What a lovely day!,"The opening is wild, kicking off with a captivating start. I think everything about this movie is perfect: the visuals, the action, the dialogue, the costumes, the acting... it was both beautiful and apocalyptic. I loved how everything felt like a rock 'n' roll fest.I love dystopian movies, but you don't have to be a fan to recognize how amazing this was. It's a story of survival in a savage wasteland, every scene felt epic. I liked the cult-like nature and how they glorified their deaths like they were Vikings. Everything was eccentric and crazy, with non-stop action for nearly the whole movie.It's really dystopian and wild, so it's surprising that this was actually a mainstream hit. ""Do not become addicted to water"" was such a wild statement, lol.The premise is very simple; I don't think I can think of a more simplistic movie that worked so well. They drive out into the desert, then make a U-turn back to where they came from. That's it. And it's a blast. This is my favorite action movie, jam-packed with crazy sequences.The movie is really just one huge dystopian action sequence, so I guess the drawback could be that it's all action. If you're looking for something more, you won't find much. Apparently, Mad Max lore has some complex and darker elements, and maybe the upcoming Furiosa will delve deeper into that.Furiosa was probably the main character; it felt like Mad Max himself was just tagging along. The villain, Immortan Joe, was great. All the characters are memorable. And because the premise is so simple and the movie is so action-packed, it feels shorter than it actually is. It's just great fun and keeps me glued to the screen. Looking forward to Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Beyond Thunderdome on acid, with a huge budget","I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie popping up. People complaining that there is a lack of story and character development, and too much action.... too much action? Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80's action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.I've also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism. Strong female characters that kick butt, is not feminism people! There's no anti-men message here. Just a cast which is dominated by more women than men. And about time for a change! Charlize Theron is my new favorite actress after this (it used to be Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton). She really takes the spotlight, and that is about the only criticism I can think of with this movie. It's not so much about Mad Max, but about road warriors in general, and specifically Theron's character. I didn't think Tom Hardy was quite as good as Mad Max as Mel Gibson was, but he wasn't terrible. He just didn't lend enough presence to his character in this movie. Which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on Max.Special mention should also be given to all the side characters. The villains are enjoyably menacing, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, John Howard as the People Eater, Richard Carter as the Bullet Farmer, and I also loved Melissa Jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladies.Go see this movie if you like Mad Max!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well made and mindlessly entertaining....,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is not the sort of film I enjoy and I after watching it, I am not a huge fan though I deeply respect the filmmakers. The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it's plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don't mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn't like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pure action spectacle,"MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that I've watched since THE RAID 2 and JOHN WICK. It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it's a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.I know that some will hate it; the story here is action and action alone and there's little else to get in the way. It's one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours. Exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work. With bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through, but instead we get tons of suspense, great fight scenes, and incredible spectacle. This is the kind of film you watch to see stuff that's never been done before.Tom Hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part. As many have commented, Max is often a supporting player in his own film, but Charlize Theron as the real lead is excellent too, so that's not important. Even Nicholas Hoult in support is fantastic. I loved the way that the bad guy is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the villain in the first MAD MAX all those years ago. Overall, though, this is a film not about the people, but the Namibian desert landscapes, the modded vehicles, the speed, the violence, the overall thrill of the chase. And it's pretty much my idea of a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Action Masterpiece. Ridiculous In All The Right Ways. (9.5/10),"George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is ridiculous in all the right ways.For those who have seen the original films and loved them, you'll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young '""wives"" escape from the film's antagonist.Leading up to the film's release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron's character. Is the story something we haven't seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it's nice to see a solid narrative.Now, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character's make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It's motivated. And it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.'Mad Max: Fury Road' has set a new standard for action films. It's arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It's that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80's action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It's the best time I've had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn't help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max Fury Road: A statement to embarrass and destroy all other movies in the action genre,"Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.Max is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy's talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on.Using this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I'm happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I'm calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it's chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it's one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.There's a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the making.FINAL VERDICT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core, and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What A Lovely Day!,"The rationale behind the success of 'Fury Road' predominantly lies with director George Miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he's been developing since its first outing in 1979 is evident throughout, and it's pretty obvious that he knows how to craft a damn fine action sequence. Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there's not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, 'Fury Road' is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!,"When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it.At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time.I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it.NOTE: ""Don't waste your time if you have seen the original."" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015!Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An absolutely insane action film that will blow you away,"Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful.The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film.I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A blockbuster that dark, gritty, brutal and bloody? Right here.","I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe  indeed.... but I'll go for it...  Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A masterpiece on a massive scale.,"George Miller returns with a bang and takes the helm of this crazy 2hr bonkers extravaganza named Mad Max: Fury Road. First of all, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. The story opens, with Immortan Joe who has young ladies as his wives, but he'll goes down when they escape the sadist's hands. Max, who has a violent past with Joe's cronies, decides to help Imperior Furiosa take the girls somewhere safe. Furiosa can't trust Max, and neither can he. So it all comes down to Joe's cronies fighting against them reaching to their destination. The movie is a bananas car chase for the runtime, as Max and Furiosa work together to fight against the evils. And then, there is Nux, a bonkers ""really skin coloured"" guy, who works with Joe, played well by Nicholas Hoult. The 3D really pays off, and is worth the extra ticket. The movie puts all other action movies of shame, the effects really pop out. Well, this is a definite masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best action movies ever made and the role of Theron's life. Miller is truly a mastermind as stated clearly in the trailer. This exceeded my expectations, and will exceed yours as well. The dark style, dark comedy and the over the top characters make a return in this reboot.

2-hour action scene,"The concept of the Mad Max films is incredible. A universe that's been left in ruins from war and only a few people left with different psychological damages is a good concept.

Alongside, a few beautifully filmed scenes Mad Max turn out to have a few beautiful scenes. But this is about all Mad Max: Fury Road has going for itself.The film is quite boring. It's based on the plot of driving a straight line for half the movie. Then realising they cant continue to then turn around, and drive back for the rest of the film. Meanwhile basically being on constant fight scenes along the way. Even so, most fight scenes are quite poorly filmed. The director used odd angles.

What made the original Mad Max great was that despite the violence and shocking moments, there was heart! You could see the motivation and the specific moments were evident that were going to change the man forever. We could understand why he chose to channel his rage and we also saw glimpses of the man that used to be. Despite the shocking violence we still routed for him and we understood his personal pain, the evolution to MADMAX unfolded and we could relate to how a good man could go down this path.

A Vehicular Magnum Opus That's Short on Plot But Heavy on Everything Else,"Rewatching this before Furiosa felt like a cornucopia of action, eye candy and quite simply, madness. It's a film that has a simple plot and premise but is heavy on pretty much everything else from dedicated actors sinking into the madly written lines and plot, gorgeous cinematography, an excellent audio score and the excellent use of practical effects. Seriously it uses such a blend of practical effects within special effects that compliment each other so well you start to believe they're actually in these crazy chase sequences including a ridiculous one through a live sand storm that was wicked to watch unfold. My only complaints would be it could have used a little more complex plot and Max himself could have been in the movie more as a protagonist instead of feeling like a supporting character in a movie with his name in the title. Other than that it's a wild ride from start to finish with almost near non stop action to keep you invested until the climactic, while partially abrupt, finish.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Charlize Theron is great, Tom Hardy is not bad, but the stunts are really where the film shines. It's hard to think of a better action road movie. It has all the intensity and perversity of the MAD MAX and THE ROAD WARRIOR, but amped up to new heights of craziness.

One of the greatest action films,"George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances.

"""My name is Max, My world is fire and blood.""","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the 4th installment in mastermind, George Miller's insane post apocalyptic journey. Starring Charlize Theron (Monster, Hancock) Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises) Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy) and (Hugh Kaeys-Byrn) as the movies villain Immortan Joe.Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is assigned to a mission. The mission is to drive the war rig and go through to the next town and siphon gasoline. Furiosa ends up double crossing Immortan Joe and stealing his 5 wives to take them back to her homeland where they can be safe. Along side her is Max, a man of action and very few words. Together they must fight trough hordes of enemies in what is basically a 2 hour long, high speed chase.I have been waiting since I heard about the green lighting of this movie back in 2009. I have been waiting for almost 6 years for this thing. My hype was high, I wasn't sure it would live up to my expectations. Well I am here to tell you that it did. It lived up to the hype, AND THEN SOME. This movie is absolutely, 1000% insane. What you saw in the trailers wasn't even close to the level of crazy that goes down in this movie. You know this movie is pretty much just all out, balls to the wall action, so if you think the trailers maybe showed off a little too much. You couldn't be more wrong.The stunt work is choreographed and directed to perfection, it is the most well crafted and stunning movie I've ever seen and will probably ever see, which is kind of the norm and what to expect with a George Miller movie. There's explosions going off everywhere, cars blowing up left, right and center, people being killed and blown to shreds. But none of it is convoluted, it all streams together perfectly, you know what is happening, when it happens. The fact that pretty much 90% of this movie is all practical effects and all stunt work is mind blowing. The cars that explode, that's happening. People bouncing from one side to the other on long poles at 60mph, picking people up and flying then back across, that's going down, too. Too many blockbusters these days are filled with CGI. And even with limitless amounts of stuff you can do with all of that. NONE of it even is even comparable to the action in this movie. The crap that goes down here, other movies couldn't even dream to aspire towards such a spectacle.People complain that there's not much of a story, they wanted more. Well I gotta tell you, the story is just what it needs. For something to be great it doesn't need to be a vibrant cohesive piece of art. The story is very simple, and the simplicity of it is what makes it great. There's enough story to keep you paying attention to it and not just going in for explosions. Not to mention that It's not driven through its narrative or its dialog. It's driven by its characters and its action. To which people also said they were underdeveloped and weren't written very well, from my stand point they absolutely were.The character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult) was developed amazingly well, I didn't really expect to see much from him but he really became his own in this movie. He was developed enough to make you care, he was written to be understandable in his actions and he was by far, for me, one of the best things about the movie. Furiosa was also developed just enough to make you feel something for her character. She's one of the only good left in a world full of bad. What Miller does in this movie is make characters that not only do you are for but are also incredibly likable and super bad ass. Max wasn't developed as much as some of the others but let's face it. If you've watched the older ones (which I recommend you do) There really isn't much to him. He's a man that's had everything taken from him and he has nothing left to lose. All he wants is to be left in peace. That's all he's every been and that's all he wants to carry on being.What I also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman. Hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them. That they can't live without men. That is DEFINITELY not the case with this movie. Furiosa is fierce, she's skilled, she's unpredictable and she's all out bad ass. This is a testosterone filled movie but it's not the testosterone that takes charge.Action movies these days aren't normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger. If he's never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats. Pondering what if the inevitable happened. Max was in peril SO MANY TIMES in this film. There was at least 10 times where I thought ""this is the end, he's going to die"" then he miraculously gets out of it. But it's not the cliché type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him. Believe me there aren't many, if any clichés in this movie. He fights his way out of these death defying situations. Furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie. Many times where we wouldn't know if she would make it.If you don't see Mad Max: Fury Road in the theaters then you are missing out. I went in IMAX and I can tell you it was worth every goddamn penny. Papa want a sequel",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What in the world,"This was crazy! A masterpiece in action filmmaking. It was a feast for the eyes, and non stop in adrenaline. I love car chase movies, and I can't believe how long it took me to watch this one. I loved the plot and how strong women actually led the movie. I felt like I watched 5 movies in one sitting. The character development was phenomenal for a movie in this genre. It's gritty and wild. I think the electric guitar player is a symbol of the unhinged craziness of the entire movie. I enjoyed the juxtaposition of the wives; soft and feminine, against the sand in your teeth desert chase. War-clad or royal, the women in this movie are all furious and metal.

It has next to no story, no plot, no character...apparently there was no script, just storyboards...which makes sense, it's like watching one non stop story boarded action sequence...it's relentless in that regard. Are the action sequences masterfully done? Sure, they're incredible...but there's so much more that goes into making a good film. It's as if critics and audiences were just looking at one aspect of the film and then dishing out a 9/10 which to me is crazy. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron also could have been anyone, anyone could have played those roles, all the characters are basically mute.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Oh dear,Utter garbage. No plot spoilers because there is no plot. Why is this film so highly regarded? Production design and stunts are great but this doesn't make it a great film. Sad,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent.,"Wow. As a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy, this film nearly delivered on all fronts. The tone is dark, but the film never takes itself too seriously, and has an insane sense of self-awareness. Some of the concepts are so insane, outlandish, and stylish you can't help but laugh and enjoy the ride.The visuals are utterly unforgettable, creating some of the most memorable images that I have ever seen in a film. In addition to the beautiful desert landscape, like I previously mentioned, the film takes it's ideas and multiplies them to the nth degree. Some of the smaller scenes, that have barely any significance to the story, I remember because of the smallest visual detail that is presented in them, even if that scene in the long run, really holds no significance and is never mentioned again.Tom Hardy is great in the role of Max, keeping the mysteriousness and the likability of the protagonist in full force. What's fantastic about Max too is that, his past is never revealed in a exposition like scenario, rather it is told cleverly through visuals, a display that director George Miller respects the intelligence of the audience and doesn't want to spell everything out for them. Charlize Theron however, absolutely stole the show. Her acting is excellent- perfectly conveying her character and the emotions that are being dealt with. Some scenes she was in actually had me in near tears, her performance was so good. The exposition of her, unlike Max, is conveyed through dialog, but it doesn't feel forced. We don't get some long monologue from her about her past, rather it feels like a casual mention. It expertly tells us about her while keeping just the right amount of exposition left out, allowing us to connect the dots with other pieces of dialog or other visual details that reveal more about her. Simply put, she might be one of the best leading female protagonists put to the screen in a while.The characters are always given time to develop, even the smallest of characters. The film has the perfect blend of action and character driven moments, allowing the audience to take a breather every now and then and just soak in the characters of this world. I forgot to mention, the action is amazing. Because the film has the perfect plot that pretty much lends itself to action, it never stops moving, and gains so much kinetic energy you wonder if it'll ever stop. And sometimes, that can be a negative. Too much action at once can leave the viewer restless, but thankfully this doesn't become much of an issue until the end. It helps that in the action scenes, you can actually see whats going on, and the film doesn't over utilize shaky cam.I was really surprised by how much substance the narrative and the characters had, dealing much with themes of redemption and attempting to rid of a dark past. This is an action movie that isn't only a popcorn movie, this is likely something that you can analyze and find hidden meanings in. Because of this, people who are more into the artistic side of film (like myself) will enjoy it as well.This is the best film released all year and the best summer movie since the likes of Inception. Actually, in many aspects it might be better than Inception. It very well be the best action film so far this decade, and that is no exaggeration.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Witness this.,"Just saw this movie for the first time, and didn't really have any expectations for it. I haven't seen the original either. The movie starts with action, continues with action, and ends with action. The action is barbaric and primitive, but also highly developed with guns and vehicles. The movie is basically one long chase with extremely modified and cool vehicles. The fight scenes are well choreographed with amazing stunts and they come up with new ideas for the fight scenes throughout the film which means that the film never gets boring, at least not for me.There is not much story in this film, just mostly action. Sometimes it's fun to watch such movies too. What also makes this film fly is the fantastic directing from George Mille, and the cinematography with this post-apocalyptic world. I was so hypnotized and extremely entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hold onto your seats for a visual and visceral masterpiece,"Overall Rating: 4.5 stars Cinematic value: 4.5 stars Big questions value: 4 stars Family value: 2 stars (This film has a mature rating due to the violence, take this into consideration before viewing)We have not seen Max Rockastansky (Tom Hardy) on movie screens in 30 years. This is a welcome return to Max and the crazy, post-apocalyptic world of George Miller (Mad Max, Babe). Max lives an existence of sheer survival. As a former police officer and family man, he is now a tortured shell of the man of justice he used to be and merely wants to survive. After being captured by the leading cult forces of this futuristic wasteland, he finds himself in the middle of a pursuit of Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the wives of the masked Immortan Joe (Hugh Keyes-Byrne). Max becomes the pivotal force to assist in Furiosa's escape and redemption. Mad Max: Fury Road becomes a race for life, redemption and hope. Shot in the barren desert of Namibia, the fight for life becomes an adrenaline charged chess match that in making the wrong move will cost you your life. No summary can do the action justice, except to say to is a new visual standard that needs to be experienced.Mad Max: Fury Road is a lesson in conveying depth with minimal dialogue. George Miller delivers a masters class in story telling and stunt driven effects that successfully convey back story, cultural nuance and the justification of these desperate acts of disobedience and violence. Even as the fourth outing for this character, we are given a fresh storyline and wealth of new characters for a new generation. It is not necessary to see the original films to enjoy this chapter in Max's adventures, but it might be worth going back to watch the first two films in this anthology. The cast is captivating and effective in their roles, but they have to take a back seat to the energetic stunt work and effects. This world seems to be a maniacal and messy existence, but becomes an enjoyable, orchestrated primal experience. Who would have thought that through the Mad Max franchise Miller would be able to convey his cinematic brilliance and deliver this visceral masterpiece. Not to dismiss the acting, Hardy is brilliant as the tortured lead character and delivering a believable portrait of his desire to survive the present while mentally enduring his past. He is given minimal dialogue, but is able to become the heart of this post-apocalyptic tale. Interestingly, Hardy is not the primary lead in the film that bears his name. Charlie Theron's shining portrayal of Furiosa is the literal and figurative driver of the film. She manages to redefine feminine heroism for film makers. She has strength, purpose and a sacrificial depth that presses the story beyond a mindless chase scene. In a genre that tends to victimise or sexualise the female leads, Miller portrays a strong female led without any unnecessary feminist underpinnings. In masking her natural beauty, Theron is allowed to develop her strengths and vulnerabilities without making a political statement. Both Hardy and Theron are supported by an excellent supporting cast that moves this experience from a mere adrenaline rush to a story of fighting for your right to live, seeing that sacrifice is part of freedom and ultimately for the hope for redemption.On many levels, Miller seems to realise that action without reason loses its purpose. In adding a spiritual component to Mad Max: Fury Road he allows for a narrative depth in the script. Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is the cult leader in this dark, twisted world. His character delivers a dark and demented message of the need for effective leadership and that leaders need to provide people with purpose for their sacrifice, even if it is misplaced. This story shows that there is basic need for something beyond our material needs that gives society drive and direction. Also, the flower on this desert wasteland is hope. Even the jaded heart of Max is turned and assists in getting those under his charge to their promised land and in giving them hope in the bleakest of moments. This is an essential cinematic vehicle when placed against the backdrop of the depravity of mankind. Miller manages to capture this element and allows for the story to consider the realities of mankind's history and future. If the film does have a weakness, it would be in the conclusion. In all that they desire to achieve and find through this film maker's journey, the finality has an empty satisfaction. After watching a film like Mad Max : Fury Road it might be worth reading through Revelation. Fortunately, with the God of the Bible there is more we can hope for in the future.Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Where is real hope found? (Deuteronomy 31:6, Romans 5:2-5) 2. Can we find true redemption? (Psalm 111:9, 1 Corinthians 1:30) 3. Can we exist without others?

What a Lovely Day!,"Cold-blooded, botanically medieval, crusades-like, and horrifically thrilling—that's Fury Road. As for Max, it looks like he's the same archetypal Bane, only this time, he's more immune to ""I'm not afraid, I'm angry."" He's silent, and angry, and frustrated. He's Rango-like, reflective of the quest to solve the water-mystery. With everything red, orange, and yellow, it seems like you're viewing 300 blended in Saw, and over-the-top F&F.George Miller revises his ideological construct in the most exhilarating, dreadful, and striking manner this time. For all I know, the audiences spoil themselves with ""cinematic orgasms,"" if that's a thing, throughout the movie. They're not afraid of the porcupine-trucks, maybe a little on the edge of madness, but that goes without saying. Here's a hint as to what it was like: Bane and Miranda beating the beep out of war-painted, anti-Christian, Hulu tribe—only this time, it's some dark, full-raged action with mountain bikes, and trucks, and springy tentacles moving idiotic half-Willy, half-Wonka The Da Vinci Code Bettany's horrendous versions. Miller puts his tribal culture in the crux of action, which reveals an unorthodox, authoritarian, and devout portrayal of enmity. The sport-arena action is complemented by prayers in Citadel, banging of drums, skeleton-wheels, and skeleton-feels. It has a bizarre feeling—you're dredged into the modernity of Prometheus and antediluvian era of the Exodus.More than anything—Max's deafening seriousness, Furiosa's bald-grace, armless-attraction, sense of responsibility, and and absolute congeniality to the role (always imposingly remarkable,) religious affirmation, banging, puffing, booming, clatter, splash, tick-tick, boom—the ""fantasized-realism"" behind all the get-off-my-property-you-crazy-lunatic is what gives you the honesty-chills. The stunts, the effort, the don't-care-about-ourselves-just-love-the-movie-please pledge, and the extraordinarily enormous—480 hours of footage into 120 minutes of freaking-awesome warfare—blows me off of my seat in the cinema to the pale, scorching blaze of the sun, amidst the crazy-eyes of this action-genre Orange is the New Black. Even the over-editing has that medieval, darkly comical feel to it, just like 300 for example (can't think of another movie with such aberrant effects, but such positive response.)But like any other movie, there are points where you start questioning yourself. Nothing seems to justify Max & Furiosa's relationship, mutual combats, strategies, certainty of plans, and stuff like that. But by then, the movie's not about logic or sense anymore; it's more about seeing what you wouldn't in ages. With such a brilliant ensemble—I mean it was pretty good for a solely madness-based movie—you couldn't care less about the abacus-loving dumb-toads sitting in exactly the middle seats of the theater to get the most balanced view of the screen, and judge the minus-plus of the 120 minute long clip. I feel like reporting their stupidity to the CIA—enough with the pen and paper!Mad Max comes equitably with the characters, their roles, and the titular projections. Each name is qualified by its corresponding characteristic with the character in the movie—Spikers, Rictus Erectus et cetera. This complements the heartfelt glow to the movie itself—everything's done for the movie. They didn't feel any need to impose worldly sense into it, which is the best part, because that miniature world seemed pretty damn believable to me—but why? Maybe it were those religious beats, maybe the dragon-roars of engines, maybe it was just the psychological effect. Whatever it was, it did what it planned to.Mad Max: Fury Road puts forth the idea that there's so much more to combats than mere combats—MMFR incorporates belligerent, spoiling-for-a-fight attitude, oppressed landscape, estranged and barbaric drug-lords, heavy-weight weaponry and wheelers, and poster-paint bombings. The intensified red-blaze of fire, the sandstorm-effect, the preposterous turn of events, the nonsensical touch of things, and the wacky script—everything wrong with the movie is everything good about the movie. Mad Max: Fury Road revises the post-apocalyptic scene—utter dryness of region and minds—and uses the irritating sense of that dryness into a rigorous will to get past it with victory—Fury Road's victory. It's not about the comparative analysis of protagonists and the white-witty-wackos, it's about what's happening throughout. And when it happens, you're only remark is: ""What a lovely day.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I won't lie, it is a bit unusual and somewhat disturbing but we expect that from movies today, especially movies like this.

The stunt work is phenomenal and the cinematography is breathtakingly stunning. Its so relieving to see an action movie that doesn't rely on CGI to tell the story, because this movie barely has ANY and it was hard to notice any at all besides this one scene. Tom Hardy is on the fast track to becoming the big budget acting star Hollywood has longed looked for because HE CAN ACTUALLY ACT! Speaking of which Charlize Theron delivers an amazing performance that should get her several award nods. Do yourself a favor and go see this on the big screen!

"Visual Playground, Amazing cast!","Do not go into this movie with the thought that this is going to be a direct follow on from the last Mad Max movie. It's not. It's nothing like it, but it's been 30 years since the last Mad Max was released - so what do you expect? In saying that - I thought this movie was fantastic!The new and improved Mad Max uses everything that modern day technology allows. It is a visual masterpiece! To the people saying it lacked storyline and was just constant action... Have you seen a Mad Max film before? They're all a bit like that. Even though I said that the new Mad Max is nothing like the old, it helps to have a bit of a knowledge on the old Mad Max storyline, because truthfully; the storyline doesn't give you much of an introduction, it just expects you to know why & what's going on in the world from the storyline of the last ones.The action, the stunts, the cars, the rigs, the weapons, the sets - they're all amazing. If nothing else - see this movie for the pure visual playground. I personally hated the first Mad Max movies. Mostly because (through no fault of their own) the time it was filmed (watching 80s movies now is cringeworthy), the lack of funding for good props and effects, and (probably because it was the start of his career) Mel Gibson's terrible acting ability. So I really didn't expect to like this movie all too much, but because of the advertisements I thought I'd give it a go because it looked visually interesting and it had a 100000% better cast. Tom Hardy is a great Max! The war boys are fantastic too. Furiousa is amazing and the wives are all quite wonderful actresses. So that alone improved this movie.For those concerned that this is a ""feminist"" movie like some other reviews have stated.. That is such bullsh*t. There are strong male and female characters. And in a world ruled by men where women are nothing but baby makers - of course they've got to stand up for themselves. Someone's got to. Just because it wasn't a man swooping in to save them from the castle doesn't mean it's a ""feminist"" movie. And in saying that - Max and the war boy help save the women too. So I really can't understand where all this ""feminist"" finger pointing is coming from.Overall - go see it! If you haven't seen the old Mad Max's - just do a little bit of a read up as to the storyline of the apocalyptic setting and war for fuel. It will help you grasp the storyline. If you have seen the old Mad Max's - don't expect this to be like the old ones. They had a ton more funding and tried to make this as epic as possible (and succeeded) - something I'm sure they would have loved to do with the first Mad Max's but didn't have access to the funds or technology. This movie is a fun, visual masterpiece, leaves you on the edge of your seat once or twice and overall is a great film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Masterpiece of Madness,"Let me start by saying this. This movie is MAD. The title was not lying. This film was exactly what one wants from a summer blockbuster.George Miller has come out publicly and said that this is neither really a reboot or a sequel. This is simply another story following Max Rockatansky. In this story, we see Max being captured By Immortan Joe and his band of War Boys. Once he escapes he comes upon Imperator Furiosa who is attempting to rescue the ""wives"" from the oppression of Immortan Joe. Cue action. I love how sometimes simple plots like this can set up an entire world of action. In the action genre, we don't need very convoluted and intricate plots that keep taking unexpected twists and turns. In Mad Max: Fury Road's case, the simpler, the better.Now on to what everyone is wondering about. The action. And yes, the stunts and music when it's all going down is some of the best action ever put to screen. By the time the climactic chase rolls around, the action is even more jaw-dropping and breath taking than before because the stakes continue to be raised. This movie is a two hour chase that never has a dull moment.As for the characters, they were all spectacular. Especially Furiosa, played beautifully by Charlize Theron. Though she is a bad-ass, she never upstages Hardy as Max. Being the emotional core of the film, playing Furiosa was one of the harder tasks to correctly perform and Theron knocked it out of the park. For Tom Hardy as Max, he was just as great as Theron. Having minimal dialog and mainly using grunts to show emotion, Hardy gave Max a surprising amount of depth, though still not nearly as much as Furiosa. This is not a bad thing however, since Max was never a truly deep character, he was an action star who kicked a lot of ass. And of course he does that in this film. The rest of the characters were played great as well especially Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult) who brought even more emotional depth this.Overall, this is a gleefully insane film. The relentless pace never holds back on the audience and it always has them glued to the edges of their seats. If you can, I highly recommend everyone does themselves a favor and witness this master-class action phenomenon that will arguably go down as one of the finest action films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Breathtaking movie with memorable action,"Who hasn't watched any of the Mad Max movies, he can be ashamed of himself, because those are one of the most lovable action pieces of all time. I've been waiting for this movie for a long time, and what motivated me even more for this movie is the lack of good quality action movies in these modern times.Movie starts in medias res. There we have Max, who is in the middle of a conflict between a gang and Furiosa, and there we have our plot for 2.5 thirds of this masterpiece. George Miller describes this post-apocalyptic world just as I have imagined it, everything is dry, there is lack of water, and carelessness of people for its nature got people to a conflict between themselves.Tom Hardy gives an alpha-male, bad-ass looking performance that reminded me of one in Lawless, where he didn't need a lot of words to speak but he was charismatic. Props to Hardy, but Furiousa steals the show for me. On many moments it seemed to me, but it actually is, that she was the main character of the movie. She is that character that we can relate to. She is that character that we feel for, and that is where Charlize Theron did a great job in.Picture of this whole movie is amazing. It is all executed very well, and to think that there is very little amount of green screen gives an enormous plus to the movie. Action doesn't stop, it is all paced, and just when you think that action stopped, it is just so audience can take a moment of rest just so it can take a adrenaline rush few seconds later.I have absolutely nothing else to add, I have enjoyed this film very much, and I hope that many directors will look up on George Millers style of shooting a movie, which is not just a fun way to take, but also very interesting and attractive. This movie excels in every way possible, it has interesting plot, lovable characters, and memorable action. It is a must-see modern masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Insanely cool visuals, but nothing more, just madly overrated.","I'm not the biggest fan of the Mad Max trilogy, but i love the films, and despite being the least liked, thunderdome is my favourite. Despite of its flaws, to me its the most complex and the one that comes out more as a film and has all the things that makes a film, more importantly the story.So when the trailers for Fury Road came out, i was super hyped, and it was definitely one of my most hyped films to see in 2015, i couldn't stop thinking what Miller would do with 150 million and the trailers made it look like an epic non stop action film with classic visuals, just pure insane action like no other film. Then critics and audiences acclaimed it to the point of being an instant classic and is now an Oscar contender!, then the Score came out and i loved it so much i couldn't stop listening and it made my expectations even higher, so i went to IMAX with my expectations at an all time high and saw it....And i was so disappointed! I couldn't stop thinking what was i missing since everyone loves it. Sure the visuals are insanely good, the stunts are breathtaking, the score is a killer, the performances are great, it has originality to spare, the production design is an Oscar winner, its so inventive, i mean the cars are insane and the costumes are brilliant, but all the rest pales in comparison.I never went expecting a complex story or even much dialogue, but i was surprised that there was no story, and no dialogue, to the point i was a little bit bored one time or two. I couldn't stop thinking how this could be an Oscar contender with no story or dialogue, and how was the film moving along. But this wasn't my biggest disappointment at all, it was the action, because i really went for the action. And it was just OK, sure it was very realistic and all, but the production videos were a lot more realistic and exciting, the film had a mad look that was cool but takes a lot of the realism and excitement and feels weird.I didn't like the choreography, it was just so simple and had a weird rhythm, there were parts where nothing happened, i couldn't find a single piece of action that i truly liked or was excited. Just things happening. And most of the problem was the edition, that mad look. Also Mad Max felt like a secondary character, just going along, that wouldn't be a problem if furiosa was a great character, but she wasn't, i couldn't relate to any character, because they had no story, no dialogue, they were just insane people with great looks, doing insane things.Overall, i can't feel nothing but disappointment, and sure the technical parts are almost perfect, the cinematography, the sound, the production design, the visuals are insanely good, but all the rest pales in comparison, no story, nothing i could relate to, not even the action that is so blunt and simplistic, even with its real stunts and all. This is the weakest of all Mad Max films. This film is hugely overrated, and its another one i cant share the same opinion the world has, but since everyone loves it so much, i must be the problem, I'm not saying the film isn't good, i just cant agree with everyone, i just cant see what makes it so great. This was one of the most strangest experiences at the movies i ever had.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Kinetic Awesomeness,"Mad Max Fury Road is a stunningly beautiful and highly charged kinetic thrill ride. It is brilliantly filmed with amazing, and well suited bombastic soundtrack. The star of the film is its direction by George Miller, showing generation MTV how to direct moving action without getting lost in its mayhem. Almost every shot is moving, similar to a James Cameron action sequence. As mentioned before the film has not got much of a plot other then a giant chase. The first half of the film is great and the second half starts to loose steam due to what has come before it. Chalize Theron is great and adds presence to the film, it is one of her best performances. Tom Hardy gives a solid performance but I found his performance somewhat lacking, he does not have much to work with and is limited to a handful of dialogue, I preferred Mel Gibson's Max. The film suffers when it eventually slows down in pace, but when it is going full throttle there are not many films that can complete with it. Is it an action classic? as a chase film , yes I would say it is, along with set design and stunt work involved But the lack of any real story and small plot holes stop me giving this film a 10, not much is explained in the film. The ending seems sudden and could of done with some more depth to it, especially the Max character. It is still a wonderful and refreshingly directed film to add to the Mad Max Cannon of films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the best action movies out there,"George Miller's masterpiece Mad Max:Fury Road will definitely create tension and will leave on on the theater sweating and with no words as how epic this film was. Is shaping up to be as much a unique experience for longtime Max fans as it will be for those who've never before visited Miller's vision of a sun-scorched hellish post- apocalyptic world, populated largely by violent maniacs. So don't worry if you haven't seen the older movies, there is absolutely no need to. 120 minutes of vehicular carnage and craziness, this movie has all aspects it needed to be.""Fury Road"" is a beautifully realized vision of the post-apocalyptic future, filmed in Namibia but looking like it was another world. And almost no CGI was used, it felt like it was real as of how amazing cinematography was, this is why it will leave many other movies behind. Tom hardy as Max gives a wonderful performance as replacing Mel Gibson, the main character of the older mad Max movies. Also the other heroine Charlize Theron plays Furiosa really good as well. Having to cut her hair and giving her best indicates she is really into the roll of Furiosa, feminine form outside, but masculine form inside. In addition, the movie also had a good but simple plot, but it definitely didn't need a deep plot. Having not much dialog also helps other people from different countries to enjoy it, as they may not have subtitles. The music was phenomenal, only one time watching the movie is enough to enjoy and get it into your head, even some of the action is synchronized with the music. So i greatly recommend you to go and join this crazy ride, specially in 3D as Miller uses chucking arrows, bones, and parts of cars and bodies at you. 'What a lovely day' indeed.I give this movie a 10/10, and Im looking forward to see it again",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfect in every way.,"I don't normally say that about a movie. Even my favorite films have flaws that I recognize and humbly admit to, even still that doesn't mean I love them any less. Mad Max: Fury Road is that rare example of a film that understands what it is so well that it forgoes flaws ...this is a perfect movie.Now I understand that's a bold statement, and I also know it's only my opinion, but it's something I thought long and hard about after walking out of the theater, still recovering from the 2 hour thrill ride I had just been on. There was not a single moment during Fury Road that Ia) checked my watch b) thought something was out of place c) got bored with the actionThe characters, the music, the action, the direction - it's all top level stuff. No fluffy words in this review, I am simply stunned at Millers execution of this very simple plot. I love how Miller allows the expressions of the characters to speak for themselves, I love how he doesn't dwell on supposed important character moments because he understands exactly what to show and when to get back to the action. The music may the key ingredients in the mix as Junkie XL delivers a soundtrack full of thundering drums, epic violins and shredding electric guitar, a soundtrack that had my heart racing a million miles an hour and gazing at the screen in disbelief as cars and bodies flew through a sandstorm in slow motion.The fact that CGI was kept to a minimum makes the film feel even more satisfying, like we payed to see high octane action where cars crash into one another and people perform death defying stunts ...and we get what we pay for as close to 90% of what you're seeing is real.I could gush over this film for hours but I'd like to say that if nothing else, Mad Max: Fury Road gave me the feeling of being a kid again and seeing a blockbuster for the first time. In an age of bloated, CGI-filled summer movies, it's nice to see a simple, streamlined, real film in the mix. Welcome back Max, don't keep us waiting to long for the next one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What a day! WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!!!!,"Prior to this review, I had never seen any of the Mad Max Movies, but with Furiosa coming out next week, I decided to finally watch all of the Mad Max Movies. I enjoyed the three Mad Max Movies with The Road Warrior being my favorite and Beyond Thunderdome being my least favorite, while still having some fun of it. Now that road has led me to Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) and I'm just gonna say it, Fury Road is not only the best Mad Max Movie, but it is one of the greatest movies ever made. This movie is a prime example on how to an established and beloved franchise from the 70s, 80s and 90s into the 21st Century perfectly.First of all, the action and stunt work is the best that it's ever been and that's saying a lot given the fact that all four of these movies were written and directed by George Miller. This is a 2-hour movie where for the entire runtime it's just non-stop kick-ass action chase sequence and Miller pulls it off perfectly. The performances are all top-notch, there is not one person who isn't delivering off the top of their talent, but the standouts are of course Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron as Max Rockatansky and Imperator Furiosa respectively. Now as much as I did enjoy Mel Gibson as Max, Tom Hardy just takes this character to a whole new level to the point where I prefer Hardy ocer Gibson. The thing that makes Hardy's version of Max stand out is the fact that for almost the entire first hour of the movie, he has no dialogue and yet Hardy is able to bring out a lot of emotion throughout that first hour with his actions and eyes. Now, let's talk about Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, this character is given so much emotion throughout her mission and journey back to her home to the point where I understand why they're doing a prequel to explore this character's backstory with Anya Taylor-Joy this year. Also, Furiosa is the prime example on how to do a strong female character properly.Overall, if you haven't seen Fury Road or any of the other Mad Max Movies in general, then what are you doing with your life, you need to watch these movies as soon as possible. Fury Road is not only an absolute instant classic of the action genre, but it is God-Tier Cinema at its finest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nothing More Than A Noisy Blockbuster,"I love post apocalyptic fiction . John Wyndham and John Christopher are amongst my favourite authors . They weave compelling stories of average everymen surround by a hostile landscape where it's every man for himself and only the cruelest and most heartless survive . George Miller's MAD MAX films are an extention of this . Low brow cinematic spectacle but fair as entertainment goes . And let's not forget hugely influential as well . Sadly the films' influence found itself being transplanted in nearly every post apocalypse story for the next 20 years where a brooding loner , a man of few words , drives through a desert landscape doing his best to survive in a hostile world against scavengers . Influntial but rather unimaginative and the movies probably did the sub-genre more harm than good . This reboot did capture my imagination via the trailers and so decided to give the film a chance , not least because as soon as it was released it shot to number 25 on the IMDb Top 250If nothing else the film gets off with a bang with the eponymous Max filling us in via voice over that the world has destroyed itself and man has to fight to stay alive against his fellow man and just to prove this is more difficult than it sounds we're treated to a high octane chase sequence replete with fast camera action and editing . Have I mentioned the opening title credits haven't appeared yet ? This sets up the rest of the film that continues in mainly the same wayIn short if you liked MAD MAX 2 you're going to love this one because this is MAD MAX 2 on a fatal cocaine overdose which is a great thing or a disappointing thing depending on how you look on it . Sadly I'm in the second camp because I wanted more meat on the story and there's not much narrative here . Max gets used as a gimp on the front of a vehicle , manages to escape during an epic stunt sequence , teams up with some fair nymphet maidens and protects them from the baddies and that's it as far as plot goes . The first half of the film is basically one elongated noisy chase sequence full of stunts , car crashes , pyrotechnics . I's brash , noisy and spectacular , so much so that I actually felt myself getting rather bored by all this noise and bluster . Eventually the film does settle down a bit and has characters talking in normal tones without the explosions in the background but the dialogue is just basic as are the performances , Certainly MAD MAX FURY ROAD will be up for a few Oscar noms next year but only for the technical aspects and I'm slightly surprised my IMDb peers rate it so highly",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Awesome acting, amazing action, a Mad Max film for the history books","WOW. My initial reaction. Absolutely incredible. This was a blast from the past and a brand new experience all at the same time, and I LOVED every second of it! From beginning to end this is a visceral and vicious film that any action film fan will enjoy. In a post-apocalyptic world where oil is the desire of Immortan Joe (evil comes to life from Hugh Keays-Byrne), but water holds the real power, Max (embodied perfectly by Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (exquisitely played by Charlize Theron) must team up to escape. Nux (a surprising performance by Nicholas Hoult) is a great addition to the team.If you enjoy action movies, this is right up your alley. This is the best action movie of the year, if not the decade. It could even be the best action movie of all time. It was fun, nuanced, and amazing. You think in seeing an action film, the character development won't be there, but George Miller brings you into the world perfectly and allows characters to say only the things, which are absolutely needed to tell the story. In an interview Tom Hardy was quoted saying that ""you can fit all my dialogue on one page."" Initially I scoffed at this statement, but after seeing the film I can't argue with it. It's a rare moment when it's funny because it's true. He has so few lines that his time on screen heavily depends on his actual acting ability and he doesn't disappoint.Not only is the acting on all accounts fantastic (Charlize Theron brings it home, once again), but the way this was filmed blows my mind. Every stunt was done in real time and was not CGI. This might not sound that impressive, but once you see the film, you will go insane trying to think of all the planning, money, and skill that went into every single shot, stunt, or intense moment of the film.Throughout the movie I was cheering, laughing, and clapping, probably to the dismay of others in the theater, but I was so invested and involved in the story that I didn't care. Many others were doing the same. It was that much fun. But more often than that, I found myself staring in awe of some of the incredible, beautifully composed shots during this action-packed adventure. The poster above is a part of the opening shot of the film and it pulls you into the world, both literally and figuratively.One last note, I think this has been the absolute best use of 3D that I've ever seen. Mad Max: Fury Road proves that 3D can still be exciting and add to a storyline as opposed to just being a flash in the pan (*cough-cough* Avatar) Never forget the importance of water in this world, or (Mad) Max Rockatansky will find you and make you regret your incompetence.If you like action films, GO SEE MAD MAX: FURY ROAD NOW!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It Never Stops,"I have to say that I tried really hard to like this. But my old fashioned ""There needs to be a story and interesting characters"" mode took over. It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind's eye. Then there's the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days. Make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable. Anyway, it is spectacular to look at but when it was over I felt no emotion or satisfaction at all.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It not only raises the bar, it smashes it completely!","When director George Miller created Mad Max back in 1979, he couldn't have foreseen the impact the micro-budget film would've had on the action genre. Not only did it launch Mel Gibson into an A- list star, it's gritty, post-apocalyptic style set a precedent for action movies and had a major influence on many directors for the next two decades. Two sequels arrived in the years following and then nothing. The series ended. Rumours have persisted since 2000 of another sequel but it wasn't until 2011 when the same director, Miller decided it was time to raise the bar once again and got to work on Mad Max 4. The wait has been worth it.Replacing Gibson with British actor Tom Hardy, Fury Road begins with a voice over ""My name is Max, the world is fire and blood. It's harder to know who was more crazy, me or everyone else."" We then launch straight into a chase scene over the desert plains of a post- apocalyptic desert where Max is captured by a group of cannibals. Elsewhere we are introduced to Furiosa (a pumped up Charlize Theron) who has been tasked by local gang leader Immotan Joe with driving an armoured rig full of now-scarce water across land in exchange for gasoline. Instead she rebels and heads for her homeland along with freeing Max and Immortan Joe's five wives, two of which are pregnant. And then all hell breaks loose!What follows is simply a breathtaking display of action cinema. From here on, Fury Road is effectively one long chase as Immortan Joe's enormous army of lunatics pursue Furiosa across the endless desert. The film slows down briefly to introduce Furiosa's relatives, but the pursuit swiftly continues.The action is simply relentless as supped up cars, motorbikes, trucks and tankers crash, flip and explode as they attempt to halt the rig with stuntmen literally flying everywhere. The stunts are simply astonishing, all the more so that Miller insisted that the majority of the action be filmed practically without the reliance on CGI – how no one was killed in the making of the movie is all the more astonishing. Director Miller, now 70, is at the top of his game and handles the action brilliantly. The locations are suitably apocalyptic (filmed on location in Namibia) and suit the movie perfectly.The plot itself is simple and, although you don't get much in the way of characterisation, it really doesn't matter. There are enough glimpses of Max's past to fill in the gaps for anyone who hasn't seen the original movies. Hardy is a fitting replacement for Gibson and does a fine job as Max, however the real standout is Theron – shaved head and as far from the gorgeous blonde we know so well, she plays the role of Furiosa amazingly.Not only does Mad Max: Fury Road raise the bar for action movies, it smashes the bar entirely. Sit back, switch your brain off and you'll have a blast!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
THIS is how you make an action movie,"I will be quite simple with that, this is a rather simple movie after all. I'm not a fan of all of the superhero genre, people ask me why- and no it's not that I don't like it because it's a comic book at all, but it's just that the films tend to be just CGI filled, and lack any interesting atmosphere. I won't even talk about characters here.So, unlike those films, Mad Max: Fury Road does it all right, instead of CGI-filled action sequences we have ACTUAL stunts, this obviously, whether if consciously or unconsciously make the action look far better, also, unlike all those other modern action movies, we actually KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, it's not just focusing on character each time and basically confusing us and not showing the entire battlefield so it may have the feel it is an actual fight- sequence, no, this film actually makes us know constantly what's on our back, sides and front.Of course I need to also address the unique post-apocalyptic atmosphere in this film, the music also fits rather perfectly. The ways those apocalyptic people fight with strange gadgets on top of their vehicles is also very entertaining to watch.So, I would definitely recommend this film, it is no Citizen Kane, I mean it isn't something deep- nor it should be, in fact I would say this is what a summer blockbuster should be- it may be not very philosophical or heart warming, but it is very entertaining and a lot of fun- and even memorable! Something we barely hear about in today's action films.So go watch it, recommended! 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another milestone in the action film history,"When talking about remarkable action movies, a few titles come to mind. Movies like Die Hard, Terminator: Judgment Day, The Matrix and The Dark Knight are great examples of it. And if you're into this kind of film, congratulations. You've just won another golden ticket to the chocolate factory.Mad Max: Fury Road opens this summer as one of the best movies I have seen in the past decade. I have recently re watched the first three movies of the franchise to dive into this world once again. After I was done with it, I came to the same realization that I did a few years back. I did not like them at all. And as a consequence, I had no hope for this one. In my mind, it was going to be as mediocre as the others. Fortunately, I couldn't be more wrong. After three decades trying, George Miller has finally got it. That post-apocalyptic world he created 36 years ago is bigger, better and crazier than ever.If you are looking for a word to describe Fury Road, insane it is. It is visually stunning and packed with exhilarating action scenes. The execution is so impressive that you get yourself smiling in the middle of a gory scene. You can feel the effort and passion put into making this movie through the silver screen. The actors job in constructing the characters is so effective that you dive into this world almost instantaneously. Props to Hardy and Hoult who conducted their characters with talent, each one in their own crazy way. But specially to Theron for creating such an extraordinary and strong female character. Furiosa is simply amazing.Hard to be pleased by this kind of movie, I was blown away. It has been a while since I walked out from a movie theater with this amount of satisfaction. Fury Road can be disgusting and beautiful at the same time. It is unique. It has reached and stepped on the same ground as some of our beloved blockbusters from the past. But not only this, it has marked itself as a milestone in the action film history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Action Packed Film,"In preparation for watch Furiosa, I went back and rewatched Mad Max: Fury Road which serves as the film that introduced the character to the big screen and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a drifter and rebel attempt to escape from a tyrant and his crazed forces.Main Character
Tom Hardy plays Max and he is exactly what this film requires. He is incredibly gruff and is a man of few words but he delivers a really physical performance here and it works for Fury Road. They give him somewhat a story arc that kind of gets forgotten about but Hardy does the best with the material he is given.But the real main character here us Furiosa played by Charlize Theron, she is easily the most interesting character here and the film really puts her at the forefront of the film and she was great to follow. Despite the off screen issues with Hardy & Theron it didn't affect their performances and Theron is great here.Supporting Characters
Nicholas Hoult plays Nux who is a worshiper of the villain of the film and he is totally unhinged in the film and Hoult gives a great performance. His character does have a good enough story arc and I just really liked the effort he put into the character.Hugh Keays-Byrne plays Immortan Joe who is the main villain of the film and I just liked this character. He is menacing and it is just the way he is presented that it made him feel like a big threat to the heroes and someone who would have this following from a cult.There are a bunch of female characters on the run from Joe and they all get some time to shine which was nice to see. Zoey Kravitz & Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are the ones who get the most to work with and they did a good job.Story
The story is fascinating, it is basically an extended chase sequence and that sounds really dull but it really works. The characters are always on edge and you feel like they are on edge and the story progresses really well with this. Though, I mean there is no denying that there is a lack of meat on the story and I kind of wish Max had been fleshed out a little bit more to make me care about him a bit more.Script
The script is okay, it is a bit unhinged like the film itself. There is some good dialogue involving Furiosa but Max has few words which is fine for the film. But this film isn't really about the script so I feel like dialogue in particular was a bit of an afterthought.Style
The style of the film is where this film truly flourishes, everything is high octane and looks insane. It is hard to explain the crazy things that happens in these epic chase sequences. Great action sequences that really benefit from the lack of CGI and focus on practical effects and boy does it rise the level of this film.Overall
Overall, Mad Max: Fury Road is a great action film. It has some of the best action scenes of all time and if that is all you are looking for then you must see this film. It slightly lacks in some other areas but it is a great watch for sure.Rating - 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How to make a triumphant return of a saga and not die trying,"As a fan of the saga I always wondered why it took so long for this movie to appear.Without Mel Gibson, who knows if he could live up to any of the previous 3.Nothing else suggested how incredible this event was going to be.More than 2 hours of justified violence in a maelstrom of action that never stops until the end.Let's not fool ourselves, the movie goes where it goes and is not ashamed to show it.Tom Hardy lives up to the character of Max, his presence intimidates and makes you believe that he is the same as always.Charlize Theron as Furiosa sublime, stealing the spotlight in much of the plot. Furthermore, with the prequel that has just been released, her character is even more favored by giving us a context that we did not have.Joe is immortalized as a great antagonist and Nicholas Hoult's character who also has great moments during the film.It is very difficult for a sequel to be as up to par as ""Fury Road"", a great example of how to make an empowered female character and make you believe it, a great example that this kind of cinema can be made in this era, a great example of that George Miller should be on par with his more famous contemporaries Spiellberg, Scorsese and company.I am grateful to have had the opportunity to see this wonder in theaters at this time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Valhalla, My War Boys!","I've seen the overstuffed toybox of my childhood pillaged for cinematic ""inspiration"" so many times now that the prospect rarely offends or entices me.

Melt my cherished memories down for pocket change, see if I care.After the heartbreaking artistic faceplant that was Ridley Scott's misbegotten Prometheus, I'd pretty much given up on these sorts of refried treats. O, me of little faith! If anyone can tool up a bloody-knuckle, road-raging death machine out of junked parts, it's George 'Mad Max' Miller. Fresh from the theater, I feel like an overstressed carburetor into which some baldhead lunatic just spat a mouthful of pure nitro. The pitiless desert sun is blazing nova bright above, and it's a lovely, lovely day indeed.I caught Fury Road in 3-D, which was cool...mostly because I now get to go back and see it without the unnecessary dimensional enhancement. And again gaze vacantly into that stupendous vortex of crazy-ass, nonstop, man-machine mayhem like the sweaty, crack-brained adolescent I once was (and of course always will be). I don't know that I've EVER in my screen-staring LIFE seen a vehicular action flick half so relentlessly thrilling. And certainly not this side of The Road Warrior. The bug-splattered, silver-glossed, ear-to-ear grin Miller & Co. smacked across my idiot mug in the film's opening moments is still fixed in place several hours later. Turns out mom was right: my face is stuck this way.One minor quibble: Fury Road would be improved significantly were some sensible soul simply to take a small red pen to each scripted instance of the words ""hope"" and ""redemption"". For a filmmaker whose visual storytelling has received such widespread praise, Miller sure lays on the thematic underlining with a hefty trowel. Some may accept Max and Furiosa's portentous small talk as appropriate to the tale's mythic ambitions. Me, I just found it kind of annoying, with the clunky sentimentalism tipping stoic gravitas into po-faced camp.But why fret over details?

One of the best action movies ever made,"Watching ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" at the theater was a truly amazing experience. Watching it again at home isn't quite as powerful, but stills being fantastic. From the very beginning to the last scene, I was completely immersed in this wild and intense world created by George Miller. I think this movie is a real masterpiece, and it's not hard to see why.The cinematography is breathtaking, the best I've seen in an action movie. Every scene is carefully shot and choreographed, resulting in a visual spectacle that's simply stunning. The deserts, cars, costumes, character looks, and color contrasts make this world unforgettable. It's one of those rare movies where every frame could be in an art gallery.The soundtrack is amazing, taking the action to a whole new level. Every beat drives the story and the intensity of the action scenes, pumping up the excitement to the max. It's a truly unforgettable auditory experience.And as for the story, I'd call it simple but spectacular. George Miller tells an exciting tale at a fast pace that never lets the audience rest. From the moment the action kicks off to the climax, there's not a dull moment. It's a rollercoaster that keeps us glued to the screen from start to finish.But it's in the action scenes where the movie really shines. They're all simply epic, the most mind-blowing I've ever seen in cinema. The fight choreography and the car chases are masterful and breathtaking. Every stunt and explosion is done in an unmatched way.In the end, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is more than just an action movie; it's an example of how to create a true cinematic masterpiece.

Mad Maxine was the worst movie of 2015...,"We were looking forward to this one and even kicked out the few extra bucks to see it in 3D... what a waste. The 3D wasn't really utilized in any way, shape or form. It was just a shameless up-sell for something that wasn't there. That was just the beginning...As far as the actual movie... I went in psyched to see it and ended up trying to stay awake through it for an hour, I finally gave up and did a 10 min. nap. Wifey woke me up (I thought she was asleep too!). So I actually did stay awake for the big ""finale"". Not because it was good, more like because at that point, I was enraged that anyone could make a movie so badly. This was the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life.Zero character development. ""Mad Max"" kept reminding me of Robin following around batman, ie the real protagonist of the film ""Mad Maxine"" (that's not the character's real name but nobody really cares anyway) was no doubt the protagonist. ""Max"" was her loyal sidekick. God it was lame.The plot was... not even present. I didn't really follow the whole blood transfusion, woman milking, bullet farming... wtf? It's not like they really invested any time explaining anything... they had too many cars to blow up and that's way more important than telling a story.I tried and tried to find something... anything likable about this movie. ""Why should I give it a ""2"" over a ""1""... where is that extra digit coming from? Well... there isn't an extra digit... because I couldn't find ONE redeeming quality about Mad Maxine...It was just a full blown rip off. A miserable failure on every level. There wasn't one scene, character, piece of dialogue, stunt or anything that sticks out in my mind as being memorable.Worst movie of the year by far.Another reheated turd to lump on the pile of other reheated turd remakes.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Witness the majestic world of golden sand and rusted steel,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a non-stop concerto of clanking iron, broken bones and splattering blood while fire squirts from all cylinders. It's absolutely glorious. As far as sci-fi world goes, director George Miller creates a remorseless realm with every bit of nastiness present. The two leading actors Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are utterly convincing, so much so audience would believe they are actual occupants of the unapologetic post-apocalyptic world.Max (Tom Hardy) is a survivor in a barren wasteland. He's about to cross path with totalitarian clan War Boys led by a dictator. As luck would have it he meets with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) as situation escalates rapidly and they must fight for their survival. Tom Hardy looks physically menacing and exhausted by the burden he carries on the desolate landscape. He is more of an anti-hero who prioritizes his safety in the expense of his morality.Charlize Theron is utterly splendid. With short hair and one arm, she still manages to look beautiful and presentably strong. She seems cold yet also rigidly determines to her cause, this is a real rendition of a powerful female character, not a model shoehorned into the wilderness. Nicholas Hoult as Nux, one of the War Boys is a chameleon. His character might have the most development as a lowly peon who gradually discovers the true nature of his clan.Production value is exceptionally well done. From vehicles, make-up and even prosthetic limbs, all of them look as though they have wear and tear from the dusty world. Strange contraptions and weapons are aplenty, explosive spears are thrown with reckless abandon as large tank mounted with electric guitar rumbles in the background. It's brazenly unworldly and over-the-top spectacle. There is no such thing as too much here.Visual is all shades of tangerine. The vistas look dry and dirty yet still can be lively or solemn as the filter regularly changes. The soundtracks blast rock, metal and techno vibe with each scene. It truly doesn't let up, riding the momentum from start to finish, though it's not just mindless explosion. Its characters are identifiable, audience would be fascinated and cheer for them between each explosions.Never a murky world ridden with death and destruction seems so irresistibly invitingly. As the characters ride through the carnage, the film is an achievement in action and destruction.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Furiosa,"The movie is frantic from start to finish. In the first 30 minutes, it cans to establish the universe by the dialogues, the absurd situations that Max finds himself in and the very well introduced characters. Then, when you accept what is being shown on the screen, the movie doesn't save on action scenes, that are chaotic, full of explosions, cars flying, bodies being thrown up and... A guy in red with a flame-spouting guitar. But this movie's triumph is that these action sequences are not tiring, quite the opposite. This is due to the development and construction of characters like Nux(Nicholas Hoult, who has one of the best emotional arcs of the movie) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who, whether you like it or not, is the protagonist of the movie, and it adds to the emotional and dramatic weight of the scenes.But the only problem in the movie is the reasonableness of some characters and their development like Imorttan Joe, who is imposing in the look but he doesn't talk and does a lot in the movie. It was to be expected more from Tom Hardy as Max, who has an important role in the story, but his development boils down to flashbacks and catchphrases.The movie color palette is strong, contrasting, with orange and red vibrant tones, but also making a transition of clear to dark tones in night scenes for example, something almost black and white. The cinematography is amazing. The sceneries are simple and minimalist, open plans, and the cinematography makes you tense, because it gives you an anticipation to persecution scenes, you can see the danger coming and it holds your attention to what decisions the characters will make and what will happen next.Overall, the movie is a really good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Are you serious?All characters were shallow and I didn't feel any deep connection towards anyone. The ending was predictable.

A true film wrapped in a Hollywood blockbuster,"I guarantee that this is a film that will stand the test of time to become a classic. Character development and plot lines are quickly developed by putting the characters in one bizarre predicament after another. The themes of environmentalism, political theory, and philosophy lurk just beneath the surface, but they are never actually discussed. It is a tribute to the skill and talent of everyone involved in this film that they can say so much while saying so little. It is affirming to know that you can still go to the movies and have your expectations not only exceeded, but absolutely blown away! The film-goer needs an open mind and a willingness to mentally go to this other world. This is a world that is a horrifying depiction of a path the world may have chosen for itself. Mad Max offers both a vision of hell, but also of the divine. The divine comes in the form of a rag tag group of strangers that accept each other, quickly care about one another, and then gain strength and confidence in following a shared vision; a hope for a better world. The depiction of the power of hope is moving and one leaves this film with a positive belief in humanity.

There is no Oscar winning acting here for sure, but every actor deliver pretty good. There was no boring moments here. Every character was unique in its own way.

A Goose Bump Riddled Spectacle of Epic Proportions,"Anyone that gives this a bad review just doesn't enjoy movies. Intense action, interesting characters, and bloody good fun. An all around great summer movie. The people that complain about there being no plot need to be more informed about the world of fire and blood that is Mad Max they're insane and need to watch the first three for a little background. I was impressed with the depth of this movie with vibrant characters and in camera visuals 80% done in camera and very little CGI. Miller adds more depth to his apocalyptic world in a way never before seen. He makes you feel the pain these people are going through. It is one of those movies that are few and far between and should be seen as the amazing goose bump riddled spectacle that it truly is. Nonstop over the top edge of your seat fun. The production is over the top and every scene is filled to the brim with eye candy. Don't listen to these people spouting crappy reviews they are the same people who wouldn't know a great movie if it sat on their face and wiggled around and they loved glitter.

"Disregard the meninists, this is absolutely must see.","A non-stop adrenaline rush featuring cars, explosions, bullets, and the most badass woman in movie history. George Miller returns after three decades to Mad Max to deliver a masterpiece of mayhem and destruction, while also creating a rare action movie that refuses to sexualize women, and instead brings them to the forefront of the action, as Charlize Theron stars as Furiosa, a rebel from an oppressive regime who kicks ass like no other, while also being a very emotionally grounded and empathetic character. Tom Hardy takes on Mel Gibson's mantle as Max fantastically, showing the will to survive despite the impossible odds. Nicholas Hoult and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley also give considerable depth to the movie, proving it not to be a mindless barrage of explosions. The visuals consist almost entirely of practical effects, with minimal animation to provide a real experience that resonates with the viewer at an instinctual level, and excites to the very core.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Overrated, Underwhelming Monstrosity","If you're looking for any substance, this movie isn't for you. The characters are hollow, there's very little story/script, and truthfully the movie was somewhat confusing (weird flashbacks with no context?). However, if all you care about is car chases, explosions, and killing, with no real context, then this is exactly what you want to see. I don't know why this is so lauded. It's two hours of mindless drivel. The bulk of the movie is the main characters trying to escape the lives they hate so much, whilst being chased by many different styles of gangs. But, right towards the end, they decide to go back to the city they fled, and when they return everything is magically better simply because they killed a couple bad guys.

"Technically speaking, best movie ever.","Before I even talk about the plot, or the actors, I Would just like to say that this films visual effects/cinematography were incredible. No, not mind boggling cgi, just flat out great camera work and practical effects. The costume and make up designers need to sweep the awards this year for their work. I walked out of the film and only hours later did I realize how good they were. Reason being, because nothing was wrong with it. The camera work and effects were so smooth I couldn't appreciate how good they were because they actually complemented the plot instead of distracting the viewer from it. That being said, oh my goodness best looking movie of all time imo. 11/10 From the looks of it, only the new Star Wars film even comes close but we will see when the actual movie roles. Okay, that was just my review on the visuals of the film, lets talk aboot that plot eh?PLOT 8/10- It is what is, an action/post apocalyptic film can only have so good of a plot story before it gets too cluttered, this film does the best with what it has, a cool setting, cool characters, and really cool cars. The third part of the movie where they find Charlize's old biker clan is the weakest part of the plot, yet at the same time, it was necessary. That's the main strength of this plot, everything was necessary, no extra back story/flashbacks were handed to us, no unnecessary expostion, we were left to interpret based off of brief dialogue and voices in Max's head as to what has lead to these characters acting the way they did. This, should be the way every action movie models its plot after, nothing too deep, yet just enough to make us understand and care. Similar to the plot of taken in that we don't need information on how the villains came to be, or how our hero came to be so heroic, we are left to think, a wonderful tool in these types of films.ACTING 9/10- Acting wise I was surprised. With the exception of the ""breeders"", everyone was fit really well in their parts. Never have been a huge Hardy fan, but surprisingly roles where he talks less makes his performances better. Although he only has around 20 lines in the movie, the ones he mumbles out either made me laugh or made me realize he was disturbed. Charlize played a strong female lead who was kickass and is not over the top at the same time. With the exception of the part where she reunites with her old clan, all of her lines were necessary. The villains were awesome for the most part, my only complaint would be that we only really got to spend time with two of them, the third one, the fat one, was more of a side piece. None the less, great acting across the board.PACING 9/10- Start your engines, make sure you have enough gas to last for two hours because this one does not let up. From the opening scene of the movie till the canyon scene towards the end you will be thrown into an atmospheric fast paced film that is both exhilarating, and memorable. Although not every great action film is paced like this, it just works in this one, with every thing being so over the top, from the insane guitar creep, to the unbreakable bones of our hero, I don't know, it just freaking works.Visuals- 10/10GO SEE IT.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Wild Monstrosity of a Film!,"Few action films have ever displayed such vigorous, elegant, symphonic understanding of cinema. Mad Max: Fury Road is a true celebration of cinema, it is a work of art that is unimaginable in any other medium.If the Academy knows anything about filmmaking, they should all be writing down George Miller in their bracket for best director, for the man has showed us what it would be like if Vivaldi was alive today, making Action films rather than composing music. The reason I mention Vivaldi is because George Miller's understanding of Action Cinema reminded me several times of Vivaldi's of music; Four Seasons comes to mind especially. While surely the crew around him have done their job expertly, the film really seems like a work of a man with a vision. Every edit, every movement (of either camera, character or vehicle) appear a part of a greater symphony. Several times does the film seemingly build towards climaxes before the conductor lowers his baton, letting the audience breathe before building all up again. The pauses for breathing are few, yet all feel perfectly placed and are just far enough apart that the film is allowed to keep a pace making it seem like the Usian Bolt of film.The action is absolutely the highlight of this movie, extraordinary, visually spectacular and quite honestly unlike anything we have seen; ever. Yet it seems Miller has also managed to hit the jackpot in his writing (though reportedly there was no proper script while shooting). The movie never tries to hide what it is; the story is simple, sometimes distant, yet it is handled in a such a way that it creates a quite strong emotional connection with the protagonists. The character of Max is interesting enough in himself, and played with an impressively subtle vulnerability by Tom Hardy, yet it with Furiosa, played by Theron (expertly so), that the story truly lies. Her quest strangely enough manages to feel relevant to society today, with the (sadly) still-relevant fight for gender-equality.The film has by some been described as feminist and rightly so. In having both male and female character fight together against the patriarchal system, it underlines the need for both genders to take part in this struggle that our society still faces. With a noble cause being portrayed in such a sympathetic way, it is made easy to root for the heroes, thus making the already spectacular action even better, by having stakes that feel as if they matter.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One hell of a road trip,"There are very few movies which deliver exactly what they promise and Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those few. This is dark, tiring, brutal and a very serious movie. But it is visually brilliant and there is no complication when it comes to the storyline. The movie is nothing like the Mel Gibson starred Mad Max but a unique, Theron- Hardy show.As many of the futuristic movies, this is also set on an apolcalyptic world where there is scarcity of basic elements. It is ruled by 'Immortal Joe' who is considered to be immortal by those below him. But only few like Furiosa (Theron) who knew the truth takes on him by trying to take his many wives away from him into a better place. Mad Max a prisoner of Immortal Joe who is on neither side happens to be in the midst of this chaos, ends up teaming up with Furiosa to reveal the truth to the people.The film is packed with ruthless action, some epic BGM by Junkie XL who got us that pump up feeling in 300: rise of an empire as well. It is a bit tiring to watch the first 20-25 minutes, but once you start getting the hang of the story, it gets us involved very soon. Tom Hardy hardly speaks in the movie and Charlize Theron has a very important role. Nicholas Hoult is brilliant. A very unique role for him. Other hot girls like Rosie Huntington Whitley are for the pleasant sight at times. If you are a fan of action genre, this is a movie you must not miss.

The future belongs to the Mad.. What a lovely day!,"Mad Max: Fury Road, the newest from George Miller was a film i never had much interest in. I haven't really seen the others in the franchise (i say haven't really because i have seen about half of the original) but to be honest it isn't really nesscessary. Im not sure if this is a prequel or sequel but whatever it is doesn't really matter as this is quite possibly the action film of the year and has some of the best action sequences of the decade in fact.If i were to explain plot here it would seem very thin because in terms of plot there isn't a huge deal of it, although this isn't really a bad thing. It follows Max as played by Tom Hardy who does do a great job following the footsteps of Mel Gibson, as well as rebel Furiosa played by Charlize Theron at the top of her game. The two go on a journey to i guess restore order to the post-apocalyptic world we are introduced to from the start of the film. Everybody in this film does a really good job, Tom Hardy's Australian accent wasn't the best i have heard but he doesn't say a great deal, most of the dialogue does come from Theron's Furiosa and she really adds a moral contrast to his performance and they play well of each other, in fact this as much her film as it is Hardy's which i was worried about being called ""Mad Max"" and all, but it doesn't bring the film down by a single notch.Now earlier on i mentioned that the film's plot isn't a very strong one. The reason this isn't a problem? Because the film is pretty much one huge action set piece. From the beginning to the very end the action does not stop. It is very much a road movie, but not a stereotypical road trip movie, it is a road movie where cars explode at every given moment and blood is splattered around with no remorse. I found out 80% of the films effects are practical and this does not surprise me at all because i had an extremely hard job pinpointing what is CGI and what isn't (with the exception of the prosthetic arm used by Theron's character). The real stand out for me was Nicolas Hult as Nux who is a character that you never know whether he is a villain or not. At first he seems insane, like our villain Immortal Joe (not the Toecutter), but you do get to know him and you do in fact feel for his character and even have sympathy for him and want him to succeed at points.By the end of the film, all the non stop action sequences that are thrown at us might seem too much, but they really aren't. Tom Hardy is as badass if not more than Mel Gibson (like i said though, i haven't seem all the Mad Max films) and Charlize Theron with the rest of the supporting cast do this film justice. You hear a lot about long overdue sequels spoiling what was once a great franchise but Fury Road just improves it. I hope that Jurrassic World and even Terminator Genysis can take a leaf out of this film's book. Mad Max:Fury Road deserves all the praise it is getting and is definitely one to get on blu-ray. See this film and you will have a Lovely Day as Nux would say. Plus, the flamethrower guitar dude was awesome, look out for him.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A masterpiece!!? What am I missing?,"Firstly this is not a sequel to the original Mad Max trilogy, it's a standalone movie, set in the Mad Max universe, however I say that loosely as the Mad Max universe in the original trilogy was believable and had credibility whereas this film lacks either.Had this been give a different name so it was not associate with Mad Max, I would have enjoyed it a little bit more, but I felt, like many other reviewers, it was an insult to the original trilogy and there were aspects of it that made me feel quite angry about this. But leaving the original trilogy behind for a moment and regarding this film as a film in its own right, I thought it was OK, a no brainer, an action film with minimal plot depth, poor acting and ridiculous un realistic and very farfetched action sequences that have had far too much money thrown at them. In summary it's an ok film to watch to kill a couple of hours.I really like Tom Hardy as an actor and I like most of his films, but I felt he was the wrong actor to play Max, he just didn't portray Max as he should have been portrayed. Far too much shallow Hollywood action hero.Also, the girls in this film are ridiculous given the setting. Yes they're very beautiful and glamorous, but I do not believe there would be women looking the way they do an a post-apocalyptic community in the middle of the desert! The pearly white perfect teeth always amuses me; the post-apocalyptic wastelands obviously boast at least one private dental clinic!As many others have stated, I do not get how this movie has scored so highly on IMDB and is considered a masterpiece. I can only think this is down to the audience's likely demographic; teenage American males.This is not a film I would bother to watch a second time, unlike the originals I've enjoyed over and over again.

All-out action,"Mad Max: Fury Road is non-stop, full-throttle, all-out action for a good two hours straight. If you are into that then this film is perfect for you. If you aren't, then I'd suggest that you watch something else.This is a movie you watch for the action and only the action. It is truly amazing in that aspect. The cinematography and stunts are groundbreaking and exceptional with tons of impressive sequences. I've heard that the producers utilized very little amounts of CGI; director George Miller has claimed that 90% of the movie's special effects were practical, not computer-generated. This genuinely amazed me when I was watching the movie. In general, the film delivers visually as well. It looks absolutely stunning at times with an impressive usage of colors and visual effects that look incredible. For example, there is a dust storm in which we see some shots that look truly spectacular. Mad Max: Fury Road is not only exciting to watch, but it is also beautiful.The problem with this movie is that we get little to no breaks from the action. The plot is pretty shallow and not that unique. I've seen plenty of other movies in similar settings, but with better plots. Some pauses to engage more with the characters or to explore the world would've served the movie well.While some movies may have similar settings and better plots, very few have action of the same caliber as Mad Max: Fury Road. The action is fun to watch and the acting from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron enhances the intensity of the action significantly. If you seek exciting action, look no further than Mad Max: Fury Road.

"A chrome plated, nitrous injected masterpiece!","George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. I don't even know where to begin. First of all, forget Avengers, forget Furious 7, this is THE movie to see this summer, and perhaps this decade. It is a nitrous injected, chrome plated masterpiece of savage beauty and reckless juggernaut aerobatics that has to be seen to be believed. Miller has taken the core elements of what made his Road Warrior so special and beloved, and kicked them into high gear for a revisionist take on the ages old post apocalyptic punk warrior desert chase film. Tom Hardy is hysterical as Max, a brooding, bruised hearted grump who just wants to be left alone, until he's dragged, literally into a deranged odyssey through the badlands. Charlize Theron is all rock solid tough as Imperator Furiosa, who hijacks the five breeding wives of tyrannical, terrifying warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keayes Byrne, Toecutter from the first Max film) and flees into the desert to find a greener place away from the madness. Miller strips away any unnecessary dialogue or clichéd 'getting to know you scenes' and streamlines the film into one sleek, forward surging force of nature, with not a moment wasted, and not a line of dialogue or glare of the eyes that isn't somehow in service of the constant 'go, go, go' mantra of the story. Such pacing is the genius of what makes it such a thrill. Also amazing is the imagination and world building. Miller uses an anthropologists eye to look at what the human mind, and civilization would evolve to in a situation like this, resulting in every character having a realistic, thought through vernacular, and some truly phenomenal, lived in style set pieces that are truly eye popping. Such attention and care is rare in this genre.

A Successful Creation in Complexity of Action Mechanics.,"what made mad max strong is the cinematography and the complexity of it's action mechanics. all of crushing car ware real, i even cant get it how the hell miller design all those cars crushing up and down.also the stunts were real. decent people nowadays, whose usually watching CGI style movies, will never understand how hard the stunt actions in this movie were. for examples : when a biker cross the war rig below it, between the wheel. when a bikers jumping off the ground up and down. when people climbing on the long rod on the car (i forget the name). it was all real. for *beep* sake those were all hard work in to do my mind.beside the actions, the cinematography and art-direction were no sh*t. miller was capable of shoting the packs of war cars with beauty and tense. he chose set decoration in the desert, which really match for the theme itself (runaways with strong lead females).the other thing that makes me amaze was the scene in the night (where they met old friends granma). miller using a freaking beauty of lighting and camera shot. using a pure candle style in the darkness of desert.seriously, if we compare this to saving private ryan. this movie stand a chance to compete in it's actions. but from the storyline, saving private ryan is much better, and of course more realistic to watch. mark my words, if saving private ryan is a movie which made in this generation, it will be a *beep* disaster, because people nowadays, have really bad taste of movie. only CGI that they thing cool.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Most Ambitious Mad Max Film to Date,"30 years following the final Mad Max film in the original trilogy, George Miller set out to create a brand new installment with the character. Released in the spring of 2015, Mad Max: Fury Road was not only a critical darling and a commercial hit, but it has now been deemed as one of the best action films in the 21st century, if not of all time. Time has proven so kind to the feature that it has grown a loyal following without any need to watch the original trilogy, and a prequel is already set in stone for this month. So why exactly did this film work so well when it could have easily been a nostalgia cash grab?The film focuses on Max Rockatansky who joins forces with Imperator Furiosa against the tyrannical cult leader Immortan Joe and his army, which results in a lengthy road battle between the elite traders and undervalued prisoners. While this premise may seem typical for your average Mad Max installment, what makes Fury Road twice as engaging is how much the stakes and intensity from the ongoing chase to stop Furiosa are cranked up towards. George Miller himself has described Fury Road's primary theme as survival, and that not only makes sense from nearly everyone in Immortan Joe's high command chasing Max and Furiosa but also from how Max himself regains his humanity by sticking with someone who yearns for a better tomorrow. A yearning for a new home and reconnection with family are what drive Furiosa and Max to escape such brutal territories, along with a remarkable feminist view as Furiosa's commitment to rescuing the many wives of Joe to a better tomorrow. It's not everyday when an insane chase movie can be this thematically harrowing.But of course, a film like this is not complete without a strong cast to bring all of these characters to life, and this feature delivered well. Tom Hardy takes over the character of Max after Mel Gibson, and he portrays the man well through intense brooding mixed with genuine emotional turmoil as the character lumbers through all the madness occuring in the world. In addition, Charlize Theron is wonderfully stoic as Furiosa and her intense dedication to escaping Immortan Joe's wrath is nothing short of remarkable. Speaking of Immortan Joe, the late great Hugh Keays-Byrne returns to the Mad Max series to portray this intense warlord amidst his intricate body armor. As for the others, the many wives of Joe could all have their own backstories and the war boy Nux arguably has the most concise arc in the whole film from going for Immortan Joe to soon going against him as the journey reaches its conclusion. The remaining cast are all fascinating in their own right, but the primary leads are what make this thrilling action chase truly more dramatic and heart wrenching in just 2 hours.Now it should go without saying that this film is possibly the most ambitious Mad Max film to date as far as production design and visual effects are concerned. Considering that this film was shot roughly three years before it came out, the amount of creative vehicles shown throughout the action scenes are frightening from their mere designs alone, and the practical stunts and intricate performers are a marvel to witness whether you're seeing this film in a theater or on your own device. In addition, the grandiose dry weather backdrops allow the chase to feel like it's literally ongoing and the brisk editing keeps the stakes cranked up without losing focus on what we're witnessing at first glance. The score by Junkie XL also adds into the tone whether the moment is quieter yet still intense or rip roaring, although perhaps some of it could have been edited out in favor of letting the silence speak for itself. From the original low budget action drama to this epic extravaganza of high budgeted filmmaking, it truly is astounding to see how far the Mad Max series has come in more ways than one.By carrying just as much emotional weight as its exhilarating action, Mad Max: Fury Road stands as not only one of the best installments in the series, but also one of the best post-apocalyptic thrillers out there. It stands so well on its own that anyone who has never seen the original trilogy will have a grand old time watching it from start to finish. With its anticipated prequel focusing on Furiosa coming out next week, now could not be a better time to endure yourself with this magnificent masterpiece of emotional intensity. It's a rollercoaster unlike anything you'll see in most action movies today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Movie,"Rating: 8.4
Overall, a grand epic that is painted with high-octane action sequences and a beautifully mad wasteland as it feels like the technology finally caught up to George Miller's Mad Max vision, but this movie too fast and suffers from typical Mad Max writing issues.Direction: Very Good
The direction on a macroscale feels incredibly grand and well executed as the action sequences are stunning and beautiful (really shows what he wanted to display in the 80s if he had the right technology); the direction on a microscale is good as you get a sense of character's internal struggles and what characters like Max and Furiosa want; the storytelling is good as there is a sense of where this movie is going (and the movie heavily relies on its rising action and climax as there is little to no exposition); they build tension very well in the action-sequences with how high-octane they areStory: Pretty Good
The concept is pretty unique for a Mad Max film as it is more about Furiosa's story arc as Max seems more like an observer in this new part of the wasteland; the plot structure is non-traditional because it is void of any exposition, we are plopped into this part of the wasteland and have to infer what is going on from Max's perspective (but this is a problem because it does not make you care for Max or Furiosa's backstory); character writing is pretty good for Mad Max and Furiosa as you get a sense of their characters and their motivations, but the rest of the characters are pretty formulaicScreenplay: Pretty Good to Good
The dialogue is an improvement from the rest of the films, but is still not that amazing as it is pretty unnatural; the symbolism is more profound this time around as it deals more with survival, PTSD, feminism, and purpose; the foreshadowing is pretty good and helps set up the whole story-arcActing: Pretty Good
Tom Hardy: Pretty Good (Feels pretty separated from Mel Gibson's performance, but he makes it his own and plays the protagonist well)
Charlize Theron: Good (Feels like the true protagonist of the movie as Max seems more like an observer to her struggle, and she effectively displays the struggle and how it dictates her actions)
Nicholas Hoult: Decent to Pretty Good (Plays the War Boy well enough, but does not really develop chemistry with the rest of the cast)
Hugh Keays-Byrne: Decent to Pretty Good (Is not really given that much to work with but plays the villain well)
Rest of the cast: Decent (Everyone does their job in supporting the two leads as it really is about them (with some performances doing this better than others))Score: Good

We could understand what was happening, the decisions and eventually root for the main characters! Sure it had lots of explosions and ludicrous cars but it felt whole!

Really!!!..for a movie on the road this doesn't seem to go anywhere!,"As said by some others this is a disappointment, it had the same vibe of disappointment as the two previous instalments but I found them more entertaining at least, the first mad max was a good film and by far the best of the series and this fails to bring any form of ""mad max"" to life as throughout the film as tom hardy's ( good casting call ) mad max remained nothing but tame max at very best, I also felt that for something based in or around a large chase scene it didn't seem to go anywhere throughout, the movie it started well but stayed at the same pace throughout the film.To say i'am unimpressed is an understatement especially in this day and age especially with all the money that was put into this and the cast with what they had did play a good part....nothing special at all!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a lovely film!,"'Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)' is simply spectacular. This visually stunning action film totally reinvents the aesthetic of its series, injecting it with chrome-infused blood and gleefully watching it run wild. George Miller makes everything he's done before seem decidedly quaint, swapping the tactile griminess of 'Mad Max 2 (1981)' for something altogether more unhinged and unreal. Yet, for all its purposeful aesthetic absurdity, the picture remains remarkably tangible, a near perfect blend of practical and visual effects that crafts a seamlessly sweaty, sandy, petrol-soaked world that feels as though it's been baked in the post-apocalyptic sun for so long that every last morsel of it has gone certifiably insane. This is an incredibly impressive picture, the kind of thing that seems incomprehensible to dream up, let alone actually create. It's basically one long chase, but it ebbs and flows so nicely that it never even threatens to outstay its welcome. Filled with colourful characters, creative vehicle designs, and jaw-dropping set-pieces (the image of Max dangling from a pole as a huge orange explosion lights up the background is still seared in my mind), the feature remains entertaining from its first frame until its last. The ominous yet exciting music gets you pumped up for the edge-of-your-seat action, which is so high-octane that it's a miracle you can follow every single second of it as well as you can. It's truly a thrilling picture that puts so many of its peers to shame. It's an unconventional experience in many ways, and its weirdness makes it all the more enjoyable. It really is a blast, the best in its series by far. If you haven't seen it in a while, you'll have forgotten just how stunning it is. It's glorious. What a lovely film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Riveting entry into the Mad Max film series,"Mad Max - Tom Hardy - has been drifting through the ruins of post nuclear Australia since the death of his wife and child. As he explains, it's dreadful to live by one credo: survive. As it happens, he wanders too close to a compound ruled by Immortan Joe. Joe has water needed for human consumption and to grow plants. He trades these things for gasoline. He needs Max and grabs him to provide a blood transfusion to a loyal War boy, Nux - Nicholas Holt. Thus, Max is a prisoner. Meanwhile, 5 wives of Joe, led by Furiosa - Charlize Theron - are sent to make a trade but decide to steal the truck and run off to a green place Furiosa remembers from childhood. Naturally, Joe and Nux and others chase after them, with Max still tethered to Nux. Can the ladies escape ? This riveting film is quite violent, yes, but enthralling. The wasteland that was once Australia is not for sissies or loners. The cast is fabulous with Hardy taking on the Max role quite well and with Theron becoming one ass kicking heroine. Hoult is hardly recognizable as a shrunken victim of radiation poisoning but makes the most of his tole, too. All the others are great as well. As for the visuals and stunts, they are mesmerizing. Here is an action film for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Gritty action sequences with very good humor, a desolated waste land with the beauty of the wives, action from start to finish but with well placed and extremely well timed character development sequences. And all of this is accompanied by a cool soundtrack, literally :).The movie feels like it was in the works for 15 years -which from what I read it actually was-, nothing is rushed and every detail is well taken into account.A beauty of a film :) Hands down!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a lovely film! The best action movie ever!,"Mad Max: Fury Road is the the continuation of George Millers epic action franchise that he created all those years back with Mel Gibson. This time around we have Tom Hardy filling in the shoes as Max. If you are unfamiliar with the Mad Max movie I suggest you watch them in order before seeing this one. The movie is a wasteland tale of people fighting over fuel and most importantly water. There is more to the story but I won't go into spoilers here. Tom Hard knocks it out of the park as Max really digs deep into the characters soul. You may discover that Max does not have many dialogue scenes here and that is due to design by the mastermind creator George Miller. The action practical set pieces are stunning and nothing like you will see in other overly done CGI films. Charlize Theron as Furiosa is one of my favorite characters here because she plays it so well but also because there is more story here about the character then meets the eye. I can't wait to find out more backstory for Furiosa. The vehicle chase/action set pieces are a breath of fresh air especially after getting year after year of Fast and Furious films with computer generated action. With Mad Max: Fury Road you think you're out on the road with our heroes as they are chased by the bad guys. The climax action scene is one of my favorite action set pieces in last 30 years. The timing, the pacing, the score, and the visuals are amazing and top notch. Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie that you will want to see again and again!

An epic Fury Road rage journey,"Rating: 9.5/10
Watched on May 25th, 2024 (first watch)
Format: Home TVTruly one of the best apocalyptic stories ever filled with great action sequences and amazing cinematography to capture all of that. This film has one of the best color palettes I ever seen in any film. The editing of this film is what makes this long 2 hour runtime fury road action journey engaging as it feels like it is fast paced to match with the vibes of the fury road rage as if we are in this journey with the characters.Despite having multiple characters, somehow the story was able to make them all interesting by either using their backstories or making them participate in the film's most important events. Charlize Theron as Furious and Nicholas Hoult as Nux truly stole the spotlight. Perhaps Tom Hardy's acting as Max was the only one that I was expecting a little bit more from and didn't feel anything towards his character throughout the whole film.Really interesting choice of designs for costumes, make-up, hairstyle and production. George Miller truly used the perfect tools and inspirations to create this world in the way he intended it to be and the result can never be better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best action movies from the past decade.,"Mad max fury road is a powerhouse of sweeping spectacle, high octane action and some surprising narrative depth.Obviously no one goes to a mad max movie for a deep, thoughtfully written narrative but fury road at least gives some depth to it's characters, and the plot, while quite literally doing a 180 halfway through, is short, simplistic and does it's job as a sort of amalgamation of different pit stops to get to the next action set piece.Speaking of the action, its incredible. By having the centre of each frame always be the focus point of every action scene, George Miller is able to create not just action sequences that are easier to follow, but are actually incredibly pleasing on the eyes. Every single aspect of the action sequences from the badass looking vehicles to the intense choreography to even the incredible score by Tom Holkenborg are all amazing and i had a rollercoaster of a time.A big portion of why the action sequences are so good has to go down to the editor, Margaret Sixel's, incredible job. Every shot is so
immaculately put together and it just really carries the entire film.One of the best action movies I've ever seen. Can't wait for Furiosa: a mad max saga to come out. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"More explosions than ""action""","If what you're hearing about mad max fury road is that it is one big explosion filled car chase that's absolutely true. Which is okay. In a strange Michael bay fashion it's got some impressive moments, but the insanely high review scores will simply not stand the test of time. As a fan of the mad max series I don't believe the film insults or dilutes the mad max universe. I was most disappointed in the way it failed to capitalize on it. Such a perfect world to mold a story out of and bring to life in the way the video game industry has with the borderlands and fallout series over recent years. They fail making the universe interesting and deep and desperate. It never suspended my belief like a great movie should. This could've been any desert full of bandits. It seemed to be loosely inspired by, if not a flat out off brand version of a mad max movie.Instead of a story in the realm of mad max they tryed to go with a balls out action movie, which once again is fine. But they wait an hour to try to add artificial drama. AN HOUR! Not that Theron acted her part poorly by any means. She doesn't have to prove herself at this point in her career. Clearly her few dramatic lines and ""courageous intent"" come wayyyyy too late in the movie to care. Almost as if somebody was like ""wow, we need to add this ingredient to the Hollywood formula because that's what our investors demand"" it's out of place and nearly makes you roll your eyes. It came of as so forced and phony it almost wrecked the entire thing for me.Also I feel like cinematic direction and results didn't match. Much of the movie didn't have that flair that I felt it was nearly achieving. I guess the only example I could transfer to written word is during the dustnado-dust storm- scene. It looks as though they were going for the 300 type filter (which by the way had they pulled it off would've been perfect) but it kind of came out as a very budget version of that aesthetic. Also the white body paint didn't do any favors throughout the film. They didn't look like blockbuster cool body makeup. They just looked like normal people going to a football game.My end game is they failed to really cement the viewer in the world. Forced some very unneeded drama. And honestly many of the action scenes never felt as intense as they should've been.either budget or ability ate into the final result. Hard to tell which.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece,"Mad max: fury road is another movie in the mad max series. It is not a reboot. It is a continuation of mad max stories. This one takes place between the road warrior and beyond the thunderdome. First off this movie is beautiful, every single shot looks fantastic. It looks like a painting. The visuals in this are also so beautiful, almost the whole movie is practical effects and you can see in the action scenes that this real. Like the old ones there isn't much dialogue, just pure action. The acting is great. Tom Hardy plays a great max, of course Mel Gibson well always be the best max but Tom does a great of carrying that character. The one character who Steals every scene is Charlize Theron's character Imperator Furiosa. Every scene she's in, she's just kills it. The action is unbelievable. George miller knows how to shoot old school action and he does not disappoint. Even we there's 50 cars on the screen, you can see perfectly what's happen. This movie is worth paying the ticket for IMAX 3D. This makes George miller a mastermind and the whole movie a masterpiece. Overall mad max fury road was was a crazy fun, non-stop action movie with great character development. Defiantly a movie that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. If your a fan of mad max or just a fan of action movies, you need to see this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Extremely Inflated,"Like the previous ""Mad Max"" movies this film takes place in a future desert world which has been devastated by a nuclear war. What remains of humanity is both primitive and barbaric and those who have survived exist with the most basic of necessities in war-like fortresses where few laws exist. That being the case, after being taken as a prisoner, it is to one of these harsh enclaves that ""Max"" (Tom Hardy) is subsequently forced to endure. And since life has very little value Max ends up as nothing more than a human blood bank for one of the militaristic ""War Boys"" by the name of ""Nux"" (Nicholas Hoult). It's at this same time that one of the military leaders named ""Imperator Furiosa"" (Charlize Theron) decides to escape from this citadel and she takes with her five wives of the religious leader, ""Immortan Joe"" (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Soon all of the clans in the entire area are summoned to assist in the recapture of Imperator Furiosa with both Nux and his captive Max in hot pursuit and leading the charge. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that those who enjoy films which feature action from start to finish will really appreciate this picture. However, it is this strength which also happens to be the films weakness as there is very little room for anything else. That said, I thought the talents of both Tom Hardy--and in particular Charlize Theron--were terribly wasted. Likewise, I also believe that the current IMDb score of 8.4 (whether by chance or design) is extremely inflated as well. To that end, I would hope that once the initial euphoria has subsided realism will set in and the score will more closely resemble the film's actual merits. Time will tell. In any case, while I certainly do not believe that this particular film is deserving of scores equal to classics like ""Gone with the Wind"", I also don't consider this to be a bad movie either. Accordingly, while my score may not be popular at this time I have rated this movie as I see it. Average.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I thought the sequel was OK but not in the same league. Beyond thunder dome was appalling and ought to have been the deathnell for the franchise, however Miller has taken all that made thunder dome a piece of Hollywood rubbish and extrapolated this to insult himself, as well as movie makers and movie goers alike. If someone says they have heard good things about this movie don't believe them.

"Pedal to the metal, non-stop, high-octane joyride","Fury Road is a near perfect movie. It may be the best Mad Max film from a story perspective, and almost definitely the best from a technical perspective.As far as the pre-production work goes, the smooth camera focus from shot to shot, the frantic way scenes are filmed, the risky and flawless stunt choreography, the vehicle designs, costumes, and settings are all executed and established brilliantly. For the post-production work, the filters for day and night are awe-inspiring, with the night being so uniquely illuminated and the day looking so otherworldly yet familiar with the colours standing out and blending simultaneously as well as how the explosions appearing as if they're bleeding into the screen. The CGI effects are used sparingly and effectively, looking as convincing as they need to be. The score supports the thrills and emotions present throughout in the terrifyingly insane world the characters inhabit. Speaking of, the performances are all top notch, no particular favourites as everyone seemed to be doing their part wonderfully, from the main players like Max and Furiosa to the side characters like Slit and Rictus, everyone. The story is essentially one big escape and pursuit, executed in an effectively efficient manner.Honestly aside from one or two easily overlooked plotholes there's nothing I can really say to discredit this movie. The only thing I could say is that Max doesn't really feel like the main character until closer to the end of the movie but that's kinda just it.Overall, I'm probably not thinking of everything I enjoyed about this film, but that's just because there is so much to love.

Peak Action,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a near-perfect action film. There are great characters, the story is great and the action is perfect.

The acting was great, especially from Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy of course. There were very few moments that felt weird or out of place unlike the third installment in the franchise.The visuals have never been better in the franchise and the cinematography is still most impressive. Speaking of most impressive things there was an amazing reference to Star Wars.

A fantastic Car chase through the poisoned desert,"This starts of very quickly with little ceremony and gets straight into the action; and this is an Action film with a capital 'A'.

The action is constant and relentless. The clever use of minimal CGI means everything looks fantastic.It stays true to the Mad Max theme with an element of cheesiness which is vital for this kind of movie to stay brutal but stop it getting too dark.There are strange contraptions, men on poles, mutated cliché characters preserved from the old world. The vehicles are wacky, interesting and varied. I personally loved what can only be described as the worlds most improbable morale boosting device?The only two gripes I have is the cgi for the flash backs is very poor along with the obligatory 3d scenes of steering wheels hurtling out the screen (they are even more annoying when you choose to watch in 2d). And the story is a little insulated. You are either in the big rig or chasing the big rig - I would have liked to see a dash more of the ruined world.But there is an awful lot to love about this.

The action sequences, along with the booming soundtrack, are nothing short of mesmerizing, I cannot remember the number of times my jaw kept dropping over the course of the movie! The stunts are simply incredible, CGI is kept to a minimum, which makes it so much better. The plot is surprisingly engaging, and the character development is exceptional. The human angle is at the forefront of this film, which only makes the action sequences so much more edgy.Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are incredible as Max and Furiosa, but it's Theron who just about pips Hardy as the bigger influence on the proceedings.

Those people lives in a very hostile place without any education and you do not even expect them to speak at all. But they speak like theatre actors, this puts me off a lot. Script was extremely artificial and most of the the as amateur as very cheap TV movie. Everybody was giving speeches to other all the time. Maybe action wise it was a good movie but that is all, full of clichés.The guy who wrote the script should find a job somewhere else.

An Action Film That Puts All Others to Shame,"After watching Fury Road I can safely conclude that not only will the film be welcomed by a majority of people craving a good action- packed popcorn flick, this new movie will effectively change the action-adventure game for the better.The story begins with Max (Hardy) being chased by a group of crazed goons across the desert in his signature Interceptor car. The vehicle crashes spectacularly and he's immediately captured. We're introduced to a host of characters warped by the landscape and made crazy by their circumstance. Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne) sits atop of the social spectra. A violent, disfigured dictator who has hijacked not only the world's most needed resource, water, but the world's most precious: the future. He has taken the most beautiful brides among his dirt-pile civilization and forces them into a harem where he rapes them to birth a normal, untarnished heir. That is until Furiosa (Theron) a trusted marauder takes the harem and escapes in her war rig with a mission to take them to ""the green place"". With war parties in fast pursuit, Max is forced to be a feral warrior's ""blood bag"" until fate allows him the chance for escape and possible redemption from the thoughts that haunt him.After a fifteen minute setup the entire movie boils down to one, big, long, explosive, exciting, pulse-pounding chase through the desert. Each action set-piece is a master's course in chaotic beauty and mayhem. Lest you think you've seen it all, watch the first extended chase between the war rig and the war parties...then wait another five minutes, because the expectations you just set for yourself will be blown to smithereens. George Miller decided to film in the otherworldly desert of Namibia instead of the Australian outback. The hues of the rock and sands of Namibia make for some austere beauty and intensifies the desperation of the world of Mad Max. No longer are their paved roads, only basins of flat unforgiving dirt remain. Trekked by those most craven and those most crazed.Through all the absurd chaos, characters emerge. Not through dialogue or long-winded explanations but through action. Everyone we meet is stripped to their essence and pitted against each other. The number one goal for our beleaguered protagonists? Survival; it's that simple. Max in particular has quite a complex character arc given the movie's structure. He is reintroduced in our psyche as a man who once had a moral compass now reduced to an animal; wild and instinctual. He lost those he loved most and is haunted by their memories. By the end of the movie his purpose is molded beyond simply survival. His resourcefulness and pragmatism follows a logical train that ends with Max becoming a restorer of hope. A rebirth of the dark anti-hero we once loved and all with little to no dialogue.Now a game-changing movie like this is not without its controversy. Men's Rights Activists have been crying foul ever since this movie's been released, claiming the movie is feminist propaganda masquerading as a shoot-em-up. Noted chauvinist blogger and blatherskite Aaron Clarey even initiated a boycott over it's perceived ""feminist agenda"". ""men in America and around the world are going to be duped by explosions, fire tornadoes, and desert raiders into seeing what is guaranteed to be nothing more than feminist propaganda, while at the same time being insulted AND tricked into viewing a piece of American culture ruined and rewritten right in front of their very eyes.""With as much respect as I can give people with rudimentary understanding of discrimination; knock it off. Having physically and emotionally strong female characters is not propaganda. Nor is making an enemy out of a thoroughly disgusting human who in no way represents the male gender or the patriarchy as it exists today. If anything the warped society that exists in Fury Road is an exaggerated view of patriarchy therefore categorizing the political elements of Mad Max as satire. Even to claim the film has a feminist agenda of any kind is suspect. Not all feminists believe the same thing but a majority believe portraying women in media in the mold of a traditional male sans male genitalia, is not the best way to empower women. Not to discount Theron's performance but her Furiosa does fit that bill.My only real complaint is less about the movie and more about Hollywood's insistence that 3D is the way to go. Dazzling sequences of real stunt driving and explosions that would put the Fast and Furious franchise to shame are interrupted by obvious frames where 3D is injected for the sake of being injected. In one, almost delirious moment of climax, we see obvious computer generated twisted metal synchronized to look like a jack-in-the-box. It was distracting flaw but not a fatal flaw.Mad Max: Fury Road is not just a spectacular action film; its an action film that truly raises the bar. Those who have never seen the original films won't be lost nor will they be disappointed. Through frenetic editing, solid, smooth camera work, strong acting, brawny, metal-meets-muscle action sequences and minimalist story, every action movie the foreseeable future is going to wish it was Mad Max.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unlike Anything You've Previously Seen,"Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)**** (out of 4)In a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world, female rebel Furiosa (Charlize Theron) goes against her tyrant leader by trying to get his female brides to a safe land far away. With the brides stolen the tyrant sends all of his force after them but with the help of the loner Max (Tom Hardy) they try to reach some place they can live with peace.This is technically the fourth film in George Miller's franchise but I think it's safe to say that this here is the best of the bunch. Considering how good the original series was it's rather amazing to see how amazing this one here turned out. I usually don't try to speak too highly of a new movie because I think the true test for any great movie is time. I mean, how does a film work fifteen, twenty or thirty years after it was made? Does it stand the test of time? While watching MAD MAX: FURY ROAD I couldn't help but feel as if I was watching something that would easily stand the test of time.Story-wise this is pretty much a simple story but it's Miller's wonderful eye that makes this truly one of the most remarkable action pictures in recent history. I really don't want to under-praise this movie because it is so wild, so crazy and so over-the-top and suspenseful that you really can't help but feel that you're watching something unlike anything before. The special effects here and stunt work are among some of the greatest that you're ever going to see. So many action films are overloaded with mediocre CGI that you can't help but feel as if you're watching an unrealistic world. That's not the case here because everything looks so real that you get caught up in what's going on because you feel as if it's a real world with a real battle going on.There are some intense, heart-pounding battle sequences that really make your jaw hit the floor in regards to the action. The explosions are loud and violent and there are a number of bodies being thrown around in every way imagination. The built-up cars and monster rigs are something unlike you've ever seen before the the pure wild imagination in the action scenes is just rather remarkable. There's no doubt that what you're seeing here is among some of the greatest things ever captured on film. The masterful editing, sound effects and cinematography just pull everything together.The performances are another major plus with Theron being perfectly believable as this tough warriors. Hardy is also extremely great as the loner who doesn't speak too many words. Nicholas Hoult, Josh Helman, Zoe Kravitz and Hugh Keays-Byrne are all impressive too. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is pumped full of wonderful action and suspense and it's certainly one of the best of its type.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely stunning cinema.,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a visually stunning masterpiece by George Miller. It's been 30 years since Miller's last project: the last of the original Mad Max films, starring Mel Gibson. Comparisons cannot be made as I've yet to watch them. There are no excuses. Max's crazy adventure may not take him very far, but the world in which he resides is imaginative. The vast wasteland surrounding small territories show how bleak everything has become. Water is sparse and saved for the main cretin and his crew. Weird, cult-like followers, with their bald heads, white painted bodies and addiction to silvery substance, follow his orders. There's no sign of any nature, only a rumour of a place populated by trees and running water. Theron's barbaric-looking Furiosa, with her metal arm and gigantic tanker, thwarts her bosses' orders and steals that which is most precious to him. Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne) gathers his whole force in pursuit. What emanates is a fantastically frenzied chase across the desert. MM:FR is full of insane car chases (the cars are a sight to behold in themselves), incredible explosions and well thought-out action. The 3D isn't necessary; only one part stands out in particular and the story is only strong enough to keep the action expressive. Max (Hardy), with his gruff voice and limited dialogue, is secondary to Furiosa. His serenity and coldness towards others makes him the perfect character to explore. Flashes of his family, from a world once known, haunt him constantly. Mad Max: Fury Road isn't just creative and captivating to the very end, it sets up potential for expansion. After this ride, it'd be criminal for the film studio not to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
High obtain action joyride!,"Guys it's simple, Mad Max Fury Road is a masterpiece! Not only does this movie have great action, it has amazing characters, dialog and heart. This movie features great FX that are all practical. About 90% of the explosions and action are all practical and makes you enjoy the movie much more. The movie is set in a post apocalyptic world and it does a good job at setting a dark tone and world. You really feel the characters motivation because of the world the movie is set in. The cinematography is also fantastic. There is no shaky cam, it's all marvelously shot. The acting is perfect. Tom Hardy as Mad Max was perfect. In fact I think he was better then Mel Gibson. The villain and characters are great also. Obviously you have Max, but the stand out characters are the villain, and the character named Furiosia. Some of the best action includes these characters. In the end Mad Max Fury road is a high octane, action joyride. It has great characters, acting, story, setting and of course brilliant action! This is definitely one of the best movies of the year!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A movie you will fall madly in love with,"Mad max is the most insane, yet perfectly executed movie I have ever seen.Mad Max Fury Road is an add on to Goerge Millers Mad Max franchise. Goerge Miller also directed this film, and gave us one of the most insane, yet perfect movies...ever. The entire length of the film your eyes are glued to the screen, and your jaw is glued to the floor. The action sequences are brilliant, and over the top. This movie is practically all one action sequence. There isn't much plot, but there isn't a need for one. The action sequences are executed perfectly. The special affects were not only spectacular but also moving. Every angle, the atmosphere, the car chases, and then there is the storm. During a car chase a giant dust storm appears,and the action continues inside the storm. Lightning, explosions, and slow motion kills, make this one of the best scenes I have ever seen in a movie.The characters are all awesome, and the acting is great. The nemesis is terrifying, and so are all the characters chasing after max. The soundtrack helped give the movie a dark and at the edge of your seat feel.This movie is truly a milestone to the action film genre. The movie is a masterpiece. It is dark yet beautiful at the same time. Every other action movie pales in comparison to this film. This movie raises the bar for action films to come. This is a film you must see on the big screen, to truly fall madly in love with it",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a lovely movie!,"You have to open your mind and not to be burden by previous movies with Mel Gibson. To see a movie like this today is so refreshing. It is proof that movie, action packed like this, doesn't have to be stupid and plain (like Transformers). My wife didn't knew nothing about Mad Max and she put pretty much everything about world it is set in.That is also what I liked the most. There was no pathetic voice-over who explains everything, no ""drawing"" of the circumstances they live in. It is clear by the simple actions of movie characters.Downside is a bit under-use of Tom Hardy as Mad Max...He isn't that mad, and he is simply over-shined by incredible, Oscar-worthy Charlize Theron.It is amazingly entertaining and fun movie to watch. I enjoyed it, and when a left the cinema, I wanted to stop people on the streets and tell them how good it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How to create an awful movie from a good story with a great cast,"This movie has a good story with interesting characters, but the director (or the producers?) has chosen to follow the ""micheal bay style"", and to remove dialogues, story and character development to create a movie that is a 2 hours action sequence full of digital video effects and explosions...""The People eater"", ""The bullet farmer"", Rictus are character that with a few lines could be really interesting.Also the story and the dynamics of the citadel could be deepened a bit, to give some more depth to the movie...If you like brainless action movies maybe this is the best movie you can see these days.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watchable,"A watchable film but a poor addition to the series. Tom Hardy, who is great in other movies, is reduced to a scruffy (rageddy man) who grunts and mumbles a barely discernable dialogue in a mixture of American,British and an attempt at Australian accents. His character development was clearly savaged to place Charize Theron?! As the main protagonist. Again a great actress but the leader of a super violent cult of radioactive thugs? Nah, I couldn't buy it and it spoiled immersion. No amount of cgi prosthetic arms could make her size 6 frame look in anyway fierce and she didn't even try an ozzy accent and just stuck with American, while the Warboys were all British??!? Why the mix of accents? Its an Australian setting.The vehicles were incredible but were made to be spectacular rather than representative of how I would imagine them to look. Huge oversized vehicles that must drink fuel, trucks with a bungee rope attached guitarist, porcupine cars?! Pointless men on poles, the predecessors to this film used common sense and built what you would imagine a post apocalyptic vehicle would look like, this felt like a computer game and was probably made to sell one. The chase scenes were spectacular and kudos to them not using too much cgi.Story line had interesting features, I won't spoil them, setting was standard for Mad Max but generally the film was one big car chase.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Some Dusty Pig,"The first Mad Max had a few strong attractions. It was overtly Australian in a few dimensions which hit a niche of the familiar exotic. It was pure science fiction in that it abstracted our world into a future where only the tiniest fragment of what we know was carried over and amplified. That fragment revolved around one of our most peculiar social constructions, the wild motorcycle gang. It is peculiar in being largely a cinematic invention. (Paris being romantic is another.)The notion of a motorcycle gang originated in California after WWII where returning GIs (mostly tattooed navy men who had served in the South Pacific) bought surplus army motorcycles. The notion of lawlessness unique to motorcycles is from Marlon Brando as copied by Sonny Barger. It is a wholly cinematic convention made real, like movie gangster talk as adopted by the Mafia. Mad Max joined this to an equally unique cinematic convention: the chase.Now this. After decades, it is still the most pure of science fiction abstractions. It is still overly Australian, more about that in a moment. It still takes the chase very seriously. But it now employs a reverse irony on the motorcycle gang trope, moving it into Fast and Furious car territory, merged with comic heavy metal and pushed into humor. The trick with these is to exaggerate enough to make us laugh but not so much that we don't engage with it in its terms.Among the Australian notions is a new one: architectural dust. Most of the stunts were practical, but all of the environments were artificial. This is the first time I know that a big film used the same effects shop (Melbourne-based Iloura) for both composites (the deserts and cliffs) and dust. Different technologies are required, but a similar notion of texture was used, and the two are combined in the dust storm near the beginning.The result is an astonishing effect of surface become air. The cinematographer seems to have been aboard in the way he overexposes and undersaturates, especially during the 'night' scenes. I don't know of any other film save Derzu Uzala that attempts this, and all Kurosawa had was snow.I hope other Australian productions adopt this technique, as it seems both very advanced cinematically and wholly Australian. When Michael Jackson advanced the art of using a spatial camera, we did see that become common very quickly, first through Hollywood's use of WETA, and then other shops.And we did see the world quickly copy the motorcycle gang trope.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The action movie we deserved.,"Mad Max Fury Road is directed by none other than George Miller. It's the first Mad Max movie in 30 years, which replaces cult icon, Mel Gibson with uprising star Tom Hardy. It also stars Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult.You know these days, where you just want to go to a movie, have fun and at the same time be impressed by the movies quality?Mad Max Fury Road is exactly that, just 10 times better.I can't find words how to describe this movie, it's everything an action fan dreams of and wants. It's the kind of movie that only comes along every 10 years or so. It's something else, something unique. It's pure adrenaline, balls to wall, fuel kicked craziness and it's everything I want from an action movie.While the movie is crazy, it is also grounded with characters that feel real and tormented by this gruesome world where survival is the number one priority. Furiousa and Max have great chemistry together and you want to learn more from their characters. Everyone in this movie does a fantastic job. Nicholas Hoult especially was very surprising as one of the War Boys, he really had fun with the role and you can see it in the movie.The plot is fairly simple, this is not a problem because it has been established as a movie where the main goal is to capture the audience with the mesmerizing action scenes. Mad Max Fury Road is a prime example that a great movie doesn't need a complex story to be good. Gravity is also a prime example to showcase this. While the story here is simple, it fits the movie perfectly.Now, the number one reason you want to watch this movie, is the visual extravaganza Miller has brought on screen. Trust me when I say this, you have never seen action scenes on the big screen like the ones in this movie. The things you see on screen are 80% practical and every time you think about that, your mouth drops even more. There is some really mind boggling stuff in the action scenes and it is all executed perfectly. Miller has created an action movie where the action is not only well made, it is also beautiful to look at. Something that other action movies almost never archive, like the previously released action blockbusters Avengers AOU and Furious 7. This movie puts both of them to shame and I wouldn't really understand why anyone would say otherwise. George Miller has done a movie so beautiful in shot composition and cinematography, one could say this movie was directed by Van Gogh. There is some abstract scenery and imagery which is wonderful to look at. Every shot in this movie feels new, vivid, exciting and is just jaw dropping at times. Miller takes full advantage of the medium and of his tools to create a movie that will be remembered in the years to come.The reviews for this movie have all been amazing and they are all well deserved. Mad Max Fury Road is the kind of movie, movie fanatics love to watch. This movie shows that even big budget studio movies can be artistically powerful. Mad Max Fury Road is simply put one of the best action movies ever made. Don't miss this movie on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A perfect film. Start to finish.,"I watched this movie with my sister and some friends in theaters back when it came out. My Dad had showed my sister and I The Road Warrior and I had LOVED it- when the trailer for this came out she excitedly showed us and I was drawn right in. We ended up going to see it and I can say for certain I have never had a movie-going experience like this one...I always envied people who got to see films back when movies were still exciting novelties that could blow audiences away, like the first audiences to see Star Wars, and I was sad id never get to experience that type of thrill. Boy was I wrong.This movie is better than any roller-coaster ive ever been on; better than any drug ive ever done; more adrenalyne pumping than any near death experience Ive ever had and has truly earned that funny phrase ""better than sex."" It is a non-stop, straight forward action filled ROMP where every single detail has been considered and you notice something new everytime. Every shot; every cut; every punch; every bullet fired; every crash; every scream; every explosion, gets your heart pumping faster and faster as you feel more and more invested in the conflict our heroes face. Part of that is because despite minimal dialogue and maximum action- you care more about these characters thsn you will in most modern movies. This movie has HEART, and a great message. It's story-telling and themes are the epitome of show don't tell. There is rarely exposition dialogue, instead props, scenes, and character costumes communicate everything you need to know about them and this hellworld our story takes place in. More is communicated in a simple nod than most movies achieve in entire scenes- partly credit to the actors and partly just because the writing and pacing are executed flawlessly. Sometimes I rewatch it when I want to feel inspired in our own warlord-run wasteland.This movie is all gas; no breaks, start to finish. Incredibly rewatchable and never loses that high-octane adrenalyne rush I felt upon first viewing.When we finished the movie that first time we went, it was downpouring out with thunder and lightning. But we were so amped up that as I drove everyone home, my friends and sister in the backseat leaned out windows and climbed out the sunroof to scream ""WITNESS ME!"" into the raging storm... in defiance of all that things ahead on the road... 2015 was a simpler time.This is my favorite film, and it's not even close.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Landmark of Action Film Making,"Mad Max Fury Road is such a movie that leaves you spellbound and dumbstruck at the same time.. It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film..

There would be no better replacement of Mel Gibson than Tom Hardy.. If I have to talk about charlize theron the first thing comes in my mind is her intensity.. She is way too brilliant in this movie.. She actually overshadows the rest.. Nicholas hoult as expected , phenomenal..

This movie seems to pay homage with similarities using a gas tanker and other similar vehicles, desert backdrop, and a music toy used by the feral boy in ""Road Warrior.

MAD to the MAX,"Wow!!! Now that's a movie worthy of all the hype, a non stop roller coaster ride with no brakes. From the sounds, the visuals, the stunts, the costumes, the cars, the girls, Darth Vader's brother and finally to our two protagonists, everything just perfectly casted. Charlize casted as Imperator Furiosa was brilliant, I can't think of any other actress who could have played her part so vigorously and with so much passion she truly stole this film away from Max who wasn't shy to give away his last bullet.Coming to Max who is played by a rising Tom Hardy, is a man seeking to survive in world that has lost all law and order, something once upon a time he was very familiar with, now just wandering the desert seeking to survive while being haunted by ghosts of his past is quickly thrown into chaos. Later Max must choose whether to ride off into the dessert sunset or like his co-partner Furiosa seek redemption.Some people have discredited the film for a lack of character development and dialog, but when you having a horde of maniac destruction derby fanatics hunting you down the last thing you are going to do is stop for a break, sip down on some mother's milk while discussing your life story....yeah I wouldn't either. In terms of the film being too feminist who cares!!!

To sum it up: A masterpiece of a film,"So I have a new favourite movie......And it is most definitely Mad Max: Fury Road.I'm a big apocalyptic movie fan, and am usually very picky about them, and if a movie is good I will simply be satisfied with it and leave it at that, however this movie is way beyond that. I am simply AMAZED at the masterpiece that is Mad Max: Fury Road.When I first saw the trailer I gotta say I was quite excited, it looked like a relatively enjoyable post apocalyptic movie. And it had Tom Hardy in it, which was great, no complaints there. In no way was I prepared for it, though. Every scene was action packed, exploding chaos, and to sum it up it was pure brilliance. And the strong female characters portrayed in it are wonderful and it's very refreshing to see that in an action movie.I recommend it to everyone, even if action movies/ post apocalyptic movies/ thriller movies aren't your thing, I still recommend it. I'm going to have to go see it at the very least, 5 more times.If I could give it a higher rating then I would, but unfortunately I can't so 10/10 (but really should be 20/10, that's how good it is.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Visual Masterpiece of Relentless Action,"In my opinion, this movie is definitely one of the best movies of all time. George Miller has crafted a truly furious film that never loses traction during its entire 2-hour runtime. While the storytelling might not be the most intricate, the simplicity of the plot is what makes it so captivating. The movie is essentially a firework display on screen, with the plot moving from one place to another and then back again.The action sequences are relentless and breathtaking, becoming the main focus due to the straightforward storyline. This is exactly what an action movie should be-pure, unadulterated excitement. If you have never seen this movie, I highly recommend it as an entry point into the Mad Max world. This film is the realization of George Miller's vision, and the passion behind it is evident in every second. A must-watch for any action movie enthusiast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Admirable in its commitment and scale, but certainly not what the hype suggests","It seemed to me that few people did not totally love this film, and I cannot think of any time on social media or reviews that I saw many negative words about it. So I was keen to see it once it came to being released for the home viewing. Undeniably the film is committed to what it is doing and it seems determined to make this world real simply by the force of its own will. As a result there does not seem any excess that is out of place, even if for me personally this also worked against the film. The simple plot allows the action to be the all, and in some ways it is enjoyably metallic – with impacts, grinding of parts, the smell of grease. However on the other side the sense of vaudeville that it has detracts from the actual feeling of tension and violence it should have. That it didn't manage to draw me into its creation meant that the constant action felt like a show rather than something with real consequence and risk.That is not to say that it isn't enjoyable, because as a show it is often quite the show. I am not sure why this content-light blockbuster got so much praise versus any other blockbuster heavy on action but light on plot, but it did. Visually it is endlessly interesting; the crazy nonsense of the vehicles and the action sequences combine with some great cinematography – over-saturating everything and adding to that sense of otherworldly extremes. The cast do the same and have that 'committed' approach that the film has – whether their performances make sense or not. Theron is the most engaging of the piece, with a very strong and yet emotive character. Hardy is a good presence but surprisingly not particularly interesting as a title character. Hoult is better, and the female support characters see good turns from Huntington- Whiteley (I know – surprising), Kravitz, Eaton, and others.It is a film that simply does what it sets out to do and doesn't seem to worry about whether it will work or not. In this way it does have strong forward motion, and never lack confidence. However the sense of performance and show to it does rob it of a hook to draw the viewer in, and as such it is always a blockbuster, even if the grimy metallic aspects suggest it is more 'proper' than other films doing much the same for a wider audience. Good for what it is, but certainly not worthy of the endless waves of praise hitting it this summer.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max is back,"What to say about a movie like this one? It's easy. If you expect a difficult dramatic story then you are not going to like it. But if you expect an action movie about a whole lot of modified vehicles trying to take over a big modified truck in the middle of nowhere, with creepy looking humans, then you are going to love it. And that's what I was going to expect. I like movies like this one where you just relax and let the action come to you. Not all the time but sometimes I do enjoy a movie like Mad Max. The amateurs of steam punk will also like this one because almost everybody in this movie is strangely looking. The filming itself was good, the script is like I said what it is. It should not have been difficult to write that script. The actors all did their job like they should. Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are the main characters and they are good actors. Nice action movie if you are into stuff like that, otherwise just pass on this movie and watch something else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not what I was expecting as a fan of the originals....,"I'm one of those in the extreme minority, that simply didn't get anything out of this film. I was expecting ""Mad Max"" and got ""Furiosa"" instead. The background scenery, costuming, and vehicles were all great (I'd love to find some model kits for the vehicles). The characters and actors were also really well done... nice and over-the-top, in keepng with the original films. I was really happy with the reliance on practical effects instead of relying on CGI... this was probably my favorite aspect of the film.Unfortunately, the storyline just didn't do it for me, I was not particularly impressed. Max was relegated to a barely there side figure for the real lead... Furiosa. I felt kind of cheated that ""Mad Max"" was included in the title. They should have just omitted ""Max"" and done a story in the same world... which they eventually did. Obviously this was what was intended all along.Even if ""Max"" had been omitted, which would have changed my expectations going in, I wouldn't have been overly impressed.

Max is Back,"Mad Max Fury Road is absolutely insane. Like, even if you go in expecting to have your head blown off, you will be surprised how forceful the decapitation process is. Wow! George Miller you guys. This man has recaptured the magic of Mad Max and given us an updated version of the story that topples all of its predecessors. The fact that most of the action was filmed using practical effects just blows my mind even further! How?!?!Charlize Theron dominates her role as Furiosa. This is truly her movie, and she is amazing in it. But hey, the Max is back. Tom Hardy is perfect has the road warrior, dealing with horrors from his past and being dragged along for an insane car chase through the middle of a post apocalyptic wasteland. These two have great chemistry and work well off of one another.The overall scope of this film is just incredible. While it seems like an empty, hallow world, there are so many regions and places you can travel. The world George Miller created is nasty, gritty, and just plain disgusting at times. I was so sucked in to the world and all the characters involved with it. I can't wait for more of these. I just wanna go back.Overall, Mad Max Fury Road is a breathtaking experience, filled with amazing action sequences and some of the best looking visual effects I have ever seen. If any film in 2015 unseats Mad Max as my favorite film of the year, we are in for quite a year. Mad Max is incredible awesomeness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Incredible,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015) is like no other mainstream action movie out there. Saw it last night, in 3D - it's a helluva entertainment. The crazy high metacritic score and praises from critics weren't just an empty thing - this movie is truly great.""Mad Max: Fury Road"" takes place somewhere in between 2 and 3 movie of the franchise, but if you haven't seen previous movies don't worry, this movie stands on it's own, but it's better for you to watch previous parts, especially ""Road Warrior"".To get straight to the point, ""Fury Road"" is a blast from start till finish. It's hands down the best action movie i saw in quite long time. It has insane stunts, terrificly directed and choreographed action scenes, crazy, twisted and ""take you right there"" settings, solid acting, tight and very simple script, amazing / gorgeous cinematography and very good music. All these parts are combined together in not very traditional and at the same time masterfully good way. This movie feels unique. It has lots of explosions, but strangely enough, we do care and kinda feel every single of it, even if characters or bad guys were on screen for just a second. There are some truly visionary scenes in this picture, which you won't see in a big budget mainstream movies, like the one at night in burned land. The ending is terrific, with a last scene just begging for this movie to be seen again - terrific ending which sort off reminded me of ""The Dark Knigh Rises"".Overall, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is incredible picture. It has the crazy spirit of previous movies, and if you like this kinda stuff, you will be in nirvana watching ""Fury Road""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Instant Classic.,"Definitely my favorite action movie so far. It is a simple plot, but with the amazing Mad Max's pos apocalyptic world to backup, which adds up to the history. The action scenes(whole movie)is amazing. I thought it would get dull to see always the same type of scenes, which were cars exploding. But it was so well organized and beautiful that you can only get amazed by then, never tired. The cars were crazy and awesome. The movie brings finally a great female character, which many do not try. Actually this brings me to my final point, and the only point I did not like. Mad Max(Tom Hardy) was definitely overshadowed by Furiosa(Charlize Theron). I am a big fan of Tom Hardy and I think that he was perfect for the character. Although I think that he did not give his best in this job, there was a lack of ""madness"" on him. I cannot blame only him for this, as it was impossible not to be overshadowed by Charlize Theron there. To sum up, the movie is an instant classic action movie, with amazing but a simple plot and great supporting actors and actress. I had to hold my self not to applaud the movie at the end and look stupid.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Mad Max Yet,"Max is back and better than ever! I know ""The Road Warrior"" is a classic, but I'm saying that this is the best ""Mad Max"" film to date. The reboot is a whirlwind of a thrill ride and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats for the who two-hour run time (making it the longest film in the series.)""Fury Road"" finds Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky, a man burdened by glimpses of the past and a little girl he was unable to protect. He is a loner, a drifter, and a man of very few words. After being taken prisoner by a group of warriors who paint themselves white and believe they are working to make it to Valhalla, Max escapes during one of the many intense fuel-guzzling battles on the Fury Road and decides to help Furiosa (played wonderfully by Charlize Theron) and a group of young women who are attempting escape and freedom by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays- Byrne, who played the villain in the first installment as well), the evil leader of the citizens of the Citadel who uses the women as slaves to give birth to his children.The performances in the film are nothing short of great and satisfying. Hardy doesn't say much as Max, and he doesn't have to. Every gesture and grunt he makes is good enough and he fills the shoes vacated by Mel Gibson very well. Theron gives us a strong, independent woman warrior in Furiosa, one of the best characters to appear in the franchise and on screen this year. Another wonderful addition is Nicholas Hoult, who plays a distraught and anxious warrior who switches to the good side after failing in the eyes of Immortan Joe.The film lives for its action sequences, which is fantastic because director George Miller is the king of action. Also, this is what the series was practically built on, something that was forgotten in the very disappointing ""Beyond Thunderdome."" The audience is given the pleasing feeling we felt while watching ""The Road Warrior,"" and then we are given more..and more...and more until we are so filled with excitement that it is hard to sit still. The film has a good plot that the action enhances.If anything, this film is a shout-out to the number of failed modern action films. While the first ""Mad Max"" revolutionized the action film in the late 1970s, this film sets the bar for modern films of the genre. I've heard that the film is eighty percent practical events instead of CGI, and that in itself in achievement. With this in mind, there were numerous times in the film where I wondered just how Miller did what he did. The seventy-year-old director has excelled where a number of young filmmakers have failed and has brought us what might be the best action film in years.This seems to be a new start for the ""Mad Max"" franchise. The original trilogy was probably good enough, but if the upcoming films are this great, they can make as many as they want until George Miller is unable to continue. Keep the excellent Tom Hardy in the lead, and keep on amazing us with the unbelievable stunts and action sequences. It's about time we had an action/adventure franchise film like this.

Greatest Action Movie of All Time,"Every action movie needs to use this film as its blueprint. This movie will age well and live on. The Oscar wins and nominations speak for themselves as they pay tribute to the overall success of how well this movie was created and executed.The first 45 minutes of the movie feels like drinking a Red Bull the whole time! Right from the get go we see a car get blown over, Max nearly escaping multiple times, a guitar shooting flames, and a massive sandstorm. And that is just the beginning. More amazing, well-choreographed scenes follow with a straightforward story that is easy to follow.This movie will age well because it used minimal CGI. The endeavor to plan out complex scenes of multiple moving vehicles shows and is rewarding.George Miller was great with being consistent with characters and their nuances.

Cartoonish Stupidity,"It seemed like every time the action sequences threatened to get good they had to remind you just how silly and over-the-top this movie was required to be. I know they felt compelled to try and top the original Mad Max but I have to ask one question. WHY??? I just don't understand why they felt it necessary to try and top it at every turn? Just keep telling the story and let this film stand on it's own merits. Why all the CGI chaos? Jamming in too many characters and adding camp and completely ridiculous action seems like they were overly desperate to make this reboot relevant. The entire plot and the actions of the leads were beyond absurd and I just don't find moronic and impossible plot turns or cartoon stunts fun to watch. I also found the character arcs to be shallow and even non-existent. I'm so disappointed. I thought I'd find a fun film worthy of the name.

The plot is meh at best but at least they are making the best of the good old blue and red colour schema.Don't get me wrong, I like strong female leads like Ellen Ripley or Lara Croft.

To me it seemed like just a bunch of trucks driving in the desert while people scream at each other for two hours. Watching it again, knowing what to expect, I thought it was brilliant.This is like a sci-fi-action-carsploitation-arthouse movie. It's an adrenaline rush from start to finish, sure, but it's like every frame of the movie is jampacked with creativity. Every line of dialogue, every performance, offers a hint of something much more. There are so many little details, you know it's a movie that's only going to reward repeated viewings.I wish I'd watched it on the big screen.Now, there's a sequel coming out, and I don't know if that's a good thing. It reminds me of ""Sin City"" and to a lesser extent, ""300"". Both captured lightning in a bottle and both had lacklustre sequels. Watching ""Sin City"" made me think you couldn't have too much of a good thing, but ""A Dame to Kill For"" had all the joy of creation taken out of it. Lightning can't strike twice.Of course, ""Fury Road"" is a sequel in itself, and as far as I know there's never been a bad Max Max movie. I can't see them repeating this trick a second time though, so it'll probably have to be something different.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What is Mad Max doing in this movie?,"OK, I went into this movie because of the crazy high rating of the movie and the ""masterpiece"" reviews, but it turned out to be far from any piece a master would craft. Was the crew paying critics to leave good reviews? This whole ""tricked by IMDb rating and checking out a movie"" leads me now to distrust the ratings here altogether for new launches.There are many good things in this movie and these are things like action sequences, makeup, vehicles, stunts, acting. But after 10 minutes of watching this gasoline/adrenaline junkie trip you are asking yourself ""what is this all for, this does not make any sense"", which is the main issue I have with this movie and I am simply perplexed about so many ""critics"" overlook this obvious issue. This is far from a masterpiece as it does not ask or answer any questions which are somewhat related to real life. The first sentence you will hear in this movie will be the whole story element. After that you get just one action sequence after another with minor pauses. And last but not least, why is Max even in this movie because he just does some minor jobs and the real hero here is Imperator Furiosa. This should be the name of the movie, by the way.This movie does not justify the high rating it has been given now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Crazy Road,"Saw Fury Road again last night in cinema. Great as ever with the non-stop action and great effects and vehicles. Great production design, by Colin Gibson with stunning costumes. Hardy and Theron both put in impressive performances even if Hardy's was mostly nonverbal. Still think he was too young for the back story though. But In Fury Road I think he built on and surpassed Gibson's interpretation of Mad Max, maybe it's what Gibson would have done if Thunderdome hadn't been made. He was just convincing as the Road Warrior, a flawed hero rather than an anti-hero. Resident Evil The Final Chapter. Was heavily influenced by Mad Max: Fury Road.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max Is Awsome!,"I checked out this movie a couple of years ago and ended up watching it a few times - which is saying something because I usually never do that! But this one? It felt brand new every single time. I'm not kidding when I say I'm the type who can't sit through a movie or series twice, no matter how much I've forgotten. Yet, this flick has some magic that keeps pulling me back in.I'm already planning to give it another go right before the sequel drops - fingers crossed they keep up the trend of making those creepy guitar guys look ridiculously cool! But enough joking around. From what I recall, this movie is seriously awesome. If you're into action, it's a must-watch. There's hardly any downtime; it's almost all action and suspense, with just enough dialogue to keep things rolling. And it's got this unique vibe, you know? The director nailed it - it's like a fresh take on the whole action genre, especially for a film from 2015. It's like Marvel villain movies, but cranked up to the max.

Breathtaking - Mad at it's Max,"I have always loved the Mad Max franchise - and the risk is that an addition many years later could be a real flop. Not here. Fury Road is everything Mad max stands for and more - all laid upon a vast canvas with a ""rock operatic"" pulsing score. Don't get me wrong - if you don't like insatiable action - car chases and madness - they you will hate this film (My Girlfriend who has never seen a Max film didn't really think it was great). So be warned- if this is not your type of film - then the Fury Road experience will be hours of annoying sound and car crashes. For the fans of this genre - it reaches amazing new heights - with finally a director understanding that CGI is a tool that ""adds"" to the grandeur - does not replace it. Performances are solid from the entire case - and set production and makeup are just - well - Mad. If you are debating 3D or not-- I saw it in 3D and would say it adds very little -- I think IMAX would be the best experience as it is so ""vast"" as a film. If you don't have IMAX - then I would skip 3D and go to a good HD cinema with the best sound system.

I thought they didn't make action movies like this anymore...,"I am your atypical action movie fan, as I usually fall half asleep during chase scenes, since I really don't care for the usually accompanying shoddy shaky-cam camerawork plus I find cars and speeding utterly boring to begin with. For me, car chases are the low point of any action movie and half of the time, I am tempted fast-forward to the ""good parts"". Sounds like I'd be in for a most disappointing movie experience with this movie, since Fury Road is more or less a two hour car chase. Boy was I wrong. I can't recall when was the last time I was so enthralled with the relentless on-screen action. What I especially like about the movie, is that while battle fatigue is always a concern with heavier action movies and could easily set in even within a few minutes in lesser movies, but not this time, as George Miller manages to keep things constantly fresh, interesting and exciting throughout this relentless two hour chase. Not only that, but he also manages to rev up the engine ever so slightly throughout the movie, that even though the action already starts on high speed, it just keeps gathering more speed right until the very end. As for the the car chase, apparently most other action movies just don't know how to do a proper car chase but finally someone has done it right. While other movies have iconic action scenes, this movie is just one colossal action scene from start to finish.

And what scenes they are!The film starts with a long non stop action sequence that sets up the story through short flashbacks, weird baddies and an attempted escape by Max and a daring attempt to get away by Furiosa that leads to the main story brilliantly.The editing is superb, the colours vibrant when needed and beautifully blue and dark at other times which raises the atmosphere amazingly well.This is an action movie that's gorgeous at all times.The costume department must have had their greatest job ever designing the outfits which are over the top and so right for the theme of the film.This is an action packed modern classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The future belongs to the mad,"Taking the final act of The Road Warrior and stretching it out for an entire film was a stroke of mad genius by George Miller but Fury Road pays off in heeps. With more fire and brimstone, extravagantly deranged, ear-splittingly cacophonous, and entirely over-the-top; the definition of a wholly unapologetically action-packed film that mixes the old and the new. Although it's cold, violent and visceral you can also feel the underlying elements of hope, loyalty, reverence and redemption and it's one that Miller carries with exceptional prowess. With its wall-to-wall high-octane action, insane practical stunts and highly stylised production, everything about the film just works, from its highly decorated cast to its pulse-pounding (if overly repetitive) score and controlled chaos. It's an amazing, full-tilt assault on the senses and one of the most brilliant pieces of mayhem to ever hit the screen.

Definitely one of the best action flicks ever made,"Mad Max: Fury Road is, hands down, one of the best action movies I've ever seen. It doesn't take its own sweet time with exposition, with dialogue or with establishment, it's just raw action from start to finish. It takes viewers on what is literally a non-stop ride through the desert, racing all the way to the end.I haven't watched any other Mad Max movies, but there's no need to watch the other three before watching Fury Road; everything still makes sense. The story follows Max (Tom Hardy) as he finds himself helping a driver of a war rig, Furiosa (Charlize Thereon) and her cargo of five women make their way through the desert. But there's a mob of in upwards of fifty vehicles behind them, hunting them down, led by the sinister Imortan Joe.Action movies are often slowed down by exposition and dialogue, and it's here that Mad Max: Fury Road excels. It doesn't waste it's time on exposition, not one bit. What's Valhalla? Why do the half-childs need blood sacks? Mad Max doesn't waste its time trying to explain every little detail, and it doesn't need to; the viewers just accept the absurdity of what's going on, letting us focus on the action. And that's the thing; the absurdity of everything is just so genius. Why is there a man playing a guitar on a truck? Who cares, just enjoy the movie!And the movie doesn't waste its time on dialogue either. This review is already longer than all the words Max says in the movie combined. It's just plain genius; Max is just this raw action hero, and we don't need his wild backstory, with him talking every second. We get to just watch this movie without the normal incessant dialogue of an action flick.That's where this movie definitely cements itself as one of the best action movies of all time. Never before do I think I've seen a movie that just has such non-stop action from the start to the beginning. The film must have a grand total of three static scenes where the protagonists just talk with one another. Everything else is just raw action, unfolding so quickly. The trucks chasing the war rig down are always in the horizon, and we're reminded of it just enough to remember the imminent threat posed to Max, Furiosa and everyone on the war rig. The actual action itself is so good; there's just so much, and the combat methods of both the attackers and defenders is so unique.The thing with Mad Max: Fury Road, is that it'll probably be the most unique action film you ever see. Right from the get-go the director throws us headfirst into a dystopian world, forcing us to just accept this and let the movie unfolds. And that's fine. Who cares how absurd everything might seem? Just enjoy the action!Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing action movie. I recommend it to just about anyone, and especially to action die-hards. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
George Miller is back and his vision couldn't have been realized better. An action packed heart pounding film,"""As the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy. Me... Or everyone else.""To describe George Miller's fourth post-apocalyptic Mad Max film as crazy would be an understatement because it is one of those rare over the top and unique action films that keeps you at the edge of your seat during its entire runtime with fantastic car chases and inventive fighting scenes that feel like a breath of fresh air in an era dominated by CGI effects. The visuals absolutely stun you and Miller's amazing vision of this apocalyptic wasteland is beautifully captured through the camera. It may have taken 30 years for this sequel to be released, but it is a huge improvement over Beyond Thunderdome and it manages to build on what The Road Warrior had achieved by introducing a much more chaotic world and colorful characters. Fury Road works both ways as either a sequel or a reboot, and it erases most of the problems I had with Max's character in the previous film. This is a return to what Miller had done in The Road Warrior, but with a much higher budget to work with and that allowed his vision to be fully fulfilled here. Three more Mad Max films are already in the talks and I can't wait to embark with Max on his next adventures. This is going to be a very difficult film to top and so far it's the best 2015 has to offer.In Fury Road, Tom Hardy replaces Mel Gibson for the lead role of Max, a wondering warrior who's still coping with the loss of his wife and son as he travels through the post-apocalyptic deserted wasteland. The film begins with a group of bandits chasing Max who eventually capture him and take him to The Citadel, where a ruthless leader named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) controls the water supply for the masses that have gathered below the heights of the mountain where he is based. Joe doesn't just control the water supply, he also has a large army of War Boys who he has trained to sacrifice themselves willingly for his service, farming women who breed their breast milk, and even several beautiful wives to give him children. Joe has created quite an empire, and Max has been enslaved to serve as a blood donor for the injured War Boys. We are introduced to this crazy place and its rules as Joe sends his trusted lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) on a local errand with her fuel filled rig to Gasland. However, she decides to take another route and her intentions are soon revealed. She is helping some of Joe's wives escape from their enslavement promising to lead them to the green lands. When Joe discovers that she has betrayed him he sends all his boys out on a desperate chase and that includes Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of the War Boys who is using Max as his personal blood bag. Nux chains Max to the front of his vehicle and brings him along the desperate and nonstop chase that ensues. For the next two hours Fury Road is basically one extensive chase that will get the entire audiences' blood pumping.I've praised Miller's vision and his direction, as well as the spectacular action set pieces he has crafted, but it wouldn't do this film justice if the cast didn't receive its share of praise as well. It isn't easy to fill the shoes of such an iconic character like Mad Max, but Tom Hardy pulled it off in a very convincing matter. As much as I like Mel Gibson, I have to give Hardy a lot of praise for delivering such an entertaining performance. He is one of my favorite actors working today. It was also great to see Hugh Keays-Byrne back in a Mad Max film playing a different character this time, but he absolutely nailed the menacing role of Joe. Nicholas Hoult was also a pleasant surprise, but perhaps the greatest addition to this franchise was Charlize Theron's Furiosa who injects the film with a very much needed feminist tone. Theron delivers perhaps the strongest and most memorable role in the movie and she is one kick-ass action star. It helped that she got a lot of action scenes where she actually got to do something instead of being the damsel in distress. The look of the film is also breathtaking, and the way that Miller envisions this world is simply fantastic. The cool vehicles are built from all sorts of scrappy metals and materials you'd collect in the wasteland. Everything about this film is simply fantastic and the action scenes don't disappoint one bit. You will feel the rush from the very opening scene and it will continue long after the credits begin to roll. Fury Road is the best film of the franchise.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A steady-dose adrenaline I.V.,"When it comes to movies, I have many loves and few passions. Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those passions, and even though I anticipated the film I was still completely blown away.It didn't take long for me to become completely immersed by the film's atmosphere; in fact, you have little choice. With a world that is so striking and foreign, your only shot at escaping captivation is to walk out of the film.Both the cinematography and sound are staggering. They take things you are familiar and turn them into something very alien, and viewers are much likened to explorers. At points, I was beside myself with how amazing the costumes and props were done. This film is as close as I've come to culture shock without buying a plane ticket.The jump-cuts, while ample, are done well in a sense that they keep your brain for lingering too long on one shot and prevent you from predicting what exactly might happen next and when it will happen.The story, while simple and nothing new, does not lack substance. Miller chooses to drive home narrative using a camera and visuals instead of long-winded speeches and explicit anecdotes. Rather, MM:FR has the viewer considering even the smallest details of the plot and how they might have come to fruition.In short: there are few movies that left me as staggered and excited as this film did. If film is to be considered a pillar of entertainment and culture for society, this film is a foundation for those pillars. Its plot is nothing revolutionary, but it's simply some of the most fun I've had watching a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Am I missing something?,"When I think of a cinematic masterpiece, Mad Max: Fury Road is not the first thing that comes to mind.

I can't actually pick apart this movie and tell someone what was good about it, because I was honestly very bored throughout it. The movie is severely lacking in any substance, as it follows the stories of very 2D characters who drive around in the dust fighting pale metalheads. Aesthetically, sure, it had some value, but it wasn't enough to compensate for the repetitive action and dull story. Mind you, I'm not the type of person to get entertained by monster truck arenas, so perhaps that's a factor. Either way, I really don't see what all the fuss is about. It was a rather boring movie with boring characters and the action scenes might as well just be the same one played on a loop.

And after the film was done, they noticed that it desperately needed a good merchandise almost everybody knows and reveres for sales reasons.And so, they slapped the Mad Max label on it.And obviously forgot what Mad Max I and II were all about (III was already something done to capitalize on I and II plus Tina Turner, but still far better than this worst crash scenario).Okay, so there is no real discernible storyline. Or probably too many of them, I don't know since...see above, no clue. All the very good visuals can't overpaint the facts that the action scenes are drawn out too long, the characters having absolutely no depth with the exception of Nux (doesn't this alone tells a lot about the quality of ""Fury Road""?) and the actors themselves are playing their roles like being an autopilot on sedatives.Pro tip: If you have never seen any Mad Max movie, start with ""Fury Road"" and whatever you need to make you feel good. When you are sober again, continue with ""Beyond The Thunderdome"" (III, substances not necessarily needed).
And then enjoy Mad Max I and II.One star for the most innovative and impressive car stereo I have ever seen in my whole life.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
For all audiences that love action,"9/10. It's action packed and well balanced with a story. I've never seen a movie that has so greatly balanced the cliché of damsels in distress (while not making it cliché in a way) and also evening it out with a story where women rise from actual oppression. I think this is for any audience type and can be looked at in any view whether it be a feminist perspective of ""the rise against the patriarchy"" or just another save the society from this dystopian nightmare. I went into this absolutely hating the style, the stupid guitar guy and drum people, the whole world's look, character's actions, and the slower start introducing Max and all, but I ended up really admiring it. This movie also does a survival story (@gravity) in the middle of nowhere and doesn't ruin anything when it has not that much dialogue. With barely any talking between the group, you sense the bond the have with all their actions, facial expressions, and etc. It's great movie even though I still have problems with the lack of some dialogue and all the flashbacks, the villain who wasn't even powerful (maybe that's the point ey), and society but either way it's a stunning movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You wanna know the truth about this movie?,"I'm gonna keep it real witchu. This movie straight action from the first 5 minutes, it takes a break by the green place but it's actually just slow action, action never really stops.

A supernova experience well worth the watch.,"Some have left reviews about the movie been boring...not making sense...not realistic...no story line....blah blah. The movie isn't a drama, its a science fiction triller, it doesn't need a very important storyline, the plot is clear and precise. The characters are in a dystopian apocalyptic future. They don't really care about having a chat about the weather or the neighbours dog barking next door. The movie has amazing special effects, Charlize Theron is meticulous in her role here and Tom Hardy keeps his character in check throughout....quiet, hurt, cautious and not really wanting anything from anyone, only some form of change. The baddies are great- ruthless, heartless, senseless even the one that has a love for the guitar.What a Blast. This movie is refreshing, it's exciting and its damn right Brilliant.George Miller has achieved a platinum star here.The folks who gave this a 2 star or 4 star need to go back to period dramas. What does one expect from a movie in this genre?The directing, effects, acting and believe it or not, the storyline are excellent..... it could really happen to us in 100 or 200 years?Why cant Miller protray that, he's probably right!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Special and weird futuristic atmosphere created by cameraman John Seale who reflects splendidly the barren outdoors . According to this cameraman the cinematography would be as colorful as possible in order to differentiate the film from other post-apocalyptic movies, which typically have bleak de-saturated colors . Spectacular and impressive production design, the art direction is as beautiful as posible ; that's why the filmmaker Miller reasoned that people living in the post-apocalypse would try to find whatever scraps of beauty they could in their meager environment . Being shot in several locations such as Namib Desert, Namibia Cape Town Film Studios, Cape Town, South Africa , Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, Penrith, New South Wales, and Potts Hill, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia .The motion picture was stunningly directed by George Miller who subsequently announced he would sign on for ,three more Mad Max films as producer or director .

review,"Mad Max: Fury road - first of all it is wrong title. main leading role Charlize Theron as Furiosa that supposed movie be named by first leading role. Theron is impressive as always as. tom hardy as supporting main character Max is not impressive. his mediocre acting and lethargic entry do not contribute to total scene. i was expecting someone sharp in action like Jason statham or splendid actor in recent scene good as Ryan Gosling at all. by the way i don't like storyline too, but action is good and constant. nux played by Nicolas hoult British actor is most controversial character. first he was orthodox religion fanatic fascinated by immortal Joe and vikings too. he believed in Valhalla(Nordic paradise) and then he turned his life views by 180° and became a member of running party of furiosa. furiosa is most stupidest female name for leading female role. i don't heard name stupid like that not even in Spain or Mexico. furiosa??? villains do not look scary like in original mad max 1 or 2. only action is constant but storyline is not impressive. furiosa stealing pregnant and virgins, than escaping. she leading to gasoline city but she dragging another tank with 300 gallons of fuel? then leading left to enemy territory. and 50 vehicles cant stop one truck? why they didn't simple shoot to thires? in that case film wouldn't be attractive or interesting. that no longer i must admit i am not impressed and i was expecting much more. mad max 1 and 2 are much better movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Once In A Lifetime Experience,"What is there to say that has not already been said in praise of Mad Max FR? Just stepped out of the theater, & I am still blown away... The superb attention to detail, every single action shot was a ""moneyshot"". The sound was so superb that you could feel the vibrations & the explosions (watched it w/o 3D & it was still amazing). The trailers generally only show parts of the first act, & the surprises just kept coming. By the time it was over I was left standing there still absorbing it, realizing only once I left that it really didn't feel like a 2 hour movie, but one intense ride to the gates of Ragnarok... truly a once in a lifetime experience!

"Grow up watching The Road Warrior in the 80""s? Prepare to be disappointed.","This new movie has none of the grit, fierceness, or reality of the 80's version.This version of Max is 3rd best behind The Road Warrior and Mad Max. Beyond Thunderdome was a full disgrace to the franchise.The new movie is cool and full of action - but has ZERO character depth or development. I never cared if any characters including Max lived or died! I never felt tension or fear or anything but tired from watching endless explosions that have no effect on the story.I never thought I would say it- but, there was too much battle! You need to have the calm quiet lulls between heavy action to really appreciate who the characters are while they navigate the highs and lows of the story.Mad Max Fury Road = watered down reboot of original",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Just Incredible !!! Tom Hardy is the best MAX ever !!! Mr Miller a Genius !!,"Greetings...I just came back from watching Mad Max : Fury Road and i have to say I am exhilarated...It is such an awesome movie with such perfectly made action sequences..From the first scene we are made to sit on the edge of our seats ... this is one of the most well-paced movies you will ever watch.... Goes down straight to business. Directing from George Miller was a work of art..Other action directors should take note. The cast and production were sublime. Tom Hardy was superb...again in a movie where he was given limited script, he shined with his ability to act without having to speak too much. I assure you he will be one of the greatest actors if not the greatest by the end of his career..such a versatile actor..Now people say Furiosa was the main character in the movie..It probably was a little more of her story but i felt the 2 characters were equally important and given their fair share of time on the screen. I 100 PERCENT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE !!!! 10/10. Will watch it again soon .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Some kind of a miracle,"When I first came out of Fury Road, I wasn't sure what to think, nor did I know how the critics would respond to it. The critics spoke–and were nearly unanimous in their praise. But I knew I had to see it again for myself, to see if I would be swept up in the chorus of praise, or if, in sorrow, I would have to admit the film I had so longed to see, the film so many deemed a masterpiece, was in fact unworthy of its laurels.But you see those ten stars at the top. You know how this story ends.I'll say it now–Fury Road is the best film in at least 18 months, and the best summer blockbuster in five years. I delighted at George Miller's ""mastermind"" billing in the trailers, but it was absolutely justified. He draws on aspects of the original trilogy, from small touches (the little music box, for one) to primary themes–the damning social critique of Mad Max, the relentless brutality of The Road Warrior, and the post-apocalyptic grotesquerie of Beyond Thunderdome. Here, working with a budget far greater than the budgets of the originals combined, he has crafted a film which draws from and, in my opinion, exceeds them.He, and an incredibly talented team, have made a masterpiece.Cinematography, editing, score, makeup, production design...all of the highest order. Spot-on acting. Perfect direction. Two full hours and not a wasted moment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"pure cinema - about time, but worth the wait","What do I mean by saying that Mad Max: Fury Road, a heavy metal action movie about a group of women led by Imperator Furiosa (and that other guy, Max his name) trying to find safe haven away from the barbarians (especially a Darth Vader-style slave-master) of the post apocalyptic wastelands, by saying 'pure cinema'? It might be unfair to filmmakers who may just love to hear their characters talk. and dialog-driven films can be made cinematic in the right hands. But what I mean to say is that George Miller really would have been perfectly at home working during the silent era, when all you needed to show were images of things happening, frenetically with the occasional dialog, to get your point across. I've seen Fury Road twice in a week and I have to wonder if Miller really wanted to be Buster Keaton or Abel Gance when he was going to the movies. Not to say westerns don't figure plenty in the framework - they have since the original film, and certainly the Road Warrior is nothing without the Cowboys vs Indians aesthetic.But Miller eschews a ton of exposition at the start and puts the characters right into the thick of the story: Furiosa goes to get the gasoline for Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, formerly Toecutter oddly enough in Mad Max 1) and goes her own path - she wants to get to the Green Place with ladies that are ""property"" of Joes, and she will stop at nothing to get there. Max is along for the ride, one of those great, wild visual touches has him strapped to the front of a vehicle with a grated mask over his face - and is once again the reluctant hero for this journey.We find out all of this along the way really, which shows how economical Miller is in his storytelling. He doesn't waste any time, and all that matters is keeping this bad motherf**** of a movie on a roll. The first major action sequence, a chase of the war parties against Furiosa, would be the climax of any other film. For Miller, it's just the start, and even when character try to take a rest (certainly in the first half) there's still tension and suspense going on. And when I mean by pure cinema, take the moment where Max first confronts Furiosa and the women by the truck. He has a gun on them, we know it's loaded from an incident we just saw, but they don't, so there's a level of tension for them but not so much for us. Then the gun gets wrestled away, a fight ensues (a manic fight, but cut beautifully), and yet the chase is still technically underway with the vehicles off in the distance.Very little of that, and other scenes in the film, need any dialog, though characters do still speak (Max, going back to the Road Warrior, was Miller's Man With No Name, the Ronin, the dude who says little but is a big man of action). When characters do talk, there is humanity given, even some dark humor (Nicholas Hoult's character is a good example of that). But what's so mesmerizing and awesome about Fury Road is Miller pushing the envelope even further and, in a way, correcting some things that he went with in Beyond Thunderdome.The movie is bleak but not hopeless for the characters, and there's barely a moment where the stakes aren't super high. Even a moment that is relatively calm like, yes, trying to pull the tanker out muddy sand with another vehicle a ways behind firing a machine gun this way and that (the driver's got blood in his eyes, woops), is kinetic and sensational.And throughout we see two things here that are refreshing: a style of direction and editing where you can always tell what's going on, which vehicle is in relation to the others even/especially during these bug-f*** crazy chases, and this seems to be a welcome thing during an era where action movies are cut too fast and shot too close. Miller has a method of controlled mayhem and fiasco, and so it's a film with about 3,000+ shots and barely a one is wasted. The other one is Charlize Theron. It's really her story - kind of like Eli Wallach in Good/Bad/Ugly, with Max as Clint Eastwood - and her performance is rough, powerful, sometimes stoic but also sometimes incredibly emotional, and she's not afraid in the slightest to show vulnerability just as much as the courage and bad-ass-ery. It's one of those woman action heroes and performances that'll be up there with the greats.Miller started in Ozsploitation with the first movie, and as the Maxs have gotten bigger in size and budget he hasn't lost the spirit of making things madcap, from the gnarled vehicles and character designs to a man who plays guitar that shoots out flames while on top of a rig (and drummers on the back). Why does this guy keep doing this? Well... he loves it, that's why! If you can dig the idea of seeing that, then you should dig seeing the whole thing: it delivers compelling heroes, nasty villains, an unforgiving landscape, and details that'll make you want to come back to see what you missed.At 2 hours it almost feels like 'that's it'? And last but not least, Hardy is a fine new Max, making his own of the role that previously got Mel Gibson his career kick-started. He may not have the same level of charisma as Gibson perhaps, but the devilish fun and cunning is still there, the wild gunslinger who will kill you if he has to but would (deep down) rather not, is there in Hardy, and I can't wait to see more of what he does with the role in future films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Apocalyptic Masterpiece!,"This movie is basically like Water World meets Twisted Metal, only on dry land, and more Artistically done, without an overly elaborate plot.This movie is very Primitive, Gritty and Real and gets to the point. Yet it does so without selling on Excessive Gore or other typical sell-out ploys. There's not a lot of character development or very ""forgiving"" moments, yet it still shows just a hint of compassion on the surface on occasion. Deaths are very UNpredictable, and countless people dying. The photography was amazing, fight scenes are done old-school, meaning they don't take 6 different camera angles to show a 2-second punch scene. It's done in longer takes, so it's easy to follow with the eyes. Yet some some scenes move really fast, like it's simulating the effects of adrenaline or drug induced viewpoints. The film style was unique, kinda like a quentin Tarantino movie, yet not nearly the same, very artistic, yet raw. The music is also like an orchestra going along with the movie the whole time adds to the drama.The custom vehicles in this movie are flat-out IMPRESSIVE, I guarantee you, they must have dumped some Serious cash to build them, tons of fabrication, not 3d effects or ""prop magic""...these cars look like the Real Deal.

Miller has made an art piece with this film.,"George Miller successfully manages to portray destruction and a vast wasteland in such a way as to make it appear artistically beautiful.He takes the absurdity and destructiveness of mankind's post-apocalyptic behaviour, and depicts in a way that keeps not only your attention, but also keeps you on the edge of your seat.Although there is a minimal use of dialogue in this two hour extravanganza, this helps to add to the film as opposed to leaving essential elements out of it. The lack of dialogue has been utilized as a tool to build up to colossal chase scenes with dangling men, massive explosions and crazy stunts.Due to its stark nature, there is a strange beauty in the entire film, and with the few beautiful women in the film each time they make an appearance they stand out like an oasis in the desert.This movie has promise to have a sequel, however - and this makes it unique in many of today's blockbusters - this movie doesn't lead intentionally into a sequel, and works brilliantly as a stand alone film.It is hard to say that this film has anything wrong with it.

Less is sometimes more Mr. Miller,"In a postapocalyptic world where everyone lives in a barren dessert, the powerful tyrant Immortan Joe controls the people with an iron fist. Of course, as we've seen multiple times in history, repression leads to rebellion.Mad Max: Fury Road is super ambitious in its cinematography. Brave editing at a pace I personally haven't seen elsewhere. The pacing of the plot is also kept at a high tempo - requiring the full attention of the viewer. (Which I absolutely love to see in a time, where most films count audiences for nothing by stuffing every detail down their throats). The directing holds for a lot of beautiful shots; mostly done in battle and by CGI, which therefore loses some of its grace.Musically, the film does a good job - both in terms of the rock music and the composed music.And then to the films biggest strength and weakness: Action. It probably has got the most action you're ever going to witness in a single film. Jesus. Some people praise the movie for this. Personally, I think it comes with a heavy price. Action is great, but not at the expense of core storytelling; which undeniably happens in Mad Max.Character development is as well nonexistent. Solely reading the script must feel like some of the laziest writing out there. The acting performances are legit being decimated to pieces with this writing - I've got nothing against the individual actors/actresses, but Tom Hardy seriously had nothing besides grunts to work with.Ultimately, the lack of these basal filmic values, easily overshadows the pros.Still though, the film earns a 6/10 because of a good score, beautiful still images and brave cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A hell of a return for director George Miller...Mad Max is reborn.,"When I was young, I was introduced to the Australian cult classic film Mad Max (1979) by my Dad. Ever since then, Mad Max has always been very special to the both of us. It has been 30 years since the last entry in the Mad Max franchise which was Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985) which in my opinion, was my least favorite Mad Max film.To see the next Mad Max entry on the big screen for the first time with Mad Max: Fury Road, it means so much to me that this film is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life. From the spectacular action to the eye-popping scenery. From the well thought characters to the well written script. Everything in this film I believe worked so masterfully by Writer/Director George Miller. Without his visionary, This film would've been as epic if handled by another director.Apart from the amazing practical action effects aside, there are also many themes and meanings in this film when analyzed closely. To me, this is more than just an action film. it is a Masterpiece achievement in Australian film-making and will be referred as a cult classic for the many years to come.This is George Miller's franchise. And he has brought it back to life. My favorite movie so far in 2015, one of my favorite action movies of all time and without a doubt is phenomenally, one of my favorite movies of all time.

They made the action sequences with a finesse, and connected you to all characters during the whole film, even during massive fight scenes. Tom Hardy was brilliant as always, I did not think that he would be able to pull off this type of movie, but as he has proved in past movies, he can!

unrelenting action,"Max (Tom Hardy) is haunted by his past failures to save the innocent. He is captured by Immortan Joe and his men.

Instead, she has freed Immortan Joe's imprisoned wives and escaping back to her former home, the Green Place. Max is chained as a blood bag on the front of his car with War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult).The action is unrelenting. The car stunts are amazing and fully worthy of the Mad Max name. It is pure energy on screen. The only thing missing is a gyrocopter and Mel Gibson. Tom Hardy is physically acceptable as Mad Max although I'm not thrilled with the character. He's lost a bit of the spark. The spark he lost has been transferred to Furiosa and has lit a blazing inferno. She is more Mad Max than Mad Max. I am also pleasantly surprised that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is actually good in this movie. The action, the outrageous vehicles and the pure energy make this something unlike anything else.

Buckle Up For The Most Intense Film This Year!!!,"Max has been captured and is being used as a human blood-bag when he is dragged along into a desert chase, to recapture women on the run with the one armed Furiosa.I, like many, was blown away by the trailer of Mad Max: Fury Road. The chaotic zen of action symphony was something I made sure I wasn't going to miss when it hit theatres. Tom Hardy fills the role of Max, originally played by Mel Gibson. We get very little in terms of story and character development from him. The little we do get is in glimpses of a flashback that seems to haunt him. Someone or some people, he couldn't save from the horrors of this post- apocalyptic landscape. Despite the film barring his name for the title, it seems that Charlize Theron's Furiosa is more of a lead here. The one armed soldier has just as much, if not more screen time than Hardy. This is Theron's film, no doubt and she steals the show from Hardy.Rounding out the rest of the cast is Nicholas Hoult, AKA Beast from the recent X-Men films, as one sick puppy determined to serve the antagonist till the day he dies. He's the demented one using Max as a blood-bag. He serves Immortan Joe, played by original Mad MAx baddie Hugh Keays-Byrne. He's a twisted villain who looks the part. Everyone looks the part, that's where this film excels at. The costume and make-up design for this film is astounding. I hope it receives some sort of recognition come awards season time.Where else does this film excel at? Why the action of course. The choreography in this film is astounding. Miller has raised the bar here. I never once lost my place in the action. Miller always had something new up his sleeve and just when our heroes felt that they dealt with something, here comes something new. This two hour car chase was never dull, never repetitive and always on-point. I had a big goofy smile on my face the entire time. Right from the chaotic beginning to the climatic end. That's what I loved about this film, it doesn't take time to explain things to you with exposition. It immediately plunges you down into their world and dares you to keep up with it.Mad Max is bold, thrilling, exciting, chaotic and so much damn fun. People want to complain about zero characterization. I beg to differ. The film gave just enough characterization for me to care. A lot of this film is ambiguous. Why things are the way they are, who people are and their intentions. I like it that way. The film is all about being in the moment.

I watch Mad Max 1 & 2 on a fairly regular basis and I will be honest, i wasn't sure that George Miller could still deliver a movie worthy of Max. Not only did he deliver a movie that was worthy of Max, he delivered a movie that was so far beyond my expectations for this movie. Fury Road has to be one of the best action movies I have ever seen, the action sequences are just phenomenal and amazing in the fact that most of it was real and not CGI. The cars and characters are just amazing and as insane as they should be in the post apocalyptic world of Max and the scenery is both beautiful and cruel. Tom Hardy was a good choice as Max, Charlize Theron was amazing as Furiosa but for me the standout performance was from Nicholas Hoult as Nux. Mad Max Fury Road is a must see movie, a must see in a cinema movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Action Movie since... I don't know,"BeforeI came to the cinema for this film, I'd had very high expectation and enthusiasm about this movie. I love the old franchise, I had a doubt this film could match the greatness and the tension of old franchise But when I saw the trailer, my old opinion definitely would be wrong, but I was afraid because usually when I have high expectation before I watch a movie, it'd be disappointed. But this movie is an exception, this movie's really exceed my expectation, I mean, It was a superb! Fury road definitely the best movie of the franchise and maybe the best action movie! it's the best cinematic experience I've seen since gravity. The visual effect, cinematography, sound, score and the design was incredible, maybe this movie can get some Oscar recognition for the effect. all the performance was very good to, but charlize theron's performance is the one who should get our thumbs! I'll be mad if charlize doesn't get an Oscar performance next year!(Although Oscar's never really about this kind of movie And george miller, what kind of human is he? How could a director made that amazing movie?!very recommended for all people in the world who still live!

Mad Max: Fury road _(2015)_ Movie Review,"Imagine a great adventure thriller story told using Salvador Dali paintings for each frame, with background music by Beethoven if he was a Rockstar. Imagine a unique action scene that's so well shot, it looks animated, but you know there's barely any CGI used. Imagine a movie that doesn't need dialogue to drop atomic bombs of emotion you, and doesn't do fast cuts to thrill you, widen your eyes, and make your blood pump faster for a fight sequence.That imaginary movie doesn't hold a candle light to George Miller's Fury Road. This film is far more crazy colorful than a dream. This film is far better than any other action movie in this generation.Tom Hardy plays the new Mad Max, a character that had been shelved in George Miller's head for thirty years. Max is reduced to a single instinct as he so simply puts it himself in the opening monologue. Survival, not only from the crazy weirdos who are trying to kill him, but also from his own mind, which is haunted by his past. All those who he couldn't save. Max's path of survival, crosses with Imperator Furiosa. A Kickass woman who is looking to get her friends to a safe place, which happens to be where she grew up in before she was taken away. They share a crazy, awesome and surprisingly mad-max-fury-road-tom-hardy-george-miller-600x421emotional road to their goals. Which as different as they are, have plenty sparkles of similarities.Every character, small or big, has motivations, seclusions, and destination. The characters are so well presented, that they seem real, in the insane world of Mad Max.This is also one of the best looking movies I have seen. It's not just the color and the background and the light, although they are stunningly crucial! It's the non stop camera movement that manages to find its direction in a mind blowing way through each shot. The camera movements are not unnecessary too as they are in many of the other Hollywood ""Thrill rides!"" It can represent vulgarisms, change in situations and change in character's relations. The great thing; is that considering all the art, this is still one of the most action packed movies I have ever seen. Every scene is a climactic one. All of them wow you with their awesome thrilling fights, chases, explosions and the many more crazy stuff that you'll only see in a Mad Max movie. This film doesn't sleep. A beautiful looking non stopFURY ROAD volcanic eruption of spectacular action. George Miller certainly knows how to get the most he possibly can out of each frame. Your background tells a story, and the foreground moves the story foreword. This is an amazing visual fiesta for the eyes.There's something very special about the feeling that swallows you whole while you're drowned in a great world created by an artist who knows how to make a great piece that will disconnect you from the earth that you're on. After all, that's all cinema is about.Oh what a Kickass masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What A Lovely Day!,"This is one amazing action film from start to finish, not only are the characters and the world interesting, the film is filled with shear craziness!

The stunt work is also top notch!The film also makes you feel emotion for the characters as well, which is such a rare feat in action films of recent years.I literally can think of very little to disregard this film except for the basic story, which you won't even be bothered by during this thrill ride of a film.George Miller has managed to craft his amazing world 30 years later with spectacular results.It's gritty, gruesome and above all glorious9/10 A must see film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This movie is so jam packed with action that there was no chance to calm myself down between scenes.The storyline was fantastic, the action scenes were the best I have seen in a very long time. If there was CGI used (which I am sure there was) it was pretty much seamless. This is the kind of movie I want to see more of.Charlize was hypnotic to watch, so so well done. Tom did a great job considering when you think Mad Max you of course think of Mel Gibson. The bad guys were menacing and the vehicles used in the film were frightening but so well done the people who put them together should be extremely proud.It's not often you can walk away from a movie and still have exhaustive thoughts about it hours later but this one, you just can't get out of your mind!

"Fast-paced, action-packed beautifully atmospheric lackluster story","The movie is good, but I think it suffers from a couple of major problems.One problem is that the main character is too weak. If there is anyone taking the lead, it is definitely Charlize Theron. Mad Max is completely shadowed by other characters, even secondary ones.Another problem is the action is dull and repetitive, doing very little to carry the action forward. This is also the case in Fast and Furious, but in this case this is explicit and it is what the audience is expecting. The content of this Mad Max movie (including action that actually moves the story forward) would probably take no more than 30 min. All the rest is ""just"" show (though a beautiful one!).The design and scenography are brilliant, no question about it. But I think that for example the design in Zack Snyder's 300 is more coherent and a better contribution to the overall experience. The story in 300 is clearer and simpler, and every element and action scene makes it move forward in a clear way. This is not the case here. Characters in this Mad Max are empty shells, simple stereotypes with little content, mere puppets in a grandiose artsy atmosphere, with no inner life.Most of the action is completely reactive, with the characters in pure survival mode very rarely demonstrating anything of their inner self and their back story. I am all for not being spoon fed the back story, and against ""talking heads"" describing their background in lengthy dialogs. But this movie suffers from the opposite problem. Only very rarely did Mad Max suffered from flashes (quite literally) from his previous life, but it felt really completely out of touch with anything.In the end, I didn't regret watching the movie (specially in the cinema), but it really felt a bit short. At home, I don't think I would recommend, unless you watch in a very large TV.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Perfectly Intense from start to finish. A must see!,"What the comic book movie franchises would do to have Max in their shallow repertoire of repetitive story lines and awful acting!Right from the start this piece of movie magic hits you hard and fast and never stops. It is relentlessly breathtaking from the very moment the tail disappears down Max's throat.The chase, pace and action make anything Fast and Furious have to offer feel positively slow and tedious (which they are anyway).The characters' personalities doff their hats to the original, Hardy and Theron as dual leads are brilliant, as are the supporting cast. The acting style and visual feel leans towards Mad Max 2. Let's face it, Immortan Joe and his warriors are like Lord Humungus and his band of road warriors wannabes, pure and simple. But that's a good thing because Lord Humungus and his followers were a truly great moment in movie evil.The 15 certificate for the UK is a joke, my 12 year old daughter (who was looking forward to this after seeing the trailer a dozen times) loved it start to finish. It most definitely is not gory, this movie uses The Evil Deads' style perfectly. Explosions, crashes, collisions, and violence are creatively, subtlety, but sufficiently over the top so as to not have movie goers becoming irked and repulsed by non-stop blood and guts. But fear not because a big chase and large cast make for plenty of ouchies!With one follow on (at least) to come, the thing that makes this movie stands out is its' use of ""practical"" effects instead of rubbishy CGI and post production visual effects. There might be a big lesson for the movie industry to learn here! Have we moved too far in recent years from the real art of movie making? Definitely a yes when you see a plethora of unimaginative superhero drudgery and computerized dross being pumped out to a mass audience who are being force-fed CGI because their Nintendos and Playstations have long since lost their thrill.10/10 I cannot fault this movie at all.

What an action movie,"I've never believed that an action movie would be one of the best movies I have ever seen. In my opinion it is very challenging for a creator to make an 2 hours road fight movie into one of the greatest films of all time. Consider that the dialogs are less than the half of the whole screenplay.Plus I find it a genuine idea that, the creators tried to focus everything that happens on the film in the center of the screen, so the viewers won't leave the theaters with a headache!What an extraordinary actor is Tom Hardy. I have seen lots of his films, thought I'm always impressed because of his talent! He wore a mask and gave all of his emotions with his eyes!

Fury Road is an extravaganza non-stop action fuel injection.,"Oh what a day! What a lovely day! I am a Mad Max fan, having seen the three mad Max films at age of eleven. I adored the films in all their weird and action-packed glory and they have only gotten better with age. George Miller was very clever in not doing the ""reboot"" a remake of Mad Max, revealing how Max Rockantasky became The Road Warrior, George Miller decided that the reboot will take place in the post- apocalyptic Australia, years after the new Max lost his family, because he did not wish to do a remake or retell the story that had already been told and had wanted to update the universe and the wasteland and wanted new movie goers to remember Max as a man with nothing to lose after losing his family. I see Fury Road as a pseudo sequel to Road Warrior and it has the quality of such. Over 80% of the effects seen in the film are real practical effects, stunts, make-up and sets, the action and production design is easily among the top. Using that visual frame of reference, Miller is able to use the action, not just to have cool moments and move the story forward, but also add to the great character work done within the action scenes. The characters are defined, informed and developed by the actions that they take without having the need to announce what they learn or spell out how they feel to the audience. It's all in what Miller is able to capture on camera with the help of cinematographer, John Seale, delivering Oscar-calibre work. People is calling the film ""Mad Maxine: Femmy Road"" (aka feminist utterly trash) That is a load of rubbish. Charlize Theron is perfect as Furiosa. Mad Max always had powerful females: In Mad Max we have an old women holds up an entire gang with a shotgun, in Road Warrior the warrior woman stabbing blocks and killing them all day long and in Beyond Thunderdome Tina Turner took control of an entire town and created the thunder dome. Get familiar with the old movies before freaking out about the new one. I dislike Tom Hardy but his excellent as Max. Hugh Keays-Byrne (Toecutter in Mad Max) as Immortan Joe is perfect. He was brilliant. His voice was extremely menacing, and was portrayed as godlike. What I mean by that is he is worshipped by all as a God. What made him even more menacing is that if he caught up to Max only your imagination could describe what he would of done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Without a doubt the franchise's best work thus far.,"Without a doubt the franchise's best work thus far.'Mad Max: Fury Road' starts off perfectly good, though the movie properly clicks into gear when the characters of Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron join forces.

The action remains super effective and visually epic, the stunt work really is fantastic.Hardy and Theron put in convincing showings, definitely an improvement on anything from the original trilogy in terms of the acting talent; no disrespect to those from the first three, it's just a noticeable upgrade for me. With all that noted, I still don't think the characters in these films are as strong as they could/should be (but still good) - and that's what probably stops me from utterly loving this.A prequel with Anya Taylor-Joy portraying Charlize Theron's character sounds great on paper, so I'm very much up for checking out 'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga' at some point soon!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What I got was a 3D rehash of bits of the earlier movies. Yes there are lots of car chase/war rig bashing and crashing, and yes there are explosions and mayhem, but there are no new plot twists to speak of and most of the characters are stereotypes or caricatures.If you haven't watched the earlier movies then this is a fun, action packed 'good guys beat the system' story.If you saw the 'originals' splice a random 2 hours of carnage together and throw in 2 or 3 pretty girls not wearing much and you get Fury Road.Overall a disappointing reboot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Visually amazing but lacking depth,"George Miller did a great job setting up this spectacular world with the desert landscape, the post apocalyptic war vehicles and the characters that all seem so unique. The shots are great, the battle scenes quite intense and the special effects will blow your mind! Fury Road's depiction of the world is visually beautiful, bright and so special that can be surely characterized as pure art.However Fury Road shouldn't be just that. It's not all about the action scenes and the special effects. All this tense failed to pass to a psychological level. Fury Road could pass a great range of messages but not even tried. The movie shows a post-apocalyptic world where the earth has been utterly destroyed and people have gone mad killing each other for water and fuel throughout a vast wasteland. And all this madness, all this vanity, pain and wretchedness fail to touch you and the acting alone couldn't just do the job. Despite the fact that acting was overly good, especially Charlize Theron is great as Furiosa, lacked emotion. Tom Hardy's dark past didn't seem to affect him as he remained neutral and cold throughout the whole movie. His reactions didn't correspond to the shocking images he kept seeing about the people he failed to save.In conclusion, Fury Road is an exhilarating action movie with extraordinary artistic cinematography lacking depth. But in a movie like that, depth is what can make it special.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Raging Fury,"""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" directed by visionary filmmaker George Miller, is a relentless, adrenaline-fueled masterpiece that redefines the post-apocalyptic action genre. Set in a dystopian wasteland where humanity teeters on the brink of extinction, the film follows the enigmatic loner Max Rockatansky, portrayed with rugged intensity by Tom Hardy, and the fierce warrior Imperator Furiosa, played with fierce determination by Charlize Theron, as they embark on a high-octane journey of survival and redemption.From the moment the film explodes onto the screen, it's clear that Miller is operating on a whole new level of cinematic mastery. The action sequences are nothing short of jaw-dropping, with breathtaking practical effects, stunning choreography, and pulse-pounding vehicular mayhem that leaves audiences gasping for breath. Miller's direction is kinetic and immersive, plunging viewers headfirst into a world of chaos and carnage that feels both exhilarating and terrifyingly real.But ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is more than just a non-stop thrill ride; it's a symphony of visual storytelling that transcends the boundaries of its genre. Miller's world-building is nothing short of breathtaking, with every frame bursting with intricate detail and imaginative design. From the grotesque warlords and their monstrous henchmen to the awe-inspiring vehicles that roar across the desert sands, every element of the film's production design serves to immerse viewers in its nightmarish vision of a world gone mad.At its core, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a tale of redemption and defiance in the face of overwhelming odds. Hardy and Theron deliver powerhouse performances that anchor the film amidst its chaotic spectacle, imbuing their characters with depth, nuance, and a fierce sense of humanity. Their chemistry crackles with tension and mutual respect, driving the film forward with an emotional intensity that is as gripping as it is electrifying.In conclusion, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a triumph of action cinema, a tour de force of visual storytelling that raises the bar for the entire genre. With its breathtaking action sequences, stunning visuals, and powerful performances, it's a film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible. A modern classic that will leave you breathless and exhilarated long after the credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Oh it's such a lovely day! I'm glad I spent it with Max!!,"I am honestly not that generous with my 10/10 ratings, I assure you, and yet this is the third film (out of four) in the ""Mad Max"" franchise that I awarded with a well-deserved 10/10 rating! Next to the low-budgeted but tense and progressive 1979 original and the phenomenal 1981 ""The Road Warrior"", ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the third bona fide & unhinged masterpiece in the series. Only ""Mad Max beyond Thunderdome"" I rated a little bit lower, due to a weaker second half, but even that one was highly enjoyable. All this makes ""Mad Max"" one of the greatest – perhaps even THE greatest – movie franchises in history. It doesn't matter that this fourth installment only reaches us nearly three decades after the others, and it doesn't even matter that a new lead actor depicts the legendary titular character George Miller's dystopian post- apocalyptic world perspective is still 100% perplexing, adrenalin- rushing and mind-blowing! From start to finish, ""Fury Road"" is a high-octane (pun intended) Sci-Fi/thriller adventure with nightmarish characters, dazzling stunt work, incredibly insane plot situations and – guaranteed – the most grotesquely imaginative set designs (vehicles, base camps, death traps) ever created. And you know what is the best part of this all? Almost everything in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is real! By that I mean real stunt work with manually manufactured vehicles that are driven by real tough guys – and gals – in authentic desert locations, instead of computer engineered effects or cast members stupidly miming in front green screens. Lone drifter Max Rockatansky roams around in an uncivilized wasteland, regularly haunted by hallucinations featuring the restless spirits of his deceased wife and child, and gets captured by the minions of the tyrannical self-declared demigod Immortan Joe. This creepy dictator is about to be double-crossed by the rough gal Furiosa, who secretly hid Immortan Joe's beautiful ""breeding"" girls in her massive fuel truck and plans to take them to the green oasis where she was born. Joe sends his War Boys after them, an army of sickly albino freaks that practically orgasm whenever Immortan Joe even looks at them. The most ambitious War Boy is Nux and he chases Furiosa with Max attached to him as a living blood bag! There are many sub plots, twists, turns and bizarre escalations, but they are all worth discovering. The most fantastic thing about ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" are the downright marvelous vehicle-designs. I swear, the people who thought up and created the cars and trucks for this film are real geniuses for sure! There are trucks with the coachwork of Volkswagen Beetles, Monster trucks with old Mercedes coachwork processed into them, pick-ups with caterpillars, sand buggies covered with metal spikes and many, many more. Perhaps the craziest gimmick of them all is a War Boy with a rock guitar that is attached to a truck, and his only reason of existence is to incite the rest of the troops. The almighty George Miller also penned down some of the most nightmarish yet intriguing supportive characters, like Corpus Colossus (the deformed midget son of Immortan Joe), The People Eater (a creep that constantly rubs his own nibbles) and The Bullet Farmer. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is cinema in its purest form. See it! And don't just wait for the DVD or for the film to appear on Netflix or whatever. This is a film you have to experience at the cinema, on a gigantic screen with the best possible sound effects. Sheer brilliance",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A movie Shiny and Chrome,"Now that 3D is becoming somewhat passé, I know some cinemas have been experimenting with 4D effects: moving seats, smells, effects, etc. Mad Max: Fury Road would be an excellent demo film for this. But they would need to spray so many gallons of gasoline, water, blood, amniotic fluid, etc at the audience it would never be cost effective!Max Mad: Fury Road is the fourth in the Mad Max series, but you don't need to have watched any of the others to enjoy this one.The world is in a state of post-nuclear apocalypse and ex-cop Max Rocktansky (Tom Hardy) is haunted by the faces of his nearest and dearest that he couldn't save. Captured by baron leader Imortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), Max is dragooned to be an unwilling blood donor to sick young warrior and zealot Nux (Nicholas Hoult, several light years away from Marcus in ""About a Boy""). Showing no regard for transfusion hygiene, Max is strapped – still ""leaking"" – to the bowsprit of Nux's war vehicle as he pursues a death-wish in honour of his glorious leader. His mission is to help bring back Imortan's harem of beauties, rescued by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and now haring down the titular highway in a fuel tanker in search of the ""Green Place""; a location across the Australian desert that has special meaning for her.Thus is set up a road-chase of epic proportions which will result in much loss of blood (not to say a driving licence ban if any cops caught them!).It's difficult to describe in a review just what an adrenaline-fuelled and maniacal film this is. It starts at a breathless pace and you think ""OK – so far – so Michael Bay"". It's when Max catches up with the bevy of beauties and Furiosa (who seems 'armless enough, arf) and a thrilling and frantic cat/dog fight ensues for control of the tanker that you realise you have stepped into something of an entirely different class. Another reviewer aptly described it by saying that it ""begins at an eleven and finishes at a number not yet reached by mankind""! As Imortan's convoy of pursuing maniacs arrive, adding new and literal meaning to the phrase 'lead guitarist', all hell then breaks lose. Many of the stunts in the ensuing mayhem look to be very much 'real world', much to the film's credit: whilst there is undoubtedly some CGI in play, it is very understated and subtle.I was pleased to have predicted in my review of last year's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" just how many of the Oscar's art categories that film would appear in, and I will similarly pin my early Oscar nomination colours to the mast on this film as follows:Film Editing (Margaret Sixel): for maintaining an outstandingly breathless pace throughout;Best Sound Editing/Mixing (Mark A. Mangini is supervising sound editor): an extraordinary mix of quiet and deafening and with some gloriously subtle effects. For example, when an explosion goes off next to Nux's head you briefly hear his ringing ears;Cinematography (industry veteran John Seale (""The English Patient"")): at times this film reminded me strongly of ""Life of Pi"" in its imagery and beauty. There are pictures that stay with you long after the film has ended: an alien marshland with deformed humans on stilts; Furiosa kneeling in the desert and screaming to the skies; and gorgeous long shots of the Australian desert and the pursuing vehicles.Above all this is George Miller's masterpiece. Here is a director demonstrating real chutzpah. A director with the confidence to deafen and then – like Hitchcock often did – cut to total silence. A director not afraid to fade to black, setting the expectation for an awe-inspiring cinematographic reveal to start the next scene (which he normally delivers on). A director marshalling an army of film professionals to deliver a real treat.It's not perfect: some of the frenetic editing could have been toned back a tad to allow the viewer to work out what is happening; a significant proportion of the dialogue is either gibberish or inaudible or both; and some of the bumps and scrapes (particularly those of Nux) seem unsurvivable – let alone coming out of without as much as a ""hurty elbow"".But whilst this film is perhaps not for the 'Marigold Hotel crowd', I'd defy those with a love of cinema and/or ""Top Gear"" not to revel in the glorious chaos of this film. As Nux would say, it is very ""Shiny and Chrome"".(If you enjoyed this review please see the graphical version - with comedy captions! - at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future reviews.

"Dante's Inferno, Distilled and Spiked with Cocaine","After a few deceptively fluffy and kid-friendly outings, George Miller returns to the Mad Max universe, 30 years after Mel Gibson turned in the keys to the tune of Tina Turner's ""We Don't Need Another Hero"". The question on everyone's mind before the first trailer unleashed an internet frenzy was, in this age of needless reboots, has Miller sold out or has he used this opportunity to finally realize his full vision for the famous saga?By now you will know that the latter is true, but you might not appreciate to what extent, and how little this implies that you are guaranteed to actually like the result. Miller hasn't just provided an update of Mad Max, or even a reboot. In fact this plays like just another episode in the wild life of his antihero, relegating back- story or origins to one or two short opening lines and brief flashes of past violence. It's also much more than a modernized take: it is early 21st century filmmaking taken to its furthest possible extreme.Since most blockbusters today are at least partially bathed in Michael Bay's patented orange/teal palette, Fury Road pushes that beyond its aesthetic limits, to quasi-fluorescent territory, creating the impression of a very violent Tex Avery cartoon, or at least one viewed while doing some serious drugs. Plot-wise, it doesn't get any more streamlined than this, or economical, and what you're left with is a hellish landscape populated by astonishingly inventive grotesques, conflicted heroes (our protagonist Max is arguably not THE hero of his own film) and a sustained action sequence.If this sounds like something you wouldn't enjoy, don't waste your time. If the trailer had you hyperventilating though, what awaits is pure nirvana. The action - most of it the result of practical effects and stunts - sets an unprecedented standard, as does the level of perverse originality in the baddies' physical and moral decrepitude: even in the hallowed company of other Mad Max entries, these are some weird freaks. Finally, the lead duo is pitch-perfect. Most of the attention has fallen on Charlize Theron's fearless Furiosa, but special mention should go to a very subdued Hardy, who beautifully anchors the film and gives it an almost calm, simmering center. Whether grumbling at sights of his stolen gear or fighting for his life in one of the meanest brawls in cinematic history, he makes us believe in this twisted universe, and feel the pain.This is a journey through hell, Dante's inferno without the sanctimoniousness: distilled to its essence and spiked with cocaine. A wilder ride you will not find this year, perhaps even this decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

If this is what passes for a good movie nowadays, cinema is dead! The cinematography is horrendous. The CGI is often unbearable crap, spastic, nauseating camera work. The acting is awful. The audio even sounds like the worst pop artist you've ever heard ran through Pro Tools. This is exactly why people don't pay money for artwork these days. If I would have paid money to see this I assure you I would have demanded it back!

"Over the top insanity, mayhem, and violence... and that's just OK","There's always been something a bit... quirky... about George Miller's film making sensibilities. Call it ""Australian"" if you will or perhaps it's just a comic book feel but from my admittedly American perspective, all the ""Mad Max"" series felt a bit different than the traditional uber-violent, slick high-action popcorn flicks. The ""Die Hards,"" ""Terminators,"" and so on.This has been its - and Miller's - big strengths. He's got a feel for a strange back story and somewhat absurdist characterization and a deranged aesthetic that drew me to the Mad Max series originally.""The Road Warrior"" was undoubtedly the high point of this series. Though always a lone-wolf anti-hero, Mel Gibson's Max was far more interesting and likable and the central action set pieces brilliantly and tightly executed. Miller was at the top of his game back then.""Fury Road"" has given Miller a much wider brush to execute the strange and quirky sensibility and that feels like its key fault to me. It's the ""too much budget"" syndrome and it's afflicted many a movie that was great precisely because it didn't have a massive budget. 30+ years and $150M+ to spend hasn't exactly been kind to this series.Tom Hardy is scarcely registering a pulse as Max. Does he utter more than 12 barely intelligible words throughout the film? In a film with ""Mad Max"" in the title I can hardly tell that Mad Max was even there. He could have been replaced by almost any other character in the movie. Nicholas Hoult's Nux - a vastly more interesting character - for example. Or Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiousa, who may have more screen time than Tom Hardy.Over-the-top violence and excess is a trademark of this series. To not go in expecting this is absurd. The problem is that the violence feels like an intentionally garish suit that Miller has put on. The absurd audio-visual assault of the first 5-10 minutes of the film, for example, feels precisely this way. What's Miller going for here? What part of the plot and story is he trying to lay out and advance, exactly? Nothing, really, I'd argue. It's there purely to prepare your mind for the ensuing craziness, sort of like a shock treatment.I was very excited when I first saw the ""Fury Road"" trailers. YES! Another Mad Max movie, finally. But Miller over-sold his story and vision in the end. He had way, way too much money to spend. I would have bought it more if he and Hardy hadn't decided to make Max this very distant, almost mute character. Max is NOT a traditional hero, to be sure, but he has a moral center most of us can attach to. I won't say this center was entirely lost here but I felt little emotion toward Max at the end. That likability was there throughout the series - from the first Mad Max to the Road Warrior to Thunderdome.It's sadly missing here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Charlize Theron shines like Mad.,"Mad Max (Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) manage to come together after a massive chase sequence cumulating in them fighting for control. Eventually they start to see they have the same goal, achieve some sort of redemption for their past failures.What Mad Max lacks in story it makes up for with pulsating action sequence in a constant chase. Fury Road is everything Waterworld wishes it was, except where there was water there is now only sand. A dry desolate world where people act like obedient zombies. The attachment to religion and blind followers is undeniable, taking swings at notions of a women's place is to breed, that an act of sacrifice will be reworded in the afterlife and that the preacher is the same as a god.The action in the chase sequences is everything Fast and the Furious wishes it was, capturing the stark beauty that the Namib desert has to offer in the background. Golden landscapes and wispy sands. Empty. Hot. But at night it's cold, and saturated in the blue dark. ""Fury Road""really captured the ghostly Southern African desert superbly. And the extreme temperatures from day to night without any character making reference to it.The traveling band is just awesome and needs a mention.The oddest aspect would be Hugh Keays-Byrne's inability to act through the costume that resembled something similar to a mask Tom Hardy donned in Batman and blew the character out the water. swing and a miss for Hugh.Nicholas Hoult brings a very unexpectedly tender performance to one of the henchmen, Nux.The costumes are out of this world, not merely the choice in some of the amazing apocalyptic desert couture but the amount of it. The scope is epic and the cinematography captures the amount of depth in these massive shots flawlessly.In spite of the lack of character development the action is so poised and beautiful to watch without becoming slow and empty. The film is just sick. cool. fleek. Whatever. Prodigious cinema is just sensational.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almst no plot. Outstanding camera work!,"TL;DR: If you're looking for a movie with fantastic camera work and very little plot to follow, give Mad Max: Fury Road a watch. If you want a deep plot, move along, nothing to see here.The only reason this movie got a 6/10 from me is because it only had half of what I think makes a good movie. Mad Max: Fury Road has FANTASTIC cinematography. Quite possibly the best I have ever seen, but it has almost NO plot. The plot is basically how your sixth grade teacher tells you to write a plot: main character gets in trouble, does a thing, problem gets worse, does a different thing, and the problem is solved. That's it.On the other hand, Mad Max is a pleasure to watch. All the shots are smooth and flow very well from one to the next while still giving you a sense of fast, rough action. This is something even the Matrix has a hard time with (yes I just said that Mad Max has better fight scenes than one of the best fighting movies of all time). The effects are over the top and just incredible. The portable metal concert seen in the trailer is even better in the movie.This movie inspired me to go back and watch the older Mad Max movies and the lack of plot kind of makes sense. The whole point is that he lost his family in the first movie, the world just doesn't make sense anymore, and all he sees is mindless violence. So the lack of plot can be excused to a point because it was intentional, but plot is one of the things I look for most in a movie/TV show.TL;DR: If you're looking for a movie with fantastic camera work and very little plot to follow, give Mad Max: Fury Road a watch.

"I really dont get the hype, thought it was pretty bad.","I just dont get why people think it was that great.People are raving about how well its produced and shot etc, but there are multiple blatant ""fast-forward"" scenes dotted across the film, including within climactic scenes that just look horrendous. The voices throughout the film are blatantly dubbed in and people seem to be able to whisper across from one vehicle to the next while travelling at (what seems to be) very high speeds and have no trouble hearing eachother.Its out-and-out action from start to finish, which sounds great, but the action is literally only ""car-chases"" through the desert where an obscene amount of crazy people, drive an obscene amount crazy cars and blow eachother up while travelling in a fantastic diamond formation.No character background at all apart from brief flashbacks for Tom Hardy.I see that it got big marks for doing loads of the stunts for real, and thats great, well done, but that doesnt make a film on its own, you need more than that.Very weak film.

Believe all the hype; it's a pure cinematic masterpiece!,"'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD': Five Stars (Out of Five)George Miller's big-budget reboot to his immensely popular post-apocalyptic 'MAD MAX' trilogy (from the 70s and 80s). This one stars Tom Hardy, in the title role, replacing Mel Gibson (who played the role in all three previous films). It also stars Charlize Theron and costars Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne (who also played the villain in the original movie), Nathan Jones, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton and Josh Helman. Miller directed and co-produced the film, as well as co- wrote the screenplay; with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris (two first time film writers). The story revolves around Max teaming up with another rebellious survivor, named Furiosa, as they try to outrun a crazed cult leader, and his army, and make it across the desert to Furiosa's homeland, with the cult leader's five wives. It was made on a budget of $100 to $150 million, but it's full of impressive practical effects and old school stunts (and a small amount of CGI). It's the first installment in 30 years and although it takes place after the events of the original trilogy, it also reintroduces us to Max; and goes back over his origins, as well as the origins of the world he now lives in. The film has gotten nothing but rave reviews from critics, at an unprecedented level (for a genre action flick like this), and it could be a possible 'Best Picture' contender, come awards time (it should be). I absolutely love this movie!The setting is, once again, that of a distant, chaotic future; after normal civilization has collapsed, and just about everyone has gone crazy. Max Rockatansky (Hardy) is still a loner survivalist, on the run from his past (and the ghosts of his dead family). He's kidnapped by cultists, called War Boys; an army under the leadership of a fascist dictator named Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne). When a beloved cultist commander, of Joe's, named Furiosa (Theron), goes rogue, and steals his five enslaved wives, Joe leads his whole army after them in pursuit. Furiosa is trying to lead the women to the place where she grew up, in hopes of a better life. She reluctantly teams up with Max, in order to do so.I think seeing this film in the theater, was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life (and I plan on doing it again, really soon); I recommend to all true cinephiles, that they see it the same way! The visuals are breathtaking and the action is absolutely glorious, and non-stop; it also has an awesome score (by Junkie XL). It's full of extremely bizarre, and memorably quirky, characters too; and it even has a little heart, thrown in, as well. The movie feels like a throwback to the 80s; but it's also a groundbreaking milestone, in film and art (in general), in it's own right. Miller created an amazingly artistic, and disturbingly beautiful, world; of crazy characters and totally insane, and admirably captivating, chaos (as he did with 'THE ROAD WARRIOR', and to a lesser extent 'MAD MAX' and 'MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME'). The film is like 'THE ROAD WARRIOR' times ten though, and I'd rank it among the all-time greatest action movies ever (like 'ALIENS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'THE DARK KNIGHT' and 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'). It's more than an action film though; people call it a 'punk western (on wheels)', which I agree with, but it also celebrates uniqueness and being different (as well as not conforming to popular society). It shows how mental illness can be a good thing; how some of the biggest heroes, among us, are totally mad!

A grungy masterpiece,"It has been nearly 24 hours since I saw Fury Road, and I'm still trying to recover. It is the sort of film you forget to breathe through, much like Gravity or Captain Phillips, but for an altogether different reason. Unrelenting from beginning to end, this post-apocalyptic saga is virtually one, long, explosive chase sequence, albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap. The action (i.e. the whole film) is utterly bonkers, conceptually and in execution. That writer-director George Miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough, but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work – augmented by gritty CGI – is simply awe-inspiring.Visually it is vivid and spectacular; the searing desert landscape offering a dirt-filled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds, whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous. The heart-pounding score by Junkie XL, in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music, accompanies Miller's on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears. The vehicular carnage may be the drawcard, but the committed cast elevate the overall product. Tom Hardy is savage as Max, Charlize Theron is compelling as Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult is gonzo as Nux, whilst a plethora of recognisable Aussies show up in deranged cameos.There's an intensity here you just don't find in majority of the big-budgeted blockbusters; an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing. Miller hasn't played in the Mad Max world since the dreadful Beyond Thunderdome back in 1985, but by God he has redeemed himself, and then some. Fury Road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself. In short: it is a grungy masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Superb Oldschool Action,"Well, I re-watched Mad Max: Fury Road again (5th or 6th time) and the movie stands the test of time - this is a hell of a trip and all those reviews who are negative don't understand one simple fact: this movie doesn't intend to be something else than it is - a postapocalyptic joyride on the wheels of hell. The story may not be the most sophisticated one (but tbh none of the movies of the Mad Max franchise are) but it gives what it promises: A trip on the fury road. A big bonus imo is especially all the ""analog"" done stunts - if I compare this with these Fast and Furios movies for example, where almost every action scene screams CGI, I am really happy to watch this ""traditional"" done action scenes, which are btw just stunning.Mad Max: Fury Road is just great and superb. I also like Tom Hardy as Mad Max (okay Mel I like more, but anyway) and Charlize Theron shows again that she can play all sorts/genres of movies and characters.I enjoyed and will enjoy this one greatly, and I am eager to see the next movie of the series.

An Epitome Of Action Movies,"Set thirty years after The Mad Max trilogy, this reboot of Mad Max brings more action and class to the already classic of a series (you don't have to see the previous movies to understand this reboot, only the characters and the idea of the not do distant dystopian future have been taken from the original trilogy.) arguably the best action movie of the year blends the fun of a popcorn-film and class of a cinema to give us a critical blockbuster which will stay with us beyond thunderdrome (the cinema hall).The movie begins the action at the beginning which doesn't stop till the last minute of the movie the chases,the cars,the war-machines, the explosions, the collisions and what not, it has everything a action movie needs to rise your adrenaline levels through the roof. The movie is like a big chasing movie in which George Miller sneakily inserted a story to keep us engaged through out the movie. The perfectly timed explosions caused by exploding spears and the vehicles which which are still coming at you even after the big explosions, the villain (Immortan Joe) with never give up attitude going after the Max, Imperator Furiosa and her allies.

The use of color in this movie adds so much beauty to it that it's like cotton candy to your eyes. The story though not so complex but compelling to watch gives us another reason to relive this epic action movie once more time.

Perhaps it was the Mad Max of old and my nostalgia for that world but this was so different and less real than the world of the original Max. Max was leaden. He seemed almost irrelevant and I couldn't care for him. Furiousa was better and brought some interest to the adventure. Nux was just Nicholas Hoult in bad make-up. I don't generally like movies with endless fight and action scenes and this pushed that genre to the extreme. In the end it was plot free, character free nonsense.But. I can understand the appeal both to the action fan and to wider cinema audiences. The visuals were stunning, the world was unique and the pace and intensity was startling.

"To be honest, one is reluctant to enjoy this film","""Who was more insane? Me, or every other person?"" In ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" Miller has pushed his Gilliam-esque vision of a world gone distraught to its sensible extraordinary. Never again are the general population of Max Rockatansky's reality just scroungers for oil or power; they have been changed into animals of condition, either left with one characterising need or left with no similarity of reason. ""Fury Road"" is a fierce film, yet the rough demonstrations in this world don't feel like subjective activity beats—they rise up out of an entire absence of different alternatives or a firm feeling of straight-up madness. Mill operator's new vision of Max isn't a warrior. Or maybe, he's a man driven by the recollections of past sins to do minimal more than survive. He strolls with the phantoms of those he couldn't spare, and his voyaging allies have pushed him to the edge of rational soundness.While meandering at this edge, Max is abducted and changed into a strict blood sack for a non domesticated warrior named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who serves the impulses of his twisted ruler, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who additionally played the reprobate Toecutter in the first ""Mad Max""). From the begin, Miller gives you no opportunity to ""straightforwardness"" into this world or the story he needs to tell. The edge rate is quickened, the altering is hyperactive, the awful person talks through a veil that makes a large portion of his exchange garbled (shades of Hardy's Bane from ""The Dark Knight Rises""), and the terrible dreams of Miller's turned future come quick and incensed. Immortan Joe is a scarcely alive irregularity of nature, continued breathing by tubes associated with his face and served by correspondingly distorted half-people with complete names like Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones) and The People Eater (John Howard).One of Joe's most striking warriors is an effective lady known as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who, as the film opens, is driving an escort from Immortan Joe's fortification to the oil refinery Gastown when she digresses off kilter. Things being what they are Furiosa has captured Joe's ""reproducers,"" the ladies he keeps detainee with an end goal to make a male beneficiary. She's taking them to ""the green place,"" to well-being. Obviously, Joe sends his men after Furiosa—including Nux, to whom Max is still appended— and whatever is left of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" comprises of one since quite a while ago supported pursue over the unforgiving desert. Except for one centrepiece of discourse, the film happens altogether moving, speeding, pursuing, ricocheting, and detonating over Miller's seared scene.As an impression of more edgy circumstances, Miller has redesigned the necessities of his future world from wares like oil to immaculate survival. Max has been rethought as a battling, driving machine, a man who ""discovers his own specific manner,"" pushing ahead trying to surpass his apparitions. Nux is a mentally conditioned goon, a man-animal who trusts that he will pass on and be renewed subsequent to relinquishing himself for an excursion to Valhalla. Max in the long run ventures into the part of the activity legend, at the same time, in one of his most brave moves, Miller gives the heaviness of the story to Furiosa, a lady who clutches the main thing that could give her trust in this vicious world—the people to come. Theron does apparently the best work of her vocation here, cunningly passing on the drive in Furiosa's spirit in a way that powers the whole film. She accomplishes more with a singing gaze or held jaw than most performers could with a page of discourse. Furthermore, one shouldn't underestimate the strengthening message at the heart of this film—Eve Ensler, creator of ""The Vagina Monologues"" counselled with Miller on the script—which proposes that ladies, as the makers of new life, will, intrinsically, dependably be the sexual orientation that holds hardest onto seek after what's to come. Furiosa takes a gander at the craziness of the male initiative around her and chooses that's the last straw. When one of Furiosa's wards starts giving birth and still safeguards herself and her yet-to-be-conceived youngster (subsequent to being shot no less), it's hard not to see ""Fury Road"" as a response to the macho jabber that so frequently characterises the activity class.""FURY ROAD"" is the most amazing activity stunt you've found in years, you truly require just hold up a couple of minutes to see something better. This is a film where you continue imagining that its achieved its zenith and afterwards, mysteriously, that minute is abandoned in the tidy. Fury Road"" was destined to be sufficiently noteworthy as an unadulterated specialised achievement—a film that chuckles despite blockbuster CGI bashes with a portion of the best altering and sound plan the class has ever observed—but then Miller goes after an option that is more prominent than specialised ability. He holds high up the activity layout that he made with ""The Road Warrior"" and contends that Hollywood shouldn't have been replicating it for as long as three decades, they ought to have been expanding on it. ""Fury Road"" was a test to an entire era of activity producers, asking them to take after its nervy way into the class' future and, similar to Miller, attempt their hardest to make something new.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The main character in Max so got our attention that we all know his story, both as character, and where that career went from there.These reviews began from a real need to write, without the burden of interest in who may read them. Certainly, there is that little niggling hope others will be in some way interested in the words, but, fortunately, it is a very little itch.

Proof that a non-stop Action-horror film can last nearly 2 hours,"8.1 of 10. This takes everything in the original sequels and ups it a notch while seemingly providing a prequel to the original films. The action is non-stop, the gore and desert dystopia beyond anything the original had to offer and bordering on horror often.The downside? The end of the world dystopia scenario is less believable than it was in the early 1980s. There have been much better scenarios since then and they failed to integrate them (especially another female-hero anime called Nausicaa (1984) that remains the best of the Mad-Max series and imitators). It's also a little too cartoonish at times the way people are able to bounce around and survive brutal accidents. But it fits within the story of the film and is made believable enough to not interfere with the overall enjoyment.It is true that this would be better called ""Mad Maxine"", but contrary to criticisms Furiosa lives up to any version of the Max character and gives the second half of the title and film meaning, plot, and mystery to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Less plot and character than Fast and Furious,"I genuinely do not understand how this movie has such high ratings. It was unintelligible from start to finish. The action sequences don't make any sense. It's a neat piece of trivia that so much of it was practical effects. I can appreciate that. However, I can also appreciate Evel Knievel jumping the fountains at Caesars Palace. That had more character and drama and it happened long before I was born.I am a lesser human being for watching this entire movie. I should have turned it off. I feel less bad for watching Dumb and Dumber 2 which also has more plot and character development than this streaming pile of a movie.Mad Max is dead to me.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Splendid showcase of sheer action,"I have never seen anything like this before.Astounding and jaw-dropping action scenes make this film a must watch for all movie lovers. Complemented by wonderful 3D special effects and top notch production values, Mad Max Fury Road is a marvelous visual spectacle that no one should miss.A particular sequence of scenes towards the end of the first hour is so amazing that it is like no other out there, and makes us realize the reason we love movies. Fast paced and spell binding first hour matched by an equally worthy second. Highly Recommended flick. Go watch it in theaters, thank me later.What a lovely Day!!!!!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Road of Redemption,"I really want to go back and watch Road Warrior now that I've seen Fury Road. The first Mad Max was a fantastic revenge story that also gave us some of the best low budget action we have ever had. Road Warrior to me fell short of the first and just didn't give me that visceral experience. But I'm definitely willing to give it another shot after seeing the insane Fury Road. Now, you don't necessarily have to see any of the first 3 to understand the world of Mad Max, but you will have a better appreciation for what exactly is going on in this post apocalyptic world. It's cleared up by Tom Hardy in the first few minutes of the movie, which shows flashbacks, or recreations rather, from the events of the first two films. Bottom line is to go see this movie in theaters. It's the best pure action film of the year and of quite some time.We begin at the Citadel, when presumably the world and it's chaos is controlled by King Immortan Joe. He has 5 wives who were individually selected for breeding and carrying on his blood, who are held hostage at his place. Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, isn't thrilled and decides to steal all of his wives and bring them to her homeland, the Green Place. While in pursuit, she crosses paths with the once captured Mad Max, and they agree begrudgingly to help each other for their own greater good. What follows is an insane action film that barely takes time to breathe. 90% of the film is supposedly practical effects, which is absolutely mind-blowing. I love Avengers, but half of the film is green screen, and you can pretty much tell when it is. But here, watching the film, I couldn't really tell you what parts were real and what wasn't. And at 70 years old, George Miller did an unbelievable job, especially considering some of the development problems the film had. There are people jumping from vehicle to vehicle, riding their motorcycles on top of huge trucks, hanging onto the bottom of high speed car chases, and almost all of it was real. It gives you an extra layer of excitement while watching the film that you just don't get with CGI fest films.With that being said, the action never becomes overpowering or distracting. It doesn't necessarily exhaust you, it just thrills you. Especially with Junkie XL's brilliant score playing in the background. Sure, I definitely would have liked to have seen more development from the characters, especially our main villain. Besides having several wives and controlling the water supply, we don't know much about him. Mad Max just gets stuck in the chaos, it's not even really his film. It's really Furiosa's film and wow is she an awesome bada** character or what? Side note: I would love to see some sort of team up between Furiosa and Rita Vrataski from Edge of Tomorrow (AKA Full Metal Bitc*). Charlize Theron strips down her glamorous Hollywood look for the role and gives a terrific performance. I found a lot of her back-story to be really touching and even heartbreaking. As much as it's a story of redemption for her, it's a redemption film for the Mad Max franchise, which will hopefully continue. This can easily be a new set of films with Hardy and the supporting roles, which it's worth mentioning how great and unrecognizable Nicholas Hoult was in the film. This film has so many great action scenes, with characters you root for and even some deeper themes about surviving madness and how you control chaos. Even though I loved the trailers, I was deeply surprised by Mad Max: Fury Road, and I hope to see more of these films.+Furiosa is an awesome character+Hardy is as good if not better than Gibson+Insane action, how did they do it?+Sets up a new set of films, but honors the ones before+Unrecognizable Hoult+Action doesn't get exhausting+Junkie XL's score-Character development9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Non Stop, Fast Paced, Best Final Action Scene in a long time.","This is a wonderful movie full of action that gives you everything you need plus more. If your looking for a great action movie with a believable star and Co Star this is it. They don't over use CGI, and they don't try to give you a little bit of everything they just stick with what they do great. Some of the scenes in this movie non action scene were amazing. (Very Artful)Those of you complaining about lack of story and lack of character progression... stop whining and see a movie that fits your needs if that is what your looking for. You have to judge a movie based of what it is and what it is supposed to be. This fell short no where. If you want a story see a drama. Or watch another crappy action movie try to give both at the same time and end up with a half assed story and bad action sequences. In all fairness given the situation the characters are in, how else could they even progress which they did a great deal, you just were probably upset because it didn't go down the typical road. This movie is great for anyone that wants to see a white knuckle, wonderfully crafted ACTION movie....",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
one word: Noisy.,"A new experience for almost everyone, trying to send short messages that explain the story without spoon feeding it to the viewers. explaining the lifestyle of the wasteland people through action only.I think the above lines explain why many people like this movie so much, that would be justified if there is a story to be told! Honestly I find it creative, telling a story with decent details using only fighting scenes and explosions, but what good is it if the story you are telling is so lame? All of the loud rock music and slow motion scenes proves my point, they want to show us how creatively they can blow up cars and set up chase scenes, they added a small story between the lines so they can wrap up a long sequence of chasing scenes into a movie. CGI doesn't determine how good a movie is because each movie is made with the latest PC software at its time. Certainly not artistic unless you like paintings of sand. Plus a package of useless scenes that doesn't add anything to the plot or the action. 6/10 may be a compliment for the director's effort in this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"mindless violence with harsh, survivalist set design","There's an issue of sorts among Australian (and to an extent New Zealand) males about what masculinity is, what is means to be 'tough', 'resilient', 'fearless' etc in these post-colonial countries, and the complex can't be more feverishly illustrated than in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"".Also, I can't help but feel that the overwhelmingly positive newspaper reviews are more a reaction to the long-held discrimination of sexism in the US, as they insist over and over again that the film is 'brilliant', 'unforgettable', and 'must-see cinema', essentially because there's a bald-headed female warrior on the run from a tribe of barbarians, trying to protect females from a clan of deformed, repulsive mutants and skinhead freaks with guns.Although, yes, that is a noble reason to retool an action franchise, it was also done in the mid 80s by Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (back when the original Mad Max trilogy was circulating in video rental stores), and actually the chief antagonist in Fury Road notably resembles the Predator from 1987 if you squint a little.So whats all the fuss about? Not sure really - MM:FR has a sense of black comedy to the essentially threatening undertones of the film, and some thoroughly awesome cinematography and production design regarding the vehicles, but it's essentially just a chase movie, and there's only so many ways you can frame a punch to the head, a wild leap from a moving vehicle or a screaming car crash until you realize the entire movies about trigger happy machismo (or whatever the femme equivalent of machismo is) and dangerously shot stunts - the film doesn't have any notable dialogue or character development at all.Apparently, if this is the new 'gold standard' for hard boiled action escapism, I have to say that it's a much better film in 2D than 3D; also DVD versions of the release appear to have one or two gross details removed, not that it detracts from the non-stop tension and ambitious prop design throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overrated and Tedious To The Max,"To quote a different old Mel Gibson action flick, maybe ""I'm getting too old for this spit."" (TV censored version) I honestly don't understand the seemingly universal praise of this effort. I hesitate to even call it a movie because in reality it's a two hour chase scene. It certainly has its moments and I can appreciate the impressive real world stunts and explosions. I also give it high marks for being exactly what it advertised itself to be a balls-to-the-walls insane action romp pivoting off the original films. For me, that romp played out like watching an insane person's nightmares over and over and over. The first two acts grew tedious and became something to endure rather than enjoy. Then, the third act hit and the last 20 minutes were amazing. You almost come to care about characters even though none of them were bothered to be developed along the way.

One of the Bests of this Decade,"This film was ridiculous, weird, unnecessary and sometimes even dumb, but this movie did everything it should have done right. This film doesn't even have a script and it was the right way to do this. The action is mostly without CGI and considering the fact that current blockbusters can't reach the greatness of this film's action by using full of CGI, one of the most if not the most endeavored action film ever. Even after the film I though that it was an ok 6 with lots of CGI but after I did my search, I found out that they really did it, they really crushed those cars, they really did. This is a huge milestone for action films just like the dark knight is a milestone for superhero movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Welcome back, Max.","It's been thirty years since I left the cinema feeling more than a little let down by the kiddie friendly, Hollywood-ised action of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome; could this long-awaited reboot from the series' original creator George Miller make up for three decades of disappointment? You betcha!One certainly can't accuse Miller of playing it safe with his fourth Mad Max outing: Fury Road is an exercise in absolute excess from start to finish. The outrageous plot opens with Max (Tom Hardy, taking over the iconic role from Mad Mel) being captured by a clan of desert warriors ruled over by ruthless tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toecutter from the original Mad Max), who keeps order in his citadel by controlling its supply of water (and breast milk!). The helpless Max is used as a 'blood bank' by sickly war-boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult), before finding himself strapped to the front of Nux's vehicle, part of the huge convoy that takes off in pursuit after rebellious one-armed rig-driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who has betrayed Joe by making off with several of his wives, having promised to escort them to a promised land of green.After the chase enters a massive electrical sandstorm, during which Nux crashes his car, Max finds himself free once again; teaming up with Furiosa, he helps to drive the rig to safety, but on reaching their destination, Max and Furiosa realise that their only hope for survival is to turn back and face the enemy head on. Up to this point, the action had been impressive, but what follows is absolutely breath-taking—a mind-boggling mêlée of sheer madness and mayhem, with more mashed metal and massive explosions than all three previous Mad Max films put together, times ten. Quite how Miller managed to capture some of the scenes of car-nage without killing anyone in the process is hard to imagine, such is the incredible level of vehicular destruction on display.The previous Mad Max movies—even Thunderdome—excelled when it came to production design, and Fury Road is the most imaginative yet, with its wonderful citadel full of man-powered machinery, and, of course, its cavalcade of absurd post-apocalyptic vehicles (love, love, love the The Cars That Ate Paris-inspired buggies covered in metal spikes). The attention to detail here is superb, with far too much to take in in just one viewing (I've only just finished watching it and I already want to see it again). The insane characters also go a long way to making this film the hugely entertaining experience that it is: Slit, a war-boy with a Joker-style smile; Rictus Erectus, the dim musclebound son of Immortan Joe; The Doof Warrior, a guitar playing gimp stood astride a bank of loudspeakers on wheels; and a strange deformed dwarf, another of Joe's sons, who watches the world through a telescope from the safety of the citadel.Finally, the 3D: usually, I can take or leave the gimmick of a third dimension, but here it really added to my enjoyment, Miller milking the process for all its worth. I suggest watching Fury Road in 3D if only for the shot of the steering wheel flying into the foreground: I felt like I could reach out and catch it—a lasting souvenir from one of the most spectacular movies of the millennium so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
War Rig is love. War Rig is life. Best Movie Ever,"30 years in the making. Numerous production halts, it looked like Fury Road was never going to be made, until now. 2015 has arrived, and in it the golden package that is the beautiful, spectacular, absolutely barmy and outrageously entertaining ""Mad Max Fury Road"", an action masterpiece so overwhelmingly explosive and jaw dropping your face will feel like its been melted, or that you've been awakened in Valhalla alongside the war boys.Max Rockatansky roams the wasteland alone, haunted by his dark past. Attacked by scavengers, he is taken to a citadel ruled by the Immortan Joe, a tyrannical overlord. When his five wives, his healthy breeding studs, are taken by rogue Imperator Furiosa, he and his army of War Boys set out on a mission leading to an all out road war to get them back. This is a pure chase movie, yet it's filled with emotional heft, superbly developed characters and the finest looking action sequences. George Miller is the man of action, nerd tears will ensue and your inner child will be unleashed.My expectations were sky high, they've been met. This movie is a royal treat, even the opening Warner Brothers title has the sound of a big, throaty engine igniting, the fuel may be igniting but so will your blood. Then, Max begins to speak. ""My world is fire and blood"", ""A man reduced to a single instinct - survive"", undeniably the finest, grittiest and most exciting narration to open a film ever. Immediately, you are treated to a gorgeous wide shot of chaos, which sees Max drive off into the distance, followed by marauders who trash his car and kidnap him.Fury Road is visceral and bold, you are thrown into the deep end immediately. When your mouth is agape throughout the majority of a whole film you know it's good. Junkie XL's soundtrack is like having a napalm bomb go off in your face, forced to take the full pelt of gigantic cinematic horns, eye-watering strings and war like drums. A moment of pure beauty is the soundtrack accompanying the scene where the War Rig is attacked by half a dozen motorcycles, its just perfect. There is no other movie like this, this has to be the hardest review I've written due to the sheer amount of insanity that takes place here. The explosions are without a doubt some of the best on-screen, nothing gets the heart beating faster than seeing Max pole vault from car to car whilst a fuel tanker goes up in epic flames behind him. The stunts are the awe-inspiring, there needs to be an Oscar category for the the stunt men and women.Tom Hardy is Max, he is the road warrior. His line delivery is so gritty and delightfully croaky. He starts off like a wild animal escaping from captivity, then gradually retains mild normality but his eyes are always filled with a hint of craziness. Hardy's mannerisms, quips and neat little movements all add up, leading to one of the best performances of 2015. The minute Charlize Theron appeared, it hit me once again why she remains one of my all time favourite actresses. Head shaven, one arm, the other operating a mechanic arm with her head smeared in oil, she looks the part and means business. Theron displays conviction, desperation, anxiety, care and dedication throughout, every single line she has is totally bad-ass, best of all ""You wanna get through this? Pick up what you can and run!"". Best performance from an actress this year so far, it will be tough to beat, as will the film. Then, bring on the coolest looking, scariest sounding antagonist ever: Immortan Joe. Hugh Keays-Byrne gives a terrifically terrifying performance, a screen dominating character with authority amplified by those who worship him. His voice is so epic and eerie, as he speaks to his people and battle cries desperately chasing to get his wives back. All the make-up, costume design and vehicle designs are awards worthy, they add commentary on how the people in this world live and in their condition in this dying world.Nicholas Hoult is unrecognisable as Nux, a dying war-boy who is given a chance to prove himself by feeding Max's blood into his system on his way to the gates of Valhalla. His performance alone is the mad in the title, and easily boasts the best line this year ""Oh what a day! What a lovely day!"" as he rides into a storm. There's outstanding support from Nathan Jones, Josh Helman and Angus Sampson as Immortan Joe's followers, each offering brute force, balls-to-the-wall behaviour and epic acts of violence. Then there's the Fives Wives, brilliantly acted by all. British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley again proves herself a fine actress, line delivery perfect with raw emotion and providing one of the most shocking scenes in the film. Australian models Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton are tremendous, coating their scenes with innocence and vulnerability, as well as Riley Keough who has the least lines of the five but performs with stunning expression. Zoe Kravitz is a total bad-ass and the lone wolf in her pack, I cannot fault these actress they all did a fine job. It's great to see Megan Gale make an appearance as Valkyrie, Furiosa's contact whose appearance reveals a dramatic twist that completely turns the tide for ALL these characters.Mad Max Fury Road is breathless entertainment, I'm dying to see it again. It is perfect, which is a big statement to make but no film is going to reach the heights of raw insanity here, nor the carnage and beautiful camera-work filled with many crash zooms. In 3D, Fury Road comes to life with a heightened sense of depth and hard hitting pop out effects that knock you dead on. The critical acclaim and buzz is worthy. 2015 is at its high point.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Miller's Magnum Opus,"I needed some time to process what I've just witnessed. I was very skeptical about this movie. But having Miller behind it with Hardy and Theron in the lead, it showed some promise. However, since the first trailer, which I must seen have a dozen times, I was sold. I was hyped. Usually, a movie can't meet those kind of expectations. Fury Road blew those expectations out of the water.This is Miller's magnum opus. A labor of love, crafted into perfection. The story is simple, dialog is almost none existent and still everything is told visually. The devil is in the details. With brilliant simplicity the movie manages to motivate ever character without the need to spell it out for you. You just get it. You understand these people and where they come from and what drives them.The world itself is completely mad. But however crazy it gets, nothing feels out of place. The action is spectacular and non stop. But unlike, say Transformers, it's not deafening and tiresome. It's well crafted and real with the minimal use of CGI. It's believable no matter how crazy it gets. But most of all, it's perfectly captured. You see what's going on it all it's glory.These 2 hours flew by and left me thirsty for more. It's one of the best action movies I have ever seen and I've seen a lot. It's also rare to see a movie put so well together. I can't remember the last time a movie made it into my top 5.

Tom Hardy has about 20 lines in this movie ( 30 of them are extremely stupid ) and mourns all the time like he's trying to cosplay Yoda from Star Wars .

What a movie! What a lovely movie!,"Quickie Review:The world as we know it no longer exists, turned into an endless scorching desert where every drop of water and fuel is precious enough to kill for. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) rebels against the oppression of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) by aiding in the escape of his wives. She comes across Max (Tom Hardy), a mystery man who needs Furiosa just as much as she needs him in their quest for survival. Mad Max Fury Road is one of the most mind-blowing, insane action movies in recent years. By relying on mostly practical stunts there is a real sense of danger, tension, excitement, and awe with every explosion, flip, and wreck of the cars. More surprisingly there is heart behind the action, thanks to the well-developed characters. Mad Max's beautiful chaos is a sight to behold and must be experienced on the big screen.Full Review:I have never seen the original Mad Max movies, I just never got around to watching them. Since this was a reboot of sorts there is no need to watch them, and I wanted to go into the movie fresh. So this review comes from someone with no prior knowledge of the franchise. Short of it, I loved it!The thing that people will be talking about after the movie ends is the action. This is action like you have never seen before. CGI is only used when it is absolutely needed and the other 90% of the time it is real cars crashing and flipping in every way they can. The chase scenes are breath taking and heart pounding, and I mean that literally. After the first action sequence ended I had to remind myself to exhale because I felt like I was holding my breath in awe for the entire scene. When another sequence ended I checked my pulse, I don't know the exact beats per minute but it felt like I just came off the treadmill after 15mins of running. Like I said Mad Max is beautiful chaos but because of the great shot composition there is sense in the chaos. I never felt lost, I always knew what was going on despite the frantic nature of the scenes. That is why you will fully appreciate all the effort put into filming this movie.One of the things I was most nervous about from the trailers was the world of Mad Max. I feared that everything would be so crazy, like the flame-thrower guitarist on a truck, that it'd be too distracting. However, the world is so well-conceived and well realised by director George Miller that even the most insane things make sense in that context. Yes, that includes the flame-thrower guitarist, he was awesome! Additionally the cinematography and soundtrack brought a much grander scale to an otherwise simple story.Behind all the visuals though there is a level of depth to the movie that I did not anticipate. The best character of the movie by far is Charlize Theron's Furiosa. Even with her disability she is incredibly strong willed and determined to finish her mission. After all, she carries a lot of the emotional consequences if she were to fail and so I was really invested in her story. In a genre dominated by male actors it is refreshing to see a compelling female character such as Furiosa, and we need more of them in Hollywood. Then there is also Nicholas Hoult as Nux who had a great story arc. I was surprised how much I empathised with his character. You might be wondering why I haven't talked about Max yet in a movie called Mad Max, well that's simply because he is not really the central character. Don't get me wrong, he has a major role in the movie and Tom Hardy plays a convincing hardened hero. Nevertheless, this is mostly a Furiosa centric story. That may be a complaint for some that Max should've been the focus, and I can see their reasoning. The way I understood it was that this film is one of many stories or legends in this world, where a mystery man (Max) plays an important part in helping our heroes succeed. In that sense the way Max's character was handled was fitting.We are only half way through this decade and already I'll call it: Mad Max is the best action movie of this decade, the very least top 5. I have a strong feeling that Mad Max Fury Road will be a classic decades from now. I cannot stress this enough, you absolutely have to watch this on the big screen, IMAX if possible. You are robbing yourself of a truly unique visceral experience if you miss this one. The only person I wouldn't recommend this movie to is someone with a heart condition, because it might get too intense.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Boring entertainment. Decent movie, but overrated.","First off, Mad Max: Fury Road is no bad movie by any means. The movie takes the viewers on a crazy ride that does not stop. Although the action is close to flawless, it will never cover the obvious weaknesses in the plot.I will say the acting for the most part is up to par, and Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron does a great job. And i found Nicholas Hoult especially good. What makes the acting no better than it is, is the bad writing. The three actors have few lines, and the ones they do have are not exactly hard to pull off. ¨Further on, as previously mentioned, the action featured in this movie is very good, however the action is pretty much all the same throughout the movie. We get a lot of explosions, blood and fighting, but what you will realize after a while is that it is the exact same explosion, the exact same blood and the exact same fighting. The only difference being everyone driving one way, then the exact opposite way. This is what makes the entertainment turn boring . It gets stale.As for the plot, i have already touched on it. They go one way, then they go the other way, while defeating the bad guy. As weak as it gets.Basically what you are getting from the movie is what the trailer is giving you. Action on vehicles. I was entertained to a extent while watching the movie, but had nothing left when it was done. I have not watched the earlier Mad Max films, and this installment has not tickled my curiosity. If you are looking for action and crazy, this is the movie for you. If you are looking for a film with even a touch of meaning, this is not for you.Overall rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Joyous Madness,"Director George Miller revisits his classic that recognized himself and star Mel Gibson, Mad Max, by bringing the mythos to this new generation of filmmaking, with larger possibilities to expand its universe and even its insanity. And Mad Max: Fury Road is just as simple as that; it just goes nuts on everything along the road. The momentum is unending, the visual inventiveness is relentless, and it doesn't stop there. It also instantly establishes its own world wonderfully (even though it's already been known before,) but even to the newcomers, you can already see what kind of larger-than-life world this is. This is the kind of utterly enjoyable experience that a true action blockbuster should be.Even with a larger budget and much riveting spectacles, the direction surprisingly stays loyal to its original style. The pacing is brisk, the possibilities of honest craziness is endless and they still shine on screen. There is a bigger arc from its characters that relies more dialogue compared to the mostly silent Road Warrior, but even so, the story is still majorly told by the action. The entire movie is a grand escape from a ragtag enemies of punks and cults chasing after the mostly sane heroes on a truck. It's a truly magnificent kind of action that rarely halts its totally straightforward mission.And people brag about how George Miller takes a break from this franchise for the likes of Happy Feet, but to be honest, his achievement there does benefit for this film's visuals. The exteriors look great; example is the sandstorm that lead to an ultimate visual wonder that no other director might have thought about its genuine ridiculousness, and even the transition following after that scene is terrific. It may sound overly hyperbolic at this point, but really, Miller has always been top- notch in this area, but it gets better with larger special effects where the imagination is limitless. But that doesn't exactly defined the Mad Max movies at all. It's all about the characters and their designs and their expressiveness, and of course, the cars!!! The characters are just a variety of weirdness that each of them are immediately established by every detail of their looks and their attitude, and their vehicles happen to be made out of scraps from various models, which is totally fascinating. Worth mentioning is the ride that brings an entire band with a lead flamethrowing guitarist that is called Doof Warrior who steals every moment of his presence.But the action isn't a totally mindless smokescreen of destruction and explosions, either. There is real action happening on screen that is truly gripping, with the heroes helping each other, briefly yet clearly explaining each of their plights, having hand-in-hand combat, surviving from some stunt, and even a competition (if that's what they call it) of spitting fuel into the motors of their vehicles faster. Generic blockbusters would normally just throw away the spectacles, but here, these fast moving scenes are the story. The acting is stellar. Tom Hardy is solid as Max, and the physicality alone buys what coolness this actor could bring to the character, but the real star here is apparently Charlize Theron since her role gets more character-work among, and she carries the film terrifically.Mad Max: Fury Road is definitely one of the greatest blockbusters in years. Big budget blockbusters' concern today usually tend to pick either light or dark, smart or dumb, deep or shallow, or whatever, but here, it doesn't even bother. It just sticks to its own spirit, except of course, with heavier effects and heightened insanity. These qualities have often turned us off due to its losing of imagination and staleness, but this film gives us a reason to love it again. It makes us less cynical that big films can be as fun as the dumb B-movies we suddenly found as our personal guilty pleasure. It's just lively, relentlessly fun, while the story is simple, it already provides too much of an excitement for one day and you'll be hungry for more.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Easily one of the best action movies ever made,"The pace that is sustained throughout this movie is insane. It's two hours of nearly endless action. Characters were flawless. One liners and outrageous scenes aplenty. Watched it in the theaters three times. There isn't a whole lot of CGI in this film, which makes the action scenes feel gritty and raw. This translates directly into what one thinks of when it comes to Mad Max. I really love the different colors that are created throughout all the difference scenes. Charlize Theron steals the show and does such a good job. Overall, this one is definitely a movie to own. That's saying something in this day and age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""What a lovely movie!!""","This is my first review on this page, so please excuse my grammar and my writing, because I don't know very well English :)""Mad Max:Fury Road"" is one of my most anticipated movies of 2015. I was so excited to see this movie that a buy the ticket before the movie with 1 week and I was expecting at something big, explosive and action. ""Mad Max:Fury Road"" is without a doubt the best movie of this year by now, one of the best action movie of the decade and one of the best movies that I ever seen in my entire life. This movie was complete. Action, stuns, chasings, acting, screenplay, directing was so perfect, I don't have a single problem with this things and with the movie. Tom Hardy in this role was SO good, but not that good as Mel Gibson, who is one of the best actor of all time, but I'm okay with that, because Tom Hardy does a great job in this movie, but for me the main character was Charlize Theron, who plays ""Furiosa"", she is perfect in this movie, she gives one of the best female performance that I ever seen, is a role who defined her career, is a role that you will remember, is a key-role,is a perfect role. The directing was great, the screenplay awesome, the stuns, the chasing, the action was perfect, this is that action movie that I've been expecting many years and finally it comes. ""Mad Max:Fury Road"" it is a movie that you need to see, is a very very well made movie, that you will remember over years, is a marvelous movie, with great action, great acting, great directing, great screenplay, is an insane movie that you don't need to miss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Oh what a day, what a LOVELY day. And film","I honestly made an account specifically so I could write a review on this movie. I would give it a 1810375930102974920194858920 out of 10 if I could! There are a few snobby critics that honestly, are a bit too critical, don't listen to them. If you love fire, blood, action, creepy creatures, guns, and gore, this is honestly the most amazing movie you'll ever see. Ever. I am a massive movie addict, and am pretty picky typically, but this movie is by far my favorite movie I've seen in years. I left the theater wanting more and more, and haven't stopped thinking about it since. Yes, there isn't an insane totally incredible ""storyline"" but I didn't even care. Yes, there are prolonged action scenes, pretty much the entire movie, but it's freaking AMAZING. I am a makeup artist and blogger, and have done a few ""Mad Max Fury Road"" inspired makeup looks! The crust punk, edgy, gory, gorgeous feel, is just astounding. Being artistic like myself, I was seriously baffled by how amazing the whole ""look"" and feel of the film was. The makeup was incredible, the cinematography was amazing, the colors were so dark yet vibrant, I thought the acting was awesome! Tom Hardy grunts a lot and doesn't talk too much, but I think that added to the whole effect! Nux is the craziest little awesome thing. Ever. The guitar playing thing? Most eerie, creepy, incredible thing ever. There's quite a lot of dark humor in this film, so if you aren't into dark, ""dry"" humor, creepy, frightening creature things, and you hate blood and crazy awesome action, then yeah, this won't be the film for you! But if you just enjoy a stinking amazing, Gory, creepy, kick butt movie from time to time, you NEED Mad Max in your life. Basically, I'm counting the days until the next one comes out because I'm OBSESSED. I actually think the term obsessed doesn't even express my love for this movie. Take a chance, see it yourself, because I highly doubt you'll regret it. I am a major superhero and scary movie fanatic, and this topped every movie I've seen in years. That says a LOT for me! My husband said the same thing, and he's quite the movie snob as well! I won't stop recommending this movie to people because I just think it's stinking amazing. See it, love it, and it'll be such a LOVELY day ;) just thank me later, babes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant Orgy of Chaos & Destruction,"More than 30 years passed since George Miller created the iconic postapocalyptic-road carnage crazy Mad Max universe. I was in doubt if he could do his magic with Fury Road – but, boy, he did.Fury Road is an unrelenting action fest from beginning to end. I cannot remember any recent action movie that made me watch in awe, unbelieving what I saw. The amount of practical stunts, the production design, the camera-work, the scope of this whole thing is beyond anything we got used to in modern blockbuster action movies. In short, this is 100 percent George Millerness and just forget everything about the Babe/Happy Feet flicks.Tom Hardy takes the baton from Mel Gibson as Max and he gets the job well done. Talking with an odd dialect, haunted by visions of the past, muttering to himself and barking half-beast-like to others in his few lines of dialogue we get the impression that something cracked in his mind beyond repair. However, Max is a survivalist machine with a spark of humanity left and, like in the old movies, gets plunged right into the s*** when things get messy.Max teams up with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), the most kickass female movie character since Ellen Ripley. A weird prosthetic arm, mascara obviously made of oil, oh, Charlizewill you marry me? Theron easily steals this movie by giving us a thin-lipped but still emotional image of Furiosa which may be her best performance of her career so far.The antagonist is scary Immortan Joe aptly played by Hugh Keays-Byrne (yes, the Toecutter) who wants towhatever. Undeniably, the whole plot is paper-thin but, hey, this is a Mad Max movie, not an elaborate and sophisticated shakespearian drama, right?Hardy and Theron are labelled as starring but the real star of Fury Road is George Miller. It is appalling how much effort, passion and audacity Mr. Miller packed into this film. When I heard that the concept of Fury Road was a 2-hour chase I was afraid that the movie turned out to be a boom-bang action flick which gets boring after one hour. The opposite is true. There are plenty action sequences but Miller gives us few, but powerful oases of calm scenes to flesh out the characters – and give us a moment to catch breath before the cinematic onslaught continues.And an onslaught it is. Crazy vehicles, skulls, madmen on spikes, a motorized stage with a guitarist as battle-enforcer (with a flamethrower-guitar!), blades, guns, souped-up cars, exploding spears, you name it. It has to be seen to be believed. George Miller has the grandeur of an old veteran knight stepping into the throne room and slapping the gauntlet into all the upstarts' faces who think they are so high and mighty (Michael Bay, anyone?) Honestly, Fury Road blasts so much CGI-action boredom to pieces that even Avengers: Age of Ultron looks cheap and lazy.The movie is almost perfect but there are some drawbacks. It is kind of awkward that Fury Road is more of a buddy movie (Max/Furiosa). In the old movies (albeit the first one) Max was the man who made the difference and helped the desperate ones to turn the tide. Today he seems to have lost his almost saviour antics and is just an able and skilled post-apocalypse fighter. Secondly, there is the supporting female cast which has very little to do except to motivate Immortan Joe's chase and look hot. They are culprit for just being there to be eyecandy for the presumed male audience.In all honesty: I want George Miller to win the Acadamy Award for best director. Fury Road is MASSIVE and if you have the slightest affection for action movies, go and watch it in the theatre on a big screen or you will regret it for the rest of your life. If there is a deeper revelation in Fury Road, it has to be that a Mad Max movie can work without Mel Gibsonbut not without George Miller.It was worth the 30-years wait and it is, indeed, a lovely day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliantly directed and strikingly original.,"""I f**king loved it.""That was my initial reaction after walking out of the theater following the screening of Mad Max: Fury Road, and 24 hours later I feel exactly the same. Trapped in a state of perpetual forward motion and absolutely relentless in its pacing, it's a jaw-dropping, eye-popping, mind-blowing experience that sets a new standard for what audiences should expect from action filmmaking.From the first shot of Max (Tom Hardy) surveying the wasteland, the film shifts into high gear and never looks back. It's nearly a full 30 minutes before you'll have a chance to catch your breath, and even that respite lasts mere moments before the engines are roaring, the bullets are flying, and the characters are pressing ever onward.Along the way, we encounter the major players in this post- apocalyptic tale: there's Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a dictator who controls the only source of clean water and breeds a constantly supply of his ""war boys"" to keep himself in power; Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe's most trusted lieutenants and driver of the massive War Rig; and Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a war boy with a surprising connection to Max, who yearns to prove himself on the battlefield.And then there are the Breeders (Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton), smuggled away in the cargo hold of the War Rig, racing cross the desert in a desperate attempt to free themselves of Joe's tyranny. Furiosa's decision to defy her master and smuggle his wives away to her childhood homeland is the spark which ignites the fires of war, and it's not long before Joe and his entire army - not to mention the surrounding clans - are bearing down on Furiosa and Max.But these women are no damsels in distress - quite the contrary, in fact. Furiosa is every bit the warrior that Max is, proving her mettle time and again throughout the never-ending chaos, and the wives are smart and strong-willed, resolute in their decision to no longer be seen as objects, but rather as people. Each character is given ample time in the spotlight, and if anything, it's Max that winds up getting a little short-changed here.The final chase scene during the third act of The Road Warrior has stood the test of time as one of the greatest action sequences ever filmed, so it's only fitting that it should finally be dethroned by the same director. Mad Max: Fury Road feels like George Miller set out to film a two-hour version of that same sequence, only with bigger cars, bigger guns, bigger explosions and of course, a bigger budget. Everything about this film is big, and that's exactly how it should be seen: on the biggest screen, with the biggest speakers, and surrounded by the biggest audience you can find.If that sounds exhausting, you're not wrong - but it's exhausting in the absolute best way possible. I can honestly say I've never seen anything quite like this released by a major motion picture studio, and Warner Bros. deserves all the credit in the world for allowing Miller to bring his vision to life on such an impossibly enormous scale. Mad Max: Fury Road is a brilliantly-directed, strikingly original film, extending a defiant leather-clad middle finger to a genre that is all too often flooded with mediocrity, and daring the rest of Hollywood to elevate their game.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Greatest movie of all time! A monstrous film that'll change cinema forever!,"I've always liked Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and would often recommend it to friends, but Mad Max: Fury Road (the fourth movie of the series) made me extraordinarily satisfied to a supreme and fanatical level, satisfaction beyond belief, like no other moment in my life. It is hands down a nuclear bomb in the world of cinema even if you have never seen any of the last three Mad Max movies. George Miller will surely be remembered as a giant of the movie industry because of this. Every single person walking out of the cinema could be heard praising the movie as a masterpiece, similarly to people's reaction to the Star Wars movies back in the days. This was on a level of epicness that can barely be described. The vast majority of people told me they were physically tired after seeing this movie because they burnt all their energy trying to mentally capture and remember every-single moment of the movie. The characters were amazing, the level of detail was mind blowing, the Mad Max universe stimulated me, the quality of the shots were perfect, the stunts were gigantic and impressive beyond imagination and the amount of stunts was insane. The whole movie is almost one non-stop adrenaline rush of beautiful shots. I didn't know it was even possible to make a movie on this level.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Just a too long chase, really.","I had high expectations of the movie as I had heard positive stories of it. I had watched the three previous Mad Max movies on the previous week and thought that really almost anything would be better than the awful Thunderdome. Well, certainly the Fury Road wasn't such a flop. I just didn't recognize it as Mad Max anymore, really. It wasn't the dystopian Earth anymore but like a fantasy world in a distant galaxy, a bit like Sin City meets Star Wars meets the Lord of the Rings. In the Road Warrior everything was in a really small scale, but now the tribe of the warboys was living in a gigantic fortress which would be hard to build even with modern technology...To start with, there was an overdoze of special effects. It just makes the world feel not real. It's ok if the action should be ""cartoonish"", but I'm not sure if it was the intention. The plot was also boring, really nothing more than just a looong chase. Actually so long that in the end it was hard to concentrate on it anymore and then all of sudden you realize that ""whoaa did the big boss just died, not sure as I almost fell asleep"".It wasn't as bad as the Thunderdome, though. At points the action really had some balls and in overall the movie was quite ""stylish"". It's a pity that the story itself wasn't up to all the effort that was used to make the chase look like a computer game with steroids. But maybe this is a generational thing...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overated.,"Well, I finally got round to watching this. I noticed it was regularly in the 'top whatever' rankings, so felt I could no longer resist. It started well, lots of noise, fast car chasing, explosions, gangs of violent thugs beating each other up...great! I thought just my kind of film. Problem was, that was the whole premis of the film. From start to finish it was bang, crash, wallop, boom. Then start again more of the same. No originality, no story - something about getting to a 'green place' - that you felt they'd forgotten about, until very late on.

Masterpiece,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a Australian post-apocalyptic action film, starring Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicolas Hoult and is directed by George Miller.This film is amazing! A true action film for the ages, and just like the trailers show, it's all action, it hardly slows down in its 2 hour running time, yet it also has a fun yet simple story, interesting characters and great world building.In the stark desert wasteland populated by a broken humanity driven with survival and the unending ravage for gasoline, a loner named Max finds himself unwantedly caught in the middle of a chase while aiding the heroine Furiosa, and her female companions, she struggles to return to her homeland and escape the clutches of a ruthless dessert gang leader, Immortan Joe. With the harsh desert sands in front of them and marauders behind, only the maddest will prevail the storm.I only just caught up with all of the previous Mad Max films and enjoyed them greatly, and i feel like this one fits right in with the previous ones. Tom Hardy has replaced Mel Gibson as ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky and he is just as good as Gibson, Hardy is an amazing actor and he doesn't have a lot to say in the film, like the older films, but his physical acting makes up for his lack of lines, you also understand his mental condition more in this film than previous ones which i thought was interesting, in the older films i didn't really think that Max was crazy but in this film Hardy proves that he is. Nicolas Hoult plays Nux, a warboy, who is on the antagonist's side of the fight in the film, i thought that Nux was a really interesting character because in the older Max films, we saw all of these insane tribesmen fighting and don't really understand these crazy characters, Nux lets us into that kind of mind-frame which i found fascinating, Hoult played him very well, and is unrecognizable in the role, not just because he shaved all the hair off his body, because this is a side of the actor we have never seen before, and he has the best line in the film which has become the tag line for the film ""What a lovely day!"" Saving the best character for last, Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa, by far the most bad-ass character in the film and one of the strongest female characters that has been put on the big screen in quite a while, like Hoult, Theron also shaves her head and sinks into her role as Furiosa, she is arguably the main character in the film, having the best lines, great action and emotional scenes. While Max is just along for the ride in this film Furiosa is taking charge, looking after people and trying to save them which was nice to see. I thought it was interesting that while Max is a big part of the film and the namesake of it, Miller decided it doesn't need to only be about him.The side characters are also interesting, Immortan Joe's wives are all strong women which each have their own thing to do and feel like real characters instead of just plot points which was nice to see, the main antagonist Immortan Joe was also good, played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the first Mad Max film, he was a intimidating, imposing character but not much more than that, we don't delve into his character like we do the others but i think that is okay because the film doesn't focus on him too much and knows that he isn't the most important thing in the film. The great thing about all of the side characters were their designs, they all looked so unique and interesting that they stood out even if they were not the most vital character, like Coma-Doof Warrior, who is a random character that plays a guitar that spouts fire and gets the enemy troops riled up, the character looks so cool that he is instantly a fan favourite.Going back to the action scenes because that is the most important thing in the film, Director, George Miller does such a fantastic job of keeping all of the action scenes fun and exciting, the film is 2 hours long and i'd say there is about 1.5 hours of action yet it isn't boring and is always exciting to see. Filming in Australia again was a great idea, the locations in the film are amazing, long rocky roads and empty deserts really made you feel like this was a post-apocalyptic world that these character are living in.The fact that the movie is one long action scene is a real big feat for me and it establishes the film as one of the greatest action films of the last decade. The actors are all great in their roles, i can't imagine any film being better than this, this summer.4.6/5",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Max Roars Insanely After 30 Years!,"This 30 years old franchise has eventually roared its way returning to the big screen with a greater filming technology and a bigger budget, though the same director after so many years, George Miller still succeeds in bringing another great entertaining sequel that is worth waiting for its epic action sequences and spectacular visual effects. Setting in future, the plot's apocalyptic society and sexual politics are pretty straightforward; combining the insanity, hyper- accelerating and exhilarating actions without repetition of styles, all are presented in a creative way which is rarely seen in recent films. While it's not necessary anyway, the film does not have much of characters development but both Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, as well as the presence of Nicholas Hoult have a great screen time of heroic performances. Meanwhile, musics by Junkie XL sound loud, tremendous and powerful (likely influenced by Hans Zimmer's style) surprisingly suit the film well, including the cool and classic cinematography by John Seale, Miller is able to deliver more than what audiences might be expecting, even with overdose f action scenes, it is still effectively balanced with emotional moments and inspiring messages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Oh what a day, what a lovely day!","That's what I said after watching this one! And what an experience. To be frank I have been urging people around me to go watch this one, as I was blown off by all the trailers itself. These days the movie marketing team is smart enough to make trailers worth while and all movies look good in the trailers, but very few live up to the expectations. This one is definitely one of them!To start with, the post apocalyptic world is shown truly beautiful. What if humanity was reduced to fight for basic survival instincts and basic resources like oil or water! Can you imagine what the world would be, cruel and mad that's what it will be! So all the dirt in the movie does really makes sense when industrialization in future world is extinct!The story is simple, our protégé who is more of a sidekick, is on the run from the bad guys, that's it! How beautiful is this concept, but it only becomes beautiful when it is executed properly. The last that I remember of such beautiful concept brought on screen was from our original Max (Mel Gibson in Apacalypto!). At times you never know what's gonna happen next and the adrenaline during the entire run of the movie of all audiences could be felt! All were in for a ride and kind of a race, probably felt heart! One can feel for Max and Furiosa reduced on single instinct of survival!From the start, the movie is breath taking, be not mistaken this movie is not made for laptops, LED TV's but has to be experienced only on big screen. That's because of its cinematography! Its breath taking and the deserts of Namibia (Or Australia?) is so candidly captured on frame. I will be surprised if this movie doesn't win the Oscars this year in the cinematography section. I never knew the desert would be that beautiful during day time, even better so in moonlight!This movie is for an action buff, don't look for performances here (although Charlize Theron clearly steals the show, her emotional outburst in the desert and the way it was captured was just awesome) This is the art of direction in an action movie which scores over acting... George Miller is the real star here!The direction and art work is also wonderful, and kudos to the mind behind George Miller who captured his imagination and painted on screen with magical moments during the chase, from guys hanging on a pole during the chase to a rock star with his electric guitar with n no of speakers behind him. Action 10/10, Cinematography 10/10 and the music! What can I say, the background score heard in the trailer, sounds even better in the movie!If James Cameron scores in best art movie direction with CGI effects for Avatar, then George Miller steals the show here with original stunts choreographed without CGI.P.S. Do experience this in IMAX/3D , it's really worth it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but lacking something,I quite liked this movie but perhaps not as much as I expected. I'm generally pretty cynical when it comes to sequels these days because there are so many (and a lot of them are terrible). I was genuinely expecting this one to be good though. I did enjoy it but it just seemed to be lacking a certain something. I'm not sure exactly what. The action scenes were every bit as good as what we've seen in previous Mad Max films. The look and feel were consistent with previous films so it definitely 'felt' like a Mad Max film (using plenty of Aussie actors like in the originals helped). The story was a bit light but honestly I think the same could be said about the other Mad Max films. I thought the acting was pretty good. Theron was superb as always. Tom Hardy had some very big shoes to fill as Max. I thought he was good but he somehow seemed to lack Mel Gibson's presence in the role and faded quite a bit in comparison to other main characters. The villains I found a bit underwhelming. There was the main villain of course but I think that perhaps there were far too many lesser villains and it got to the point where you almost lose track of who the good guys are actually up against.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best action movie,"""Mad Max"" is an exhilarating action-packed film that takes you on a wild ride through a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Its strength lies in the adrenaline-fueled performances by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, who bring intensity and grit to their roles. The cinematography is visually stunning, capturing the desolate landscapes and chaotic car chases with precision. The music adds to the high-octane atmosphere, driving the excitement forward. However, one weakness of the film is its minimalistic plot, which may leave some viewers craving more depth and character development. Additionally, the relentless action can be overwhelming at times, overshadowing the storytelling. Overall, ""Mad Max"" delivers on its promise of non-stop thrills, but its narrative and character depth may not satisfy everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

People drive around shouting and blowing up,"The original Mad Max films could best be described as an inconsistent trilogy (in terms of both tone and quality), so what exactly does this fourth entry bring to the table? Not a great deal, to be honest. There's a lot of action, explosions and grunting... which is fine I suppose, but the plot seems to serve as an excuse for the action, as opposed to being the driving (sorry) force of the film.

Poor descendant of a classic,"I very rarely write a review, usually just giving a rating as the minimum of 10 lines set by IMDb annoys me. However, as a big fan of the original Mad Max movies (the first and second ones, I thought the one with Tina Turner was rubbish), I felt the need to add my thoughts.When I found the page for Fury Road, I expected an average score of around 6 and was flabbergasted to see such a high score. The plot is weak, there is no acting to speak of and there is way too much CGI. This is a movie for kids and easily impressed adults, consisting of fighting, shooting ad explosions. I'm amazed that George Miller had anything to do with it as it is completely lacking in imagination or vision.

Or, something else for that matter, but nevertheless.Rewatch Max from the turn of the 80s if you want to watch a decent piece of film. This is like trash rock music with a bad music video. And I like rock, but good one.Only thing that is worth here is Charlize, who never disappoint and always add on movie score at least one star.

Mad Max Fury Road,"Mad Max Fury Road finally hit the screens around the world and let me tell you, the thirty years gap was well worth the wait. The technical achievement is beyond anything we see these days because it combines the best of modern technology with good old school cinema. CGI is definitely used as little as possible while stunts and special effects are put forward in this slice of madness tainted of nightmarish visions inspired by paintings of Dali and Goya. The colors, sounds, costumes design and characters development are amazing and the film turns out to be something completely unique, a savvy mix of action, adventure and visual madness. Probably the only film after El Topo that has had such an impact on me. Huge fan of the original trilogy, this film manages to respect the old style but pumps up the adrenaline and push the pedal full throttle into 21st century. What surprised me was the fact that mastermind George Miller, now in his 70's has managed to direct a film of an incredible modernity while younger directors today are incapable of doing something as fresh or as original as this film. Clearly a modern masterpiece filled with so much depth and visual elements referencing; the stolen generation, the gender issue, themes of slavery , servitude, redemption and human greed. Shot like a huge chase across the gorgeously photographed Namibian desert, the cinematography from John Seale, who came out of retirement especially for this film, is beyond anything I have ever seen. Every shot is filled with so much elements, so rich of details, I think I just took the biggest slap of my life at the movies. I highly encourage the audience to watch it in IMAX 3D because this film seems to have been invented especially for this technology... I assure you, films like this come only once in a lifetime and I feel blessed to witness the rebirth of the lone 'Samurai' and anti hero Mad Max Rockatansky. One little regret, Mel Gibson would have been a better choice than Tom Hardy who does an OK job but lacks the charisma and the natural flashing madness so unique and perceptible in the eyes of mister Gibson. Thankfully Charlyze Theron is impressive with her shaved head and mechanical arm, inhabited by a rare determination and burning the screen with her raw intensity, she will surprises a lot of people. Thoroughly thought and built this film is simply the modern achievement we needed for the rebirth of the action/ adventure genre in all its glory. One can only hope Mad Max Fury Road will destroy everything at the box office this summer so Miller will start work on his Mad Max Furiosa....When the V8 roars at the start, you will feel chills going down your spine and return to the state of a twelve year old witnessing the beginning of a new cult classic piece of cinema like we too rarely see these days... As a screen legend said once ... fasten your seat-belt...it's going to be a bumpy ride! and a mad one....",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thin plotted but a very entertaining non-stop action BLAST,"Not typically my kind of film and to be honest what got me to watch it 6 years later after it came out was the fact that I saw an interview from Tarantino where he praised it. And Im glad I did.All 3 (Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron & Nicholas Hoult) in leading roles did a great job here, but Nicholas Hoult was just different class here in my opinion, just a fantastic performance from him. Tom did what he usually does, played bad ass lonewolf action hero, well. Charlize nailed her role as well and I was surprised by the authenticity of her performance as a bad ass action chick.The stunts in this movie where amazing, top notch, they were so well made it made the moving thoroughly enjoyable all the way, even tho Im NOT about action like that.Just a full 2 hour blast of solid action, amazing stunts, spiced up with great acting performances.

Undeniably entertaining but a bit much at times,"Max, an über competent drifter (Tom Hardy) ends up helping a one-armed warrior-woman (Charlize Theron) pilot a massive weapons-studded rig across the stark deserts of a ruined world with a cargo of stolen wives whose bizarre warlord husband and his equally bizarre army is in furious pursuit of. This is the long delayed second sequel to 1981's 'The Road Warrior', one of the greatest action films ever lensed - a near perfect blend of humour, action, and stunts, with a fantastic (and often copied) aesthetic, great cinematography, and memorable characters (notably Wez, the gyro-captain and the Feral Kid). 'Fury Road' is equally well made but is too much of a good thing - a lengthy, hyperkinetic, physics-defying car-chase that is punctuated by some staggeringly good stunt work (although CGI is used to maintain the illusion that there were no safety lines, nets etc) that all begins to look the same after a while. The design work that went into the various apocalyptic vehicles is imaginative and fun, but the grotesqueries of the characters is a bit 'over the top' and the lack of 'narrative background' (the 'culture' of the citadel seems to exist only to set up weird or cool scenes) makes for generally undeveloped characters who exist only to chase or be chased. Great to see Hugh Keays-Byrne ('The Toecutter' in the original Mad Max (1979)) back and burning rubber on bleak wasteland roads once more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest action films of all time.,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a film that I truly enjoyed watching. The entire film was well constructed from top to bottom. While touching on the pressing topic of our world as we know it turning into a desert where water is a high commodity, the film has a lot of heart without verbally saying much. The acting from Theron, Hardy, and Hoult was deep. This film is very visual. From the cinematography, color grading, production design, special effects, and costuming, the film creates this amazing world filled with gold, red, and bright turquoise. It is an interesting combination of skull laden violence from the vehicles and warriors paired with the vast ethereal landscapes and white-clothed females. The combination works as these elements often go hand in hand. I enjoyed the cinematography in the film because it was very dynamic, and the edit worked great with the shots and furthering the story. Although there was minimal dialogue in the film, the soundscape and accompanying score took me into the world of the film. I enjoyed seeing the rock elements incorporated throughout the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Italian Mad Max rip-offs from the eighties were far more intelligent!,"Story is stupid beyond belief. We start from A to B, and when we reach B, we get to meet a ridiculous gang of granny bikers before we turn around and go back to A. That's about it.In the future this will be known as the Mad Max film where the protagonist becomes a background extra in his own film. Not to mention that you can't call it Mad Max if there is no Mel Gibson.Sure, the stunts are great, but they're basically repeating the same stuff from the previous films, albeit on a bigger budget. The big difference is that the previous ones did not have such stupid sequences like the sandstorm in Fury Road, nor did they insult the viewer's intelligence with the introduction of ""strong female"" type characters. They might have well named their film MAD FURIOSA or something like that, but that would have damaged the film's box office so why no stick the Mad Max logo onto this one?The film concludes with the rather disturbing notion of replacing the old elite with a new one. This is what is eventually going to happen to all the heroes of the cinema world. Get replaced by female/androgynous parodies of male archetypes.On a positive note, the way language is used in this film is very interesting. The decline of civilization comes along with a decline in the way a language is spoken. Which, in a way, shows us in an exaggerated manner, how Australian English has deviated from the standard norm.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
this film should have been titled mad maxine.,"This film has nothing to do with max rockatansky, and honestly doesn't have anything to do with any of the previous films either, as its focused around the female lead (furiosa)and tom hardy's character ""max"" is nothing more than secondary scene dressing with like ten whole lines of dialog in the entire film. The whole affair had me feeling like a big bait and switch as i came to watch a mad max movie about survival and instead got some social justice nonsense about neo-feminism and other such garbage. Sure the stunts/car chases were what one would expect but the whole lack of actual substance combined with them forcing furiosa down our throats makes this a paltry viewing experience for any fans of the originals who were hoping for an actual reboot or sequel to the originals. In fact this could have been an entirely stand alone film with no ties to the max franchise and it would have made about as much sense, but i guess i should have just been glad there were no dancing penguins in it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Desert Odyssey: The Fiery Ballet of 'Mad Max: Fury Road',"In the arid wasteland, where humanity is broken and most everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life, there comes a film that bolts across the desolation with the force of a nitro-boosted war rig. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a phantasmagorical symphony of fire and blood, orchestrated by George Miller, a maestro returning to his hallowed dystopian vision.The film is a relentless chase sequence that begins as Max Rockatansky, played with gruff intensity by Tom Hardy, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe. But this is not Max's story alone. It is also, and perhaps more so, the tale of Imperator Furiosa, portrayed by Charlize Theron with a steely determination and a compassionate heart. She drives the War Rig, a massive truck, on a mission of liberation for Joe's enslaved wives. The ensuing pursuit is a ballet of vehicular carnage, a dance of destruction choreographed with such precision and clarity that each crunch of metal and burst of flame is a brushstroke on a canvas of organized chaos.Miller's vision is grand and unyielding, his world-building meticulous. The Citadel, a vertiginous tower of rock and despair, is a monument to the madness from which Furiosa flees. The vehicles, monstrous amalgamations of steel and engine, roar with a life of their own. The costumes and makeup are not mere attire but narrations of lives lived in extremity, tales told in scars and spikes.The narrative is sparse; words are precious commodities in this world. Yet, the story is told with eloquence in the silence, in the glances exchanged, in the roar of engines, and in the quietude of the desert. The film speaks in the universal language of action, a tongue understood by all who witness the spectacle unfurling before them.Junkie XL's score thunders in the background, a relentless drumbeat that fuels the film's frenetic pace. It is driving the narrative forward with as much urgency as Furiosa's quest for redemption.""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is not without its quieter moments. There is a tenderness in the camaraderie that develops between Max and Furiosa, a shared understanding of loss and hope. There is poetry in the vastness of the desert, a stark beauty in the emptiness that offers a respite from the cacophony of the chase.The relentless pace, while thrilling, leaves little room for contemplation, for the audience to catch their breath and ponder the intricacies of this world. The dialogue, though sparse, can at times feel stilted, struggling to rise above the din of the engines. And while some of the film's feminist undertones are refreshing , they can feel heavy-handed, as if Miller is determined to make a statement rather than let the narrative unfold organically.But these are mere quibbles in the face of the film's achievements. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a testament to the power of cinema, a reminder that films can be both art and entertainment. It is a visual feast, a narrative triumph, and a clarion call to the wildness that lies in the heart of all who step into the theater. In a world bereft of hope, Miller offers a fleeting glimpse of redemption, a chance to believe that even in the darkest of times, there can be light, there can be life, and there can be a path to a better world. And for that, we are all witnesses.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Initial reservations resolved,"When I heard a fourth Mad Max film was being made I was sceptical about Mel Gibson being replaced with Tom Hardy made me less enthusiastic about the film. Despite the former's fall from grace over the last decade he was still an iconic figure in the series. When the film played at the theatre where I worked I didn't give it much more than a passing glance and thought that it was obnoxiously loud. It would be over two years later when I caught a clip of the black and chrome version and was stunned by how beautiful it looked. I gave it a try. Despite my initial hesitancy to accept Hardy as Max those concerns quickly faded; he's fine in the role. But it was Charlize Theron as Furiosa that won me over. She says very little but the emotions play so vividly on her face and eyes. We are given very little about her origins,especially how she lost her arm but it's not necessary. Some who are going to be disappointed that Max is not much more than a secondary character in the film, which leads me to the question: Have you not seen the last two films. Max is only part of a larger story, much like The Man With No Name from the Sergio Leone Italian spaghetti films. There are scenes that are truly remarkable,especially one in which we see people on long stilts crossing a swamp. In the black and chrome version it resembles an illustration from any prog rock album cover of the 70's. I'm still unsure if this has surpassed The Road Warrior as my favourite action film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hit The Road Max,"Mad Max: Fury Road narrates a truck trip for 2 hours. Ok, this description doesn't sound very appealing...What if I told you that this truck is being hunted by crazy fanatic guys guided by a demented leader in a post-apocalyptic desert? Sounds more fun right? The absurd in the movie is always done smartly, Fury Road is an action movie but is deeply poetic and will take you on a journey through its visuals.The plot of Fury Road is basic but logical, solid, and corresponds to a story that takes place in a world devastated by a nuclear war. The point of the movie is the search for hope and redemption in a desert where madness is the norm. Indeed madness has a capital place in Fury Road. Max, one of the main character, is constantly wondering if he is crazy or if it is everyone else.The main characteristic of Fury Road is its action sequences. For some, these scenes are excessively present. In reality, everything is developed around it and I think the action is the essence of the movie. Indeed, Fury Road will thrill you from beginning to end with its high-speed pursuits. George Miller, the director, wished to make a movie using the minimum green screen and the result is mind-blowing. Some stunts in the movie are even performed by cirque du Soleil artists. Like I said before, this movie is absurd but in the right way, everything is designed to make you feel the insanity of the antagonists. Some sequences will probably make you wonder what you're looking at. This includes a suspended blind man playing a flame-throwing guitar on a high-speed vehicle.The other key point of Mad Max: Fury Road is its characters. The hero of this film is not Max like you would think but Furiosa, a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young wives escape from the film's antagonist. She is played by Charlize Theron who has a very impressive acting performance throughout the film. Furiosa is a strong female character with charisma and determination. The spectator can easily become attached to her and her fight for hope.Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the greatest action movies ever put to screen. Action scenes are awesome and breathtaking, characters are badass and the movie itself is mad. Fury Road will make you want to put flame-throwers on your car and drive it around at high speed while listening to metal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pure Adrenaline-Filled Awesome,"Perhaps the blood rushing constantly doesn't allow you to fully process what you actually just saw, but after checking out the bonus features, you have to realize that besides digitally removing certain things and enhancing colors, every stunt you see was actually performed-- and usually at top speed. I'm talking about blowing up huge trucks, flipping cars, motorists jumping over vehicles, and so much more. Easily my favorite are the pole-rider guys; you may remember them from the trailer on these huge poles to swing from one vehicle to another. Yeah, guys trained for weeks to be able to do that. And I might as well say, kids, no matter how cool it looks, I only give you permission to attempt these stunts as long as you capture it on video so that I can laugh at you later.Now I can go on and on about these epic stunts and explosions and kills and action and fighting, but even that doesn't give the movie full justice, for it is one of the most fully-realized movies ever. George Miller had this brilliant vision, and the product is a story told with hardly any lines spoken by the main character-- or other characters for that matter. The women are given strong roles to emphasize their importance, not feed on weakness, and the message Miller gave his unit was loud and clear and wonderful: Even though this is a post-apocalyptic world, that doesn't mean it has to be bleak and lifeless and bland. This movie is vibrant and beautiful. To put focus on how humans would actually scramble to find remnants of beauty in a forsaken world is a great twist that enhances the story and the experience.Now let's talk about the Oscars. And there's a lot to talk about. This film won 6, all these very technical awards including his wife winning for editing, and nominated for 4 others. Not only did Fury Road win these Oscars, but it had to beat The Revenant to do so. Granted, that masterpiece beat it in directing and cinematography, but that's rightfully so. I think a lot of people were questioning why an action flick was winning all these awards from an academy that is known for excluding action, superhero, and blockbuster flicks. I am so glad it was recognized that this high-octane movie had such a vision that came together like nothing else. It's so hard to compare it to the other Oscar nominated films, but it is also really hard to compare it to action films in general. Generally, you have the opening action sequence, background of characters, perhaps a twist halfway through, then a balance of action scenes and talking scenes with a huge climax. And that is not Fury Road. My favorite vehicle from the armada is the huge cargo truck hybrid with drummers beating on the back and a guitarist suspended with strings jamming out and unleashing flames (it's an actual flamethrower guitar). That to me embodies the movie. A weird, weird world full of rocking characters on a chase set to a score with an equal amount of pounding drums and quick guitar jams. It's so cool, but still so intricate with the suicidal half-lives who follow Immortan Joe.This film changes the game. The progressively more intense sequences keep piling up for some of the most fun you'll ever have at a movie. Will other movies follow suit? And more importantly, how does George Miller create a respectable sequel after this?You can check this review and dozens of others out at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a Lovely Movie!,"George Miller is back stronger than ever!!! The new ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was nothing less than a perfection and it even outshines the previous movies. It gets you hooked from the first minute until the very end, without letting you take a breath out of the action. It's a thrilling, non-stopping action movie with amazing visual effects and great actors.The 2 lead characters are played by Tom Hardy (Max) and Charlize Theron (Furiosa) and if anyone wonders how well Tom Hardy did as Mad Max, he was simply amazing portraying him. He fits really well in the shoes left by Mel Gibson. Then we have Charlize Theron who plays Furiosa and can I just say how glad I am that George decided to create such a strong female character who is the most badass girl I've seen in movies for a while. Her character was pure joy for the eyes. She makes you feel what she's been through the movie and all of that while fighting and killing dozens of bad guys. We really need more badass chicks like her in future movies.""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one of the best (if not the best) action movies in the last 10 years or so. Hopefully the movie will have huge success and we'll see more movies in the Mad Max universe sooner rather than later. Hopefully my next review will be for ""Mad Max: Furiosa"" and it will be for another awesome movie.

What a lovely day!,"Mad Max 4ury road is one heck of a movie. While not as good as ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" this film manages to breath new life into the Max Mythos, and has me very excited for any future sequels. Enjoyed this one thoroughly. Tom ""For You"" Hardy Kills it as Max, and Theron is a total unrepentant BadA**. This is what action movies are all about. God, it's so cool. it's just....a really cool movie. I can't stress that enough. The main plot involves Max teaming up with Theron's Furiosa, begrudgingly at first, but slowly gaining each other's trust, to steal a Warlord's prized collection of wives, and deliver them to safety. The simplicity of the plot allows for some beautifully well crafted action sequences, set against an intensely colorful and gorgeous background. This is just a well made, well acted, well written, and downright entertaining addition to the Mad Max Saga. It's a ten from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Everything it should have been and then some,"All other films that think they can call themselves ""action blockbusters"" please step aside to make way for the only true blockbuster this summer, and for many more summers to come I'm sure, Mad Max: Fury Road. Oh. My. God. This movie right here. This explosive, obscene, grotesque, beautiful movie right here was everything I ever wanted it to be and more. George Miller, after thirty years, has returned to his legendary Mad Max series, and he's returned with the some serious firepower at his disposal. Firepower in the form of 150 million dollars and the limitless wonders of modern technology. Miller fires off this ammunition at full force to create the impossibly vast and intimately gritty world of Max Rockatansky in the grandiose way I think he envisioned it from the start. Upon seeing the first trailer for this film I said it looked like the Mad Max film Miller always wanted to make but didn't have the tech or the money to accomplish. Seeing the movie in its glorious two hour entirety affirms that statement.Mad Max: Fury Road stands alone from its three predecessors with the titular character and his post apocalyptic scenery being the only thread that combines them. Fury Road presents a wholly original story taking place in the wasteland where we meet a water hungry colony ruthlessly ruled by Immortan Joe, the film's badass big bad. Despite having plenty of water, Immortan Joe hordes it to keep control of his colony while he impregnates his forced marriage wives, called Breeders, with the hopes of them bearing future warlord sons. The story gets going when Imperator Furiosa, played by an ass kicking Charlize Theron, betrays Immortan Joe (sick names right?) and steals the Breeders to get them to a land referred to as the ""Green Place."" Max, previously captured by Joe's War Boys, ends up getting mixed up in Furiosa's campaign and finds himself aiding them on their long treacherous trek through the desert wasteland, all the while being pursued by Joe and his allied gangs from Gas Town and The Bullet Farm. Did I mention I love all the names of everything in this damn movie?My memory of the original Mad Max films is somewhat limited, especially when it comes to more specific elements of the world, so I might be wrong in saying that Fury Road has some of the most ingenious and in depth world building I've seen Miller accomplish. Even if I'm wrong about that, the post apocalyptic society Miller has constructed in Fury Road makes for an incredibly poignant and gloriously over the top statement on what humanity might devolve into after the apocalypse. He does a fantastic job of bringing Max into the modern era as well. Where gas was the most precious of all resources in the original trilogy, it now takes a second seat to water, the resource most craved by society. Being in California, this element hits frighteningly close to home.Everything Miller does in Fury Road affirms and expands on everything that was so great about this series before it's budget had nine digits. As was the case with the previous Mad Max films, Fury Road isn't a story primarily about Max himself. The story really focuses on Furiosa and her own hero's journey across the desert as she quite literally drives the plot forward. She fuels a plot that ultimately has an awesome feminist angle by the end, breaking down gender barriers and making the women of the film the most exceedingly capable and overly wicked characters. I've already mentioned how awesome Theron is, and her accompanying group of supermodels...er... Breeders quickly transition from damsels in distress to a resourceful band of hot chicks who also kick a lot of ass.So, I want to just come out and say this. This movie is a visual MASTERPIECE. I'm not exaggerating either. Yes, I saw this movie less than 24 hours ago and my testosterone levels are probably still spiking, but I will stand by that statement as long as I live. Mad Max: Fury Road is gorgeous. It delivers some of the most wildly imaginative action set pieces every conceived and some of the most creatively constructed chase sequences I've ever had the pleasure of watching play out on screen. I said a lot of things about The Avengers: Age of Ultron action scenes that I would repeat here about being clearly displayed and easy to follow, but where Fury Road surpasses this is by showing just how beautifully shot these scenes can be and what happens when you accomplish the capturing of the impossibly huge scope of the Australian outback setting. This desert wasteland is MASSIVE and the film constantly reminds us of that in wide shots that would make Kurosawa require a change of underwear. Yeah I said it.Also, this is one of those incredibly rare moments in my film reviews where I would actually highly recommend the 3-D. It is one of the many many things expertly utilized in Fury Road. Miller expertly uses it as a tool to immerse you in his world, rather than a gimmick for a few mediocre sight gags. Fury Road is a film that traps you in its insane world for two solid hours of entertainment, and you come out on the other end in a haze full of sand, blood, and nerd tears. It's a transcendental experience, guys. You need to experience it. Seriously, you are doing yourself a major disservice if you don't go see this film, so drop everything your doing and get to the theater to see Mad Max: Fury Road.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Mediocre Pursuit,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" sets off at an often relentless and disorienting pace, which some may find more bewildering than exciting. The film's striking and vivid colors evoke a visual style reminiscent of darker sci-fi realms or the aesthetics of video games.In this chapter, Tom Hardy takes on the role of Max, but his portrayal may leave viewers yearning for a more conventional and relatable hero. Max's limited dialogue, replaced by animalistic utterances, contributes to a sense of disconnection between the character and the audience.The action sequences in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" are undeniably extravagant, with a penchant for pushing the boundaries of plausibility. The relentless pursuit and audacious stunts, while visually impressive, may border on the excessive for some viewers.Regrettably, the film's storyline is notably thin, serving more as a backdrop for the visual spectacle than as a fully developed narrative. The world it portrays is bleak, with survival as the central focus, and this simplicity extends to the storytelling.""Mad Max: Fury Road"" may dazzle with its aesthetics and action, but it falls short of achieving a balanced cinematic experience.

Now That's How You Remake.,"Strong female characters fighting the patriarchy - another woke remake right? That's what I thought and I was wrong.First, there are real strong characters in this one, many of them who happened to be females - really strong because they get by even if they don't win every fight against opponents twice their weight classes. They're strong like old strong cinematic women were; Their strength doesn't come from their sex, but from their personalities. They get no free passes on their heroine's journey like it is currently the norm.Theron here is as reliable as ever, more and more credible as an action figure. She is the main character of the movie, and she deserves every bit of it. She looks right at home in this arid cyber-diesel dusty drama, made out of monster contraptions, fanatism and cheap life.Now, for those who weren't sure about it, this is a movie filled with action scenes, but all of them have an odd element that makes one suspended at the edge of the seat, captive yet entralled.

Purity of form,"I don't have a lot more to say about this fine film and what may be the last action film with extremely limited CGI. If you are an action junkie or like the Mad Max series you will love this film. It does everything a post-apocalypse film should do. But the feature I like the most about it is how simple and pure the film is as a story.At its core this film is a redemption arch for Furiosa and this plot is demonstrated in straightforward ways-i.e. The final shot of the character she is raising up. That the film is-more or less-a chase sequence followed by a race sequence-only adds to how elegantly simple it is. American tentpoles, action films in the 2010's have largely been convoluted and cluttered-quick explain Endgame's plotting in a single sentence! The film explains just enough to be engaging but doesn't get bogged down in ""mythos"" filler. The characters are developed just enough to be memorable. But there is no fat in this film.

Miller does a superb job of bringing to life the world he has created.Another great thing I love about this film is that Miller doesn't go crazy with CGI - in a day and age when it seems nearly every movie uses way too much of it - this movie feels very organic and it looks amazing because of it.

No Mad Max here; sorry,"There's some of the old films' magic here. Clever costumes and rigs and props made from scrap metal, with nutty personalized touches. People with crazy names.

I don't even know who the stand-in is, but he has no personality. Charlize Theron is physically imposing but doesn't get to do a lot of acting. The supporting actresses are just eye candy for hetero men, their flimsy desert wraps artfully placed to just barely cover the naughty bits. The plot is a well-worn scheme about a tyrannical ruler who uses control of resources and a bogus mythology to suppress the masses.

A new landmark.,"It is rare for reboots and remakes of classic (or at least kind of memorable) intellectual properties to not be conceived by major Hollywood studios as a scheme to make a cheap profit without any regard to quality. How about for a reboot to entirely stand on it's own? As of a week ago, I could think of two (""Casino Royale"" and ""The Dark Knight"").And out from the bare and beautiful desert rides film ""mastermind"" (that is what they call him in the trailer) George Miller, revving his armed, armored, nitro-spitting vehicle of a film ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" which I can safely call the best action movie of the decade, possibly this century. Here Miller employs a refreshingly streamlined narrative as the foundation of some of the craziest practical combat sequences, entirely inventive set, machine and sound design, and surprisingly deep performances, all combined to rewrite the rules of action filmmaking.The plot never takes any ambitious twists and turns, but it never really needs to, especially considering how much storytelling is executed through non-verbal means. The sand-soaked horizon, the off-road vehicles that look as if they were taken apart and put back together again with bigger engines and more spikes, and the primitive, one tracked nature of each character provides everything that needs to be known about the environment. Miller implies countless stories about each character with little to no exposition, and because the main characters of Max and Furiosa have been assembled and presented with such care, the performances, especially Theron's, become much more powerful. It is almost as if the atmosphere around the characters has eroded them so much that they have lost any use for speech, and seeing such a beautiful thing lost to a world man has inflicted upon himself really hurts on a level that no dialogue could possibly explain.For the first time since I-have-no-idea-when, we have practical effects on the big screen. The entire movie was filmed on location in the Namib Desert of Southern Africa, and all of the automobiles were entirely functional. Because these sequences are filmed in real time with actors performing highly dangerous stunts such as vaulting from one moving car to the next on 30 foot poles, they have an energy and risk surrounding them with twice the thrills of a film largely shot in a green screened room that will be saturated in CGI when post production approaches. Even scenes that have to be computer generated, such as a blood red sandstorm that the warboys fearlessly enter exclaiming ""What a Lovely Day!"" in insanity stricken jubilee are believable because cast and crew fully commit to Miller's vision, refusing to let such a monumental concept ever feel cheap. The cinematography captures the action in all its colorful glory, never masking any loose ends of stunt work or pyrotechnics.Most importantly, the film travels quickly while still retaining a shape and a core. For all of its explosions and heavy metal guitar players rocking out on top of a roaring armored car with a flamethrower attached to the guitar's neck, the movie has dynamics. When a sequence ends, it gracefully fades out into quiet, allowing time to contemplate over the destruction and the endless desert ahead, as well as a moment to study the complex predicament that Max, Furiosa and the wives face. When the camera sweeps through Immorten Joe's armada, individual motors and warboys fade in and out of the mix according to the camera's position. When gunfire pierces brief tranquility, it does not oppress the movie from each direction, but rather it occurs in one corner of the theater and crescendos into the movie's next event. A filmmaker's job is to make use of light and sound to create art, and Miller's new film is crafted in those terms to the absolute highest caliber.Some may call ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" a dumb Hollywood action flick. They may call it one giant action scene. But even if it does not require heavy brain activity to enjoy, even if it has extensive expertly crafted combat sequences, it certainly has a purpose. ""Fury Road"" is hope in the midst of hopelessness, a world where battered individuals will travel for hundreds of days to reach a land that might not even be there at the end of the journey. In many ways George Miller's struggles with this film's production, which went on for sixteen years, parallels Max and Furiosa's journey to the Green Place. Miller had no idea whether or not his efforts to make this film would ever pay off, let alone if the movie would ever finish production. Fortunately for him and moviegoers alike, ""Fury Road"" pays off in every definition of the term. It is classic movie-making at its best, and an unforgettable film going experience.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Love the Austrailian bleak future MAD MAX known,"This story given Excellent based on my devote' to this saga NOT losing its caliber. WHAT???? Much of this genre for this saga kept its bizarre content very well. What indeed would this country go to IF, it allowed itself to become a wasteland? Most of it already is interiorly for those of map looking.Good to see familiar face of C.Theron from her commercials and Ridley Scott/Prometheus movie. She was admirably convincing in this part as one of two people bringing down the tyrant symbol all the people at story start wanted freedom. WHAT ELSE IS NEW? Those marvelous chase scenes need you allowing them to slowly show you why some vehicles appear how are.

A pretty freaking great action movie,"I've been super excited for this since I saw the trailer. I was more excited about this than I was about Avengers: Age of Ultron. Did it live up expectations? Hell yeah it did! This movie is freaking awesome. It kicks all the ass. Is it the most thought provoking film ever? No. Does it have an amazingly original story line with super complex and deep characters? No. When you get down to it, it's a 2 hour chase scene. But that doesn't matter with this movie. It wanted to be fun and it achieved that. What sets this apart from other movies that try to be nothing more than ""fun is the fact that it doesn't waste time on a story that doesn't matter anyway. Lets use the Transformers franchise as an example. Overall, pretty terrible franchise. Why? Well a lot of reasons, but the one I care about here is that each movie wastes time on pointless crap that doesn't matter. It's a Transformers movie, I want to see Transformers fight. I don't want to watch humans argue in a Transformers movie. Those movies can't be fun if they keep wasting time on stupid stuff. Mad Max doesn't do that. It lays out the basics, so it makes some amount of sense, then they get straight to the action and it doesn't really stop. We get two glorious hours of exceptionally directed action scenes with no crap in between. This really is one of the better action movies I've seen in recent years and I really hope they make more.

One of the best action films ever made.,"'Mad Max: Fury Road' is directed by George Miller and stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult and is the fourth installment of the 'Mad Max' franchise. In this film, Max Rockatansky is captured by a warlord's henchmen and is taken to their fortress and is held captive. Once he escapes, he forms an unlikely partnership with former lieutenant, Furiosa, who is attempting to protect a group of people she cares for and return to her homeland. The action is superbly shot with no shaky-cam at all, it consists of wide-shots of chaos and anarchy throughout. This film is filled with relentless action and intense moments which are incredible. George Miller directs this film beautifully and with precision, so much so that I believe this film to be the best directed film of the year. The acting is excellent, especially that of Charlize Theron who portrays the persistent character of Furiosa. Tom Hardy is also great as the troubled character of Max who was previously played by Mel Gibson. The film is a non-stop action thrill ride but it also has a significant amount of feeling and emotion to it, especially scenes with Furiosa. Some scenes get really emotionally powerful later in the film. The film has an intimidating villain, a layered main character with intriguing side characters and amazing stunts. I well and truly loved this film. It is undoubtedly the best film I've seen this year and is easily one of the best action films I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pure action and not much else,"I hate to say this but I feel this movie is a bit overrated. The best things Mad Max: Fury Road has to offer are the multitude of intense, epic action sequences and the visually stunning landscapes and images that the film captures. Besides these traits, Mad Max fails to offer much more.While the film overall is still pretty enjoyable, its major flaw is that it fails to develop any real connection with the viewer. None of the characters are developed that well and none of their conflicts and goals are truly explored. The problem with this is that some of the scenes that are meant to be more emotional aren't very impacting.As mentioned, there isn't much else that is great about Mad Max. The acting is fine but nothing impressive, the story isn't all that interesting, the script isn't anything special, and in general, the movie fails to catch the viewer's attention except for when the action sequences occur. In conclusion, Mad Max: Fury Road is still a fun ride but just not with very much to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""A Dystopian Masterpiece of Chaos and Colors""","In a world where silence is scarce, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" roars to life, presenting a cinematic experience that is as visceral as it is visually stunning. From the very first frame, George Miller immerses viewers in a post-apocalyptic landscape that is simultaneously haunting and breathtaking, where survival hinges not just on brute strength but on sheer will and ingenuity.This film defies traditional storytelling, opting for a relentless, high-octane chase that spans the entirety of its runtime. It's an audacious decision that pays off tremendously, delivering a narrative driven by action rather than dialogue. Each pulse-pounding sequence unfolds like a symphony of chaos, with expertly crafted visuals and choreography that keep the audience on the edge of their seats.At the heart of this vibrant chaos is a haunting exploration of humanity-its depths and its extremes. Furiosa, played with fierce determination by Charlize Theron, is a revelation. She stands as a beacon of strength and resilience, shattering traditional gender roles in a genre often dominated by male protagonists. Her mission to rescue the oppressed Women of the Citadel is not just a plot point; it's a powerful statement of defiance against tyranny that resonates long after the credits roll.The film's aesthetic-characterized by its stunning use of color, stark contrasts, and imaginative vehicle designs-creates a world that is both familiar and alien. The deserts of Australia serve as a perfect backdrop for the exhilarating action and thrilling visuals. Meanwhile, the eclectic soundtrack pulses through the film, heightening every chase and clash, ensuring that viewers feel every moment's urgency and drama.""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is far more than an action film; it's a profound commentary on society, survival, and the lengths to which individuals will go for freedom. It challenges viewers to reflect on what it means to be human in the face of despair and destruction.In summary, this cinematic achievement deserves every accolade it receives. It's a rollercoaster ride that redefines the genre, reminding us that even in the dust and chaos of a brutal wasteland, hope and courage can still flourish. Every frame of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a testament to the artistry of film, making it an unforgettable experience that will resonate with audiences for generations to come. ✨",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Classic,"A harrowing depiction of post-apocalyptic life with amazing scenery, staggering amount of detail, VERY brief and succinct dialogue, constant shifting of allegiances and a keep-you-guessing story line.

Now...This is what action movies should be like!,"The movie starts out with a bang and it seems like it never ends. Not that that is a bad thing. It's a thrill ride from beginning to end. The action scenes are amazingly well done. The acting is great, though I did think that some of the wives could have done a better job at it. The characters are really interesting. This movie finally gets the female action hero right. The movie is as much a Mad Max movie as it is a Furiosa movie. The story is not that complicated, but it has layers of deeper meaning to it, which you can choose to ignore and just enjoy an action movie, or give it some thoughts. Either way, it's a very good movie. The desert landscape is beautiful! The vehicles and machines are very detailed and look great. What also stood out to me was the score by Junkie XL. He really outdid himself here. During one of the amazing action scenes I thought to myself: ""Holy sh*t! The score is absolutely amazing!"".I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!

6 out of 10 at best,After finishing this movie I wanted my money back the problem is I didn't pay I watched it at my friends house. He was telling me how good it was and I completely disagree. Visually it was great but the acting was sub par and the story was weak I would rather watch the first three movies then watch this again. I may give it another try but I seriously doubt it. I am a big Tom Hardy fan but this has to be the worst movie he has been a part of I hope that if he is in any squeals that they give him a way bigger part and a better script.

Crazy aesthetics,"Awe-inspiring aesthetics and masterful photography. The film unleashes a devastating force and arrogance in all its directorial and scenographic choices starting from the punk and cyberpunk taste of the costumes, to arrive at the meticulous quality of the never banal chase scenes and furious fights aboard whimsical and eccentric cars. In the face of the fact that this ""action package"" occupies most of the vision after all, and therefore it would have been easy to fall into repetitiveness. These are undoubtedly positive elements, which fill in all respects the semblance of emptiness (desired and not at all dystopian) in the deepening of the plot of the characters, and in particular of the protagonist. These latter criticisms of the film are understandable, but nevertheless they do not in any way undermine the audiovisual experience, which is decidedly of another level compared to modern action cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Well-made action setpieces, but lacks in everything else","It took forever, but I finally saw it. Mad Max: Fury Road was probably the most hyped up movie since Gravity. Everyone was talking about it. Some people even saw it more than once. But when I heard about the movie being pretty much 98% car chase and 2% story & characters, I knew it wasn't really going to be my kind of movie.First, let's get to the positives. The production values are incredible. When I watched the movie, I really felt that all the vehicles, costume designs, make-up and even the (mostly) practical special effects just had a lot of heart put into it. There was an incredible attention to detail. And that's what I admire about the movie. These people wanted to make a REAL movie, not just have actors in front of a green-screen and fix the rest with a computer.The cinematography was also excellent, a real visual treat to watch. Another thing the movie does right, putting some actual effort into the photographic outlook.There were also some decent comical elements, like the guitar player mascot, some goofy and odd-looking villains and some sporadic hilariously out-of-place lines.So what did the movie do wrong? Well, the biggest problem is that the characters are just not that developed. There are some brief glimpses of possible character development, like Max having flashes from leaving people behind and also Furiosa in general. I was thirsty for knowing more about her, but it never went beyond her badass-surface. Pretty much all of the girls Furiosa had with her (Which she kept locked up, what the hell??) had zero characteristics at all. The closest we get to character development there is a woman being worried about her baby. Okay, note down:Character trait: Worried about babyGot it. Let's move on. What is most disappointing with this movie is, unfortunately, Mad Max himself. He just didn't have a personality. Furiosa wasn't developed much, but at least she resembled somewhat of a character and I could root for her. But Max is just... a regular guy. Not the Bruce Willis-type of regular guy, but simply regular. Tom Hardy is a pretty good actor, but he got way too little to work with. He oddly enough had pretty much the fewest lines in the whole movie, not to mention that when he had a line, it wasn't very memorable. You don't give your main character quotable lines??? Whazzamatterwithyou? A letdown and waste of Tom Hardy's talent.The story itself was also... Oh who am I kidding? The only story I got here was that people need water and a villain is hell-bent on having someone's baby. Speaking of it, what did he need the baby for? And where do the weird girls come from? What purpose do they serve? And who did Max leave behind? Was it his daughter? Someone else's daughter? Jesus, this movie leaves more questions than it answers.Does it work as passable Friday entertainment? To some extent. But it's definitely not a brilliant movie. I dunno, maybe I was just the wrong crowd. I just want flesh AND bones to my movies, not just bones.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Way too over the top for me.,"The original Mad Max had some undercranked shots to speed up the action. It looked fake but conveyed the message of speed. Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior had some of the same, but was a bigger film with bigger production values and a bigger story. Mad Max III with the late Tina Turner diverged from the credibility aspect of the first two films, but the shots were still real stuntmen with real vehicles.Mad Max Fury Road just throws all credibility out the window. The Road Warrior, which is my favorite of the films, is by far the best, and inspired me to take the vehicle combat genre and put my take on it on the big screen after I got my degree. Regrettably my parent's advisors didn't like my path of success and stopped me at every opportunity. As such I never got a chance to muster the resources needed to shoot a trailer or proof of concept film for my take on the genre, which would have been more in line with something like Black Hawk Down or the Road Warrior, but certainly not ""Fury Road"".Gibson is missing, probably due to his very impolitic comments regarding his father's position on Jewish people, which I think is unfortunate. Mad Max is not his father, an I think keeping him out of the loop takes away what I think was much needed continuity for the film.There's a massive reliance on CGI and digital backgrounds to present an Australian desert landscape that never existed. And stunts that would impossible without actors or stuntmen doing wire work on a green digital stage. Gone are the Mohawks and commandeered police cruisers from the first films, to e replaced with bare chested marauders and children painted white, and extras dressed in post apocalyptic rags.Car bodies welded on top of car bodies, sporting those dump truck tires from mining vehicles using in deep mining pits, and just a whole host of over wrought and over done or over the top art direction that detracts from the grounded reality of the first couple of a Mad Max films.I wouldn't call this a movie, though technically it is, so much as a comic book or graphic novel ported to the cinematic format.My film would have had actual weapons, no over the top stunts, been in line with actual physics, and been real or realistic, and not have any superhero moments in it, unlike this movie which keeps pouring on one unbelievable action stunt upon another.And that's more a comment on today's commercial feature films aimed at not just the teenage audience, but the teen-oriented mind. The kind of adult who can't grow up and still reads ridiculous comics with scantly clad women and over muscular men doing heroics that are just unreal on every level. Whether it's Marvel Pictures with Disney and their Thor, Ironman, Spiderman or Avengers movies, or Warner with their DC pantheon, or Paramount trying to reinvent Star Trek and introduce new spy film properties with like stunts and antics.It's just garbage. And the dialogue is just as juvenile. Fortunately Fury Road still makes a pretense of trying to appeal to adult teens by keeping ego driven dialogue out of the film, but the art direction and over the top stunts and heroics are just too comical and comic book oriented for this viewer.It's all action and stunt work. There's no introspection by Maxwell Rocketansky on anything. Oh well. George Miller is a doctor, and made his Mad Max films as police recruitment posters. This one was clearly aimed at the graphic novel crowd that doesn't know from good theatre, and only digests junk food media.It's a shame. Gibson is gone His character is gone. The smart and well grounded realistic film making is gone. And what we're left with is a lot of spectacular visuals, but nothing of good writing for character observance and reflection. Oh well.Look, it's not the worst film ever made. It delivers on action and visuals, but with all the tools Miller had to work with, he went for the three-ringed circus approach. My film would have been much different, much more scaled back, still plot driven but with character moments, and not a police recruitment film.I don't recommend this movie, but if you want really way out action on your screen, and a threadbare plot that really doesn't explain much, then Fury Road may be the film for you.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Proved me wrong,"This was better than I was expecting, even with all the rave reviews I just didn't think I would like it as I'm such a huge fan of the originals. I figured it would get Hollywood-ized with Charlize Theron looking like a post apocalyptic starlet, all pretty and clean and then CGI'd so that it lost that cool unique atmosphere of the original. Neither of these things were true.Set in a sun parched post apocalyptic future, we again follow loner Max (this time he is Tom Hardy) as he gets caught up in the plight of a group of warrior women as they flee from an evil ruler/dictator across a desert wasteland.Most of this movie is one big car chase, which actually isn't a bad thing, full of high octane stunts its pretty awesome and also keeps the atmosphere and tone of the originals perfectly with lots of weird, crazy characters. Its desolate, futile and Hardy is mostly silent.

"An epic visual marvel of an action movie, with enough ideas to keep you satisfied and engaged","The opening to Mad Max may well be the most attention-grabbing I've seen, gluing me to the edge of my seat eager to see how the movie unfolds. The energy and visuals continue to amaze throughout, though the early world-building was the best storytelling in the film. The vision of the desolate post-apocalyptic world was so well realized, I was a bit disappointed when I realized the movie was pretty much exclusively going to be a big long car chase. The opening 20 minutes or so, when we see Max chased and caught, meet the ruler and get a sense of how the world works, and meet Furiosa and get a sense of her plan, are near perfect filmmaking and great set up for the characters and world. We do learn more about the girls and crucially more about the people working for the ruler through Nux, a stowaway turned traitor, but the movie is light on character development, dialogue, and plot. That's not all bad - Miller is committed to making a thrilling visual action movie, and he undeniably nails that. The action is so well shot it makes similar action sequences feel fresh and exciting. There is some relevance to contemplate as we see Furiosa certain that there is a green place where she grew up, only to realize it was an illusion in her mind and that her only real hope is realizing the potential of where she has been living and taking control there. I admire Miller's commitment to making a great action movie and not forcing a bunch of dialogue or romance in, but while I marvel at the craft and visuals of the action, especially early, the other elements are good but not great, and even the greatest action scenes repeated for 2 hours can't maintain that same level of awe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A lesson in action movie making,"Max swings in front of the camera, holding for dear life to a pole, while vehicles that would even look out of place at a monster truck derby blow up behind him, like an orgasm after one of the many action sequences that make this movie. The scene reminded me of the one with the ladders and trains in The Lone Ranger, another recent film to get action right.However, unlike LR, Mad Max Fury Road does just what its title promises : it races straight on, leaves you next to no time to breathe or look at your watch. In a way, the movie made me think of an opera. Grandiose almost to the verge of ridicule, but epic enough to sweep you along for the ride. Characterisation and plot are there and something rare happens, the story actually continues to unfold as the action goes pedal to the metal, instead of taking a break while you look at all the beautiful explosions. What about the action? you ask. Well, forget your shaky cams and frantic editing to make up for the lack of actual skill involved. The set pieces are fast and all over the place, but you never once wonder where you are, what's happening, and where the protagonists are in all this mess. After such a magnificent love letter to action thrillers, one can only hope some of them action-makers take a notepad with them when they go watch this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An In-Your-Face Action Masterpiece,"Imagine this: you're in a theater, but instead of simply watching a film, you're grabbed by the shoulders and violently shaken for 2 hours; THAT'S the fantastic experience of MM:FR. It's less an adrenaline rush than a direct I.V.-shot of caffeine into your bloodstream. Faster and more furious than the most recent car-based movie, it's kinetic action in the style of a fever dream. A punk-rock, post-apocalyptic nightmare that's a feast for the senses, benefiting from director Miller's visionary and fearless eye. Pure, unadulterated insanity that reminds us what it looks like when great artists try something uniquely extraordinary and succeed. Miller's main achievement is getting everyone to buy into this insanity. With the scale of a blockbuster and the soul of an indie, MM:FR is unlike anything you'll see in theatres this year. Hardy as the new Max continues the characters reactive-style heroics with just enough heart behind his crazy eyes, and all the supporting cast portray their varying levels of madness with crazed conviction. However, all of these talented performances are overshadowed by the amazing aesthetic. Through grimy, herky-jerky visuals, Miller gives us practical-effects-filled action sequences that are masterpiece level. This isn't to say there isn't something deeper going on. On top of being of a feminist manifesto, a study of religious extremism, and an argument that capitalism leads to death, it's ultimately a moving story of equality and hope that proves goodness can defeat desperation. Haven't seen the Mel Gibson originals? That's okay. Don't let the daunting task of seeing all those first keep you from one of the greatest action films in years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Late to the party but finally watched this movie,"I put off watching Mad Max, Fury Road because I loved the first three Max movies, yes, even Thunderdome which actually may be my favorite of the three, and I didn't want to see the franchise ruined by modern Hollywood bs which I suspected when I saw Theron as the lead.But I finally watched in and although I almost bailed in the first twenty minutes or so from freak overload I stuck around and am glad I did. Is this movie on par with it's three predecessors? No, it's not, but it wasn't bad either, it does entertain throughout it's run time, even if it's in a very simplistic way.Back in the 70's (dating myself here!) chase films were big for a while; Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, Vanishing Point, a few others. They consisted of just enough character development and plot to get by but mostly consisted of one long chase scene. That's what this movie is.We don't learn much new about Max, or most of the other characters. We do learn Theron's characters back story but that's about it. The characters and ""plot"" are only there to support an action film that consists of a two hour chase through the desert and not much else.The stunts are very cool, as befitting a Mad Max movie, the vehicles are also cool, as is the makeup, although the freak meter could have been dialed back a few clicks. And it did hold my attention throughout. But at the end of the day it's really nothing more that a lot of noise and explosions and loud music...I didn't hate it, and I don't think it tarnished the Mad Max legacy, but it didn't really live up to it either. If they're going to make more Max movies, and I hear they are, I don't think they'll be able to get away with this again. There needs to be more to it than there was here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max returns to theaters after long hiatus in furious fashion!,"After viewing Avengers Age Of Ultron a couple of weeks ago and now this one, I have to give this film the edge as far as enjoyment goes. 'Wow' is just one of the words I would like to use when describing Max's return to the big screen...a return that was long overdue and it was very nice finally seeing a Mad Max film in the theater. The film put forth here is one of intensity and nearly nonstop action, a film that does not have its characters stopping in a random place so that we can see some back story that really is not relevant to the plot, no flashback scenes so the director can tell you why the characters are the way they are...no, here we have simple action and the characters' actions telling you what they are about. It would be nice to see other Mad Max films in the future and it is possible as Tom Hardy did sign on to do three films. More than likely if they did get made, Max would once again find himself in the middle of a dispute that he really wants no part of, but begins to feel the need to help.This film starts out with Max getting captured in record time as he is taken to a place called the Citadel which has water and greenery in abundance, but said greenery is controlled by a man named Immortal Joe. A woman who apparently drives for him, named Furiosa begins her next mission, but she is about to break ranks with Immortal Joe and Max will soon try to help her and her cargo escape the demented mad man and his crew of crazies in an attempt to find a place away from the madness.It was great seeing Mad Max again as Miller made sure a lot of the staples from previous films were included as well as some odes to the previous films. It was nice seeing the sawed off shotgun, the pursuit vehicles and the nitro. Makes me wish they'd let Miller direct one of the many comic book adaptations as he proves you can create a film that is nearly all action without it looking like a cut scene from a video game. Tom Hardy does admiral filling in for Gibson, had they made this film when Miller had originally envisioned Gibson would have been in the lead role once again, but Hardy looked the part and it did feel like he was Max. It was also neat seeing that Miller got the actor who originally played the Toecutter from the first film to be the main villain here, though he is most definitely a different character.So yes, really good action films with very little talking can be enjoyable to watch. Why wouldn't they be? I've never understood at times why they always feel the need to make action movies and such accessible to everyone. It is not as if they add gun fights and car chases to a musical to make it more enjoyable for a male, so why they always seem to do this for people who do not like action films seems a bit silly. Granted, you may lose some of the American audiences money, but a film like this is going to thrive in the foreign market. I at least hope it does, because I would enjoy seeing Mad Max on the big screen again; however, if I do not I will at least be satisfied with seeing this one as it was an incredibly intense action film rarely seen these days.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The best action-film in a long time!,"The movie starts of with a voice-over, and 15 seconds in to the movie, the action has already started!

This whole movie is simply put a 2hour-long chase-sequence with real stunts, chaotic, but easy to follow explosions and fight-sequences (unlike the mess in Michael Bays Transformers movies...). This movie works so good, mostly because of George Millers vision. He's got such a great control over the action and the universe. Miller is the star of this movie, even though he doesn't appear on-screen (that I noticed.). When I walked in to this movie, I was a bit afraid that two hours of this would get boring after a while, but I guarantee you that it doesn't! The universe this takes place in, is really interesting, and the thing this movie does right, is that it doesn't tell you everything. It doesn't explain every single little detail about everything, considering the fact that it's probably less than 100 lines of dialog in the movie. It's visual storytelling, so the universe is as complex as you make it yourself. You can see this movie for the action alone, but there is a lot of interesting elements besides the action, even if it's only sort of hinted at. The great thing about the action, is that very much of it is done with practical effects and real people. This makes the movie feel more authentic, and it's a nice break from the cgi-heavy superhero-movies of today, even though there is some cgi, it's never too much. You feel the speed and the action, and instead of slow-motion, this movie use quite a bit of speed-up footage, which adds to the insanity of the movie. The movie is visually really stunning, and I especially liked the feel of the nighttime scenes (which were actually shot at day, but touched on in post-production.) It's visual beauty. The characters are also very interesting. Mad Max himself, is pretty much Mad Max as we know him (even though Tom Hardy has taken over for Gibson). Theron plays Furiosa, which is a female protagonist right up there with Ripley and Sarah Connor. Personally I think I found Hoults character Nux, the most interesting. I won't spoil anything, but he's great. The villain, called Immortan Joe, is a classic Mad Max villain, especially considering he's played by the same man who played Toecutter in the original Mad Max. His presence makes the movie even better. Overall I will say that Mad Max: Fury Road is hopefully a future classic, on par with MM2: The Road Warrior, and other action-movies like Die Hard and Terminator 2. It sure as hell deserves it. This movie is like an awesome roller-coaster. You're in for a ride that will shake you around for two hours, and when it let's go, you will, if you're anything like me, want to get right back on for a second spin! It's insane, and makes the Fast & Furious movies look like they're meant for kids (and I like those movies too.). This is just so much more thrilling. The plot may be a tad too simplistic, but that didn't bother me, because the action weighs up for it. If the Taken sequels had action-scenes like this, I wouldn't complain one second for the lack of an original plot! This movie is just so inspired, and feels so fresh. I can't really explain it with words, you just have to see it for yourself. Chances are, you'll either love, or hate it. It all depends on your taste in cinema, but it sure as hell fits me perfectly. I will also say that it's a movie that is meant for the big-screen, so don't download this on your computer or watch it on a small, bad TV. If you can catch it in the theaters, than do so! The visuals, and the soundtrack is best enjoyed on a large scale. (The soundtrack is awesome btw. And sort of played by the people in the movie, I guess you've seen the guitar-player in the trailer!). Watch it in theatres now!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Good not great.,"If you love the original trilogy, you should love this. All but the character of Mad Max is brilliant.If you love action movies, you will love this.If you don't enjoy action movies, don't bother.I felt as though not enough was done with the titular character. Either they found out too late Tom was a bad choice, or they just didn't bother with Max. Tom had a few lines and grunts, then didn't speak the rest of the movie. There wasn't any explanation to what was going on with him. The effort was put into Charlize and Nicholas' characters.

Mad Max packs a punch!,"Written and Directed by George Miller, we are taken on an epic roller-coaster ride down 'Fury Road' in this new 're-imagining' of a cult film.Starring a lifetime best Charlize Theron, acceptable Tom Hardy and a surprisingly flawless Nicholas Hoult as an out of the norm 'War Boy', this picture magnificently uses every ounce of technology and special effect, as well as a huge amount of real stunts and crashes to give the audience some of the best action scenes in world cinema history.Okay there are no real shock, the action is a bit crazy the characters weren't developed in depth, but who cares...It's called 'Mad' Max...it's in the title! My only personal disappointment is the lack of Aussie actors in the leads.The film genuinely leaves the mouth wide open throughout and coupled with music scores by Tom Holkenborg this really is a must see this year on the biggest and loudest screen you can find!This will finish after the hundred's of thousands of votes with an 8.2 - 8.5 mark my words and has a clear right to be in that top 50.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Furiosa to the Max,"Let's back off a little and look at who did this movie: The original Mad Max director! The guy who made all 3 previous movies then. He didn't really have much money when he made the first one (which is considered a classic and has some nice stunts, but has aged badly, feeling blown up at times, filling time to get to the 90 minutes mark), but it was successful enough to make more. The second movie was considered to be the best. Up to this point that is ... we have a new king (with a mad Queen by his side).So a 70-year old man brings you this movie that could and should be played in film schools. But don't get it twisted, this is entertainment as it should be. Unless you have a case of ""macho gone wrong"", there is nothing you can fault in this. The beginning alone almost had me jump up and down with excitement. That's 5 minutes into the movie ... and more (insanity) was still to come.If you can fault the movie for one thing, it's that you don't get as much Mad Max (the character) as you got before. But it actually makes Tom Hardys character even more mysterious. We don't really know what he's about (it does seem to lean a bit on the previous installments, character development-wise, if you want it to be - but that's up to the viewer to decide). You don't have to have seen the previous movies to get this. And even if some things seem inevitable (and some might say cliché), the movie itself is just superb and pure entertainment. Stunts, ideas, editing, score and more all blend into a very fine movie indeed",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Dystopian Success,"This movie was....Awesome. I have seen this movie twice and plan to see it again in theaters it is by far the best Action movie I have seen in years.This movie doesn't only live up to the original three movies, it might actually be better than them. This movie is action, pure action. No matter how hard I try I can't think of a scene in which there wasn't well choreographed action. But, it wasn't dumb action there was a strong plot backed up by strong and compelling characters. Aside from this movie being pure action it is packed with strong performances from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Tom hardy kills it in this role and he only says like 5 lines. Charlize Theron gives a thought provoking and emotionally resonating performance that added undeniable depth to the movie. This movie is a must see. A",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
At Last An Action Movie With Good Action?,"I wanted to see this really bad after witnessing the mountain of positive reviews and a score of 8.8 on this site, also I wanted to see if it was anything like The Road Warrior which I enjoyed immensely in my teens. So after watching this film in the theaters I have to agree with the hype, this movie is at last an action movie where you can actually freaking see what happens and where the action is kinda logical,where questions of ""how and why"" make sense and the moments when they don't are few and far in between.I feel like I have to make this clear, this is an action movie and should be reviewed as such(it is what it needed to be), compare this to most of the action movies that Hollywood produces each year and yes this is a masterpiece from that point of view. Although I don't know if I can agree with this being No25 movie of all times, but I can see the appeal of it.The visuals where astonishing,not only can you almost see every detail that is important, it is also beautiful to look at. The stunts were amazing and directing from a technical point of view was really well done. The non stop action that glued you in your seat just wins the Oscar here, entertainment at its finest. The actors for the most part were good, Theron was awesome as Furiosa and the main villain Immortan Joe left a good impression on me, and the dialog was entertaining to say the least(what a lovely day indeed...). Why 8/10? Well, minus one point for some flaws here and there and for the plot which could be a tad better (although you can argue that it was good enough for an action movie), and minus one point for Tom Hardy as Mad Max. Although I don't consider him a bad actor or that he was horrible in this film, it might be just my personal bias because I liked Mel Gibson much better and I inevitably compare the 2 of them.Overall this is an action movie that you have been dying to see, forget Transformers where you can barely see who fights who(scratch that, you can't see even that..) or Fast and Furious where a car under 1ton stops a freaking tank(yea that happened..), here you have Mad Max:Fury Road that retains the ridiculous over the top elements that its predecessor possessed combining it with non stop action that is clear and makes sense. Nothing more and nothing less.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Visual over-sophistication, waste of good actors","The initial Mad Max movies were crazy and odd enough, but they had a solid plot with character dynamism and a lot of lines, but the one in question is a constant and rough chasing, with vague characters performed by celebrities (Hardy, Theron, Hoult - all distinct actors otherwise), model-type ladies (performing doubtful roles as heavily pregnant women handling heavy machinery and ""kicking butt""), and ""unseen"" actors (faces with warpaint/masks). True, there are some silent and pensive scenes in the middle, but they seem out of context, as a pause for audience to catch breath before uproar starts again. Just back and forth on the same deserted landscape, with even explosions and shots not influencing some characters' exterior.The only personage I liked somehow was Nux (skilfully performed by Nicholas Hoult), but his change of sides remained mystery to me...All in all, the movie is like a protracted Manowar video or a road movie inside out, but the conceptual element regards visuality only. The rest is rather mediocre, at times annoying, meaning that visual effects might be a supporting component of plot only (e.g. Tarantino's movies), not the substitution of activities / logic of events.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
≈ The Most Insane Movie Of All Time ≈,"In the best possible way.Going into this movie, I feared that all the hype might be too high. An all out action movie receiving a staggering 99% on RT is very rare. However, I can assure you, the hype is met. In fact, this film exceeded most of my expectations.First off, I have to talk about the cinematography. Simply put, its staggeringly beautiful. The camera moves around these wild car chases in such a fluid way, its almost poetic. The colors of the barren desert are eye popping and every grain of sand on the ground is captured in such detail.Now, the action. It is just insane (yes, I had to use that word again). And the best part about the action is the rawness and grit of it. My hat goes off to George Miller, who at his age, has achieved sometime outstanding. The direction of the action is what makes it amazing. Beautiful, wide, long takes mixed with quick pace editing. It is something to be witnessed on the big screen.The soundtrack is also perfectly fitting. Harsh, unforgiving, intense. When a moment of tension arrives, it is enhanced by a subtle yet prominent soundtrack, which gives it that extra edge. In the climax moments of the film, the soundtrack begins to rise in tone and give the car chases and absolutely epic feel. Another great aspect of the film.One of the only tiny, mini, little gripes I had with this film, is the acting. Yes, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are excellent as the two leaders of the film. However, the supporting cast, especially 'The Wives' had some moments of awkward and forced dialog; it didn't seem natural. Even Nicholas Hoult had some slight moments that took me out of the movie, and seemed like an actor playing a part.Nevertheless, I absolutely loved this film. This is the reason I love movies. It is the ultimate form of escapism. You go into the theater, sit down and just get lost and have a great time for 2 hours. It is the purest form of entertainment; exactly what this movie was supposed to do.I believe this film is a milestone of action filming, and shall be remembered that way for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

what a film! what a lovely film!,"...well, maybe the word ""lovely"" isn't the BEST way to describe it, although the visuals are quite beautiful.I'd say that the best words to describe ""Fury Road"" are awesome, intense, chaotic, and jaw- dropping. It is one of the greatest action-adventure movies I have ever seen. Not only is the action well shot and executed, but the entire visual style has an epic quality to it. Everything from the character designs to the color pallet work together to form a masterful cinematic roller coaster ride.This brutal and monumental instant classic also contains likable characters, strong performances, and subtle storytelling. As George Lucas once (ironically) said ""A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing."" ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is full of mind blowing special effects, and also contains a pretty outstanding story. there are moments of genuine power and tenderness. At times Miller puts the action on pause, and the spotlight is now on the characters. So, despite this film containing seemingly non stop action, it still is strong enough script and character wise to keep the audience caring and engaged.I would also like to note that I very much admired how Max's backstory is mostly kept a mystery here (perhaps it is explained in the original films, which I have yet to see-although I do plan to sometime soon). Instead, it is made clear that something has happened to him- there has been some tragedy in his past life, and it effects his character. It shows some kind of human weakness, almost like the final scenes of ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"". Warren Beatty's character always seems like the toughest guy in town, but by the end the pathetic nature of human beings is shown, and his weaker side is at last exposed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

And Charlize Theron is a good actress, I had no problem with her being in the film either.The problem wasn't the casting choices. The problem with this film was the film itself.

The best action film of the decade.,"It was clear to me that George Miller's intention with this soft reboot of Mad Max, was to make a 2-hour long action sequence that tells a story. And this movie accomplishes that ambitious task flawlessly. In this post-apocalyptic wasteland, our anti-hero Max Rockatansky, is captured by the ruthless war boys, who are under the command of the wasteland's dictator, Immortan Joe, who has power over the remaining lives on this deserted planet by controlling the only source of running water guarded by his lovely sons and his war boy army who are on the never ending quest for gasoline, weapons, and utter chaos with the hopes of arriving at the silver and chrome gates of Valhalla. In order to save what remains of the planet from total destruction and slavery, Imperial Furiosa, the badass one armed truck driver and expert sniper will need to team up with Max and the renegade war boy Nux in order to rescue the enslaved wives of Immortan Joe, and find the ""Green Place"" in order to save them selves and find hope in the never ending suffering of the wasteland. What separates an action film like Fury Road from movies directed by Michael Bay or any other boring mindless action film, is that the action in Fury Road means something. The constant fighting and amazingly choreographed chases our characters go through, they go through it because they'll find redemption not only in themselves but also in the post-apocalyptic nightmare in which they come from. The action has significant meaning to the overall theme of this movie which is hope. And on a technical level, this movie is breathtaking. The chases are real, the explosions are real, the vehicles ARE REAL, and because of that, George Miller has a made a film that will forever be timeless. This movie is amazing, I was literally sweating after seeing it in the theaters. It's about as visceral and compelling as an action film gets. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An exhilarating two-hour chase fest in George Miller's unique universe,"Much like Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange, George Miller's Mad Max universe is comprehensively innovative, right down to details like vocabulary and attires. And one of the most pleasant surprises about this revival of the Mad Max series, 30 years after Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, is exactly how Miller has honoured and embellished these peculiarities of his universe, and made them the basis for the film. The result is that Fury Road feels like a story which emanates from a world and an environment which has been sitting there all through these 30 years, instead of being simply a construct of 2015 action sequences with an imposed Mad Max design. This is quite an achievement considering the fact that the film actually is more or less an endless series of action sequences: an exhilarating two-hour chase fest starring a dichotomy of characters and an absolutely amusing array of avant-garde/retro vehicles and equipment. And when Miller still is able to make all this work so well, despite the simple good/evil distinction and the perpetual nature of the story, it's all because of first-class craftsmanship - with actual, practical stunts and effects - and a complete immersion in his bizarre, truly original universe.

The entire plot is totally idiotic to be honest and serves only the purpose to create one action scene after the other. If you manage to shut down your brain for the 2 hours running time you might be able to love this movie, and I think it is sad to see how many people are able to do just that, because like this there is no reason for the producers and studios to care more about the script and they will continue make idiotic empty eye candy movies.

This is crazy in so many ways,"Insane action packed, two hour road rage movie, that more or less sums up this crazy film, George Miller still got it, coming back after 30 years and making this in just the right spirit and with all it entails is amazing.This film is an instant classic, even though a film where they drive around for two hours sounds like something that gets boring, it just introduces new strange characters, one more crazy then the next all the time and keeps the action and tempo at a very high gear. I was entertained from the beginning all the way to the end and there was enough to see and think about on the way, caught myself sitting with open mouth and a big grin on my face many times.The acting is not deep, but there are many characters, one more crazy and strange until the next one shows up, how did they find all these crazy people and drag them out into the deserted lands miles from civilization. Well actually there isn't much acting for most parts or not in matter of lines, the only one that really pulls through on this is Charlize Theron, she delivers a good performance, is a tough girl and still keeps the glimpse in her eye. Tom Hardy on the other hand more or less grunts through the first half and gets a few more lines through the rest, but he does deliver a good performance as the main male character, crazy, mad or driven to insanity of sorts, Max is his name :) The young Nux played by Nicholas Hoult also does a great job, we see the world through different perspectives through his eyes, first as the mechanic that wants to be accepted into Valhalla and later he finds that there is other ways.Hugh Keays-Byrne plays Immortan Joe, don't know if he is the only one, but he was also in the first Mad Max movie from 1979, I think it was missing a Camio from Mel Gibson or Tina Turner, that would have been a fun surprise.All in all bang for the buck, really nicely topped of with visuals and music that just fits perfect into this desolate wasteland and crazy character scenario, two thumbs up from me and a big happy smile.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
an epic modern masterpiece,"What are action movies today? They are a sea of CG, PG-13s just for the label, Marvel super heroes, and Michael Bay jokes. But every so often there is something like this. and while this is an existing franchise this moves shows us what a modern action movie should be. One of the draws of the original Mad Max trilogy is the real stuntwork during the action scenes. There really is something special about watching an actual stunt and knowing it was done for real. Mad Max Fury Road actually is real stuntwork like it's predecessors- but not only that it is far more ambitious in every action scene. Just about every move someone makes or a crash during an action scene here really is a spectacle. The theatrical trailer is just a small taste of what happens. And I estimate that 50-75% of this movie is pure action- yet it somehow doesn't grow old. But this is not a CG free film. However CG was only used to remove stuff like rigging and wires- which makes the action even more spectacular. Another spectacle this movie has to offer is the production design. Just looking at the vehicles and how most of them are pieces of different vehicles is just incredible- and they all were real. And at last there's the story. This movie sort of is a remake of the original Mad Max and The Road Warrior but at the same time is it's own original film. Not only that but there's the aspect of the characters- and despite the massive amounts of action, every major character is completely developed, and even the supporting cast is very memorable for different reasons. In actuality the story keeps the action from getting old and the two parts actually are almost the same thing. This movie is almost a month old at the time I'm writing this review and this is one of my top 10 favorite movies. This may not be the case for most people, but the use of action as visual storytelling really left an impression on me and I wish more action movies will follow in its footsteps. It really is impressive that 30 years after the last Mad Max movie and after 14 years of delay that George Miller brought back his signature series with a completely new vision. I look forward to the sequels that come. This is a really simple summary and it does not do the movie the justice it deserves. Mad Max Fury Road is a movie that cannot be summarized in words. It can only be experienced.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Oh what a film, what a lovely film!","'Mad Max: Fury Road' can best be described as the film equivalent of an adrenaline shot! A literally breathtaking movie, that offers the best action seen in years, even though relying on a somewhat thin plot.Still, this doesn't mean that there is no story whatsoever. Director George Miller, the mastermind behind this whole franchise since the very beginning, does a nice job of familiarizing the viewer with the crazy post-apocalyptic world he created. Set in a desert wasteland somewhere in the future, this world is weirdly appropriate mixture of BDSM, steam-punk and motor-heads. Our hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy, who replaces the original Mel Gibson) is captured by the so-called War Boys, an army who belongs to the crazy tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), whom they worship like a god. Joe rules over a region, called the Citadel, with endless water supply, yet limits the water rations of his people to a minimum to assure his leadership. One day he sends out a War Rig, driven by his lieutenant Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), to get fuel and bullets, which just like water are rare goods in this world. But Furiosa has other plans: Together with Immortan Joe's wives, his 'breeders', she plans to free herself. As Joe finds out he and his army of War Boys start to pursuit her. Max, who's being used as 'blood bag' to a sick War Boy called Nux (Nicholas Hoult), has to come with them, strapped on Nux's car. From here on a crazy movie emerges, that defines the expression action-packed in a new way! Explosions, car-chases, fight-scenes, everything happens at once, at an insane speed, captured by the camera in the most beautiful and iconic way one can imagine. The movie clearly benefits from the practical approach they took. One catches himself to cringe at some of the impacts seen on screen. The few CGI-heavy sequences fit in well with the rest of the film. The great soundtrack and sound-editing make this one of the liveliest movies of the last couple of years, maybe even of all-time. Thankfully the movie doesn't solely rely on its fascinating action. Instead it manages to bring in a lot of interesting characters and a thin, yet perfectly functioning plot. Especially George Miller's ability to establish his characters and give all of them interesting personalities is impressive, considering how little talk there is throughout the whole film. Particularly Imperator Furiosa deserves to be mentioned here: She is, probably even more so than Max himself, the main character of this movie. Her hope and search for freedom is what this story thrives on. Furthermore she is one of the strongest female characters in recent movie history, both meaning that she is kicking ass, but also well written, developed and understandable which is often a problem with female leads. The wives are also worth mentioning. They could have easily become one-sided forgotten characters, or even worse, annoying 'eye-candy', who depend on a man to save them. Instead all of them have their own character-traits, which make them likable and individual. The plot itself functions mostly as a justification for all of the insane action, but still offers enough substance to involve the viewer emotionally and intellectually. Some might even shed a tear here or there. Yet, one thing must be said about the dialogues. As I mentioned earlier there isn't a lot of talking in this movie. That's no problem. However, the use of dialogue is one. Instead of letting the imagery speak for itself or implementing things in the dialogue, important plot-points are often just spoken out directly which comes off a little weird from time to time. This is, seen in the greater context of the movie, forgivable, but could have been done in a smoother way. Performance-wise Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are both great as lead characters, even though Theron's star shines a little brighter in this one than Hardy's. That's no surprise since Max mostly communicates via grunts and gestures whereas Imperator Furiosa is a more fleshed-out character, who experiences far more emotional changes and who develops therefore a closer emotional attachment to the viewer than Max. The supporting cast is solid throughout, led by a brilliant Nicholas Hoult. Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley bounces back from an awful performance in the awful Transformers 3 as the 'lead' wife and Hugh Keays-Byrnes is a wonderful villain. If somebody is faintly reminiscent of the first 'Mad Max' seeing him - he played the main villain there, too.'Mad Max: Fury Road' offers everything one might hope for and probably even a little more. The mostly handcrafted action is obviously the selling point of this movie and that alone is worth the entrance. Still every action-sequence serves to develop the story as a whole, which even though short offers enough turns and twists to keep the viewer interested. As a whole this movie is a brilliant showcase for all studios on how to revitalize a beloved movie franchise in a fresh yet recognizable way. If this turns out to be George Miller's last movie one can only congratulate for ending his career with what might be the best action-movie of all-time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It is not as remarkable as the original trilogy, but amazingly perfect as a separate Mad Max movie","Yes, this new Mad Max is a non stop chase movie without a real story which some people complained about, but this doesn't mean that the movie is disappointing. The other way round, I really felt a film after years! What the action movies are lack of these days is heart and soul and this movie got it right! Most of the new generation blockbusters have lots of action, digital effects, high technology, maybe magnificence but without emotion and spark. Hollow movies... This Mad Max movie is not a bluster movie. Somehow, there is a drama in the background. There are chases, but not for the sake of it. We care about the characters. As for Mad Max criticism as he was not the hero or star of the movie, it didn't frustrate me. While I was watching The Dark Knight Rises, I was always asking ""where is the Batman? where is the Batman? because Batman was like a cameo in the movie. Mad Max is different. Max is there, waiting for you! I mean it works here somehow. Everything works well in the movie. The story is (if there is one) is plain and simple, but somehow it works perfectly. Story development is not powerful, but the movie doesn't need that. Maybe, only flaw of the movie is the underestimated villains. The master director George Miller doesn't do justice to the great villains of the film. A great villain is another thing that new generation action movies are lack of. We rarely see the main bad guy and his henchmen, especially his muscled son are not effectively used in the film. The villains are intimidating and haunting but mostly, they were more like pawns in the desert. However, this is not a big problem. Everything is done as it should be. As for Tom Hardy, as a fan of him, it was a pleasure to watch him again, but I couldn't see him as Max, he was more like the son of the mad max than our old, original character. However, I liked him as a character. Mel Gibson could have joined the cast as a cameo, but it seems that he didn't want to do it. What about Furiosa hype that has shaken the world? Well, Charlize Theron was remarkable, but don't expect the most legendary character of all time in movie history or something! Not unforgettable, but a very gritty character portrait. The girls were charming and their story was sad, but maybe their surreal existence was out of place in the movie. The opening scene of the movie was disappointing for me, but then the movie turned into a breathtaking, non stop journey, an amazing freak show with fuel, machines, fire and blood! The action scenes were an example of incredible technical craftsmanship. I just want to congratulate all the cast and crew for this hard work. In comparison with the original, old trilogy, a powerful story with a development is missing here, but as a separate film, my favorite film of the year so far. There is tears, there is fun, there is fuel and there is blood!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hype,"This is probably where Tony Abbott is taking Australia.I find all the 10/10 reviews very suspicious. It was a run of the mill, dull, dumb action film. The plot consists of a chase up a road and back again, I'm not kidding.I've just read that I have to write a minimum of 10 lines of text for this review. That's a bit ridiculous considering the script can't have been much more than that.Bizarre fact; the director's last two films before this were Babe 2 and Happy Feet. Mind you, the intelligence needed to understand this film is way below the 15 years requirement to get in to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Furiously Majestic: George Miller Reboots the Series with A Beautifully Entertaining Film,"Here's a question: can an action film ever be considered art? Usually with big blockbusters such as Avengers or the Fast and Furious series, explosions are paired up with corny dialogue. Never do we see a film that treats this genre with respect and is willing to take risks. The last time such a movie, of the action/blockbuster genre, was able to achieve such balance and quality was probably with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises. But we have another savior, in the shape of mastermind George Miller; his latest installment in the Mad Max series: Mad Max: Fury Road, might compete to be one of the best films of the series, and I will be bold enough to say that it is one of the best films of the year.Mad Max: Fury Road achieves such a high caliber due to the incredible simplicity of its plot and the lack of unnecessary sub plots featured in today's action flicks. Fury Road avoids telling the entire backstory of our main character Max (Tom Hardy replacing Mel Gibson), and simply jumps straight into the action with Max being captured and held prisoner. We are in post apocalyptic Australia (although the film was filmed in Namibia due to the very rainy season that Australia had). In the original Mad Max films of the early 80s, the main concern then was a nuclear apocalypse, while this film sticks more or less to that apocalyptic theme, one can't help but look at the dry landscapes and relate them to the climate change epidemic we are facing. With Max prisoner to an oppressive leader of survivors named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), we move on to the story of Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who ends up being the true main character of this story. Furiosa is a loyal and celebrated commander of Immortan Joe's army of War Boys. However, as the story opens we see Furiosa betray Immortan Joe and steal his personal Breeders (women slaves used to feed and reproduce the survivor population). A chase ensues and Max, being used as a blood bag, for an ill soldier named Nux (Nicholas Hoult) is taken along for the ride.What is most impressive about this film is that the majority of special effects used for the explosions and flying cars were not CGI (according to IMBb 80% of the special effects were live stunts). I think the risk alone of that by the actors is enough to earn my respect. However, the explosions themselves were panned to look beautiful; this paired with the either heavy metal soundtrack or Verdi makes most of the fight scenes feel majestic.George Miller is an aged director (70); he's made various great films including the original Mad Max trilogy, and the more family friendly Babe and Happy Feet. What is most striking about Fury Road is the lack of dialogue. Apparently Miller had composed the film using storyboards first, it was only after that that a screenplay was written. And I think it's the fact that Miller created the story visually first that makes this become a precise spectacle.This lack of dialogue also allows our actors to display the frantic paranoia that verges on insanity. The performances from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are amazing, but the true surprise here is Nicholas Hoult. Hoult is probably better known for his role as Beast in the new installments of the X-Men franchise; in Mad Max he plays a crazed War Boy who has Max as his prisoner and blood bag. Hoult portrays his character with a restricted insanity so that he seems scary enough, but one does pity him. Tom Hardy plays Max with more grunts than dialogue, and when he does speak he uses a voice that recalls his role as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. However, after such scarring moments of his past one cannot blame Max's character for having gone well, mad. So in that aspect, Hardy does a good job in handling the role. As for Charlize Theron, she plays Furiosa with a composed viciousness; since she is not objectified in this film as the attractive female that she is, she was able to show the range of her acting chops with more ease. In fact the majority of the second half of the film was filled with a womanpower that was appreciated and, in the apocalyptic setting, didn't seem forced at all. It was only in some points that the actors felt a little lost amongst the chaos so that some character development doesn't end up being too realistic.So in conclusion, Fury Road is the perfect reboot/sequel to the Mad Max trilogy. The beautifully created action sequences along with and explosive pace are enough to make one feel goosebumps. George Miller you've done it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Again IMDb.?... Again?,"Last time I felt really misguided by IMDb was Dark Knight. OK, Heath Ledger's Joker was good, action was decent but that movie was really NOT one of the 10 movies of popular cinema. anyway, the third movie Dark Knight Rises didn't surprise me after all, it was really really bad.And we had Road Warrior. This movie was something else. There's no other post-apocalyptic movie like it - even no action like it. Mel Gibson / George Miller had a really unique and flawless chemistry there, the movie really freaked me out when I was a kid (aaah 80's!). Third Mad Max was a kind of joke near it, so I didn't even bother to watch it.So when I heard Mad Max is back I was really excited and waited for this movie for so long. And when I saw the perfect reviews and hype on IMDb, I thought OK,this will be epic.Umm, yes it's not bad, no no it's really good - as an action flick. It's way better than soo overrated Dark Knight movies. It's better than zillions of action movies... but this is nowhere near Road Warrior. Tom Hardy is NOT Mad Max. If this movie has some other name - as ""The Fury of Post-Apocalyptic Desert People"" or ""What A Lovely Day"" I would give higher vote. But it uses Max's name... and it's not an easy name to use.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I felt my boomerism rising up while watching this..,"Because my first reaction is to HATE HATE HATE this film. It's like an overly long David Bowie music video in its weirdness without Bowie's great music and great style.But it does do some things well. Yes, the action is great, but it is practically a silent film with just snippets of dialogue and relying on visual story telling. Within the first twenty minutes it is revealed that: Water is perceived as bad and is a means of control, the war boys need blood to survive and use human stragglers as a source, chrome and metal are worshipped, and different tribes in the desert have different specialties in terms of vehicular warfare. Plus there is the strong female character and female empowerment theme mentioned by so many others.For me, it was a split decision.

"Apocalyptic, surreal, exhilarating. 82.5%","As with Mad Max 2, this latest instalment of the Mad Max franchise presupposes no prior knowledge of the preceding movies. The term ""reboot"" has been applied to it, which is perhaps fair enough. Having a new star as the titular character (Tom Hardy) lends credence to this view. As with Mad Max 2, Fury Road begins with a voice-over narration setting the scene. In Mad Max 2, that voice was some nameless man, acting as a teller of the myth of Max. In Fury Road, it is the voice of Max himself. Mad Max 2 struck me as more mythic, but Fury Road does not eschew this approach but it does appropriates other stylistic genres.Perhaps the driver of this story is a variation on the story of The Iliad...all Hell breaks loose when the wife of a powerful man goes walkabout...off the reservation, so to speak. There seems to be more emphasis on a picture of a post-apocalyptic society here than in previous Mad Max films, although perhaps Beyond Thunderdome did delve in to this aspect...it's just that I remember very little of of it, apart from that cage-fight setting etc. Early on in the film, at least, it's more about creating a sense of place and society than focusing on Max. Most of the movie is one long, frantic, car/truck/motorcycle chase sequence...which might sound like a bad thing but director George Miller makes it exhilarating...although perhaps falling short of the standards he set in Mad Max 2...which happened to be my introduction to the franchise and made me conclude as a child that he had outdone Hollywood (later watching the first film in the series was a disappointment, I have to say).How does Tom Hardy fare in the role? In this, he seems a marginal character a lot of the time...an accidental/incidental hero, if you will...low intensity often, too. He looks buff compared to the lithe Mel Gibson in the first three movies. His accent seems a bit weird too...I can't remember if I found it to sound South African at times...or maybe that was one or two other characters? Some of the other characters have weird accents too...either they're not nailing what they're going for, or it's just a mixed bag of accents. Max's costume accessories at times recall his role in The Dark Knight Rises. Sometimes Max's predicament puts in mind Daniel Craig's James Bond being in a similar, outlandish circumstance (e.g. being a hood ornament... literally!).In this mad world, it's good that Max isn't the be-all and end-all. Quite a lot screen time is spent on Charlize Theron's character...the fancifully named ""Imperator Furiosa"". One has to give Charlize great kudos...I doubt that any other actor has taken The Method to such an extent as to have their forearm amputated for the role! She is, in a way, a rival to Max's myth.Also impressive about the film is the cinematography and style of it all. The sea of humanity early on in the film, the aesthetic, which seems to draw on such diverse sources as ""Beneath the planet of the apes"" (perhaps...foggy memory!), underground American horror films about the backwoods people and Freaks...etc.etc.etc. The refugee camp aesthetic has a distinct looking cast but I don't think that they have the memorability of the goons in Mad Max 2, with the likes of The Humungus, Wez and The Feral Kid (although he is not a goon!). Let's not forget The Gyro Captain in that latter camp too!Some really impressive visuals can be found in the dust storm sequence, which seems positively of The Apocalypse and one setting which brings to mind wastelands enchanted by an evil spell...a la ""Lord of the rings"" or ""Excalibur"" like. The latter setting has a surreal feel to it in stark contrast to its stark, monochrome colour palette.Perhaps for the first time in this series, the ""mad"" part of the title character seems to be literalised. He has demons which torment him. To be honest, I wasn't sure where to place these in the chronology...before going into this movie, I suspected that it was set some time after the events of the original movie and perhaps before or after the events of the second. Max has numerous flashbacks which unsettle him. I did wonder if one of the faces I saw was meant to be the Feral Kid or another was meant to someone from the first movie...but the age of the character in the flashback I Fury Road made me doubt that...although the original movie isn't clear in my mind. It might very well be possible that the events of the flashbacks could be fodder for a sequel to Fury Road...assuming that they haven't been covered in the prior movies.My casual reading of the series is that the first movie was set in a remote, violent community. Some time between the events of that movie and the second, some sort of global catastrophe occurred which brought mankind back to a primitive, dog-eat-dog state. Speaking of which, there are some nice, seeming references to Mad Max 2...from the truck driven by Furiosa (is that where this movie's title derives from?) to a nice nod to the dog food scene...but turned up to 11 (something the squeamish may want to close their eyes momentarily for!).To be honest, I would have been happy for Mel Gibson to reprise his role as Max and I didn't really need ""name"" overseas stars brought in, but Charlize is probably less of a marked choice than Tina Turner in Beyond Thunderdome (although she had a couple of great songs on that movie's soundtrack!).I'd place this movie behind Mad Max 2 and above Beyond Thunderdome, which I saw before rating movies at places like this. It's an exhilarating ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
George Miller is a mastermind,"Last night's viewing of the latest Mad Max installment has left me and the entire cinema in awe. I was never a huge fan of the Mad Max movies so when I heard about another installment I was not too thrilled but I decided to give it a shot. The first impressions and reviews that I heard from Cannes got my hopes up, and the IMDb reviews got them even higher. From the opening sequence I new that something wild and crazy was at hand.1) The story. Unlike the last three movies, this one has a story that actually makes sense and has a beginning and an end. It is not something spectacular or groundbreaking as Inception or Interstellar but it functions perfectly. Simple and understandable without any difficult explanations or twists, ending with a sequence that can only be explained as an adrenaline injection into the spine.2) The acting. Since the movies stars are Hardy and Theron much was expected. I believe that Hardy was the best possible choice for Max and he did a good job. The cold, crazy, mad performance he gave made me feel like I was watching a wild animal in a cage trying to escape. This perfectly intervenes with the script and the dynamic of the movie. His madness and barely controllable rage follows the story so perfectly it is hard to believe that any take was made during filming. Fluent and uninterrupted, without a single break of character Hardy is Mad Max. But, even though it takes a whole lot of heart to say this, Therone gave the best performance in the movie. Her acting is something so perfect and flawless it is hard to believe she has only one Oscar. Her character and her portrayal was extremely vivid and lifelike. She was the only character that I believed was a real life person and not a comic-book-style-version of a real life person in an post- apocalyptic world. Combined, Hardy and Theron took the movie to a whole new level, a level the previous versions never even came close to.3) The atmosphere. By far the best element of the movie. The post-apocalyptic feel was present from the first sequence to the last. One could almost feel, taste and smell the dirty and disease infested wasteland of a world the story takes place in. The colors and combinations of colors present in the movie gave it an even more relevant feel. The drastic change of color picturing night and day was as beautiful as terrifying. But the thing that makes this mad movie even crazier is the paste. Perfect timing, perfect duration of the sequences, the editing was the best I have seen in an action movie in the last 20 years.All in all, this visual masterpiece is George Millers triumph and best movie by far. It is brutal, ugly, dirty, it holds no connection to reality whatsoever, and that is exactly why it is so brilliant. It is a movie that must be seen over and over again. At this point Mad Max Fury road is the best movie of the year, the best Mad Max movie, and one of the best, if not the best action movie in the last decade!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

And man it was breathtaking. 3D effects, cars, crunching, make ups and the plot. Two words: TOP NOTCH! At first I thought it will be another mediocre Hollywood reboot but I am awfully happy that it proved me wrong. The film made me stay on my seat all-the-time and I literally forgot to go to the rest-room at some point. Brilliant, simply brilliant storyline, and each and everyone acted accordingly. Needless to say, made me watch the previous trilogy, nonetheless. I must say, George Miller has shown what he's capable of. Loved ""Happy Feet"" duologue and then THIS!.

"Action, action, action","If ever a movie deserved to be called ""action filled"" this is it. I would guestimate well over 90% of it's length is action. It begins with a 45 minute (I timed it) action scene and never really lets up after that. The slow moments are like slowing from 60 to 30.There's the one mandatory scene of exposition, reveals, and tad of emotion, but it's relatively brief. And little if any romance or even much sexual tension.Action, action, action with nary a moment of drama.But, good special effects, great stunt men and women (if they weren't CG), good music, good cinematography, good editing, and good use of music.I preferred the original (I'm 66 so of course I did) precisely because it DIDN'T have the production values of this one which are fully Hollywood. It somehow made it eerie in a way I liked. More of a feeling of ""the lone hero"" a la Eastwood than this one.Somewhere there's a thread complaining that this movie is ""obviously"" feministic propaganda.Good grief. Let's be clear. This is a MOVIE. It has no message, no deeper meaning, and isn't the least bit feministic. (We have both hero and heroine (who has a more than passing similarity to Sigourney Weaver's Alien roles.

"Insane, Action Packed, Western on Wheels.","Mad Max: Fury Road is handled and directed perfectly by George Miller and is by far one of the best action films of recent years. Mad Max: Fury Road is basically a Western on wheels, and is an action packed thrill ride, having you on the edge of your seat at all times, making you feel fear for the hero's life at all times. Everything you could ask for from an action movie, Fury Road has.To me the only complaint I could have with this movie was Tom Hardy, don't get me wrong, he was great in this movie, but to me he didn't really sell the part of Mad Max. Charlize Theron's character ""Furiosa"" on the other hand was great in every scene. The villain ""Immortan Joe"" was exactly how I wanted him to be, Hugh Keays-Byrne did a great job as the antagonist.George Miller's directing is also great, every frame was perfect, every shot and angle was done great. The cinematography was done exceptionally well by John Ceale, at no point did I take my eyes off the screen. Mad Max: Fury Road was so fast paced and so well shot, I didn't even want to blink, just because I did not want to miss a single moment in this movie. another thing that was great was the explosive action scenes, they were insane and exactly what I wanted from this movie.Overall Mad Max: Fury Road is a fast paced, action packed thrill ride and is one hell of a movie and I recommend you to check it out, this needs to be viewed in cinema. Like I said the only problem I had was Mad Max himself, In my opinion George Miller could have set this in the same world and time period as the original Mad Max trilogy and gave Hardy his own character, then this film would have been a perfect action movie.Go watch Mad Max: Fury Road as soon as you can, you will have a great time at the cinema. And will be very entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Drags down the name of the franchise,"It's a whole lot of crap.It sours the reputation of a wonderful film series by making ""max"" utterly flavourless and dancing on his grave. It took a person trying to survive, and made him resemble the villains of The Road Warrior in terms of senseless anger and self-absorbedness.I have heaps of issues with the setting of this one, in that the initial society was much over-powered for what a post-apocalyptic rebuilding society should be. Where did they get the massive steel chains from- where did the raw resources come from, how did they refine it? Furthermore, how could they spare the resources to put towards a musician in a society where the king-figure claimed his people would get addicted to water?I could list in detail how they desecrated Max's character, but to begin with he no longer has sympathy. Max has, throughout the prior films, always been stoic, practical, and thoughtful. He did not take meaningless actions, and he was always one for deals and fairness. He did not threaten without being threatened, and he did not stick his nose in others business. While he would eventually give in and help, he was neither eager to be a savior nor did he not care at all for those in need.In this film, he seems rattled by any misfortune, to the point of not thinking about logical ways to solve the situation. Incorrect. He immediately threatened the women, and furthermore tried to steal the truck for himself. Utterly incorrect. It's painful to see how they've ruined his character and turned it into someone who would cause violence against people who showed him no harm just to get his way.Furthermore, I feel as if the film lacks stylistically in it's cleanliness and CGI, as one of the most charming points of the prior films was the genuinity. Compared to the first film, where it was not intended as apocalyptic but was considered so by lack of budget, it feels utterly fantastical and unrealistic. The beauty of the prior films was the balance between apocalpyse and realism, in that it took place in a way that was utterly likely if an apocalypse were to happen. Who would have the time in an apocalyptic society to create a massive carving in a rock face? And the resources for that?Furthermore, It takes away from the previous settings by lacking accents. It's plain and charmless, and sticks out like dogs balls because suddenly everyone is American. Of the third movie, one of the best aspects was the dialect created by the children as it felt organic and suited the setting. There is no charm in this film.While it does desecrate the film series, it could stand up on it's own plot-wise, and without the self-absorbed pick-me sigma-warrior of a ""max"", but only if it didn't claim to be part of the same series, and it didn't claim to have the same main character. They are nothing alike and it hurts to see such a lovely protagonist fed to the dogs of money-orientated media.Hell, if it didn't claim to be a Mad Max film I'd probably rate it 7 or above, but the way it destroys a well-crafted world is just... hideously profane. It's really not worth the time watching if you're a Mad Max fan, it enfuriated me what they did to ""max""",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Endless ride through apocalypse,"Totally surprising movie experience, first post apocalyptic road-movie I've ever seen. George Miller doesn't let you look at watches while watching this, because you just don't want to finish this ride forever. Stunning, sooo much details and even interesting story and background philosophy purpose to think about. At first I was like: hmm, aanother act-like-movie-blockbuster but when I sat in the cinema and saw opening scene, it was really promising. Music, camera, action, actors, screenplay, environment, details and total crazyness of everybody on the screen. What a lovely day! Miller really did a nice job even on film tricks and stunt actions. Most of physics was trustworthy. It also kinda reminded me the Matrix. One hero with his team can bring victory to all the people. Will he survive? Will he die? What's the matter of this war for nothing? All of these questins will be asked with such a tasty way in both od these movies.

A riot: Gwar meets Pasolini meets Cirque du soleil,"Okay, no reason to mince words. This is a riotous success in what it does and how it upholds the legacy. How unexpected that the original filmmaker came from animated penguins and obscurity a few years back to barrel through superhero-dominated Hollywood with all this verve. Where others see no story and just another action fest, I see exhilarating freedom from the formulas of Marvel and Nolan.How samey for example to have dragged our feet through another origin story, setting down some convoluted saga. How boring to have turned Max into another 'chosen one' saving the world. We get instead a man spat out by the dust, a schmuck buffeted around, a grunt along for the ride; Hardy's reimagining of Max is great. Instead of the same dishwater look as any other apocalypse these days, we get colorful swirl. We do get a few plaintive looks and music, but few.The new Terminator we got this year, the latest stab at an Alien with Prometheus, they miss the whole point thinking we wanted someone to smear some more with the mythology. It was never the myth and explanations, always the immersion in a world. Mad Max benefited from never having a sturdy mythos, a Skynet or Weyland Yutani, we just roamed around the sands and came upon odd bits of world. Another enclave here, a Gas Town somewhere, things that just exist around for no deeper point.And the same sense of avoiding the trivial extends in another way. The film is a long chase practically, they could have just made a Fast and Furious rig crashing through desert. Instead the film is a pendulum that swings to the edge and back, and in the movement we soak up different tribes, worlds, oddities of custom and ritual, details that show someone lovingly tinkered with its world. How great e.g. that we don't need to have sophomoric explanations about Valhalla or the spray paint, we see all that we need to know in action.Sure, it's what GWAR is to music, provided you only look at it as a piece of gnarly show business. For me it evokes a bit of Pasolini; exhilarating spiritedness as a way of moving beyond the familiar limits of vision, toothless peasantry flocking to divine water.It's important for me to see works that jolt from the routine of fictions, enliven. It's why I seek Herzog and Pasolin. And there's a whole flying circus around the chase this time, chainsaw-wielding acrobats on poles et al. It's what Verbinski tried for in Lone Ranger. And those vehicles! It's all very wondrous to me even in this gnarly shape. I can appreciate the work it took, actual work you do with your hands and have to choreograph around bodies (instead of a Marvel team doodling away on computers), to construct all these rigs and film in Africa.How do you go from this to staid Tarantino in a few months? Only bringing him up as someone who likes to skirt the absurd. I imagine him, Verbinski, Scott, Snyder, the Marvel makers, paying their respects to this guy. This is the most furious comeback of a franchise I have seen.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Friggin' amazing!,"Tremendous. It's a nonstop thrill-ride with interesting, though quickly drawn, characters and some of the most economical storytelling I've ever seen. It makes all other Hollywood action movies look like they're in kindergarten. Every minute brings a new indelible image. It has a strong female presence, with Charlize Theron as almost a co-lead to Tom Hardy's Max. Both Theron and Hardy are wonderful, with Hardy giving Max a very different flavor from Mel Gibson. I loved Nicholas Hoult, as well, and Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the Toecutter in the original Mad Max, has a powerful presence as the major villain. A masterpiece of its genre. I loved it so much I saw it twice this week in the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Truly Magnificent Cinema Experience,","Mad Max: Fury Road is an outstanding movie with an extremely well developed plot and a terrific cast. There is no other movie truly like it, it may be the fourth film in the Mad Max series, but it is very different to the Mel Gibson versions. It's significantly weirder, filled with tons of action that keep you at the edge of your seat throughout and is beautifully directed by George Miller in what is without a doubt his greatest work to date.I think the film definitely needed to develop Max a bit more. I understand it was taking a different approach to telling the characters story, but for an audience who have not seen the previous movies, it is not very clear that Max is the way he is because of the murder of his wife and daughter, they should seriously consider focusing on this more in the sequel.The cast are all superb here, Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult all play characters that start off not being particularly likable, and as the film progresses you really care for them all and want them to succeed in their journey. Only complicated, somewhat anti-heroic characters like these can only gain support when actors as talented as good as these are portraying them.It is a wild ride from start to finish that always kept me entertained and never slowed down. Action packed, truly unique and well acted, I would recommend Mad Max: Fury Road to all moviegoers.In an apocalyptic wasteland, two rebels team up with the hopes of restoring order.Best Performance: Tom Hardy",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Max is back; better and madder than ever in this extravagant action spectacle.,"Mad Max: Fury Road stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicolas Hoult and is directed by George Miller. The plot revolves around Imperator Furiosa; a woman who is trying to get back to her homeland, as well as escorting five young women who are on the run from the dictator-like Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne); a man who has rallied an army of doomed, radioactive-poisoned boys - the Warboys, the Kamakrazee - and who has basically enslaved a population of people, since he promises them water (something that is rare in this world). These five women (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Riley Keough and Courtney Eaton) are also Immortan Joe's ""wives"" (kind word for it), his price breeders. It's here where Max's and Furiosa's paths cross.Now the story in Mad Max essentially boils down to a two-hour car chase (even though the story has more layers to it than what you would expect in any similar films). Furiosa needs to get these women from point A to point B. But there's a lot more going on than that beneath the surface of the initial plot.Mad Max has gained a lot of hype, especially during the past week or two. Most of this originates from early word-of-mouth that supposedly said that this movie was amazing. The movie then gained an unprecedented 98 % on Rotten Tomatoes and an 89 on Metacritic (seven points higher than The Dark Knight). Critics cited this as one of the greatest action films of all time. Now, obviously this puts a ton of pressure on this movie. And how well does it hold up to those words? Well to put it simply: Mad Max: Fury Road is an achievement, and one of the best films I've ever seen - ever! This movie was absolutely incredible. A feast for the eyes. If you're a movie fan then this is a must go. You have to see it to believe it.So why is the movie so fantastic? Well, let's start with the performances and the characters. Tom Hardy is great as Max Rockatansky. He may not have a lot of lines in the movie, but Tom Hardy pulls off Max's troubled past subtly and perfectly. And then you have Charlize Theron as Furiosa. She was fantastic in the role. Some have argued that she is actually the main character of this movie, the one who really drives the movie forward. And that's not a bad thing, because she knocks this role out of the park, and Furiosa as a character is really well written and fleshed out, despite the fact that the focus isn't really on the characters at all, but rather the action. The biggest surprises of this movie's ensemble came from Nicolas Hoult, who plays warboy Nux, and from the lovely ladies who play the characters who are referred to as the wives. Nux as a character may be the deepest in the movie, and at one point, that character even moved me to tears (in a movie in which a man plays an electric guitar which shoots flames through it's neck...yeah, it's that good). The wives are also very interesting, since they don't play like usual damsels-in-distress at all. Instead, each one of them feels unique and important.Besides the performances and the surprisingly layered and deep characters, there was a thousand other things to love about this movie. The score is perfect (by Junkie XL and the writing is also perfect. It just really fits with the movie. But let's get down to the bones of it. The essential parts of why this movie has made such a splash. First of all, this movie contains what easily competes with the absolute best action sequences ever put to film in the history of motion picture cinema! The action scenes - who are 80-90 % practical effects, differentiating itself from today's CGI heavy films - are absolutely breath-taking, mind-blowing and jaw- dropping. There were several moments were my jaw dropped from the sheer spectacle before my eyes. And due to my other main thing, namely, the cinematography.This movie is one of the most beautifully shot films of all time in my opinion. The way George Miller utilizes day and night sequences, and differentiate themselves from one-another is brilliant. Every shot is a sight to behold and it's so nice to see a post-apocalyptic film that has such colors that this one has.Verdict: Mad Max: Fury Road is a spectacular visual effects extravaganza of epic proportions, with surprisingly layered characters and heart-stopping, beautiful cinematography and production design. But the real surprise is the tender backbone that the film backs up its insane action scenes with. And it's all thanks to the real star of the picture; George Miller, who's dream film (no, quite literally dream-film. He dreamed of this movie a decade before it ever saw first light) is perfectly executed by a master film-maker. By the end of the film you can't do anything than to applaud and bow to the mastermind himself. Mad Max: Fury Road is THE movie to beat for the remainder of the year, and the action movie to beat for the remainder of the decade.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The film I'll show my son to let him know he has become a man.,"This flick should not have worked. Not only is it yet another 80's remake but even more worrying, yet another entry into the post- apocalyptic genre that is so much in vogue right now. But there was something promising about those trailers though. . . Even from the opening credits you get the sense that this is not gonna be a conventional ride; something in the lettering that suggests a time where films were made for pure entertainment. The movie is set in the near future but this is no cutesy tween franchise in the making, designed to capture that ever important 12 to 17 demographic.Oh, f*** no.There are no spunky heroines, no games, no mazes and no adorable robots learning how to love. What you have is the dirty, broken remnants of humanity trying to survive. The setting is dystopian in the true sense of the word, a gritty, grimy and grotesque world where mankind is barely holding on, their bodies ravaged by disease, where water is a precious commodity and a healthy baby is valued more than anything. This is a world of fire and blood, life or death ride on a whim and damn if it isn't a beautiful thing to watch. The mayhem starts from the opening scene and doesn't let up until its dusty, breathless ending. Director George Miller and veteran cinematographer John Seale have crafted a maniacal and delirious romp through the gorgeous Namibian desert and created what is, essentially, a 2-hour long car chase scene that looks amazing; vehicular manslaughter as grand spectacle. The main reason for making this film seems to be the director wanting to answer the question: what kind of movie can be made if you have no concern at all for stuntmen safety. For most of the running time there are people jumping on, over, below and, in one memorable sequence, even swinging from poles around moving vehicles, Miller and Seale capturing every vertiginous shot with precise expertise. You are going to come out of this movie exhausted and dusting sand from your clothes.As Max Rockatansky Tom Hardy brings that quiet intensity he is famous for but, despite the title, this is Charlize Theron's movie and the story is mostly presented from her point of view. As Imperator Furiosa she carries the film's McGuffin, all lovely five of them, and some of the most poignant scenes. For even if this is a damned and barren place it is not, entirely a man's world. Women are very much a part of it and can be lethal too. A movie about cars, violence and explosions that still manages to empower women? Not even all 7 Fast & Furious flicks can match this ride for ferocity and enjoyment.Now, some may complaint that the story is hard to follow, and to be honest, I had a difficult time following the Australian accents. But this is mostly the gripes of a public used to having the plot spoon fed to them like delicious apple sauce. There is no hand-holding here, no lengthy exposition to ease you into this world of woe. This is just not that kind of movie. The director has much more respect for his audience than that. The earth is f***ed, humanity is dying, get used to it. Not that you will have too much to ponder what is going on with all the craziness happening on the screen. Fast cars, explosions, fights, a dude playing the guitar, even a goddamn tornado! And you want to worry about backstory? Naah, son. You walked into the wrong theater. Now, sit back, shut up, and enjoy the glorious madness. Oh what a lovely day indeed!Parent's brief: Rated R. Running time: 120 minutes On Sex and Violence: This is gonna sound a little counterintuitive after reading the preceding review but, there is actually not that much graphic violence in the film. I'm not saying bring the little ones. That R rating is there for a reason, but most of the violence is cleverly implied.

Deranged is the new black.,"Dear George Miller, I truly admire your post-apocalyptic take on the future of humanity- it is senseless, spectacular, isolated, barbaric, idyllic, brash, demented, berserk, refined, and nonsensical all in the same breath.Let's try to break this film down into 3 separate plot-points or occurrences. First, Miller immerses us into the wondrous yet disturbing landscape of Mad Max's Australia - a dry and barren futuristic wasteland. The film essentially is one giant tracking-shot for the ages. A video game-like sequence (of sorts) in which our favorite bad boy Max, traverses the unknown territories of Miller's universe- in the hope of helping Imperator Furiosa smuggle wives; belonging to a tyrannical cult leader named King Immortan Joe- from his utopian citadel.If that sentence sounded long and absurd, it's because the plot itself needs psychotherapy. Trying to adequately sum up the storyline is an insurmountable task - thus; let me skip trying to explain it. All you need to know is that it's a mindless car-chase extravaganza that ends with good prevailing over evil.The characters in Fury Road are all over-the-top- simply put: they are just plain fun to look at. The special effects are unfathomable in their grandeur. Yet after all that praise, the film misses the point of what ""itself"" is trying to accomplish.I was expecting a catharsis for the character of Max. His moral-ambiguity towards everything he does, anyone he meets, and anything he tries to accomplish - is never truly explained. Let's take for instance, his quite peculiar relationship with Furiosa. Max lives in a world filled with savages that support a madman - yet we do not understand why he chooses to protect Immortan's wives from being captured. He feels conflicted at first, and later just becomes their secret guardian angel. The convolution in the plot is irreparable.If like me, you expected to find a poetic message left at the end of the film - you will be extremely disappointed. I waited and waited for something emotional to happen that would enable me to empathize with these characters. This moment never came. The one underlying problem with Mad Max: Fury Road is that the ideas it presents are so far-fetched and borderline crazy - they detach the viewer entirely from the film. There is no background given to the characters, therefore, all credibility in the storyline is tossed out the window. The journey Max and Furiosa undertake is confusing. The plight of both these characters is not resolved in the end. Furiosa will try to establish her ""Green Place"" in an area previously run with violence and cruelty; and Max just wanders off into the sunset - doing whatever he does after that. Which is a way of saying: it's unclear where Max will end up and what tasks lie ahead of him.The practical effects used in some action-sequences are revolutionary. They even hired individuals from the Cirque-du-Soleil to perform some of the stunts. This shows Miller's dedication to create a lifelike universe - where the viewer is expected to spend over 2 hours engrossed inside. However, this universe lacks any sort of human component to it. All the human elements or themes of this film started to develop a deeper significance towards the climax but ultimately were left dying in the dust with car wreckage.The desolate land, George Miller details in the film imparts us with a sense of psychological confusion. The universe of Mad Max is fundamentally flawed- which is the point I think, but Miller neglects the prospect of refining it. He does not explore the motives of the characters inhabiting his canvas. He sets a grimy tone to the universe but fails to justify its purpose or presence.In conclusion, Mad Max: Fury Road is a visually pleasing spectacle but the actors playing the protagonists do a poor job at conveying powerful feelings to the audience. This may or may not be George Miller's fault, but at the end of the day, no one can deny the fact that this film is, and always will be a visual masterpiece.Consensus: A soulless circus that entertains, or a cartoon parody of itself? No one can deny George Miller as a mastermind but I feel even he lost something in the making of this puzzle. Was it his sanity?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
(Review of Black and Chrome Edition),"Let me begin by quoting Director George Miller commenting on this release: ""Losing some of the information of colour makes it somehow more iconic.""Nearly 2 years ago to the day, Mad Max: Fury Road exploded ferociously onto the big screen. It now stands as a modern pioneer of the immense success that large franchises can achieve by using practical effects over CGI wherever possible (over 80% of the film is shot in this way). Re-released now in monochrome, this version of Mad Max: Fury Road is just as thrilling to watch as it is in colour; if in radically diverse ways.Initial stipulations for Fury Road included making the film as colourful as possible. It is unusual, then, that Miller should be calling this desaturated edition ""the best version of the movie"". In fact, this is the style in which Miller always wanted to release Fury Road, and ultimately, it isn't hard to see why.The 2015 version is certainly a stylish film; winning Six Academy Awards including Best Production and Costume Design. But the blend between action and monochrome is remarkably tasteful here; it can be strongly argued that Fury Road is the ideal film for this sort of translation. The black and white itself is never flat; it's not just a simple case of putting a filter over the screen. Plenty of extra contrast is added to the image which enriches the movie nicely, creating a chilling atmosphere at points.Although unfortunately, in black and white it loses a lot of the emphatic impact of the flaming guitars, and the incredible stunt work isn't quite as staggering. For a film based primarily on its visual effects, this does take its toll on the overall product.In contrast however, the outstanding performances by the cast are wonderfully enhanced, hurling the audience back to the golden age of cinema; where movies were dependent on the principle cast's integrity to be an effective movie, not special effects. In the moments where Fury Road isn't putting the Fast and Furious franchise to shame with its exceptionally filmed car chases through the Australian wastelands, the personal moments are somehow even more forceful than in the original. Miller is indeed right about the absence of colour making a film feel strangely more distinctive, and Fury Road benefits enormously from this added layer.It was announced recently that James Mangold's gritty, dystopian superhero masterpiece, Logan, will be re-released in monochrome. Thus, it seems cinema's adoration of black and white is sliding back into popular culture again, and by God let it endure. The possibilities for future iconic re-releases of movies in black and white are limitless, and as it does for the use of practical effects in modern times, Mad Max: Fury Road proudly stands as an embodiment of the great achievements that big budget films can accomplish if released in monochrome.What A Lovely Way (pun intended) to watch this adrenaline-fuelled spectacle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I wish I could vote minus figures!!,"First I loved the original Mad Max films, OK Thunderdome was a bit iffy but it was OK.

No real story and Tom Hardy who is a great actor only spoke about 25 lines in the whole movie. The actions scenes are great and the whole film is action scenes but we know nothing about the characters.

High Octane Action - The Best Apology for Thunderdome Miller Could Ever Make,"Mad Max 4 should be titled: Apologies for Thunderdome.While the third movie wasn't completely awful, it diluted the power of the American titled ""Road Warrior"" or as we called it in England where I first saw it, ""Mad Max 2"". By the time the third movie came along in 1985, I could actually see the damn film without somebody telling us it was a ""video nasty"" and something we shouldn't see.Fast forward 20 years to 2015 and a massive marketing campaign for Mad Max: Fury Road. First thought - thank you George Miller for this movie, it's as good as an apology for Thunderdome as I could hope for. Do I like the movie as much as the pinnacle of the series, Road Warrior? I do not. Why? Max isn't so much as maximus as minimus to Charlize Theron's Imperator Fursiosa. She's the *real* hero of this movie. Max plays a supporting role, and you know, maybe that's OK.First off, despite being an action movie, this is an adult's movie. It feels more like a 70's movie with adult themes, reactions and action than EVERY other action movie this year. It's a testament to this film that I watched every trailer BEFORE the movie minus the hopeful Ant- Man and thought, ""There's no way I'm watching that sh***y movie"".The best movie this year is 'It Follows', but guess what? Mad Max: Fury Road is a solid #2.Things I love. The plot has no story arcs. It's like a Japanese Kurosawa movie. Max and a bunch of ladies have to escape an evil daddy figure and that's it. Simple set up then ... action.What follows is all logical minus the way Max gets kicked up onto another vehicle to help save the day. People die when you don't expect them too. Not because you want it or it's appropriate, just because, s*** happens. I loved the non-calculatedness of Mad Max.Max isn't the hero you've been looking for. Furiosa is. The mission is righteous, but geez, this is an imagined and detailed world where barely anything makes sense. My favorite thing was how a bad brainless goon becomes the ultimate self-sacrificing hero without it feeling forced. That's good movie making.In conclusion, American audiences don't often see this kind of movie. It doesn't follow format. It's exactly why Avengers: Age of Ultron failed. Joss Whedon is super talented but he was *contained* by rules of his own making. George Miller has NONE. He made a movie about a sometimes great, sometimes victimized called Max who helps a truly heroic and hopeful being called Furiosa make the world just a little less shitty.For the authenticity and trueness of the story and acting, I give this movie a high 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The World belongs to the Mad,"The pitch of the film is not very complicated : a car chase in the desert.The world in which George Miller takes us is a hostile world, a world that is no longer the world as we know it. And the film may lack some elements staging the madness of this world's individuals outside the action scenes : indeed, although they are visually impressive (we are finally getting rid of CGI for most of the film) we can not prevent this tendency of Fury Road to repeat itself in identical sets. We could almost be tempted to say that the film lacks madness ... And, finally, it should be noted that Max is not the main character of this film ; his character is always a witness of the scene in which he is located. And indeed, it is a bit all the approach taken in the film : the viewer is projected despite his will and his ideal in this world without landmarks, without sufficient reason, as Max is. Thus, the vision of Miller seems diminished since it never takes enough space in the narrative. But the film remains a very decent & entertaining piece of work and deserves the praise it gets.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Maybe not the best action film, but it's certainly the most action film.","Mad Max: Fury Road is the last film I expected to be this year's darling of the first half of 2015. Does the original trilogy really have that mainstream fondness? Cult favourites certainly. I've only seen the tedious first half hour of the first which I will finish at some point. I trust Road Warrior is a significant improvement. But since Beyond Thunderdrome, George Miller directed family movies such as the Babe sequel and the Happy Feet pair. He has an Oscar for directing a cute film about dancing penguins. But was the sunstroked chaos of Fury Road swirling in his head the whole time? Nevertheless, despite its long production period, Fury Road is not a film that feels overthought. Waiting out a couple decades of mindless CGI disaster porn, Fury Road is a breath of fresh dusty air with ambitious practical effects taken to a scale not possible in the 1980s. It's commendable for that alone, given it's essentially one long chase scene with little time to breathe. It's an incredible technical feat with its editing and creativity to keep it thrilling.However, it's very rough around the edges, the curse side of its wild blessing. The first act is overcooked and all over the place, setting up its promises and over-delivering. It's a blur, and with confusing motives, it's difficult to latch onto. However, once we're through the sandstorm and it strips down its dynamics, for one giving its protagonist Max a chance to grunt a word, and reveals its secrets, there's a reason to invest in what it's trying to do. If you want to call it a feminist agenda to expose a collapsing patriarchal hierarchy then fine, but it's very welcome in an otherwise barren genre. The film does something that most films these days have forgotten, letting the hero be a hero. Max is a complete stranger to the story, and while he helps because he must, there's an element of his moral compass in there too. So many films revolve around the protagonist's problems, but a real hero is much less self-involved. It's refreshing to see a classic archetype utilized so well.Charlize Theron steals the show from Tom Hardy, providing an emotional texture with her glazed over eyes to the film's action that it would otherwise severely lack. However, the world of Mad Max is not an endearing one. The revolting culture of the antagonists is vague and while I'm glad it didn't go into it despite the idiosyncrasies, it's something I can't embrace. Nicolas Hoult is especially awful, never landing a sincere moment, at least not until the second half of the film where he's all walk and no talk. Shame Miller's taste in dialogue is so dreadful. At least his taste in atmosphere is something to behold, though the guitar guy took me out of it every time he was on screen. I'm not sure if I would call Mad Max: Fury Road one of the best action films of the decade, but it's certainly the most action film.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Insanity gone utterly mad!,"What an insane film! Unlike the disappointing Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and more like the first two movies, this takes the craziness to a brilliantly high level. With constant mind-blowing and explosive action throughout, epic visual effects and cinematography, and a pretty exciting story too, this is an absolute thrill ride that can't be missed.The main thing about this film is that it is totally and utterly insane, but deliberately. You see how severe this apocalypse has been by the way that everybody's just gone completely out of their mind, making for a world of total madness and insanity.The fact that this film approaches this insanity with a good sense of humour, to the extent where you see a guy with no eyes playing a double guitar that shoots flames out of it whilst in battle, this film is quite simply a hell of a lot of fun to watch, however the drama and excitement in the story is not at all cheapened by that.This film has a very simple plot, being set around what is effectively a two-hour car chase across the desert, but the success here is that it manages to bring in proper drama and intrigue for its main characters along the way. Max, played excellently by Tom Hardy, is as enigmatic as ever, and although he doesn't have the sense of extreme anger like the first three films, he's still a solid action hero that you always want to support.However, the stand-out character here is by far Imperator Furiosa, who claims what is effectively the position of main character, being the one whose ambition and drive pushes the entire story along, whilst she's also a very strong, and totally badass action heroine, thanks to a brilliant performance by Charlize Theron.One of the best parts of this film is the visuals and the on-screen vibe that it gives off. The special effects, both practical and CGI, are stunning to behold, whilst the cinematography of the action sequences throughout is flawless, taking a very simple approach to filming the fight scenes that makes it much easier to watch than a generic shaky-cam look.This is also the first Mad Max film where you get the vibrant colours of the desert world shining through. In Mad Max 2, there's a little bit of that, however this film is simply beautiful to look at, whether it's at the wide golden landscape shots of the vast desert or the gloomier, bluer night scenes that add to the eeriness and tension of the story even more.Overall, I'll give this an 8, because of its fantastically exciting story, strong characters and performances, stunning visuals and the sheer insanity that prevails throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stunning visually but lacks story.,"This film has an 8.5 currently which it in no way deserves considering the lack of any kind of original or interesting storyline.Yes there is loads of action, it is beautifully shot and everything you could want from a post apocalyptic, desert survivor scenario as far as they way it looks. I'm sure it cost a load of money.But what was great about the original, low budget films was the angst of Max torn between the good and evil within himself; Hardy is a great actor but we don't see much of his talent and what we do see is too sketchy to really get a feel for his character. Theron is great too but once again there is really not much going on. The other guy is quite good and the rest mediocre at best - with such stock, stereotypical characters they did not have much to work with.So, if you would like to see a two hour car crash set in an apocalyptic, spaghetti western future without the cowboys this if the film for you; if you want something to think about, don't bother.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just wow,"I'm sort of a fan of the old Mad Max saga. Those movies introduced me to a ""road movie"" genre of sorts, where films are centered around driving, ranging from Dead End to, even, Waterworld (I thought of that bad-mouthed movie as a sort of Mad Max with water instead of wastelands). I wasn't expecting much of Fury Road, to be honest. As the vast majority of sequels and re-makes nowadays, I thought it was going to be a hyped, clichéd attempt to revive the franchise. Boy, was I wrong.Mad Max Fury Road delivers the whole experience of the old saga, plus more. Let me start by saying that this new movie borrows A LOT from the old ones, from camera angles, to paraphernalia, even a bit of the fast-forward motion used in the old movies!! I checked afterwards and, to my surprise and delight, Fury Road creators are the same as the old Mad Max movies, so that explains a lot. I believe this new movie could easily pass for one of the old ones, minus that little extra CGI, of course. I'm glad they didn't try to add new, more modern stuff to the Mad Max universe.Oh, and this is not a sequel, but some sort of re-make. It is another vision of the same theme. Personally, I think it'd be better to watch the old movies to get a better understanding of the reality presented to us in Fury Road. Those flashback/hallucinations would also make more sense.The first 30 minutes of the movie are PURE NON-STOP ACTION, without cheesy or ""cool"" dialogue added, something that ruins most films nowadays. In fact, there's very, very, very little talking (throughout the whole movie), something that stays intact from the old days, as well; and that I sincerely appreciate. But, hold on, the action still continues after that marvelous beginning! When the pace slows down a little (just a little), it's only to gather momentum! It's hard to surpass that first part of the movie, OK, although it's still great.The added CGI creates the perfect extra for that post-apocalyptic future, although it's mostly old stunts and little CGI (I think!), which is also a bonus, for me, in this industry overcrowded by cheap and over-expensive computer generated graphics.The cast, although not great for the main characters, is acceptable. I'm not a big fan of Tom ""one expression"" Hardy or Theron. I'd actually have preferred Max to keep the ""mask"" longer, it gave him more of a ""Mad"" air. It reminded me of the sensation I got from seeing the last installment of Judge Dredd, where leaving the helmet on all the time supports the character and makes us focus more in what's going on, at the same time, instead of attracting unwanted attention to poor acting in the form of shallow facial expressions.I found the mythology in this new movie very appealing. I'm glad they stayed away from Christian themes.Allow me to also indicate that I hate movies like fast and the furious or whatever those are called. Please, in case anyone relates Mad Max to that trash, let me tell you that it's nothing of sorts; Mad Max uses the vehicles as a means to deliver a story of survival in a dystopia, contrary to the other movies where the means are the same as the end. This is not a movie about ""tuning"", saying clichéd ""cool"" one lines or any of such non-sense. This is a movie about survival. No matter how absurd it might seem, or actually be! You have to center in the action and forget about the rest, while still keeping it in the background as a reminder of what you are watching. Complicated? Well, it's just not about car racing and being cool, and let's leave it at that.I read they are going to make a sequel to Fury Road. I certainly hope they can stay in the same road (no pun intended), no need to mess up an excellent comeback.It's great to find a movie like this in this present reality of bad, over-hyped creations. More creators should go back to their origins and deliver shows like this. The only thing they could have added to make it more like the old movies would be Mel Gibson. I'm afraid that would have made Max too Mad, though.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Cars, Carnage & Crazies","Mad Max Fury Road is everything you've never expected from a modern day action movie. And if you've set your expectations low or aren't into post-apocalyptic movies, you'll be in for a surprise. And by the end of it, you'd have wished that you'd never thought so low about George Miller's ambitious masterpiece.30 years since the fourth movie, George Miller sets Mad Max Fury Road in a world where almost everybody has gone insane, including its lead, Max Rockatansky. The plot is paper thin and its nothing but an escort mission, lead by Max Rockatansky and Imperator Furiosa, through barren post-apocalyptic wastelands and chased by the main antagonist, Immortan Joe and his maniac War Boys. This is a standalone movie and can hold strong on its own, but if you do want to get into the tone and mood of Mad Max, you oughta watch the old trilogy as it also sheds some light on Max's story and arguably on who Immortan Joe really would be.Its one orgasmic chase sequence, from start to end, and there is little room for character development. But who's complaining when you are glued to your seats, entertained shitless with its almost unrelenting brutal action. Nothing can prepare you for the intense action in Mad Max Fury Road and this review might feel meaningless until and unless you've experienced it. Its all out gritty and it'd help if you've got a wicked sense of humour. You are also not given much time to think as you are pushed from to one action set piece to the next.As Max, Tom Hardy does have an ample role to play in the narrative, but this is essentially a Furiosa movie set in the Mad Max universe. Charlize Theron's Furiosa is indeed the lead protagonist and Max just accompanies here in her insanely dangerous 'road trip' and you cant help but applause at Theron's strong performance here. I am not a huge Nicholas Hoult fan, but in Mad Max he delivers as Nux. As for Immortan Joe, Hugh Keays-Byrne delivers and it is a real feat when he has a mask on which covers most of his face. It would have been great if they had shown his face at least once, at least for old time's sake to see how 'Toecutter' from the original looked like now.The visuals, doubtlessly, are spectacular and what adds to the sheer beauty of it are practical effects. We've all been conditioned to watching and, growing on, CGI heavy movies this past decade and the difference here could be instantaneously felt. Its not completely devoid of CGI wizardry but practical effects dominates the visuals here and its nothing less than eye popping. For the first time, normal 3D felt serviceable and at the same time I kept repenting that I didn't see it in IMAX. You know its good when you see your partner dodging car parts and entrails every now and then. Normal 3D does wash out, what would have otherwise been, a brilliant color palette and the end result is a somewhat dark and de-saturated film. Exceptional sound design and Junkie XL's background score is the cherry on top.Compared to the old trilogy, The Road Warrior still stands supreme. Suffice to say, Mad Max Fury Road had me, breathless, gaping at the extremely well choreographed action sequences. I had to wait a few hours before I could collect my thoughts on the movie and rant about it. This is by far the best action movie I have seen this year, OH YES, much better than Avengers Age Of Ultron. As for the feminism critique revolving this movie.WHO CARES! This here is a fine piece of action cinema, Thank you, George Miller!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad.. From The Beginning To The End,"It's about adrenaline rush from the beginning until the end, however, George Miller can very well maintain the plot and simple storyline so that although he has brought the rush from minute zero, the movie could still execute and present the climax in a very good way to the audience.The moviegoers who haven't seen the original movie should be able to learn and gather the puzzle of the story, not to clear everything up (yet!), but the way it tells the story and ""explain"" it is so classy for a 'mad action brutal full of truck race and debris' movie. We won't feel confuse when we leave the theater, in fact, asking for more :). Sure there are some details that questionable, but hopefully those can be answered in the sequel.The actors performance are quiet balance anyway, Charlize Theron appears to be too plain for that strong character of Furiosa, I was thinking that someone as strong as Sigourney Weaver could fill that shoes. Tom Hardy simply nails it, this classy actor can transform from the unknown to resentful to lovable and reliable Max. Hugh Keays-Byrne plays brilliantly as Immortan Joe, very full of testosterone and adrenaline, his total madness and love for the wife and baby in the other side can represent what the movie is all about.Absolutely Look forward for the next one!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max: Fury Road,"I think what would be most appropriate when reviewing a film like, Mad Max: Fury Road, is to do a move that the late great, Roger Ebert did a couple of times. When he reviewed his own film, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (which he wrote along with writer/director Russ Meyer) and when he reviewed John Waters' Pink Flamingos, he gave neither film a star rating. With, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, the reason was quite obvious, because he wrote the film and was good friends with Meyer, and regardless of the film being a cult masterpiece (which I think it is), he did not give it a star rating because the rating would have been biased, so instead he gave more, or less of a recap of information and what putting together the final film was like in general. John Waters' Pink Flamingos (which I would also consider a cult masterpiece) was one that Ebert felt that he could not give a star rating to because he felt that a rating system did not belong, or would not be acceptable for such a film. If you have seen, Pink Flamingos (and every lover of the offbeat really should), you can definitely see what he is talking about. The film, while I still like it very much, is extremely offbeat and you could use any number of adjectives to describe it (whether you liked it, or not), but to rate it as one of the great films of all time, or even what to rate it at all, would prove definitely a perplexing and difficult problem for some. I would personally give perfect ratings to both Dolls, and Flamingos, and I personally own both films and consider them and look at them very highly. Yet bizarrely, I find I am running into Ebert's dilemma when it comes to Mad Max: Fury Road though. I simply do not know how to rate it. As my alias on this site suggests, I am definitely a fan of all films offbeat, misunderstood and stuff that the general public has shied away from. So why am I finding it so hard to give a rating to Mad Max: Fury Road, which definitely falls into a lot of those categories? I think part of this is while I certainly did find a lot I liked in Mad Max: Fury Road, and in general, I would have to say that I did like the film, I think part of the dilemma for me is that this is an action film and very few action films rank very highly, or favourably in my palette of taste for films. To say that, Mad Max: Fury Road is not an action packed film would be the understatement of the year because from the second the film opens till it ends, it is action packed from start to finish and sometimes is so over the top in it's action and violence and often even it's fast editing style which jumped from scene to scene as if filmed by a madman, reminded me of Russ Meyer's own editing style, which was very similar only he never really made a film like this and this editing feels like Russ Meyer's style with a day's worth of coffee and energy drinks thrown in. Before, I run out of space to write, I must say what I liked and disliked about this film to be a proper reviewer. Basically, there was nothing I did not like. Even though the action genre is definitely not my thing (never has been, never will be), I still liked Mad Max: Fury Road and found things to like and dare I say, even admire about the film. My biggest compliments probably come on the technical side of the film. The cinematography capturing a post apocalyptic wasteland and showing all the gritty and barren backgrounds to the absolutely and sometimes hideously looking people inhabiting this space, was all very well done. The makeup, costumes and cinematography was all first rate in every single way. The editing (which I described above) is also extremely impressive and worthy of praise here as well. The acting is definitely not award worthy, but I felt all these actors did really hold their own and did a decent enough job here. What, I really found impressive and an admirable trait for this film, was that a major studio like Warner Bros, would go to all the efforts to get this film made and spend one hundred fifty million dollars to do so, is an incredible feat and I am impressed that a major studio would shell out that kind of money for a film so offbeat and definitely bizarre as this one. Warner Bros and other major studios would do that type of thing all the time back in the day, but now unfortunately it is becoming more and more uncommon. Perhaps with this film there is still hope for Hollywood yet. As it stands, I will not give this film a star rating because I don't feel I can, but I did definitely enjoy the film and it certainly never left me bored for it's two hour running time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth the Wait All This Time,"If you're reading this, you should stop right now and go see Mad Max: Fury Road...and if you've already seen it, go ahead and see it again. Sure, there isn't much for character development or much by way of story, at least not the conventional variety that movies usually contain...but it was still there, just a bit differently conveyed and with a strange sort of (I'm loathe to use the word in reference to this movie, simply because it sounds absurd)...subtlety. The plot is propelled in a very visceral way, with the explosive momentum of the action itself as the vessel...and good lord was that intense.This movie took the tension and action from Max Max, The Road Warrior, and Beyond Thunderdome, rolled it all into one beautifully executed package, and made it far more epic than the previous films could have been. This was the movie I spent more than a decade waiting on, from the first time George Miller began discussing his plans for Fury Road (only to have it put on what appeared, at the time, to be a permanent hiatus), and it was worth the wait. As much as I wanted to see Mel Gibson reprise his role, Tom Hardy handled it with the sort of professional capability that made it easy to deal with while experiencing the final product. Hell, there were even scenes where he was almost indistinguishable in the role from Road Warrior era Gibson. Charlize Theron was fantastic in what amounted to the leading role of the movie, but Theron being great comes as no surprise to anyone, I would imagine. She always is. Of course, we can't forget the absolute perfection of continuing the Farscape correlation, at least those of us who were fans of Farscape. Melissa Jaffer (who played Utu-Noranti Pralatong) plays Keeper of the Seeds in Fury Road just as Virginia Hey (who played Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan) portrayed ""Warrior Woman"" in The Road Warrior.And then there's also the fact that Hugh Keays-Byrne (who played Toecutter in Mad Max) once again portrayed Max's major antagonist by portraying Immortan Joe in Fury Road.Little things like that really do make me happy.I'm not going to deny that there are probably numerous flaws with the movie beyond the miniscule ones that I noticed, but I couldn't conceivably care less...the whole was strong enough to compensate for any shortcomings in the components. Admittedly, I'm a Mad Max fanboy. I'm one of those people who sincerely feels that original trilogy of films stands just as strong as movies like The Terminator, and the other movies from the same time period that are considered to be classics by many. My opinion is, of course, a bit biased in that respect...but not that biased.It was fun, it was intense, it was jaw-droppingly spectacular where the effects were concerned, the cinematography was actually beautiful in a lot of respects, the acting was solid and consistent throughout, and Miller's directing was superb. This one is worth seeing on the big screen, as many times as you can manage it, in 3D if you can manage it (it takes advantage of the 3D better than a lot of movies do).So, get going!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Action Movie of the Decade,"After three decades, Mad Max returns to cinemas. I had high hopes for the fourth installment (to my knowledge confirmed as a midquel between Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome) and the return of George Miller's direction gave me hope, even without Based Mel. That is why I am happy to report that Fury Road wholly delivered. It is not as good as Road Warrior, but hey, being 2nd best ain't too bad.I'll start with the obvious. Tom Hardy is great as Max and is worthy as a successor to Based Mel. His Max carries all the nuances Mel carried and while not as dynamic as Mel Hardy still keeps his stoic demeanor flawlessly through the film. A newcomer in the series is Charlize Theron as the warrior Imperator Furiosa. She's totally badass, even more so then The Amazonian in Road Warrior. She may be one of the coolest female badasses I've seen.Speaking of these two, what makes Fury Road work as an action movie is how fragile Max and Furiosa are. The peril is real as is the threat of them dying. It is easy to root for them and feels great to see them succeed. However, it is just as easy to root for the villains. They're so delightfully insane that it's just pure jot to see them on screen. One dude has a powdered wig made of bullets and sits in a chair mounted to a car. Another dude is eyeless and rides on top of a car playing a flaming electric guitar for a majority of the film. The villain of the film, Immortan Joe, while not nearly as good as Lord Humungus from Road Warrior, is still pretty cool and his design is one of the best villain designs I've seen in a while.The guy who steals the show is Nux, played by Nicholas Hoult. He is so insane it is awesome, and his character arc throughout the film is strong, poignant, and genuine. Goofy like the Gyro Captain, but also a tragically well written character, Nux serves as the most memorable side character. Good thing he has lots of screen time. The War Boys in general may easily be the best and most fun group of baddies I've ever seen in a movie. On the downside, the sex slaves Immortan Joe is chasing aren't memorable and are just kinda there and some of their dialogue is confusing. They're walking talking MacGuffins, but what else could they be?The thing to be most commended is the action. Fury Road starts fast and never lets up. It is basically one long action scene, but the action is so visceral, intense, genuine, and mad that it never gets old or tiring. This is without a doubt the best and most fun blockbuster action I have seen in a theater in quite some time. The direction is pitch perfect and the editing is high octane. The sound also perfectly accompanies the direction in bringing these sweeping car fights to life. The sound effects are perfect and the score, ranging from classical or booming orchestral, compliments each scene.The plot is-oh come on who watches Mad Max for the plot? There's a truck. In it are sex slaves a tyrant wants. Max gets tangled. Drive away from the tyrant or die trying. That is Fury Road. It serves its purpose and echoes a typical Mad Max plot and serving as a segway into the mind blowing action scenes. For all its runtime the movie is entertaining as Hell while also being masterfully crafted.In short, this is the Mad Max movie George Miller dreamed of making. As a Mad Max film, it succeeds in leaps and bounds. It is one of the most intense and thrilling action movies I've ever seen and rights all the wrongs commercialized blockbuster have inflicted. Nostalgic without ever feeling rehashed, this trip down Fury Road is one Hell of a ride that should not be missed. Please, I urge you to go see this film if you are A) A Mad Max fan B) An action movie fan C) One who actually cares about great quality high budget movies not about rehashed superheroes or toy lines.Don't let this suffer the same fate as Dredd. Help the return of the violent R rated testosterone high action movie succeed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action all the way for a future Classic,"This will become a classic in its own right I have given this a 9 because I would have wanted to see Mel Gibson back but too be fair Tom Hardy plays a very menacing Max and totally believable ,but I cannot help thinking that the role was written for an older Max who was looking to cure his inner demons Since seeing the film I have read that George Miller wanted to cast Mel Gibson but his previous public misdemeanours had prevented him from doing so .What a shame I watched the film last night and felt the need to add my positive thoughts to the others on the IMDb review board.It has a different agenda from the first three in that fuel is no longer the controlling element but water, hope and the future of the human race Charlize Theron dominates this film and her character develops as the film progresses into a caring person ultimately looking for redemption Someone I went with actually thought she must have had a prosthetic limb in real life such are skills of the CGI boys Go see this in the Cinema and enjoy it in all of its Widescreen and Dolby Surround Sound it is the only way to watch this masterpiece",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An action spectacle without equal,"Get ready to replace your eyeballs after this experience, as Max Rockatansky is back in his most explosive, sensory overloading, vehicular led journey yet! Fury Road, a petrolhead's sand infused dream come to beautiful yet utterly bonkers existence in George Millers long gestating action extravaganza, that not only laughs in the face of modern blockbusters, but blows them away by creating some of the most outstanding carnage ever captured for our screens.In a modern day and age where it's hard for action events to differentiate themselves from each other, blockbusters that are CGI laden and shaky cam heavy, Fury Road does the impossible and turns what is essentially a 2 hour long desert set car chase into something that is unique and refreshingly mad. With a budget in the hundreds of millions and a crew that clearly knew how to deliver the goods, 70 year old director Miller has had his visions come to roaring fruition, from the cars, the inhabitants and the milk productions, this is the apocalyptic wasteland that Miller must of envisioned all the way back with the original Mad Max, but only know did technology met the requirements.It's without question that what elevates Fury Road to the next level of pure cinematic enjoyment is the fact that the world we enter into for these 2 adrenaline fuelled hours is a world that feels like a living breathing entity, a handcrafted and often destructively beautiful labour of love. There will be a constant reminder to oneself that what you are seeing is largely perfectly constructed stunts and props played out to painstakingly elaborate setups. Every clash of metal on metal, every loud burst of exhaustive vehicle power and every swaying stunt man is a sight to behold and thanks to a thankfully strong cast of leads and supports, Miller's orchestrated chaos is not lost by the wayside.It was never going to be an easy task for the actor stepping into Mel Gibson's leather boots, but man of the moment Tom Hardy does a solid if slightly unmemorable job in his new gig, in what is a role that sees Max play wingman to Charlize Theron's feisty and soon to be iconic Imperator Furiosa. It's a criticism of the film that it does seemingly waste an opportunity to get more out of Hardy and while there are small moments of greatness and thankfully humour (Max heading off at night-time to take care of a car full of bandits springs to mind) his turn is not a highpoint of the film. While criticism can be made of this aspect of Fury Road, it's also in an opposite effect a huge win for the film that it doesn't rely solely on the charisma or bulking presence of Hardy to succeed and finds great moments when Theron takes centre stage and in the moments from support from Nicholas Hoult as bad luck War Boy Nux and a fantastic bandit named Doof Warrior who takes inspiration from Jimi Hendrix with his axe work.An action event of recent times unparalleled equals and quite possibly one of the most purely visceral and intense action films ever made, this wild and frightfully wild car chase is going to please fans of not only the Mad Max universe but cinema fans the world over. George Miller toiled long and hard to get his ultimate vision to our screens and after all his blood sweat and tears its fantastic to be able to say Fury Road is the great success that it is and hopefully the beginning of an all new saga for our beloved road warrior.4 and a half dedicated guitar players out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A return to lean R-rated action where practical effects rule the day, its veins coursing with high-octane gasoline and attitude to spare (hell, balls might be more apt to describe it). It unloads the thrills but sneaks in the human sadness unsuspected.Really, this is just the kind of big-budget Summer action movie I've been asking for.

Not a patch on the originals!!,"Having waited in anticipation for this modern remake for quite some time, ever since the rumours first originated, I have to say that I was a little disappointed. It was a pretty standard attempt to recreate a cult classic which I guess you could say is ""Typical of Hollywood"". Not to mention, the opening line of the movie; "" My name is Max, my world is fire and blood"" is just...well, cheesy.The cinematography on the other hand was unique, with some exceptionally vibrant graphics, colours, scenery and action, yet this wasn't enough in my eyes to rescue the movie from the sheer lack of suspense, storyline and any opportunity to express any level of talent or emotion from the characters. The complete opposite of the likes of say Game of Thrones. It seems the focus these days is more about all out action, hype and special effects rather than substance.Although this movie seems to be based on Mad Max 2, which is understandable considering the first Mad Max really just set the scene, there was no introduction to the history of Max, how the world was in the sorry state that it was in or any real agenda. The entire focus of the movie was built around one concept, which was a singular, action - chase scene from start to finish. This is such a discredit to the original trilogy and such a shame, considering the $150,000,000 budget spent. Everything was in place for this to be a master piece, right down to every outstanding little detail in costume and scenery.If you genuinely want to know what Mad Max and the media spread hype is all about, watch the original Mad Max 2 and 3. If all you care about is all out action e.g. if you are 12-15 years old, watch the remake.(Not to offend anyone, but the 12-15 year old comment was a joke. I grew up watching the Mad Max originals countless times when I was younger, which may explain my biased review. Never the less, I believe it would be an injustice for anyone to base their opinion without having watched the originals.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"All in all, the movie is a fun ride, a tense one, and it delivers.","I couldn't help but think of St. John Paul II's description of the culture of death, and how it kills a civilization either slowly or very quickly. Peter Kreeft, following on this line, said the the Third Reich was supposed to last a thousand years but only held for over a decade simply because it chose to build itself through killing its own. A similar note rings throughout Mad Max: Fury Road as we are presented with a story of humanity at a crossroads in figuring out how to rebuild itself after a profound era of destruction.The movie tells the story of a group of women who escape a Viking-like primitive civilization in search for freedom from slavery as prizes for a select group of men in her culture. Civilization as we know it now has dramatically fallen and gangs of primitive tribes form around a culture of gasoline and cars, manipulating them and extracting all their worth as their dependence on it will eventually fade. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) leads a group of harem-like women out of their desert city as Max (Tom Hardy) gets reluctantly drug into their escape, merging goals of finding a way out to freedom.The relationship of men and women, one that's crucial to the survival of a civilization, is at the core of ""Mad Max: Fury Road."" What the movie presents are two extremes of the sexes in relation to each other, one given a very bad depiction in its harsh expression (and rightfully so), and the other in a more subtle though inevitable retreat into nothingness. The city Furiosa and Max escape from is nothing more than a slave state with a despot that controls his people through water distribution. He chooses a group of women to be his harem and that's that. Later in the film we're presented with a rival tribe composed of only women and hostile to all men that come their way (they're even laying bait and hunting them). This too, will not sustain a civilization. The obvious necessity for any civilization to thrive is a way to produce stable homes for children, and a culture that threatens that (and there are plenty of ways that that can be threatened) will destroy itself, especially if it rejects this necessity.The two main characters, Max and Furiosa, are a microcosm of this tension between the sexes, grappling for power but working together toward the same goal, freedom from a destructive society, both struggling with the negative tendencies of their sex.There are few movies that I've felt such anxiety over the pursuit of an evil and terrible gang of villains, seeing what they do to those who oppose them. The terror they're threatening throughout the movie is almost debilitating, and thankfully there are a few moments where we have respite from it. A parallel exists today in ISIS, which I couldn't help but think of throughout the movie. It's a terrorist society built on religious extremism and is notorious for brutality toward women and their enemies, and unapologetically so. The depiction of these gangs roaming and destroying what they wish is likely similar to what's being done by ISIS in our time, which puts a weight on other societies to act on it in some way.Religion itself in the movie is given a lot of screen time, and in very interesting ways. The religion of Furiosa's society mimics the pagan religion of the Germanic tribes of ancient northern Europe with references to Valhalla, and their warrior emphasis. Men are brought up from birth as soldiers, and the society is built around war and plundering. Characters in the movie routinely pray (some to an unknown god) and reference the afterlife, which in a sense is a welcome addition to the film, giving characters in the movie a more interesting arc and drive. Some will interpret this as a vestige of primitive societies that more ""advanced"" ones will grow out of (and there is certainly the existence of childish religions), however it's not clear that the filmmakers are saying that.For the first half of the movie, Max is portrayed as a selfish and very distant renegade, all the while carrying hallucinations from a past trauma. In this, I welcome an actual ""madness"" to Mad Max, something I was always wondering about the older movies. Max just seemed like a tough guy, nothing really mad (meaning crazy) about him in the older films. This movie takes it more literally in the sense that he's suffering from a psychological ailment throughout the movie, and it comes up repeatedly. This adds an interesting handicap to Max, and a more visible struggle he's working through as he escapes the tribe trying to kill him.All in all, the movie is a fun ride, a tense one, and it delivers. Other reviewers have called it a much-needed shift for action movies in our time, especially as the Fast and Furious style films run their course. This movie carries with it a feel of mythology and universality, something any Jason Statham movie probably couldn't convey as well. As I write this, news of more Mad Max movies are on the way, and I hope they hold this theme of civilization building, stripping it down to its chrome shell and seeing how long it will run on a certain frame.This movie does not contain any explicit nudity or foul language, though the violence is intense and gory.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best action film since Terminator 2.,"Right out of the gate this film fires all 8 cylinders and never lets up. The film is pretty much one large chase scene, and while that sounds terrible on paper it works incredibly well. The style of directing here is unique in that there isn't much exposition dialog at all. Everything you need to know is presented in small doses as needed to advance the story. The film does exactly what a film should do and that's show, don't tell. You need not see the previous films to understand who Max is, or why he does what he does.The film is absolutely gorgeous. Most post-apocalyptic films are bleak and dreary but this film breaks the mold. For those not familiar with post-processing film techniques, it's as if the entire film has been ""instagrammed"". Because this film has little exposition through dialog the look of the film says it all. One of the most impressive pieces is when they show the inside of a dust storm, that's all I'll say about that.The sound design is flawless. You feel every bullet, shake with every explosion, and are brought to near tears by the soundtrack. There is also a very unique presentation to some of the tracks as the war parade has musicians acting as war drummers and ""trumpet"" players on the front lines. I'm reminded of how TASM 2 used dubstep during the showdown with Electro, but this time the incorporation is actually good.The film is ridiculous on so many levels in the best kind of way. The man playing the electric guitar that shoots fire out is nothing short of lovable. You actually feel like you are on the front lines of an all out war with war drummers and said electric guitar man being the driving force behind the energy. The war boys are wicked cool and their belief system gives inspiration to their absolute madness. Their leader is utterly terrifying. Everything from his voice to his armor to his inability to feel true fear helps elevate this villain to the top 10 list.The amount of detail presented in every shot is breathtaking. You really get the feeling that this is the film the director wanted to create for the last 30 years but because of budget concerns he was never able to. The fact that this film was in development hell for so long is usually a clear sign of a destined failure (see Duke Nukem Forever), but here it payed off.The acting is spot on. Max is still a man of few words and Furiosa is the perfect teammate. If you had to create a team of badasses you would pick Furiosa and Max. Their chemistry is brilliant. It's not forced at all. You know they need each other to survive and when they work together great things happen.I was a little nervous when the first 30 minutes of the film contained Michael Bay levels of madness. I thought ""well, there's only one way to go from here"". I can safely say I assumed wrong. The director has more than enough fireworks to last the entire run time. The finale is absolute madness. It's not just people killing one another so survive, it's about redemption for multiple characters. This was their last chance to make things right and you felt everything we have witnessed was nothing compared to what was to come. The delivery was so action packed I couldn't believe what I was seeing.It's hard to find flaws in this film. Sure, we can nitpick little things but honestly, I would need to study the DVD/Bluray with a microscope to find them. If you like action films you owe it yourself to buy a ticket for this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Insane.. but awesome,"This title pushes the limits of cinematic brilliance, some scenes hold you to your seat just looking at the visual treat that is before you. Don't let me lead you astray , that is only one part , a major part but still only one detail of this amazing movie. Mad Max.. is one hell of a ride , and i mean every word of it . We have a glimpse into what man will become when everything goes to ****. It is not hard to imagine such an outcome, just take the niceties out of the world we live in and enter into the desert and nitrous filled world of Max. This movie you need to see again and again , seeing it once , you will forget what it was all about. A review without giving much away, okay, you have Max (Tom Hardy) , Furiosa (Charlize Theron), Immortan Joe(Hugh Keays-Byrne) .. and some other folks (some really cool folks) You think that this movie is a chase , but it develops into something much much more . Some people want redemption , some people want to keep hold of what they have , some people want to correct the way things are . For a movie that is thought to be this violent , it is not gory , it is actually beautiful.. there is no over glorification of kills , no slow mo shots .. this movie is not about that . Who says you need words or sanity to make a movie work , Mad Max is a success worth watching more than once , but this movie screams for a bigger screen..",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Action Movie of the Decade,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the action movie I've been waiting to see in my five years of film reviewing. I haven't been waiting around in agony like a Southern belle longing for her Rhett Butler — I have, instead, been continuously leaving the theaters of various actioners pleasantly charmed. But thrills, yes, thrills, have been kept at a minimum. Sure, it's fun to see CGI, likable actors, and bombastic set pieces mix it up with the delirium of a succulent martini. Yet, these days, action movies seem serviceable, great for two hours but not for much else. They don't stick with you: you end up ranking their greatness in the scheme of other films in their franchise. Immediately after ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" last year, for instance, my sister and I spent most of the ride home arguing about whether it was better than the original ""Avengers"", hardly talking about what we liked about it, what made it such a success.The minute I grabbed a seat for ""Fury Road"" last night, I didn't know what to expect. The first three ""Mad Max"" movies, ending thirty years ago with the imaginative ""Beyond Thunderdome"", were cynical explosions of dystopian disaster, where the mindset is kill or be killed and the lead character, the titular Max, isn't so much a hero as he is a wounded guy trying to survive. The ""Mad Max"" movies are so seminal because the action is so unforced: the remaining population is so willing to slaughter for the final drops of gasoline to propel their decked out vehicles that the films may as well be called Mad Max vs. The World. No one is ever, ever safe. You can count on Max to survive, but you can't bet that the world will be a better place after he fends off his latest opponent. Fiery and desolate, the balmy lands of the post-apocalyptic future are never much of a haven. Max isn't a hero, rather a man who can work a gun and a car and who seems to constantly be in the wrong place at the wrong time.""Fury Road"" has been called a reboot of the original franchise, but reboot seems too plain a word. Reboot suggests laziness, a ""RoboCop"" no one's in the mood for. With the same director at the helm, George Miller, ""Fury Road"" is a reawakening, a rollicking continuation, and a startling return to form. Certainly, it is the most brutal of all the ""Mad Max"" films, not for the screeching sissies of the population. But it is also among the finest action movies in the history of cinema. We have been able to stomach superheroes smashing goons into the buildings of New York City, probably killing hundreds of civilians in the process, for so long — here, consequences are really consequences. The characters are vulnerable, however heroic or villainous they may be, and the action sequences produce just as much of a thrill as they do a shudder. For once, something humane in us lights when someone gets crushed by a mountainous vehicle.Tom Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson, portrays Max Rockatansky, a loner deep in the Australian outback attempting to hide from the dangers of the recent collapse of civilization. Only a few minutes into ""Fury Road"" is he kidnapped by the War Boys, the henchman of the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who leads and controls a strenuous territory with a massive water source. The War Boys are essentially half-dead young men — Max, in response, is provided as a ""blood bag"" for the sickly Nux (Nicholas Hoult).Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), an ally of Joe, takes off on her war rig to collect gasoline from a nearby pipeline. But after driving off road, it becomes clear that she has something else in mind: she has brought Joe's five wives along with her, who act as his means of breeding. So a chase ensues, the nefarious foes close behind. Max and Furiosa finally meet when Nux catches up to the rig — and a partnership is formed. Left is a series of car stunts, tour de force performances, imaginative cinematography, and a feel-up of a dystopian society refreshing among a sea of ones filled with sexy teens and Hunger Games.The aesthetic of ""Fury Road"" is something of a punky, raging pulp novel: cars are covered in metal spikes, guns are an extension of the arms of the characters. Night scenes are drowned in a cerulean blue, the days a ferocious orange; bullets, eye patches, and skulls aren't simply decor — they're part of the landscape, as natural as the air, as the dirt. Even part of Joe's entourage is an electric guitar player, who strums whenever sh*t is about to go down. These touches may be laughed at by some, but as a part of Miller's vision, they're something of a wonder.And while the film may include the name Mad Max in its title, Furiosa is the hero of ""Fury Road"", and the female action hero we've all been waiting for. Long gone are the busty Black Widows and Lara Crofts: with her metallic placeholder for an arm, oil warpaint, bald head as a stab at gender reversal, she is an embodiment of zeroed in anger. Theron's performance is, by turns, explosive and vulnerable. You won't be forgetting Furiosa any time soon.You can disagree with me all you want, but ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the best action movie of the decade. Before you completely write this statement off the map, though, consider this: what was the last action movie that really surprised you, really slapped you around and didn't ask if you wanted to take a five minute smoke break? This is visionary filmmaking, action or otherwise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A forceful decisive and entertaining action packed journey like no other, PERFECTION","A visceral and awe-inspiring masterpiece of Odyssean proportions.George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is a culmination of over thirty years worth of a vivid creative vision into a magnificent, spectacular and awe-inspiring masterpiece. Not since Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight have we left the theater exclaiming ""I want to watch it again!""From the same lucid and resplendent apocalyptic wasteland as Miller's 1979 Mad Max – the landscape of Fury Road is a palpable physical manifestation of a world eviscerated by war. The barren desert lays way to a humanity re-built from that arid destruction as it battles to survive. Fury Road's story is wholly original and separate from the plots of its predecessors but deserved at their sides. Mad Max: Fury Road is the story of Max (Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron),and their encountered perils searching for salvation. A search in a desert wilderness where savagery stems from the vestiges of primal necessity.Upon opening on the first photographically framed scene, Mad Max: Fury Road dramatically propels forward at an increasingly accelerating velocity, knocking audience members forcefully into the backs of their plush cinema seats. An onslaught of decisive and visceral action displays the narrative at hand with purposeful glory.This ability to derive story from action is proof of Mad Max residing at the pinnacle of great storytelling. From our heroes and their beastly rides to the extras with a lifespan of a few seconds, each character was immensely textured and filled with intriguing detail. Fury Road naturally and effortlessly creates compelling characters and a complex alternative world, all the while taking the audience on a truly immersive ride. We wouldn't be surprised to see George Miller's Fury Road studied for years to come in film lectures and art schools.For those who have no interest in seeing the film, we at least dare you to go for Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Abbey Lee, Zoë Kravitz, Courtney Eaton or Riley Keough. Not that these mavens are exploited for their beauty, just whatever it takes to get you in a seat and watching this film. So that you too can experience the pleasant event of having your face melted by its twisted metal glory.At the end of the two hour saga, with pounding symphonic score to match, audience members are left rejuvenated and euphoric from the after glow of a truly mind-blowing experience. This is what film making and film viewing is supposed to be; this is the massive ability of the cinema. George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road will go down in history as one of the most effective film experiences of all time. My sympathy goes to the aspiring directors whose projects must follow this epic cinematic accomplishment.(Update) Pro Tip - Don't watch the film in 3D. Our second viewing was in this capacity and it completely cheapens the action and makes it feel rife with CGI, when it is not.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Watch 'Mad Max : Fury Road' because it is pointing its fingers towards you and screaming, ""Witness Me!"" 5/5","So, here was another weekend, and as is the norm, a movie in the theaters was on the cards. I and my friends were all eager for 'Piku' as the word of mouth was on a roll.But sometimes, things don't happen the way it should – as goes the rule of the Fury Road. I randomly checked for other movies which were on the show this weekend, and was excited by the ratings of Mad Max's Fourth instalment. With a staggering 99% Rotten Tomatoes, 89% Metacritic and 8.9 IMDb rating, I just drifted towards this mad ride of contemporary cinema. And oh what a ride it was!Having never watched any Mad Max instalment before, I had no idea what to expect from the movie. But then, less expectations, more fun!The movie is based on a post-apocalyptic world, and adding any more description to it would be an injustice towards the people who are yet to watch it. It's a one of a kind movie and describing the movie would be like ripping the heart out of it's charisma. I mean, we must have watched movies of different genres and different scenarios and different presentations, but one could rarely fathom a movie which goes beyond those classifications. This movie redefines every adjective which we have ever used for describing a movie. It is pure ingenious cinematic brilliance.This movie sucks you in its world and makes you undergo such surrealism that you are on the edge of your seat throughout its ride. It is not only the madness which gets to you, it is the ultra- skewed world, the premise, the machines, and the inherent humour in the face of doom which gets instilled in your veins as if you are the part of that world. Such is the intensity of the cinema that you'd want to jump in the road of fury- as binding as it gets towards a true movie- watching experience and a cinematic marvel.I learnt about the Mad Max franchise from Wikipedia and I was more than overwhelmed to know that the first Mad Max movie broke all the records of the Box-Office in Australia (it is an Australian franchise), and held the Guinness record for most profitable film for decades. The other two sequels have also had great runs, and by the look of it, the fourth one is seemingly going to topple the previous films' earnings. George Miller, the director of the franchise must really be a man from another world.Watch this movie for its surreal setting which seems from another planet/world, its thrilling and spell-binding action sequences, its war-machines, the special effects, and exclusively for the madness, the humour and the innate meaning it carries for the dwellers of the real world. The last time I was this overwhelmed by a movie, its name was 'Interstellar'. Watch 'Mad Max : Fury Road' because it is pointing its fingers towards you and screaming, ""Witness Me!"".For the sheer cinematic experience : 5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Retaliate First,"Greetings again from the darkness. Thirty years have passed since we last saw Mel Gibson donning the leather in 1985's Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, which was of course, the third in the franchise after Mad Max (1979), and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981). Over the years, rumors have persisted that writer/director George Miller was going to add to the franchise and take full advantage of today's high-tech movie making techniques by securing the budget necessary for a true blockbuster. It may have taken 3 decades, but Mr. Miller's dream is realized with his $100 million version (compared to $300,000 budget on the first one) that will undoubtedly satisfy the Mad Max fans, while also reminding the industry what an action movie can be (Michael Bay's corneas may burst into flames watching this).Tom Hardy plays Max Rockatansky, a loner haunted by a tragic past seen only through millisecond flashbacks that occur at both inopportune and opportune moments. Hardy has the physicality to pull off the role, but despite the title and the history, this film belongs at least as much to Charlize Theron who literally drives the story as Imperator Furiosa. Tired of living under tyrannical rule, Furiosa frees a group of ""breeders"" played by Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough (Elvis Presley's granddaughter), Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton. Their plan is to escape across the desert (well, everything is desert these days) and return to Furiosa's childhood home known as ""the green place"".This is pretty much a two hour chase sequence featuring monster vehicles, soaring motorcycles, massive gunfire, screen-filling explosions, and enough stunt work to amaze even the casual movie-goer. All of this is accompanied by ear-bursting high-octane music courtesy JunkieXL (the first Max films were scored by Brian May of Queen). Some of this ""music"" is raw heavy-metal shredding occurring live on one of the chase vehicles – quite a sight and sound gag. It should be noted that stunt work is the surprise here. These days, most movies rely on CGI effects, while Mr. Miller mixes an extraordinary number of old school stunts with the compliment of CGI for such things as an overwhelming sandstorm and Ms. Theron's mechanical arm. It's a fascinating blend of old and new.John Seale certainly deserves mention. He is an Academy Award winning cinematographer for The English Patient, and has also been DP on films such as Rain Man, Witness, Dead Poet's Society and The Firm. He has four Oscar nominations and is not the first cinematographer one would think of when putting together a huge action film; however, the choice pays off in what is a beautifully shot film – both in space and close up scenes. It brings an element of propriety to what on the surface appears to be out-of-control, non-stop chaos.The post-apocalyptic look and feel is accented by periodic splashes of color that prevent the usual bleakness from others in this genre. Many will be surprised at the minimal dialogue, but the straightforward plot removes any need for extended conversations from folks simply trying to survive.Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies) may be the most interesting of all characters, and probably has the most lines of dialogue (while still not saying much). He is a slave caught up in the dream of serving his master, while then re-discovering a modicum of humanity buried somewhere deep inside. Fans of the series will also cheer the presence of Hugh Keays-Byrne who plays the very striking Immortan Joe, and also played Toe Cutter in the original film 37 years ago.Filled with nostalgia and respect for the original series, this fourth entry also provides a new palette for a new generation of fans. The biggest change comes from the focus on strong women who are out to change, or at least escape, a world rotted by the male lust for power. It's difficult to say insanity rules this world, because so little sanity exists that rational beings are non-existent.George Miller will always be known as the creator of the Mad Max series, but we shouldn't forget that he also directed the Happy Feet movies, as well as Babe: Pig in the City. Perhaps those two personalities allow him to create a world as crazed and chaotic as we see in his latest Max film. Mostly we can feel happy for him that he was afforded the opportunity realize his filmmaker dream  a nice reward for 30 years of patience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I Came away exhausted, mesmerized & thoroughly entertained. What did I just see?!","I was dropped jawed throughout the entire movie. WHAT A RIDE! Gorgeous, incredible and original looking visual effects and set, costume and vehicle design. The car & motorcycle chase scenes & stunts were paced and timed perfectly so I could see all the detail. IOW no frenetic, jarring quick cuts that left me asking what just happened. Where did that come from? I missed something! It all made sense as if I was watching it live.Special effects has really improved in the last 5 years. It's all very realistic and seamless. ""Prometheus"",""Gravity"",""Mad Max"" & ""Ex Machina"" are now four that's left me scratching my head in amazement. Usually in the past I could see signs of off looking CGI but now I can't tell fake from real. Where are they teaching people how to make this stuff? Only complaint is Mad Max was ear bleedingly loud.

The glorification of stupidity,"Everywhere I turned there were people telling me about the Mad Max Reboot.With the original tale the warning was: it's not about nuclear disaster, it's about the lack of petrol. Which did not stop the audiences rave about nuclear disaster, especially after Chernobyl.With this one the production team made it clear. They put a useless monologue in the beginning to make sure the audience gets it now: it's about petrol. So a wise guy put in a lizard with two heads. Which, like in all cautionary tales written by English majors, lives and functions well.Now, because the problem is petrol, the only way to entertain yourself is to cover large distances without roads in inefficient cars that are made even less efficient with all sorts of addons.Precisely because there is no petrol, all people use electric tools that are fueled by the toxic fumes going out from the ears of the writers and director involved.And because there is no petrol, there are no roads either. Which helps the characters save fuel and run on pixie dust.It becomes mildly amusing once you start seeing the ugly white corpses as Minions on a budget. Probably painting them yellow, instead of white, would have made the film somehow better.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a lovely revival,"After allowing it to lie dormant for nearly three decades, George Miller reboots his beloved ""Mad Max"" franchise in a manner that, I believe, very few saw coming. While it's the season for raucous, summer blockbusters that require little thought and provide for passing entertainment, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" changes course for the series and the idea of a blockbuster. This is an exhilarating, but uncommonly brutal, display of some of cinema's most kinetic and coherent actions sequences of the last decade, sewn together with everything from grotesque characters and characters that tread the line of being impressionistic.For the first time, the titular character isn't played by Mel Gibson, but instead, Tom Hardy, who provides a large amount of subtlety. In addition, I'd say that he also has about two full pages worth of dialog in a one-hundred and twenty minute film. He is less a character and more a brushstroke representation of an action hero, even moreso than in the last three films. Taking place, yet again, in a distant future where societal order has collapsed, Max is kidnapped early in the film by a gang known as the War Boys, led by the ruthless King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), to be used as a blood donor. Meanwhile, a woman known as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who was assigned to use an enormous, armored truck to collect gasoline, the most sought after commodity in the community, is driving off course with all five of King Joe's wives, all of whom meant for breeding. Max winds up escaping and hitching a ride with Furiosa, resulting in a long chase throughout the entire desert.There is a simple moral of personal redemption in ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" and it's a moral that keeps the film from being entirely empty. However, it's not tacked on or exploited in a way that feels heavy-handed. This is one of the many tricky dances ""Fury Road"" manages to pull off and do so very well. It's also a film of details, with screenwriters Miller, Brendan McCarthy, and Nico Lathouris essentially playing around on the large, spacious canvas of the desert, seeing where they can go and what they can do in order to create a film entirely focused on creating tension and breakneck action. Consider little inclusions like a deformed character who rides on an enormous truck, shredding on an electric guitar with dozens of loud speakers behind him. It doesn't add much to the story, but it provides for some incredible sounds throughout the whole film.The film also bears the best cinematography and visual effects so far this year. The desert has scarcely looked more attractive in all its sun-soaked glory, and cinematographer John Seale gets some of the best, most vivid shots of it throughout the entire film. Consider the scene when Furiosa collapses to her knees in the desert, as the sand and the sun are shown as limitless representations of time and space and stray sand grains softly glide on top of more compact sand, effectively creating what looks like a mirage. Or even consider the longshots that show the intense scenes of the War Boys catching up to Furiosa's truck. All of these beautiful inclusions and more are thanks to an extraordinarily talented visual effects and cinematography team.Finally, we have the action, which makes up about ninety-five minutes of the entire film, and for the first time, I'm not complaining. For one, the action in the film is captured clearly and vividly. Miller never loses us in the camaraderie; everything is so visually pristine and clear that there's never a lost sense of suspense because the camera-work is shoddy or the editing failed to do the scene justice. Editor Margaret Sixel really shows her talents in the beginning of the film, a briskly paced opening sequence involving Max, who is haunted by past memories, desperately trying to outrun the War Boys whilst being burdened by visions of his past encounters. These kinds of scenes are haunting, and add a layer to what would otherwise be standard situations in action films. However, the action is captured so crisply that it's impossible to ignore the sheer magnitude of talent on display here.For me, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is an early candidate for the most surprising film of the year and favorite summer blockbuster. This is a film that pulsates with life and energy, taking one exhilarating, cacophonous circumstance after another and bathing it in road rage, gasoline, and unbridled chaos. Its immaculate portrayal of madness almost works to call out other big-budget films that have skimped on their own visual clarity, proving great results can be achieved if time is taken to do such great work. It appears that during his time away from the franchise, Miller reflected on where he wanted to take it, and what results is a fully realized film that struts with confidence and swagger. The film proves a lot of things about action films, but most importantly, also proves you can have a franchise lie dormant for years and, if seriously handled and given to the original creator, there is still potential for a spectacular comeback.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Oh my *beep* god. George Miller, what have you done??","Let me but this as bluntly as I can: This is the best action film ever made in the history of cinema.Forget that the action is all done with mind-blowing practical effects (my friend couldn't believe me when I told him that after the film was over) but the actual storytelling was excellent! The story was pretty thin but it's the way that it was told that made it so amazing. Even the characters themselves have a lot of subtle and great development that bring a human touch to a world so full of insanity.But the action scenes. One review put it perfectly: ""The first car chase in MM: FR is the best in movie history but the worst one of the film."" That pretty much sums up the rest of the movie.Oh yeah, and the opening shot to the film is the best opening shot to a movie this year, without question.

"Fun, straight forward action","First off, I need to state how much I can't stand that IMDb lets anyone rate movies before their release date!Anyways...I liked this movie.If you are looking for an in depth plot, look somewhere else. If you are looking for 5 star acting, look somewhere else. If you are looking for a fun, Friday night action flick, watch Mad Max.The Good: The cinematography in Mad Max is down right amazing. Mad Max blends gorgeous landscapes and gritty, bad ass vehicles better than any movie in its genre. The explosions are amazing and the roar of the engines feel just as good. The actors feel like they fit in the setting and the struggle to survive is seen throughout every character.The Bad: Acting is sub par. The random scenes of emotion felt out of place. Not much of a plot line. Likable characters, but not attachable.By FAR the WORST aspect of this film was Mad Max himself. He just didn't feel like Mad Max. Honestly, he didn't even feel like the main character.All in all I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.Watch with some friends and enjoy the carnage.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"The Latest Film Has The Best Special Effects, But That's All. Mad Max 2 Is Still The Undisputed Champion.","In 1979, George Miller directed a dystopian action film which earned US$100 million worldwide and held the Guinness record for most profitable film for decades. The film propelled Mel Gibson to an international cult figure called Max. This film Mad Max, was followed by two sequels, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome.I watched the sequel to Mad Max before I ever saw the original Mad Max. The original Mad Max can be considered a backdrop story to Mad Max 2. I think the original film was made just to launch the more serious chapter of the film which was the sequel. The concluding third chapter was generally considered a mediocre final chapter of the franchise and an average performer at the Box Office.The Human society is decimated by a nuclear holocaust and the few survivors fight over the meager resources, gasoline, food and water. Enter Max, a patrolman whose wife and toddler were literally run-over by vicious motorcycle gang and who is now just a ""shell of a human being"" wandering aimlessly through the badlands...Miller's latest film Fury Road can be considered a continuation of events just after The Road Warrior and a prequel to Beyond Thunderdome. In fact, a character called Imperator Furiosa(Charlize Theron) is very similar to the Mad Max 3 character Aunty Entity(Tina Turner).Mel Gibson who played Max in all three of the films has been replaced by English Tom Hardy. This I find very offending. Mad Max is an Aussie franchise and should have stayed that way. Also the absence of Mel Gibson in the film is an open insult to Mad Max fans all over the world. The casting of South African actress Charlize Theron is the final slap on the face. Aren't there much prettier Aussie actresses to choose from? What about Nicole Kidman a veteran Aussie actress? Why was she not considered for this film?Plot: Max is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe(Hugh Keays-Byrne), and taken to Joe's Citadel. Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a ""blood bag"" for the sick War Boy Nux. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa drives her armoured war rig to collect gasoline. When Furiosa drives off-route, Joe realizes that his five wives — women selected for breeding — are missing. Enraged, Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.Verdict: Mel Gibson fans will find their hero sorely missing in this one. The only consolation is that Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the main antagonist ""Toecutter"" in the original Mad Max, is cast as a new villain Immortan Joe.Fans of Tom Hardy will be disappointed, as Charlize Theron ousts him in every cut of the film. She is the major character of the film and Hardy plays the role of the side-kick. The sound and special effects are very well done, which is the only redeeming aspect of this latest film.More George Miller Films: Twilight Zone: The Movie(1983), The Witches of Eastwick(1987), Lorenzo's Oil(1992), 40,000 Years Of Dreaming(1997), Babe: Pig in the City (1998), Happy Feet(2006), Happy Feet Two(2011).Thank you for having the time to read my review.

"Mad Max and Furiosa on the Fury Road, a massive chase scene with breathtaking visuals and action you will remember for a life time","Mad Max: Fury Road is an action movie I go back to every year or every other year, it deserved all 6 Oscars that it got.
What George Miller created was amazing and it will be hard to top it as it might be one of the best action movies in the world and possibly on the list of best movies of the last 15 years.
The story is set in a desert wasteland and the world and civilisation has collapsed as a result of wars and dwindling resources. Fury Road takes place in a that wasteland deep in the apocalypse where War Lords own territory and have created settlements. We follow Max as he's hunted and gets into a chase with the War Boys which serves the main villain, Immortan Joe. Shortly after that we get introduced to Furiousa which is the second main character. Tom Hardy portrays Max and Charlize Theron portrays Furiousa, both gave incredible performances and Tom showed that he was a worthy successor to Mel Gibson. The rest of the cast was also amazing.If you are new to the Mad Max franchise I can tell you right from the start that some things are extreme and some straight up ridiculous. The prequels are more ridiculous, but if you take a look at the world building George Miller and his writers you see how incredible it really is. Let's take an example with the film's villain Immortan Joe and he's played by the same actor that was featured in the first Mad Max, but it's two separate characters and Joe's Citadel and religious leadership is a fascinating and not entirely unrealistic but either way fantastic. There's also a huge attention to detail in the continuity of past films like for example Max's leg injury and iconic car.George Miller is a good screenwriter but I can only judge from the first three Mad Max movies and he wasn't great but that's alright because of his visual storytelling is superior and makes up for the not so good screenplay. The story have always been fascinating and enjoyable though. He's also a great and talented director, his Oscar nomination in Directing indicates that he did something right. He knew exactly what he wanted to do with this picture and he took the action genre to a new height.Sound mixing and sound editing was two categories that won an Oscar, and when you get the chance to experience the movie then you will understand why. Now when I re-watched it for maybe the third or forth time, my first in 4k blu-ray, the Dolby Atmos makes it powerful and the musical score mixed into that, incredible is a word I would use. The music should have earned a nomination as well as it flows so well with the film. The editing won an Oscar, and same with the sound editing and mixing, professional editing which made every scene entertaining and fascinating to watch.
There other wins it got was for production design, makeup and hairstyle also for costumes. It was won fair and square, the whole production was extraordinary.
The cinematography is visually stunning and overall impressive, and one thing I heard a YouTuber talking about which I read about now before writing this review and it was that George Miller told cinematographer John Seale to keep the main actor centered in the screen so that the viewer's eye did not have to search the screen due to the film's fast editing style, and it was done with such perfection.Without spoiling the most entertaining part of the movie, the massive chase scenes and action sequences I'll just say it mildly. It's one of the most stunning, suspenseful and enjoyable action sequences I have seen, it leaves you on the edge of your seat and it's a huge thanks to George Miller and his team that took the choice to make as much as possible practical. I don't know how much is CGI, but I know for a fact that most of what you see on the screen is real. The well choreographed and visually stunning action sequences have made me come back again and again, I won't stop anytime soon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Crazy Piles Up,"This movie has an excuse plot and it never pretends it doesn't. The dialogue is simultaneously flat and over-the-top, the actions the characters do at no point make sense and the only thing even remotely approaching a character arc is Nux's and the bulk of it is over a one-minute-long half-cooked conversation.In any other movie, that paragraph above would mean a rating of 2 or 3 from me, what pushes it to 7?Well... Everything else! The aforementioned excuse plot is there to have Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy and Nicholas Hoult witness and participate in Miller's string of increasingly insane ideas.This is obviously a movie the director had been waiting to make since the 70s, but the technology of the time and the budget didn't allow him. In retrospect, that worked in the other movies' (well, 1 and 2) favor since the less focus on crazy stunts meant more care for the characters, but I digress.This movie doesn't let its audience rest, for the most part. After every over-the-top stunt happens, something even crazier follows. Most of it is stuff we had seen before in other movies, mind you, but this movie's achievement is that it puts it all together and at no point one even questions what is happening. Most of my objections came after leaving the theater and thinking back on the ""plot"".A testament of my sensibilities, though, is that my favorite scene doesn't involve cars or explosions: It is the perfectly choreographed, adeptly directed, completely believable, raw and brutal fight of Max and his unlikely ally vs Furiosa and the Five Wives. It was almost transfixing.This is definitely a movie worth watching (albeit maybe not rewatching, I'm pretty sure most of the craziness loses its impact on second watch and one will find its lack of pathos more obvious).Plus, there's a red-clad guy on top of a truck playing a humongous guitar he also sleeps on. Anyone's argument is invalid.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Bombastic, grandiose, intelligent and wickedly entertaining","There aren't many action films that do much for me. Usually, the story itself isn't engaging enough for me, and sometimes the action just becomes way too overwhelming to the point that I become desensitized to it and lose interest pretty much. In fact, this is what happened to the rest of the Mad Max films. I think all are decent, but great? Not really. So I was super excited for this because of all of the acclaim, but also hesitantThankfully, this film really did it for me. In terms of narrative structure, it's pretty straight- forward, but the universe created here is nothing short of outstanding, and the themes it's presenting are grandiose and powerful. For all of its madness (and yeah, it's truly mad), there's a sensitivity to the film that I can't really pinpoint. It's one of the loudest, busiest films I think I've ever seen, but the fact that its heart shines through and it actually comes across as honestly trying to tell a story about human nature, and not just putting it for show because it ""needs"" to have a story, is wildly impressive. Some of the dialogue is stuff to be expected, but the way the film paints these relationships without trying too hard really pays off. The film is able to maintain its madness and through it all actually resonate emotionally. That's a grand featBut in terms of the action, wowza. Don't really know what else to say. Whereas many action films, and with a lot less action I may add, suffer from the way the action is filmed, nothing here does. The editing and cinematography need to be praised for that alone. There is so much happening and yet every scene comes across cleanly without any glaring problems. The film also cleverly overwhelms its first act with as much action as possible, and in its own way calms down after that. This helps to let viewers know that the classic ""action film"" structure will be broken, and it's done wonderfully.To say that this is my favorite Mad Max film would be a huge understatement. It's glorious and majestic, wickedly bombastic and entertaining. Easily one of my favorite ""action"" films ever, and the only time I've been overwhelmed by an action film but was still able to enjoy it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What a day! What a lovely day!,"After a 30-year break, George Miller returned for a fourth entrance of Mad Max franchise. It was quickly hailed as one of the best action films of the 2010s, earning top score reviews from numerous outlets. On an action level Fury Road was fantastic with it being constant thrill race with all its car chases and explosions. The final act was basically The Road Warrior on steriods.Whilst Fury Road was a Mad Max film, the titular character he was a supporting character in his own film. He was literally along for the ride at the beginning of the film. Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa was really the main character. She was the driving force of the plot and the action and Max just helped her. The story of young women escaping being sex slaves gave Fury Road feminist overtones.Whilst it satisfies as an action level the story and screenplay was skeleton thin. It's not a writing masterpiece like some critics have made it out to be.The music by Junkie XL was amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not a Mad max film.,"Pro's: This was not the worst movie I've seen. If it hadn't been called a Mad Max film I'd have given it a 3 or 4. So a -3 points for deception.Con's: This is not a Mad max film. His character is entirely irrelevant. He plays no role in the development of the plot (such as it is). None of the male characters are really relevant except the arch-villain (and his role is VERY limited). The central character is Charlize's ""Furiosa"". The acting is generally very unconvincing.There is no real story being told here. It is without a doubt the worst of the mad max lineup, if you even count it as being a mad max film (I don't). At no point did I reach the level needed for voluntary suspension of disbelief. This is a very silly movie, and not in a good way like Willy Wonka. There were numerous other issues too. I'll leave off them so as to avoid any spoilers for those who plan to see it.Bottom line I walked away from the film feeling as if I had duped. I went to see a Mad max film and got ""Furiosa, girl power"". I recommend renting and viewing Mad Max 1 or 2 again and giving this one a pass.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Crazy, Fun, Inventive, Beautiful...","Crazy, Fun, Inventive Beautiful and most of all CRAZY!?!!I've been a Mad Max fan growing up, I must have seen Road Warrior countless times and when I heard they were doing a remake/sequel without Mel Gibson I was skeptical. Then again it was George Miller, so perhaps there would be potential. The Mad Max series has progressed more and more with ideas and visions of how an apocalyptic society would be, and Fury Road had a far larger budget than the previous films.Visually the film is stunning and the car stunts are something I haven't seen. I'd compare the car stunts to the Raid 1 & 2, they are creative, over the top, and some scenes are very extreme. The acting is top notch as Fury Road has Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy. There's a sense of sadness through those characters. Also the other characters you get a small glimpse of the chaotic nature of this not so distant apocalyptic future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Madder than earlier,"Description: Oh what a day!!! What a lovely day!!! Max is taken prisoner who needs to escape. Don't worry I won't spoil it for you. Max gets into some deep trouble, the trailer shows him attached to a Deuce Coupe called The Nux Car in the middle of a fight he doesn't even want to be.Things I liked:Visuals: Breathtaking, totally steam-punk and beautifully done. Every frame is warm or cold and a wallpaper. Shocking at times due to the horror they oozed or the dizziness they induced, it made the whole movie watching experience unforgettable.Vehicles: Totally cruel and merciless instruments of death. Whoever has worked on it has a twisted mind. They have made use of whatever they could to design these vehicles. I read that they lost few vehicles to the desert while shooting, what a pity. I wish they create a museum of these vehicles for people to see them.War: Epic guns, spears and epic action choreography makes you want to watch this again and again.Music/Sound FX: We have hummed the soundtracks practically every time we watched, damn that music is awesome.Costume: Totally steam-punk, I need to get this jacket desperately. -Actors: Tom Hardy - Thank you for being Max, none could be madder than Mel Gibson but you. I've seen Bronson and now this, Sir, you are a great successor to Mad Max after Mel Gibson.Charlize Theron - You Ma'am are great and beautiful and bad-ass at the same time. When Furiosa is being followed for the first time, you can see tears in her eyes and she holds back and carries on with her mission to save the girls. You can see the desperation in her eyes. Hats off for the action and the great work as Furiosa.Hugh Keays-Byrne - The only actor who has acted in two Mad Max movies, Mad Max (1979) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). The actor has shown what cruel looks like. The way he calls out the women's name, ""Splendid"", it shows his command over them and how he dispensed cruelty over them.Nicholas Hoult - Nux was awesome, insane, we witnessed you take an acting in supporting role to a whole new level.Director: George Miller There is so much left unsaid but yet revealed in a different way to the audience. This was a work of art, once in a blue moon a movie like this is directed which blows our minds. This was legendary. For e.g. A lot is not shown about the cruelty of the villain, but we know that he feasts on the people's needs and keeps them hungry. We know that Max is delusional and deranged, but his past is not shown to us.This is like art, you are convinced and become part of a well written and directed movie. The cinematography, script, casting, music, drama, action, all stitched together create an unforgettable experience. Truly a worthy wait of 30 years!!!Blu-Ray: Do buy a Blu-Ray when it's out. But I wish they add more and more story to the unrevealed parts in the movie and reveal more of it to us. Maybe they add background of each character, deleted scenes. I wish the Blu- Ray is uncut.Verdict: I have loved what they did to the franchise, made it more insane. I exhort you to watch it if you haven't already. Fury Road isn't like the earlier Mad Max movies, it continues to entertain you from start to the end. I give it a 10/10. Do yourself a favor, watch it only in IMAX, because it's ...

"""If you can't fix what's broken, you'll go insane.""","The world of Mad Max has progressively become madder and madder; 30 years after the third film, Fury Road presents a fresh, new tale in the mythos of the legendary road warrior. This time, the picture the film paints of the future is far more vivid than anything that's come before. Against the backdrop of harsh desolation and vicious tyranny, the stage is set for a new round of intense vehicular carnage: what follows is a relentless onslaught of bullets, fire, and bloodshed.This film starts off fast and furious, and it keeps the pacing up all the way to its finale. It can be generalized as one two-hour chase scene, but that's not to say that the action ever becomes dull, or that the film never takes the time to breathe; like any great blockbuster experience, it's a roller-coaster ride so full of ups and downs that it keeps the audience exhilarated constantly. The film's chases are the biggest highlights; there are a plethora of incredibly well-designed vehicles that crash and burn in phenomenal ways, while the characters fight and struggle across the moving cars. The film is consistently loud, explosive, and intense. When the characters do manage to catch a break, the characters struggle against each other and against the elements, so there's hardly any drag at all.Within and outside of the action scenes, the film tells the story it needs to, and it does so with minimal use of exposition, very effectively showing more than it tells. In the same vein as The Raid, Dredd, or Duel, which were simple stories centered around the situation, so too does Fury Road use its central chase scenes as a basic skeleton from which to add on more to the characters and story. The characters are a compelling bunch; Max is reintroduced to us as a broken man, still haunted by events of the past (which are shown in rapid-fire flashbacks, and differ vastly from what's shown in Mad Max). Max's journey becomes entwined with that of Furiosa, a tough and brave woman whose motivations are revealed as the plot moves on. Together, Max and Furiosa represent two characters who are broken in some way, and join forces to fight their way to liberation and freedom. Some audiences have said that Furiosa is more the main character than Max, but I find that both share screen time equally, to complement each other the same way Max had to share time with everybody else in The Road Warrior as a rogue element. What might throw people off is that Max doesn't speak much in this film; what little he says is gruff and crude, and he fills the rest of the space with a few grunts and noises. However, Max remains the narrative focus of the film, as it tracks his journey in and out of bondage, and finally to liberation, to become a legendary drifter once more.This film is captured with fantastic photography and punchy editing. Color schemes are very bright and vivid. Filling in the shoes that Mel Gibson left behind, Tom Hardy plays Max Rockatansky with a phenomenal presence, and with blunt, animalistic dialogue, which is fitting for the primal world he inhabits. Charlize Theron plays it tough as Furiosa, but with enough distress to elicit sympathy for her struggle, and make her character well-grounded and well-rounded. Nicholas Hoult is surprisingly lovable in his role, and Hugh Keays-Byrne exudes a phenomenal presence as Immortan Joe, who stands as one of the most chilling villains I've seen in a while. Writing is concise and it gets the job done. This production has loads of superbly detailed sets, props, and costumes, all of which brings the post-apocalyptic world to life fantastically. It all contributes to showing and illustrating the culture of the War Boys, which shows plenty of well thought-out ideas and concepts. Most stunts and crashes were done practically; what few special effects the film has are used precisely and effectively, and are great. JXL's music score adds to the experience admirably.Mad Max: Fury Road is easily the best-looking film of the series, and it boasts the biggest and most brutal action scenes. It's a perfect example of how a simple premise can be used to tell an invoking story and craft an exhilarating experience. Best of all, it does so using the power of images and sound, just as cinema should.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ladies and Gentlemen I Present To You...The Greatest Action Film In Over A Decade!,"Mad Max Fury Road is directed by George Miller starring Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult and is a continuation to the Mad Max series making this the 4th film. Ladies, Gentlemen, Mad Max Fury Road, was Mind-Blowing. I haven't seen such amazing action sequences in a movie since movies like the Indiana Jones Trilogy, Aliens, Die Hard, Terminator 1 and 2, Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2, and the Matrix! This movies action is unbelievably revolutionary and original that it will make you so pumped to see the movie again and again. Now what makes this movie feel so unique, and so action packed, is its beautiful shots and smooth paced action shots. The big plus is that most of the action in this film is made by practical effects! Lately we have been watching lots of movies with unbelievable amounts of CGI, which is not a bad thing in some ways. I enjoy CGI once and a while it can sometimes be amazing and sometimes terrible. I recently saw Avengers 2 which was full of CGI and I hugely enjoyed the film. But the practical effects in this film were by far better than any of the CGI effects ever released out in the Cinematic Universe!Characters - Tom Hardy plays Max who is a man mentally troubled by his past, trying to find a path of hope through a futuristic post apocalyptic deserted world. Tom Hardy as Max I felt was a really good cast, especially since Hardy has been doing hugely well in his career. I didn't though feel like his character wasn't too impressive, but he still did a great job as Max. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa a women who is trying to escape with a special group of (I won't spoil what) cargo. She was a really badass character in this films and was a surprising addition to the Mad Max Universe. Nicholas Hoult plays Nux who was honestly my favorite character in the film because I found him the most relatable too. Nux is a member of Immortan Joe's settlement known as The Citadel, but later tries to ally himself with Max and Furiosa. Nux is corrected man who believes that he is destined for something great. I felt Nux was the most emotionally touching character that you can truly care for. Hugh Keays-Byrne plays Immortan Joe who is the main villain who I felt was a pretty badass villain in the film. He wasn't anything real special to the film, but I think he is a terrific addition to the Mad Max series.Plot - The plot is overall pretty simple. Furiosa is trying to get away from the settlement ""The Citadel"" with a special cargo when she later runs into Max who doesn't know whether to ally with her, or not. While this occurs, warriors from the Citadel chase down Furiosa throughout a straight through action packed, consistent film. This movie is straight forward action, there's not a ton of dialogue but it works and leaves the audience drooling with ""Ahhh"".Score/Soundtrack - I'm not really big on listening to a musical score in a film, but in this film the score is so pumping and exhilarating, you can't help but notice it. Like in Indiana Jones, there is consistent music that just pumps you up and makes you really really excited. This film had that kind of score that can greatly improve your enjoyment for the film.Action Sequences/Special Effects - The action and effects in this film is what makes Mad Max Fury Road, Mad Max Fury Road. The action in this film is so well directed with smooth and beautifully paced camera-work. Amazing stunt work that just can't make you not geek up and get excited. There was a man with a electric guitar that shot out huge flames playing on a truck with huge surround sound. Tell me that's not awesome!!! The practical effects in the film made me so amazed. Every shot you saw in this film could be a humongous poster that you can put on the Movie Theater walls. Every shot you see you can look at with ""Wow"" because its so beautiful and awesome! There's this one shot in particular that shows most of the vehicles lined up with a very mixed color sky background that was probably the most enjoyable landscape shot I have ever scene in a film. I am going to see this film in Theaters so many more times just to see the action in this film.Pros: -Great Casting -Fabulous Action Unlike Anything! -Amazing Effects -Great Casting -Motivating Original Score -Beautiful Landscape Shots -Interesting Narration -Very Unique to Many Action Films of TodayCons: -I COULDN'T FIND ANY!!!!!!!Guys, if you miss Mad Max Fury Road you will be missing out on the 2015 ride that you need for this year. It is by far the best film in over a decade and by far the best film so far and I will be quite surprised if this film beats any of my top films for 2015.

Firat watch the old version,"Firstly If i have never watched Mad Max series before i would have voted 5 or 6 out of 10 . Why? Because the atmosphere was right but there weren't enough Max in this movie but mostly furiosa. Also the story felt like incomplete, characters were too shallow. Especially Max was not crazy enough, he felt like a marvel hero. To be sure i actually watched an old Mad max movie and really there is a huge difference. Sure the special effects are much more convincing but the acting and the atmosphere is more convincing in old one.Why i gave 7 is because i love Mad Max series and i am hoping they will shoot more and while doing so they will improve.

(i'm blaming that now on the 3D, but i will watch again to be sure. the 3D did enhance many areas later on.) but soon enough they started injecting the characters with life, and we were off. i say it all the time, but once a movie has me caring about it's people, i'm able to achieve suspension of disbelief and take the ride i'm supposed to take.this latest version of the mad max universe was a masterful combination of the classic films and some creative new ideas. the mythology really entertained me and has me wanting to become a bigger fan of the series. i will definitely watch the original trilogy again. i had just watched them in 2014 but thanks to this film its time to go back already and really soak in as much of the mythos as possible. fury road has created a fanboy here.the picture was photographically beautiful. i'll enjoy looking at all that again in the near future. lots to marvel at. but also cinematically there were great things going on. moments in the big road battles were actually breathtaking, and the retro zooms and framerate speeds added the perfect touch that both paid tribute to the classics and added to the manic feel of the movie.i had also heard about the feminist interpretations of this film and i was not disappointed. this was my favorite charlize theron role ever. and the way they sort of deflated the cliché hero archetype to create this max was much appreciated here. i realize he wasn't super human in the originals either, but here we have a character who goes lower than anti-hero into pitiful territory. it's welcome in an age where we seem addicted to writing nauseatingly ""safe"" men in lead roles. the risk is taken here that max will not be idolized or even identified with by a large percent of the male population, and thats a refreshing change of pace.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Furious passion,"Forget about story arc. Mad Max: Fury Road is an unpredictable thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The protagonist Max stays in the background so that the secondary characters (who are not critical to a sequel) have screen time to be humanized before some of them are killed in an orgy of clever and inventive brutality. The refreshing lack of humor is made up for by a handful of personalities whose agendas are evident and therefore interesting. Although it is violent, the passion put into every scene shines through the bleakness. It feels authentic as dystopian fiction. The themes of despair and hopelessness are presented convincingly with the help of amazing settings, props and cinematography. I don't have any real complaints apart from Max being perhaps a bit too hard to relate to. Overall, here is a movie that has realized its potential.

Maximize your expectations,"First of all, I can't understand why some people walked out of the theater (some of them after 90 minutes). Some other are saying that it's only action with no storyline, and therefor hated it. Others are saying that the trailer seemed like a very different thing, and much better than the movie. This doesn't make any sense at all. If you saw the other mad max movies, you should know what to expect. If you saw the trailer, the deduction is the same, and if you appreciate solid movies with great storyline, you probably should watch drama, and not action. You go to see a movie with this name: ""MAD MAX"", you saw the trailer, you probably watched or at least have read something about the previous mad max movies, and still you wanted to see a movie with a great storyline!...something is escaping me...whatever! Well, I loved it...the action is great, the sound superb, the scenarios and color wonderful, and all the actors delivered.

"Welcome back, Max!","I enjoyed the new Mad Max film. It did justice to the first three films, while at the same time managing to add enough new elements to the mix to justify its own existence -- no small achievement! Tom Hardy didn't bring quite the same gravitas to the role as Mel Gibson did, and I would have preferred to see the aging actor in the role, which I think could have made it more moving when Max is suffering nightmarish visions of his dead wife and child -- that's the trouble with a reboot that doesn't ignore the previous films, in squaring away the new cast with what has gone before. But, all things considered, it didn't disappoint, and I suspect it's one that might be even better second time round, when there's a chance to take in more of the secondary characters and the visuals. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
There is MADNESS and then there is MAD MAX,"Taking your breath away is a sentence which I thought is clichéd and cannot actually happen unless you are hit by soccer ball in your guts. But this is exactly what happened after seeing this movie, I was getting breathless with non stop excitement.There is no story as such to this movie. it is about what a simple idea can do if the director has the vision as Miller has. This is directors movie. Period. No matter how great Charlize Theron is, she still couldn't upstage the director. Miller is a star.The vehicles used in this movie are out of this world and straight from hell. Shudder to think if something like this ever happens to the world and we start using such vehicles. There is no need for guns, the vehicles are enough to cause massive destruction to the mind and body.This is a road movie for the completely deranged. you will never know where you lost two hours when you see this movie. it is like someone is torturing you but you are still enjoying it and enjoying it a lot.Check out Nicholas Hoult ( the sweet zombie from Warm Bodies ). He is a revelation and I have never seen acting like that before. Miller made sure he has a villain to match the grand canvas and Immortan Joe as villain is picture perfect.1 point I am taking out of this movie ( not giving it a perfect 10) is because of TOM HARDY.

A masterpiece,"I think Mad Max Fury Road is a masterpiece ! Any director even thinking of directing an action film should be made to watch it. George Miller is a genius.

"Basically a live-action movie of the ""Motostorm"" Playstation game","This is a well-done action move. End of praise.I am shocked that this movie is trending at 98% ""fresh"" on another website that aggregates critic reviews. But I guess that measurement is basically saying that most people agree the movie is ""good"" (and not ""bad""), yet the depth and ""how good"" the movie is is not reflected in the score.I'm giving it a solid 6 out of 10; it IS a decent action movie, more ""good"" than ""bad"", yet there is little depth to the film. Seriously, this feels like a script that would have been written to fabricate a ""story"" to fit the Playstation 3 game ""Motostorm"", which is essentially a bunch of crazy vehicles racing in a post-apocalyptic desert location. Well, that is basically the plot of Mad Max. The acting IS good, but don't expect the best movie ever; this is not a Chris Nolan style action movie, folks.By the way, I AM old and a fan of all of the original films (even Thunderdome); this one is a fine reboot, but is so over-the-top I would rank it slightly behind the original series since the action sequences are pretty much unbelievable (although I did appreciate that many of the sequences were true live-action and not 100% CGI, although there is some obvious CGI going on plenty of times).Recommended if you want a decent non-stop action movie without much plot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A triumphant return to form for both Mad Max and George Miller!,"Let me just first say that right off the bat that Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most insane action films that I have ever seen! Although the film deviates heavily from the original trilogy in terms of aesthetics (the overtly orange-yellow palette, the ridiculousness of the action scenes...), the story and spirit remains pretty much the same: Max Rockatansky is trapped in a post- apocalyptic Australia and does all he can to survive - while getting involved in the dangerous affairs of others.Prior to watching Fury Road, I quickly squeezed in some time to watch both the Mad Max and Mad Max: Road Warrior - both great movies in their own right. Entering Fury Road, I had some expectations of how the latest Mad Max installment would turn out. Based on my rating for this movie, one can say that my expectations were blown out of the water.Tom Hardy as Mad Max is just as good as Mel Gibson as Mad Max. The character's lack of faith in humanity, paranoia of strangers, and sense of loneliness are all brought convincingly to the screen by Hardy. Not to mention, he can be just as brutal and violent - don't worry, some of the best action scenes in this film belong to Max (despite the belief that this movie eventually sidelines Max for Furiosa).That's another thing that really surprised me - Charlize Theron as the tough-as-nails Imperator Furiosa. Not only is she completely unrecognizable in the role, but also (IMO) gives one of her career bests here! Her commanding presence on screen is proved by the fact that she can hold her own against any of the male characters (including Max), and that she can take great risks at the expense of the group she's trying to save. Along the way, she also makes a number of painful decisions that elevates the film's emotional impact. In all honestly, I'm hoping that Miller and Warner Bros. do a spin-off movie for Theron's character if Fury Road proves to be a success at the box office.The story may seem simple and straightforward (it basically feels like two long, ridiculous car chases), but don't let that detract you from the fact that it is imbued with a deep sense of back-story and many complex themes. Despite what sceptics are saying, Mad Max: Fury Road is not some dumb, typical popcorn-flick. The film also lightly touches on a number of current social/political issues: gender equality, global warming, and authoritarianism.Recently, I've been noticing a number of my reviews haven't been helpful too fellow readers. If anything, I believe one of the reasons why they aren't helpful may have to do with the fact that I assign a 'verdict' at the end of my reviews – telling people whether or not they should be watching the film on the big screen. I realized that in my short time as a movie reviewer, people will make that decision on their own regardless if they take my review into consideration. I also realize that he/she may actually end up liking a movie I gave a poor rating to or disliking a movie I gave a great rating to – and that I have to respect that. Starting with this review, I will no longer be putting 'verdicts' at the end of my reviews.All in all, Mad Max: Fury Road is designed and meant to be seen on the big screen. I'm certainly glad that I saw it on the big screen (even though at first I had no plans to see it at all), and highly recommend it to anyone. This is a great film; don't let the opportunity slip by.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The acting of Charlize was great, tom hardy did the same as he did in the drop, the dark knight and all his other movies.The movie setting was great and there was something with water and people driving around, getting away from stuff and returning to it.

"Explosive whirlwind of entertainment, no action fan will leave this film disappointed","So this is what happens when you give George Miller a good budget.Completing a recent trifecta of spectacular world cinema in the action category (The Raid 1 and 2), Mad Max Fury Road not only easily becomes among the top movies of 2015, but arguably amongst the best action movies this century. Two hours of absolute post-apocalyptic mayhem, this is one of the rare sequels that not only stands tall with the originals, but actually surpasses them. What used to slightly restrict the previous Mad Max movies were budget and technical limitations. But in the 21st century, with more money involved, and more resources to tap into, George Miller's decade-in-the-making vision comes to life in the most entertaining and thrilling way.Fury Road may have the Mad Max tag, but his story is just one of many that roam around. The most impressive amongst the cast (Tom Hardy as Max really didn't have much to do outside participation in the carnage) is definitely Charlize Theron, who plays the tough-as-nails woman that jump-starts the action that will preside over the last 100 minutes of the film. Without mentioning too much, Theron (has there been a quieter action career than Theron?) as Furiosa steals a massive armored rig and raises absolute hell as she tries to make it to her childhood homeland with other prisoners. Crossing paths with her is Max, a loner with recovering from his past who also has been taken prisoner. Even though plot isn't usually a focus point in action movies of this caliber, there is plenty of social commentary and feminist themes to stir the pot.While the verbal and storyline aspects are nothing to scoff at, the technical details of this movie is the headlining show here. Nearly flawless, from the art direction to the cinematography to the editing, the apocalypse has never looked so beautiful. The colors pop out at you, and the camera-work isn't shy of displaying the miles upon miles of nothingness that surrounds the characters. It truly feels like the end of the world as you see the small shadowy figures of vehicles maneuver through the layers of sand or see dark blue darkness when the sun mercifully comes down. And then you have the wide array of visually unique characters that look straight out of your pulp comic books (Yes, the guitar-playing fiend deserves his own story). It's a hauntingly beautiful ride.Miller's directing is what makes the movie stand out. The action sequences are intense, relentless, and done with so much precision and attention to detail; you cannot look away from the screen a millisecond as you see the next round of carnage take place. This movie tries excruciatingly hard to separate itself from the pack of normal summer blockbusters, and it succeeds by pacing like a video game; continuously escalating and topping the previous action sequence.The Raid movies also notoriously saved their best tricks for last. And my friends, even if you might be the slightest bit underwhelmed just wait until the final 30 minutes. Be prepared for some of the tightest and well-choreographed action since the criminally underrated Adventures of Tintin (The ""Opera Chase"" deserves much more love). The mix of special and practical effects blends in so well you swear you can smell the burning tires. The movie is one big long vehicular chase, and one that never starts feeling stale.Summer may have peaked extremely early, because it will be very difficult to top the vicious joyride of Fury Road. From start to finish, from the top-tier acting right down to the sound effects, this Mad Max installment is the best hands-down, even though Hardy is no vintage Mel Gibson. Not sure what happened to American action filmmaking, but now Australia and Indonesia own the right to claim their country has produced the finest action flicks this decade. If you are in the mood for a highly entertaining yet original action extravaganza, look no further. By the time 2015 finishes, I can guarantee you that Mad Max Fury Road will remain as one of the best movies in the entire year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Visually stunning average script..,"Mad Max is visually stunning film. Most of the movies special effects and stunts are real and you really can see it. Mad Max looks like a movie which won't produced any longer. Today most of the special effects are made with computers. Even the quality of today's CGI-effects still never looks so good like the old type explosions and stunts like they were done in this movie. Frank Millers visuality is beautiful to watch and movies red/brown landscape looks almost magical. Movie is full throttle action from start to finish. That can be a strength of this movie, but it is also the weakness of it. Because of all the action thru out entire movie it's ending won't blow your mind. Also there are some weakness in it's script. Script isn't very clever but it's weakness is buried with all the action. Tom Hardy is good choice to play Mad Max even the story won't give to him much enough to shine in his role. Despite it's weakness in story Mad Max is still one of the best action movies this year so far. With better script it would be perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Listen modern directors: show, don't tell.","If you're tired of films with more exposition than story, then this is your post-apocalyptic Citizen Kane.Mad Max: Fury Road is the story of Max Rockatansky, a former cop with a hero complex who's slowly being driven mad by visions of his past. He's soon captured by a band of paint-streaked fanatics who take him back to The Citadel. There we encounter Immortan Joe, theocratic dictator who holds his population enslaved via his control of the most precious resources in a post-apocalyptic world: clean water. Joe is treated like a deity by his ""war boys,"" a cadre of genetically damaged soldiers who live short lives and are willing to sacrifice themselves to do his bidding.During a routine run to gas town, one of Joe's most trusted war generals, Empirator Furiosa, veers off unexpectedly. We soon learn that she's smuggling precious cargo: the so-called wives of the dictator. Joe finds out, chase ensues, and the mad Max somehow finds himself involved.To parrot every other review for the film yes, the mostly practical effects are spectacular, yes the editing is great, yeah the characters are interesting, and of course the themes are fascinating. But what's most impressive about this film is the innovative way it handles its story. George Miller gives us a narrative that's almost completely devoid of expository dialogue. He asks us to infer things like character motivation and world status through action instead of dialogue. We never get a scene explaining why a character feels a certain way or how Joe's regime came to be, we see characters whose dialogue is meant to make situation sense and not simply serve the plot. This is a refreshing contrast to Christopher Nolan style writing, where half the script is spent explaining the other half. Miller has faith in his audience's intelligence, and doesn't condescend with simplistic elephant analogies or examples ripped from Event Horizon.The film wears its political leanings on its sleeve, and its feministic elements go far beyond giving its action heroine so much agency. There's a matriarchy depicted as being a possible viable alternative to the patriarchal Joe. The film deals with themes like the perception of women as property, and the attempt to control women's bodies in various ways. It's rare (and therefore interesting) to see a high budget film this explicitly political.So yeah, watch this film. Don't just watch it for the spectacle, but be amazed as to why simple doesn't necessarily mean simplistic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Feels a bit like the old Max, but disappointing","I'm old enough to have caught all the original Mad Max movies when they hit the silver screen here in America.It was entertaining but I felt sort of let down. I expected more of original formula. As much as I like Tom Hardy in other movies, he honestly couldn't carry the Mad Max character. Then they tried to make up for it with some weird horror like montage/flashbacks. I got the feeling this ""Max"" had either gone insane or maybe he was on some serious drugs.Mel has this sort of spark to him. His version was much stronger, more masculine, sort of like a superhero. Harding on the other hand seemed weak and kind of mushy.I'm starting to feel that Gibson would have been better again despite his age. Sure maybe he couldn't crawl under a truck anymore, but Arnold and Stallone carry an action movie fine and they are even older!It did have the Mad Max feel to it at times, but for the most part it seemed to have a lot more of the modern feel.Unfortunately this time Miller must have been wooed and couldn't resist the temptation to over do special effects like 90% of most action movies are these days. I'll say it again, and again, if you don't have story you don't have anything.Does every movie need to be one and half hours plus of pure SFX? It got to a point were the movie seemed too implausible and surreal.And then it seems like Miller was thinking ""screw it, I'm going to make this movie really mean something!""; and make this weird dynamic about some political statements all over. Miller seemed have gotten soft in the head. The originals were like ""Watch this wild strong guy try to survive in some apocalyptic wasteland"" and that was all we needed.This move just doesn't have that magic. The original Max really had this edge to it. And it had a lot of character.In the end it's a pretty entertaining movie, but like me you'll probably leave a bit disappointed if you were a big fan of the originals..",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Ugly, but in a good way.","Who would have thought that 30 years after Beyond Thunderdome we'd be treated to an actually decent Mad Max movie? Actually, just plain decent doesn't do this movie justice; it was fantastic.Beyond Thunderdome took the Mad Max series into a cutesy, kid-friendly direction. Thunderdome was closer to being The Goonies than having anything to do with the stellar second film, The Road Warrior. Thankfully Fury Road is ugly, gritty and fast paced. There is maybe a total of 12 minutes of this film that have no action.Fury Road is exceptional because of how relentlessly it throws images of carnage at the viewer. Take the infamous big rig chase scene from the Road Warrior, multiply it by 10 and you've got Fury Road. However, it's still even so much more than that! I was astonished at how nicely shot and clear all the stunts were in this film. I say clear because I pretty much never lost track of what was going on amidst all the boom boom. Coherency is so rare in modern action films, of which many are full of boisterous CG effects that destroy your perception of what is happening.The only thing I can ding this movie for is that the plot is slightly jagged. However, the sheer brilliance in the pacing of this film smooths even those hiccups.I highly recommend Mad Max: Fury Road.

Totally unexpected,"I wouldn't usually watch films of this sort of genre, I'm not always a fan of the image that they create and the in your face advertising, which usually disappoint. With Mad Max, it lives up to the reputation. the whole world that is created in this film is marvellous, real aesthetic is built up before the torrent of violence occurs. while of course the film is never going to be heavily character based with complex layered story lines, for what it is, it is a widely enjoyable film. the costume and design is very absorbing in itself, with realistic props being created. I do feel the film needed a little more dialogue, the characters often became unrelatable or cared for due to the lack of development, if something bad happened to certain characters, often the feeling created was less than sympathetic. overall, however, it remains a strong film with good aesthetics created and enough fast paced drama to ensure the film progressed at a good rate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

SURELY ONE OF THE 10 BEST FILMS EVER MADE.,"Now THIS is what entertainment, let alone films, is supposed to be.

This film has set a new bar for action cinema, and, quite frankly, it is unlikely we will ever see anything so spectacular again.Charlize Theron gives a performance that lives up to the namesake of her character Furiosa, establishing one of the meanest, toughest, and dare I say, sexiest characters ever written onto the screen.

George Miller produced an action movie on a scale, unlike anything I have ever seen. The effects were almost all practical, giving the movie a grit and realism that most films never reach due to the overuse of computer-generated effects.

It did not seem to have much of a story line, other than the never ending car chase across the desert.For me, it was really Charlize Theron's movie, with Tom Hardy co-staring as Max. It was a flat performance that I was glad to see the end of.It was good to see a scattering of Australian actors in the cast and some of the old cars. Unfortunately not enough of the Ford coupe made famous in movies 1 and 2.The car chases were well done, and I've read that there was very little CGI used which makes them all the more impressive. Good photography, let down by the script.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What on earth are people thinking? This is one of the best movies ever made.,DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE RATING THIS 1-4 STARS.These people are living on Mars.I am not even a mad max fan and this film blows me away.THIS MOVIE IS DESIGNED TO BE WATCHED ON A MASSIVE SCREEN WITH A GOOD QUALITY SOUND SYSTEM. ESPECIALLY THE BASE.It may give you a completely different perspective on this film.The thing that makes it all that much better is there is almost no CGI in this movie. They did all there stunts live with real vehicles and explosions. You can watch a video about it.Get watching this movie right now and don't even waste your time reading the negative views because they are all drivel.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Arguably the best action film ever made,"Mad Max: Fury RoadIt is unbelievable that Mad Max: Fury Road's director George Miller made Happy Feet and Babe but then he also made the original Mad Max and hence that statement should be the other way around. Of course, since this is almost 30 years since that Mad Max, the new version is at least 30 times grander.Somewhere George Miller is yelling ""My movie's action will speak louder than words"" and that's exactly what the film does. It is a visual spectacle that redefines the sheer pace of an action movie narrative. Almost 90 minutes of the 120 minute movie happens on dirt-kicking moving vehicles which just refuse to slow down. When the vehicles stop you are gasping for air and feel like taking a shower but before u can regain your senses those mutated vehicles are running again.Of course, words are not important, whenever the action quietens you have stunted B Movie dialogues which could have been better except for this hidden gem ""Hope is a mistake, if you cant fix whats broken you will go insane."" My only grouse with the film though was that whenever there is an opportunity to show unbridled gore, Miller flinches (maybe cause a NC-17 threat was peeking over his shoulder) but the movies jarring metal soundtrack makes up for it.The star if not 'the action' would be by far Charlize Theron as Furiosa, a cold and calculating rebel who has balls of steel and then there is Tom Hardy as Mad Max who is more insane than Mel Gibson could ever get. See his eyes dart to and fro in a crucial climax scene. The guy seems dead inside much like the desolate wastleand he dwells in and yet there is a craziness which lurks in him.Mad Max is not a perfect film and may age poorly but it is definitely the most exhilarating film you would see in a long time.One Word: Epic!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Isn't It Suppose To Be All About Mad Max?,"I thought Mad Max was suppose to be the main character in a Mad Max film. This film focused on Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and her struggles to find her home land a little more than it did Mad Max (Tom Hardy), in my opinion, not that I'm complaining because it's still a great film. This film is set in an apocalyptic era, of course, which causes it to be a breeding ground for a lot of action and to me that's what made this film so great. Almost from beginning to end there's enough nonstop action to keep any action film fan satisfied. The story line that involves the two main characters were simple but the action completely made up for that. Overall it's a good film, not what I expected it to be but still good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Truly remarkable,"Initially when first seeing this I was a bit underwhelmed. I mean I thought it was cool but it felt very ""style over substance"". Years late I've watched it countless times and I definitely have a different opinion of it. Its without a doubt one of the wildest, creative, pulse pounding, unique films ever made. The star of the movie is of course Furiosa played by a fierce Charlize Theron whom justly won an oscar for it. Nicholas Hoult is the second most interesting character and his journey is truly emotional and engaging. And well the title character Mad Max is the third most interesting character. Tom Hardy does a solid job of playing him crazy but the role is underwritten and mostly depends on his impressive physicality. Set years after the third film and Max has failed to help the tribe of children. He's constantly haunted by them and finds himself suddenly thrust into a harrowing situation in which Furiosa betrays her boss and decides to help his wives to escape. The action scenes are thrilling and have a real raw energy to them. The score is wonderfully intense and epic and the cinematography and stunt work are something truly magical and need to be seen to be believed. In the end it's not completely able to shake some thin spots but overall it's one of the best films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Simple, exciting, raw and unique action on-wheels","A movie worth seen that could only improve if the facial expressions and interpretations of the actors became more... expressive. Also, maybe at some points it lacks stronger lines on the conversations.Nevertheless, in general, unquestionably it passes the message it wanted to: a raw action survival in a post-apocaliptic (or may I say, ""post-climate change""?) earth, where humans have been dehumanized and reduced to instincts in pursuit of survival (that can explain the simplistic expressiveness of the characters at most of the time, but I personally still think they could have been portrayed as decaying humans with feelings at some times). If you want an intelligent action movie, that's not the one, but if you want an exciting, full-of-crazy-on-wheels-action, unstoppable and survival pursuit of dignity, it sure as hell fits it.This way, basically, Mad Max: Fury Road is a diferenciated, strong and exciting story that does not go into the shelf of the best movies or actions movies of all-time (as some might say), but it sure does differs from the common and generally follows its raw plot idea with an creativity and boldness worth seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Mad and the Furious,"This is one of my personal favorite films. I'm actually a fan of the Mad Max films, I really liked the first one, second one ""The Road Warrior"" was even better and is also a personal favorite film of mine. It was a long wait for this film like reaching the destination of any long road trip it was well worth the trip.I really like the look of the post apocalyptic world which I feel just like with ""The Road Warrior"" is in a wider scope, it's dark and yet fascinating at the same time. Despite the lack of certain technologies they at least have some technology that works but of course the most valued are the automobiles which is to me what makes the post apocalyptic world fascinating because it's a automobile subculture taken to the extreme.It also really looks like the Mad/insane have truly taken over the earth. And it seems like Max and Furiosa along with others are literally almost the last sane people on Earth. Which really creates that isolation feeling.Nicholas Hoult as Nux I though was a fun character and actually has a really solid character arc. He's crazy and yet he's actually really smart which makes him useful to the crew.Tom Hardy is excellent as Max Rochatansky, I really love the voice which is kinda rough and gravelly tone. Max is well still Max, it's true he doesn't say much in the film but Max wasn't known much for talk anyway because he's a man of action. And I like that as usual he's reluctant to do the right thing but he does it anyway because of how driven he is by his conscious and lets face it what else is he going to do.Charlize Theron was just fantastic as Imperator Furiosa. She's one on my favorite fictional feme fatales up there with Betrix Kiddo (Kill Bill), Ripley (Aliens) and others on my list (I said my list) and literally steals the show. Her character is just true to her name as she is just driven by fury and is just hellbent to her task willing to mow down anyone that gets in her way. I love that she can kick some serious ass and takes crap from no one, she literally almost beats Max in a one on one fisticuff fight which I always find cool seeing a supporting protagonist beating or coming close to beating the main one which I don't see enough of.Both Max and her have an excellent back and forth, in a way it's sort of the first time Max had a go two person that was a match for him and Furiosa is more that one for him. Both in a way are almost the same in a way as both have been robbed of their family and are mad at the gangs, the world and themselves.I like that with all three characters they have something in common all three want redemption. For Max in his mind he failed to protect his wife and child from the scum in this world. Nux wants to be a hero but has been playing for the wrong team. Furiosa was practically kidnapped and forced to be one of Joe's solders. This one task in transporting the slave girls to salvation is to them is the thing they need the mos to make some difference in the mad world, and of course what their doing amounts to making a big difference.The villain I thought was solid, fun and memorable, Immortan Joe played by Hugh Keys Bryne whom played the main villain in the first film. Which is really cool because in a way it makes things come full circle. I really like the look of him, he really looks like Sweet Tooth from the ""Twisted Metal"" video games. I really like the voice which is menacing and you can tell from his mannerism he is completely crazy and nasty from the inside out, which is just all the more motive for all three protagonists to get away from him.But like with most of the Mad Max films we're all really in it for the action and automobiles and both have plenty of gas and speed to keep you entertained.The automobiles are also the stars of the film and their terrific. I really love the designs of each of the automobiles which all look like they could be on the roster list in the ""Twisted Metal"" video game franchise. Each of them are uniquely colorful, dangerous and crazy looking. From one vehicle that is a mobile rock concert where there are enough amps to make anyone go deaf and there is some crazy mummy guy playing a guitar that also doubles for a flame thrower. Another with a crazy amount of spikes front to back, it's practically a mobile porcupine.The action is just fantastic, the stunt work and chirography in fight but also automotive driving is spot on. And it's over the top violence which makes it even better where automobiles are just exploding left and right, bodies and body parts are just flying, heads are getting blown off, and so forth.I really love the fact that this film is kinda one big chase movie which is great because it makes the film simplistic no boring bull crap, the pacing in this film is just constantly going almost like in the film ""Speed"" where you hardly have time to take a breath. One of the action sequences I really liked was seeing Max just jump on one rival vehicle after another and just beating the crap or killing any of baddies manning them, it just sort of remind me of Swashbulckling action.Well I've said enough, Max is back and still has plenty of millage for fun.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sensory overload!!,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a triumphant realisation of all that is possible on the big screen. The explosions, the violence, the sounds!! Forget all that you think you know about blockbuster action movies. This is it!! Okay, let's pump the brakes for a second. What makes a classic movie? Storyline and dialogue. Sure, but we'll have none of that here thank you! Not necessary!! Don't get me wrong, I love a good, cleverly written movie with witty dialogue and an interesting premise, plus a dash of quirkiness. But, although 'Mad Max' is indeed interesting it doesn't have or need any of that other stuff. This is visual story telling in its most basic and pure form. It is little more than a car chase through the desert spanning a couple of days and destroying countless vehicles and lives along the way. And it is beyond epic. This is quite possibly the most action packed movie I have ever seen. At times it borders on complete sensory overload. There is just so much awesome stuff going on (including a gimp chained to a truck playing a flame throwing guitar!!). And ladies, yes, you should be going to see this with your boyfriend/husband/significant other. Hell, go with the girls. The thing is this: I don't remember ever seeing a movie with so many strong female characters in it kicking serious arse. True, many of them are insanely hot, but some are also old and wrinkly. All are awesome. Girl power all the way. I would be so darn happy if I went to see this again and there were big groups of girls going to celebrate having a vag and an attitude in this high speed desert pursuit rather than the formulaic, clichéd bullshit that is 'Pitch Perfect 2'. Sorry, I just don't care how funny Fat Amy is. Director George Miller deserves to be knighted. Or, at the very least, he should be given his own reality TV show where he gets to judge the everyday functions of everyday people in a situation that makes it seem somehow not mundane, thereby becoming the most popular personality on TV. The guy is a saint. When I first heard they were making a new Mad Max a thousand years after 'Thunderdome' I was highly skeptical. No way could he pull this off. No way could he make this relevant. Modern audiences won't appreciate it. What's he gonna do? Have an old Mel Gibson? Oh wait, Tom Hardy is going to play Max and it's going to be set around the same time as the original movies??? I dunno man I have never been so happy to be wrong about a movie. The theme song from the Lego movie belongs here now. Everything is awesome.

A Mad & Fury Blockbuster Worth The Hype,"When a few years back, Australian director George Miller announced a new Mad Max film would be in the works but sadly it would have taken over 25 years for the project to fly off the development stages (as there was issues with production, locations and even script development over the years) but this year was the year audiences would finally see it on the screen in this final completed work. The question is for all fans was; would it be worth the wait all these years to happen, and would it be worthy as its original trilogy? The following summary below pretty much sums up the wait and anticipation had really paid off for both the fans and the filmmakers.Fury Road is a worthy wild action ride that packs punch, value and high quality into the trilogy that was established previously, it can be considered both a reboot and a sequel but this enables Miller to expand the wasteland universe and to further the life of the 'Road Warrior' Max. Having seen the trilogy countless times, we are immediately aware of the production value it should carry, but with the film having the biggest budget to use (beating the trilogy's separate budget values), Miller crafts not only an epic film in action and storytelling, but in terms of value, concept and direction he gives us a shining feature that stands strongly and respectively for the fans of the franchise.Casting in the film was great, in particular marks the first time that a different actor has filled in the shoes and duty of portraying Max and that actor was Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises, Lokie, Bronson and Inception). At the time when it was announced of his role, fans both agreed or disagreed with this casting choice as he was of British decent and it was Mel Gibson that defined the role as iconic for both him and the franchise. With Hardy, he gives a solid performance that makes us feel that Max has still strong after so many years past since Thunderdome, and pulls it off without no flaws that makes him solid like Gibson. Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron plays as Furiosa, a character that seems to take the leading action role as much as Hardy but there has been criticism from various anti-feminist groups that she is more dominate and more action-oriented than Hardy's character on screen and thus making fans feel that Max is a secondary character. From my perspective, this is a false fact as Max does play a major role throughout the story; as he's assisting with Furiosa's journey of redemption to bring the women into a safer world, without Max's assistance she may not have survived Joe's ambush and violent attacks to stop her.The supporting cast includes the talents of Nicholas Hoult (X-Men: Days of Future Past, Warm Bodies), Hugh Keays-Byrne (From the original Mad Max), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Nathan Jones and Megan Gale to name some, in which all play great performances in their roles. From my eye, Hoult makes homage to the Gyro Captain (from Mad Max 2) that's in the form of his wild boy character Nux while Byrne's Immortan Joe is dominate as the villain and bares the similar voice with Bane (played by Hardy ) with tension and pure bad buy quality (there's barely any bad dialogue from him or any of the characters).In terms of action, Fury Road is indeed a major contender for action quality that matches not only the quality from the previous films but takes it further in terms of stunts, practical effects and choreography work. From explosive crashes, high-wired acrobats, jumping and moving along moving vehicles and fist fights on top of tankers, the film does it with amazing eye for detail and realism using practical effects and stunt people whilst using minimal CGI to assist the action or landscape. The fast and clear camera work and editing makes the action sequences seem so beautiful, brutal and flat out insane that it leaves the recent Fast and Furious films in the dirt and in shame.Cinematography, sound mixing, editing and practical effects are all top notch throughout the film, Miller and his crew give the action, story, its characters and its deserted environment a style that has been missing from the genre for sometime (though a few today have occurred to be solid examples such as The Raid 2, Furious 7, Kingsman and even some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films) but Miller reignites both the genre and his style of filmmaking that make it seem possible for the film to get Oscar worthy consideration in 2016; which would be nominated for best cinematography, sound mixing/editing, visual effects and possibly direction. The amazing cars featured (including the signature Interceptor) are all real, detailed and seemed so based from the minds of Miller and his design team and it's a true fact that 350 vehicles were used in the film, but who knows how many of them were destroyed during the making of the film (I hope the future home entertainment release will feature a behind the scenes look into this and the production values).OVERALL:Mad Max: Fury Road is an epic action ride that delivers solid entertainment for both action fans and fans of the original trilogy, Miller has taken so many years to get this franchise back on the screen and the results we see are the best we've seen in filmmaking and the genre itself. This is perhaps my favourite film I've seen alongside Age of Ultron, CHAPPiE, Kingsman: The Secret Service and Birdman but this film stands at the first position and earns itself an 'Seal of Approval' for quality entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Also, Charlie and Tom embody the spirit of Mad Max. They carry the movie with very limited dialogues; only through their actions and eyes. Tom like his other roles in Lawless and Locke mesmerises with acting skills.While there are quite a few ways Miller could have captured gore, but he craftily leaves it for the viewers evil imagination for filling in the gaps.

Best action film I've seen in oh so long...oh so good!,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"": This was my absolute, most anticipated film for the entire year. And to just get this immediately out of the way, this film did not in any single way whatsoever disappoint me. It has been days since I've seen the film and I'm still pumped about it. ""Fury Road"" is a masterpiece. That is exactly what it is and there is not another word that describes it any better. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word in terms of action, concept, writing, character, style, effects, acting, sheer filmmaking. I grew up knowing of the ""Mad Max"" franchise but I didn't really grow up with it other than the glimpses I had gotten and the few scenes I caught on television as a kid. Not until I got into my late teens that I caught the first Mad Max movie on TV one night and I liked it, but it wasn't until the second viewing a few years later that I fell in love with it. It was something that for some reason or another went over my head the first go around, but when it finally clicked I went straight into watching the second film ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"". At the time I was determined to not let the second film one go over my head like its predecessor, and I fell for ""Road Warrior"" right away. To me, the first two movies are some of the greatest action films of all time; although that is pretty commonly said about ""Road Warrior"", the original I think is pretty underrated. Now, ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" I honestly don't like much at all. There's really no hate that I have for ""Thunderdome"", but there not a whole lot for me to enjoy about it either. Mel Gibson is still good in the role and that's about it. Then when I came across the rumor of ""Fury Road"", at first I was a little skeptical but once I saw a trailer and some still images, any skepticism I previously had completely subsided and was replaced with excitement. If this film ended up being bad, you have no idea how depressed I would be. The fact that this actually somehow exceeded my expectations is beyond comprehension. ""Thunderdome"" wishes it could have been this. For a film being in production hell for 30 years, this was an unbelievable achievement in film history. Probably because it had a genius like George Miller behind it; creating the entire story solely out of storyboards alone. Which makes this film such a rich experience; it's as if I was watching a silent film at times. Every shot was completely stunning. Any time the movie took a breath, it was still so beautifully constructed that I could put the film on mute and still get an emotional response. Although I will say that the musical score was just as beautifully composed and added even more to the performances on screen. There is not a boring moment throughout any of the running time. There is not a dull character that comes into play. There is not a bad stunt or special effect thrown in during any of the action. It is as close to flawless as humanly possible. I will say that it was slightly sad not seeing Mel Gibson in the role anymore, but Tom Hardy nails everything about Max Rockatansky. That is the most negative comment I could say about the whole thing, and I don't even think that even comes close to counting as a knock against the movie, actually in a way is a compliment to a talented actor. He felt like the same character, but has naturally progressed into more of a primal being than before. For the first half of the film he doesn't even really speak, he grunts. This was awesome just to watch him sort of mumble and grunt to himself and some of the other characters. But I loved that the film still remembers the first ""Mad Max"", being haunted by the death of his family. It went into that territory just enough that it supplied me the character development for Max that felt satisfactory and justified the movie to remain as action packed without feeling as though there were no one worth routing. As much as this is Max's movie, it is equally Furiosa's too, played by Charlize Theron. Oh god she did fantastic in this; embodying exactly what Miller said to be, the ""Female Road Warrior"". In anyone else's hands, could have gone horribly wrong, but it doesn't. She is fierce while also heartbreaking. Furiosa deserves as much credit for making this film work as Max does, if not more so in some aspects. Lastly, I just want to go over the villain real quick. Entering the frame, it was as if seeing the next Darth Vader pop on screen. Immortan Joe holds such a presence that I thought I was gonna s**t my pants! So now that I have gone on and on about this movie, this is a must see for the summer. For the year. For the decade. A straight up ""must see"", period. I loved this movie. It's pretty obvious that most everyone who has seen this film loves it. I do not want this to be the next ""Dredd"" film. Or ""Edge of Tomorrow"" where it is an absolute great film that gets screwed in the box office and never gets another chance to expand its universe with a sequel. This is one of the greatest action films of all time right next to the first two Mad Max films in cinema history. Please go out and watch this. I am begging you, if I don't get a sequel to this then I am going to go on a killing rampage...I mean, I will be very sad. Seriously though, was fantastic and I hope to see more of Max's, and even Furiosa's, story in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max returns,"This is the film that George Miller shall had done 30 years ago instead of the tepid Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome.Tom Hardy steps into the boots of Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky. A man of few words, haunted by the past and cares little of the world he is living in.Charlize Theron is Imperator Furiosa who wreaks revenge on evil Immortan Joe by taking his young wives whose sole purpose is to make babies and be his chattel.As the ladies escape they come across Max who is help captive by Joe's gang and he reluctantly helps them escape while being pursued by Joe, his sons and other members of his posse.No doubt this reboot expands the premise of Mad Max 2 and is effectively a one long bonkers chase film with stunning stunts and visuals.As a nod to the original Mad Max, Hugh Keays-Byrne returns as the villain but plays a different character, the sadistic Immortan Joe. The Mad Max films has form of having the same actors playing different characters.The film adds a feminist twist with Theron joining Hardy as the lead character and Max being helped out by a group of women escaping from Joe's clutches.As for Hardy, it is unfortunate that he had so few lines and I have to say that he has yet to wrest the role from Mel Gibson.The film won six technical Oscars and was a contender for the best Picture and Director Oscars.

The Winner of 2015,"Twenty years from now, when film geeks and ordinary movie-goers both look back on the movies of 2015, which one will first spring to mind as the movie that most defined the year? Above the Avengers, above all the traditional Oscar-fare, above even the return of Star Wars, Fury Road stands as the movie of the year. I truly believe that in ten years this film will be near-universally regarded as one of the greatest action films of all time alongside Die Hard, Aliens, Terminator 2, The Matrix, and Raiders of the Lost Ark.It is an absolute masterpiece. A film so lost in it's world's insanity that the viewer can't help but be pulled into every mad minute of it. The near-constant action is directed and choreographed with a precision and eye for detail usually reserved for art films. It's commitment to practical effects adds reality to every explosion and car crash, every bullet fired and punch thrown until you can almost smell the gasoline, smoke, and blood. And yet there is such beauty in it, it's as if we're looking through the eyes of George Miller to see the beauty to be found in all the chaos and destruction. Awash in bright colors of orange and blue, that play as the gorgeous backdrop to the brilliant and unique designs of a fleet of tricked out muscle cars and war rigs making their eventual destruction into bits of flaming, twisted metal all the more visually stunning.But all the action is backed up by a story with more feeling and humanity than countless more 'serious' films. Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult and a brilliant supporting cast milk every bit of emotion and character to be had from a script as stripped down and efficient as the film's visuals are over the top. The subtlest of facial expressions and effectual use of sparse dialogue manage to convey all the emotion we need to understand what's at stake. It's a story of redemption, of finding life and hope where there is none, of acting for justice and equality.Mad Max: Fury Road won 2015 ladies and gentlemen.

Furiosa: Pregnant Chicks and Bane without lines,"Let me start by saying, I loved Mad Max as a kid. And Gibson was half the appeal of Mad Max. He truly melted into the character and made it his own. I'll start with the good. Truly epic effects; which is what I went in knowing I'd see. The explosions, the cars, the scenery. It oozed with Road Warrior goodness. Truly beautiful and breathtaking. Never an overkill; especially not for this movie. It felt like a roller-coaster ride from hell. I NEVER do IMAX, but wish I did for this film. Sadly, I will not re-watch it.The somewhat bad; Tom Hardy is a very talented actor. In this movie, I just had a hard time seeing it. It being Max. Throughout the movie he is given a handful of dialogue, and most of it is very quietly spoken. Somewhat like the Max from Thunderdome. However, other than the intro, I found Hardy's Max boring and one dimensional. Even his accent was bland and completely unlike Mel Gibson's Max. There was his first line in the beginning of the film where it was super scruffy and hoarse voiced Australian Max. And the rest of it felt like Bane without lines. The location of this story is Australia. The people should probably be somewhat..... Australian sounding. I was quite upset about Hardy because I know what an amazing actor he is, especially when given a great piece of writing. This was not it though.Charlize Theron.... As I said before, this movie was centered around Furiosa and the pregnant girls. She played her character well, and I think that's because Theron always does exactly what directors tell her. And I can respect that. I don't think Charlize Theron is majorly talented, but she does what she's asked of in respect to direction. Which is a commodity in Hollywood. And a blessing for directors.Eve Ensler..... When I heard this, I dropped the movie by a star. Why was this movie partially written by the chick who developed The Vagina Monologues? This is Mad Max for effs sake. Are you kidding me? I feel her input took away from the realistic scenery of a post-apocalyptic world. 130 lb Charlize Theron in a fist fight with 240 lb Tom Hardy... riiiiight. Women all placed in sexually appealing clothing and somewhat exposed.... So the message is, all the men are disgusting, vile evil people. And ALL the women in the movie are sexy, beautiful model types that can do no wrong. Riiiiight.I learned that apparently George Miller is a feminist. And I lost a lot of respect for him. Although I don't believe in feminism; his opinion would not keep me from respecting his craft or watching his films. I lost respect simply because I don't care for political messages forced into any movies that I'm unaware of prior to entering into.And whether or not you want to believe this movie was politically charged, doesn't matter. This movie was NOT about Mad Max. I just pray that the next installment actually includes him in his own movie.And what was with the guitar guy....?? I really could've done without that. I mean, I get it, these people are crazy, and sadistic... But the guitar dude strapped to amps seemed kind of..... lame. Maybe it was a cool scene in IMAX.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max was FANTASTIC,"Honestly Mad Max is something you would never expect. Tom Hardy delivers a fantastic performance as Max and Charlize Theron does a pretty amazing job as well. This movie was honestly in the top 10 best movies i've ever seen. It's different its unique its something you've defiantly never seen before. I encourage you to watch this movie it was great! It's all perfectly, wonderfully, fantastically crazy. Amidst all those ingenious, power-packed road warrior sequences, Fury Road contains a surprising amount of depth and character development. George Miller returns with his greatest ideas in his mind, resulting in raising the bar in all terms for the genre - colorful characters, satisfactory plot, delightful setting, enigmatic character and story backgrounds, multiple references to other movies of the series, and enough of personal and overall human drama. It's only May, but we already have our movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thank You George Miller,"I went into this film with pretty high expectations. I'm a fan of the earlier Mad Max movies and by the time I saw it the initial reviews were in and they were all very positive. I was excited to see it and, simply put, it was incredible!I could not believe how much fun I had with this film. I loved more or less everything about it. I thought Tom Hardy did a great job as Max and that's coming from a big fan of Mel Gibson's portrayal in the first three. I loved Charlize Theron in this movie too. She was an absolute badass but at the same time she brought a refreshing amount of emotion and heart to the chaotic wastelands of 'Mad Max:Fury Road'. It really is just nice to see a strong female character after so far this year just being given Anastasia Steele (Fifty Shades of Grey) and Jupiter Jones (Jupiter Ascending). The actors gave performances that were compelling, but it was the man behind the camera that impressed me the most.Directors that are making an action movie can learn from George Miller as 'Mad Max:Fury Road' is a tutorial for film makers on how to make an action movie correctly! These days action movies suffer because their directors choose to use quick cuts, extreme close ups and worst of all shaky cam when they're creating their action sequences. This causes car chases and fist fights to become confusing and hard follow. George Miller throws this lazy technique out the window, rightly. Fury Road sees Miller create scenes of absolute carnage and mayhem with car crashes and explosions, whilst capturing all this chaos within beautiful wide shots with no shaky cam to be found so all the glorious destruction is clearly visible for the audience's pleasure. And another big plus is that the viewer isn't left feeling detached from the world of the film by poor CGI because Miller uses practical effects, the car crashes seem so real because they are. Furthermore, I was clenching my fists as I watched Max face peril at every turn. Unlike action heroes nowadays that seem to be indestructible, Miller puts our protagonist in danger constantly, he is vulnerable just like the rest of us and I worried for his life at times, it was fantastic! I was full of adrenaline and grinning uncontrollably throughout the entire run time.If you have not seen 'Mad Mad: Fury Road' yet I strongly suggest you fix that as this film deserves all the money that can be thrown at it. You will be left drooling as you witness George Miller's return to the Mad Max franchise that he executes with such grace and expertise. Michael Bay take note! Thank you George Miller.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!!,"I'm not usually into post-apocalyptic world movies, but this movie was brilliant. It had amazing effects and could not have been a better cast. Tom Hardy is my favourite actor and he never seems to disappoint no matter what role he plays. He's portrayal of Max was great and its one of my favourite movies now. (honestly, I only watched it because he was in it) but Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie you can watch over and over again, I have never seen a movie with so much action. Finally a movie that doesn't involve sex or profanity, just pure action. I recommend this movie 100% even if you aren't into this genre, the acting is perfected by every actor in the movie and it just makes it all the more better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A non-stop chase through the desert with over-the-top cars, guitars and scars!","Charlize Theron described this movie as a ""fever dream"" on Jimmy Fallon, and I have to say that's the perfect description for the flick. It's like watching the Fast and the Furious in the stark, post-apocalyptic desert with psychotic minions performing Cirque du Soleil. The movie had very little down time, very little character development, and honestly very little plot, but it absolutely succeeded without all these elements. This just shows the genius of Miller. The effects and stunts were about the best you can see in any movie, old or new. The pulse-pounding action definitely kept me on the edge of my seat with white knuckles. No need to be a Mad Max guru, as this story sits fairly independent of the previous masterpieces.Sure there were some parts of the movie that didn't add up and you could definitely poke holes in if you over-analyze it. It also seemed like some of the characters later on in the movie were just plot fodder. However, you don't have long to think about these things before you see a posse of 2000 horse power monster rigs and hear 2000 decibels of screaming guitar on the horizon and anticipate another chase unfolding complete with explosions, crashes, rolled vehicles and flying sand.I loved it and the movie far exceeded my expectations. A movie has to be near perfect for me to give a 10, but the 9 stars here are certainly deserved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watch it twice,"Way back, when I watched the Matrix for the first time, as did everyone else back then, I didn't know what to think about it. What did I just saw? How to process this? Is it good, better or even bad? Then I watched it again and it's actually that good and it's fresh.Same thing here, watch it once to get into it and then re-watch it to understand it. Fury Road is so fast and stylishly paced that you just don't have the time to soak explosion of details and process all of it at once. Hence repeated viewing.It's the movie Michael Bay wish he was 1/10th able to make one day, but he can't because he is a hack. It's Frank Miller's wet dream of how over the top everything and cranked up to 11 is but doesn't look crass and cheaply macho. Yes, this Miller, George, the Mad Max creator, Babe maestro, somehow pulled it off again and made Mad Max: Fury Road one of the super-blockbusters of the year 2015. And rightfully so.One requirement is needed though. If you never saw older Mad Max movies, do that first. If you hadn't watch them in a long time, refresh your memory first. Not for the story but for the atmosphere that is so rich and unique, everyone's been copying it since the first and second movie. It does take a while to take you back into it emotionally, how everything is damn insane and silly in the Mad Max universe.This movie drives you from start to finish in no time, no stopping, pedal to the metal and it's never boring. The opposite of this is the final fight between Zod and Superman in Man of Steel that lasted 45 mins and you were bored and/or sleeping from the get go. No, Fury Road keeps you engaged all the time.And that's also one thing that actually choked this movie a bit. If you look closely you can see how magnificent and smart everything is and detailed, from cars, to costumes and characters. Movie just zooms through it and almost never lets you fully enjoy it, savor it. It's like Miller is saying to us ""We're not here for you and fan service, you're here for us, now enjoy."". Which I like - no BS and audience pandering, just getting straight to it, but I would also like more of everything... please. But judging from initial response from, well - everyone, we will probably get at least one more movie, named Mad Max: The Wasteland.Performances are mostly solid, those breeder wives could get an acting lesson or two, but overall - solid. Super-kudos to massive amounts of practical effects and makeups. It looks great, gritty, so gritty and dry in fact that it actually made me thirsty while watching.Really nothing more to say, go see the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"For lovers of action-packed, explosive stuff with shallow plot.","Good points: well filmed, good action sequences, well made props and costumes. Basically: the visuals were pretty good, except for the fact that the camera work was actually too soft and sterile for that kind of movie.Bad points: very predictable script, bad dialogues, shallow characters, poor acting, even from seasoned actors like Charlize Theron, who has in the past demonstrated high skill (vide: Monster). The remaining actors (Tom Hardy included) need to attend workshops at the very least. Some of the supporting cast should change jobs altogether.The experience of this movie was overall shallow, based on visuals and clichés. I expect a little more quality from the writer and director of something that cost an estimated $150'000'000 to make.Result: 6.5/10, rounded up to 7, as the rating system doesn't take 1/2 points.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

GEORGE MILLER'S GENRE MASTERPIECE,"After some 30 years writer director George Miller brilliantly brings back to a new generation of moviegoers his iconic character of Mad Max, which was originally played by Mel Gibson in a breakout performance that made him an international superstar. Miller's new supercharged, visually stunning reboot is a punk-influenced dystopian vision with an angry feminist streak, it is also a non-stop relentless orgy of brutal violence, death, blood, automotive mayhem peppered with collisions and explosions, as well as unforgettable, adrenaline-pumping, kinetic action sequences that puts to shame every action blockbuster in recent memory! The plot concerns the revenge seeking desert nomad Max Rockatansky, played impressively by Tom Hardy who skillfully takes over the role from Gibson and proves to be a worthy successor. Max is roped into helping a one-armed, steely-eyed, badass female protagonist named Furiosa, played magnificently by Charlize Theron in a scene-stealing performance. She has escape with five young women from the clutches of Immortan Joe, a fearsome psychotic warlord who wears a teeth-bar mask, he is chillingly played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the sadistic villain ""Toecutter"" in the 1979 cult-classic original Mad Max. Joe with his army of murderous gonzo warriors and tricked-out vehicles race across the desert, he will stop at nothing to recover his female property and is totally hellbent on stopping them. Masterful direction by Miller, exceptional supporting performances by Nicholas Hoult, Josh Helman, Nathan Joe, Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Gunting-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abby Lee, Courtney Eaton, but it's Charlize Theron's feminist freedom fighter that surprisingly steals this awesome film. Dazzling cinematography by John Seale, with extraordinary razor-sharp editing by Jason Ballantine and Margaret Sixel. The film has breathtaking stunt work. A cinematic work of jaw-dropping imagination and artistic craftsmanship, a total masterpiece. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture & Best Director: George Miller.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a Lovely Day Indeed! Mad Max Fury Road is without a doubt the best action movie of 2015,"If an earthquake starts to shake your home what's the first thing to come to your mind? Survival. Should your car break down in the middle of the desert and you have no phone to call for help, what comes as the first instinct? Survival. I may be placing a lot of emphasis on the word survival, but we take for granted how much it takes just to survive. We hear stories of starving children that are teetering on the brink of death, yet they manage to survive for at least another day. What makes us want to survive? Protection.So what is it we're protecting? Whoever it is we want more then anything to see the new day. No matter what people of think themselves, no matter how much of an egotistical jerk they are, there will always be someone that their going to put more importance on then their selves. Maybe their a child that might have a better chance then you had or maybe an older persons who holds an important bit of information that's needed for everyone else's survival. When a major disaster strikes, we drive ourselves to save everyone. When the world has fallen apart like it has in Mad Max: Fury Road, then everyone else matters more then you.Max (played by Tom Hardy) is still drifting around the Austrian Outback dessert in the same post apocalyptic wasteland we've seen in the previous Mad Max movies. He's captured by an army of the infamous leader of a thriving city, Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays- Byrne) where he's being held as a prisoner and a universal blood donor of one of Joe's sick henchmen, Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult). Meanwhile, a famous driver named Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) has been assigned to take a large vehicle to collect gas (which is very hard to find in this world).In the middle of the escorted transportation, Furiosa makes a sharp left into the desert where it's made clear that she's going rouge, taking the rig along with the four wives of Joe with her, escaping their slave-like roles. She manages to loose the rest of Joe's army in a sand storm, all except for Nux who still has Max with him, taking plenty of clean blood from them. Max escapes once they catch up with the Rig and joins Furiosa and the other women to get to safety in a rumored land of green where there is hope for the future of humanity.It has been thirty years since the last Mad Max movie and I wasn't sure what to expect, as I wasn't sure if people were still hungry for the road warrior. Not only does director George Miller prove he still loves this character, but has pulled off one of the greatest action movies off all time. Watching Mad Max: Fury Road is like watching one continuous car chase that runs through out the majority of the movie. You would think that would become boring after a while, but Miller kept it's focus not on the action (though it's great!), but on it's characters.Tom Hardy does well as Max, still making him likable even though he doesn't have much dialogue in the film, but he does not need it. The real stars here are Charlize Theron and the rest of the women. It's not just their characters personalities, but how much they play a part in the story, always helping out and working together to flee away from the mad men. You could say that Mad Max: Fury Road may be one of the most feminist movies ever made (yet the guys still work on an equal level).I'll give this five Mad Max vehicles out of five. Get ready to ride into Hell as we watch interesting characters drive through an interesting world. The characters are great, the story is great, the design is great, the car stunts are great. It is truly a lovely day indeed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action Movie of the 2000s and 2010s,"Every decade has its defining action movie. The 1970s had Mad Max, the 1980s had Terminator and Die Hard, the 1990s had Terminator 2 and Golden Eye, the 2000s and 2010s have Mad Max: Fury Road. I, for one, am not a fan of modern day action movies. They are lazy, CGI clusters that are just made to look good, and they can't even do that right. Modern day directors simply don't understand how to make an action movie. Thankfully, George Miller hasn't forgotten. Miller's Mad Max remembers something that all others seem to have forgotten, the fun aspect. Fury Road is pure fun. It doesn't let story of perfect development get in the way of that. The story remains simple, as it should be. The other major problem with modern day action is the overuse of CGI. Fury Road has an astounding lack of it. The amount of practical effects in this movie is amazing, the movie simply looks great. If it had all been done with CGI, this would have been much more disappointing. I highly recommend Mad Max: Fury Road to all action movie fans out there, as it is the best one in decades.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An insane & action packed roller coaster ride!,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie that revolves around Max Rockatansky(Tom Hardy). In the future, humanity as we know it has ended. In a desert landscape, people are fighting over Earth's basic necessities. A ruthless leader named Immortan Joe(Hugh-Keays Byrne) has total control over the water of the desert. Now, it is up to a rebel named Imperator Furiosa(Charlize Theron) with the help of Max, to put an end to Immortan Joe & his dictatorial rule to bring back peace. Furiosa also wants to return to her childhood home.Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the craziest films I've ever watched & I'm stating this as a compliment. The action & special effects of the movie have been superbly crafted. There is not a single dull moment in the film. The constant car chases & brawls on top of these cars is the highlight of the film. In fact, you can't even call these vehicles, cars! They look monstrous & are fully battle ready & fit perfectly with the tone & theme of the film. Except for maybe 10 minutes of the film, the action is non-stop & the IMAX 3D puts you right in the middle of the action & mayhem on screen. The only flaw in the movie is the lack of character development. I would have really liked it if Max & Furiosa were given more detailed back stories. We should have been given more insight into Max's traumatic past. Better character development would have helped the viewers understand & sympathize more with all characters. Performance wise, this film ticks all the right boxes. Tom Hardy is excellent as Max Rockatansky. Despite being given minimal dialog, Hardy makes the iconic role of Mad Max, his own. Charlize Theron is outstanding as Imperator Furiosa. Theron portrays various emotions as the mysterious Furiosa with panache. Nicholas Hoult is great as Nux. Hugh-Keays Byrne is menacing as the antagonist, Immortan Joe. Josh Helman is good as Slit. Nathan Jones is effective as Rictus Erectus. Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee & Courtney Eaton are brilliant as Toast the Knowing, The Splendid Angharad, Capable, The Dag & Cheedo the Fragile respectively. John Howard is effective as The People Eater. The supporting characters are impressive as well. Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action movies of all time! A unique experience.

Surprisingly Suspenseful and Epic,"A woman (Charlize Theron) rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic Australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshiper, and a drifter named Max (Tom Hardy).Without a doubt, ""Mad Max"" is the surprise success of 2015. While it is not surprising that a big budget reboot of a popular science fiction series would be a commercial success, how could anyone have predicted it would be a critical darling as well? And yet, it has found its way on to numerous top ten lists and picked by many as the movie of the year. ""Mad max"" even has the second most nominations for the Oscars, which is unbelievable.The movie has its shortcomings. The plot is... well, more or less non-existent. There is almost no character development. And even if you know the mythology of Mad Max, it will be more than a little confusing for the first hour trying to figure out what ""war rigs"" are, and why a bunch of pale guys have Max strapped to a car. And why do we have a man with a flame-spouting guitar? What purpose does he serve? So it is not a shock that of its impressive list of nominations, none are for the writing or the acting. How could they be? While there is probably an art to scripting fights, this is really fleshed out on set. And the acting is... well... hard to say. Most of the good moments were probably handled by stunt people.But the categories of costume, makeup, production design, effects and more are all clearly visible. Even the cinematography. This is a dystopian future in a desert, and yet Australia looks more vibrant than ever before. I would not expect the film to take home a cinematography award, but it is obvious why it was nominated. The best bet for a stature is in production design, and maybe in visual effects, but then they would have to fight off ""Star Wars"".What will likely happen is ""Mad Max"" ends up being the biggest loser of the Oscar ceremony. With ten nominations, it has just about the most to lose... it will be lucky to go home with one or two. Because, frankly, the Best Picture nomination is a fluke. This is not the sort of film that typically gets the nomination, and it is far less likely to win when it is supported by mostly technical achievements. It simple does not have the dramatic weight of competitors ""Revenant"" or ""The Martian"".The odds are better for a Best Director win. While this is unlikely, it is not impossible. Alejandro G. Iñárritu and Tom McCarthy are the front-runners, but ""Max"" and director George Miller can edge out ""Room"" and ""Big Short"", right? Seeing a cult director from Australia win would be incredible. Not likely, but possible, and certainly a nice change...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This is How an Action Movie should Feel like!,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a one big, breathtaking, lunatic car chase through a surreal looking Australian desert;it's mad, it's madder, it's f*ckn Mad Max!George Miller surpassed himself 30 years after he had let Mel Gibson fight in the Thunderdome for survival and he reclaimed the very essence of the franchise which is furious Speed, violence, freaky characters as well as rough, handmade action scenes with extraordinary vehicles and amidst all this accelerated ferocity, he still found one or two quiet moments for character development, narrative depth, and beautiful, even poetical imagery.Tom Hardy is an excellent replacement for Mel Gibson who would be too old for the role by now and Charlize Theron gives a worthy female counterpart as ""Furiosa""; she is smart and strong and not the only woman in this movie, who steps up to the men in a harsh, misogynic, post-apocalyptic wasteland.The score, the drums, the electric guitars, it's bombastic!This is how an action movie should feel like!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Without them men are only arid souls in the wilderness. Exactly like Max Rockatansky, who lost the women he used to love: his wife and daughter. For the rest of you guys who love pure action, crazy crashes, amazing FX and unbelievable stunts: don't worry, Mad Max has got all of it too. And it rocks.

The finest action movie this decade,"I'm a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy, although I must admit they're not as good as other action movies from the 80s. The Road Warrior is my personal favorite of the three, with great characters, story and action. And yet, despite how much I like it, it is not even CLOSE to beating out this movie in terms of quality. I'll actually go as far as to call it a milestone for action-movies as a genre. Way too often recently, the action movies feature poorly written heroes, villains and action set pieces, so it was fantastic beyond words to see this masterpiece. The cinematography in this movie is honestly some of the best I've seen all my life. The vastness of the sands and cliffs combined with the blue sky make for some of the most gorgeous shots in any action-movie. The action itself was also mindblowing, with long, wide takes and a fantastic sense of grittiness and realism to every set-piece. The movie also sports great characters with great emotions, backed up by great performances, as well as some top tier worldbuilding. I could honestly talk about how much I love this movie all day, it's so good. It's a miracle in today's world of cheap, boring, badly directed action, and I will continue loving it until the day I die.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Better story, fantastic special effects, completely impossible to suspend disbelief","The reason why Mad Max was great was because it was all new. Low budget film created in an era that just started getting over movie censorship with completely unknown actors by completely unknown film makers and in a different style. It shocked the studios, it brought Mel Gibson almost accidentally in the film business and shot George Miller through the stars. The reason why it all happened in the desert was that it was an Australian film and because it was cheaper. It showed guts, originality and created true art in an otherwise classic revenge scenario.The sequels were different, better budgeted, more post- apocalyptic, more action packed, with more action and, frankly, that is what most people remember about Mad Max, unfortunately.Mad Max Fury Road is better acted, better written and better directed by the same George Miller. The huge budget allowed for all types of wacky things. But it was nothing but a rehashing of the two sequels. It was not a reboot of Mad Max, but a reboot of the mad tribe car chase wacky races.All the well designed characters, all the wonderful scenes filled with tension and nitro, all the epic scenes of people worshiping the guy who gives them water by pouring it on the dry rocks, they all fail when one imagines Dastardly and Muttley in one of those cars chasing ""the war rig"". The various weird vehicles and attack methods were just rehashes of scenes from Mad Max 2 and 3, even the bad guy was a rehash, from the original at least. This might have worked back then in '81 and '85, but it doesn't work now. It all looked so over the top that it was impossible to feel any real thing. It was just like watching cartoons.Bottom line: the movie entertained me and it was better than average, but I have to penalize it for wasting obvious talent in writing and acting on pointless scenes of ludicrous road carnage and on rehashing the silly part of the Mad Max universe. It gave people what they wanted, but not what they needed and turned Mad Max into yet another comic book character.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Literally MAD !!!,"I went for this movie with very low expectations, as off late there have been many apocalyptic movies.The movie starts with Tom Hardy in back drop having very rugged look reciting the prologue.

Cars chasing, trucks exploding, insane shooting, stabbing, gore violence is on your plate which will blow you away.Acting wise both leads do not have much to show case as direction and action take front seat and do most of the talking.

A Mad Max's sequel without Mel Gibson feels,"...like an Alien's sequel without Sigourney Weaver, or like a Rocky's sequel without Sylvester Stallone... It feels like it lacked something, something big. I missed him a lot. The guy is a huge Star and he also directed Braveheart, Apocalypto and starred in the best one of the Mad Max series: Mad Max 2 (1981). On the other hand, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) could easily be the second best of the series. George Miller knows his stuff and delivers great action sequences, very cool ones, indeed. The action and Charlize Theron performance are the very best of the movie. Tom Hardy is a fine and intense actor, but he is not a Star in the level of Mel.

Kemonbet Great Movie,"Great action movie. It really is a strange film. As Max, the craggy but full-lipped Tom Hardy doesn't look anything like Mel Gibson. It is Theron - or possibly Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, playing a sultry breeder called Splendid - who is channelling the eerily beautiful Gibson from 1979, except that probably neither is pretty enough. Fury Road is almost a silent film in it way. Dialogue is at a minimum, and when Max says anything it is usually preceded by an eccentric rumbling, mumbling mmmm sound. He is impassive, to say the least: the nearest Tom Hardy's Mad Max comes to an emotional outburst is when Splendid does something very brave while hanging on to the side of the truck.

But when one of his subordinates attempts to rescue these women, he is led on a gasoline fueled chase across the open desert, while amongst all of this, a traumatised loner named Max gets pulled into the fray.Back in 1983, Australian director George Miller redefined the action genre with his sequel ""The Road Warrior"" to the 1979 Mad Max, a film with so much vehicular chaos and destruction it was praised for its physical stunt work and world building. Now in 2015 we get Miller returning for a reboot/re-envisioning of the same story. But fear not, this is Miller's baby, and it is in good hands. Fury Road is exactly the film it should be. Like 2012's Dredd, it is a one trick pony but the ace up its sleeve is undeniably astounding. Capturing the pre-computer generated age of the 80s and 90s, the film is a visceral and eye-popping spectacle of carnage of the highest caliber, made even more so by the current over-saturation of action films.Tom Hardy takes on the titular role as Max, a man haunted by the death of his family (shown exclusively through jarring, nightmarish flashbacks) beside him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, the warrior woman with a bionic arm who defies a tyrant to free his slave wives. Immortan Joe is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the part of the villain Toecutter in Miller's 1979 Mad Max. All of the acting, asides perhaps the anger-fueled Immortan, is downplayed but not forgotten here. The film shows rather than tells with Hardy barely speaking at all outside of an opening narration, Theron's Furiosa very well steals the show as the character with the most to lose. A worthy note should be given to Nicolas Hoult (X-Men Days of Future Past) who disappears into the role of one of Immortan Joe's pasty pale War Boys. People argue that there's a lack of ""characterisation"" here, when in fact there is plenty to progress the story and make you understand their motives. What this film lacks is unnecessary quips, one-liners and exposition dumps, all which can bog a film down.But the action takes centre stage here, and the budget delivered towards the vehicle, costume and character design and construction. Near everything is practical effects, you cannot watch it and not appreciate how everything looks, my eyes were on stalks just taking everything in.I actually can't think of anything ""wrong"" with it. It is a grisly film, a visceral film with such an astounding visual style that has been long forgotten about.There's a truck in this film covered in massive drums, amps, and on top a blindfolded dude suspended in bungee chords with a double- necked guitar that shoots flames! How how can you NOT like that??",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Film of 2015,"I have a friend. I don't know if he wants me to use his real name so we'll call him Ben. Ben is what I would call a radical film fan. We were in the same high school TV and Video Production class and we both love film, but he's a radical film fan. So when he came to school and told me ""Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action film I've ever had the privilege to watch in theaters."" I replied, ""Chill out dude I'm sure it's good but it's not that good."" He kept on hyping it for me so when I eventually did see it, it was not even close to what I was expecting. It took me three viewings of Mad Max: Fury Road for me to realize it was a great film. I have now come to the conclusion, that although Spotlight was a GREAT movie, Mad Max: Fury Road was the best film of 2015. There has never been a director I've watched in my life that took more risks with the camera than George Miller in this movie. He directs the crap out of this movie. It is one of the best directed films I've ever seen, and my film watching career includes over 500 movies. The acting is first rate and spectacular, however the visuals and absolutely fantastic imagery overtake the great performances across the board which further proves my point that it is a fantastically directed movie. I can't find a single flaw with this film. If it had won best picture I would have been one happy camper. It is a GREAT movie, and I will be upset if it does not make this years AFI top 100. You are doing yourself a major disservice if you do not see this movie, it is beyond what I would call a great film. Mad Max: Fury Road is the Best action film, nay the best movie I've watched in the past 10 years. WATCH IT NOW, BUT KEEP AN OPEN MIND.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aesthetics over substance,"First, to enjoy this movie in any capacity you need to turn on subtitles (the audio mixing is god awful and Max only talks in caveman grunts). Then, to enjoy the movie further, turn the subtitles OFF, because the script is laughably wretched. Who wrote this, a 15 year old boy? Oh, right, George Miller. Unfortunately, 9 years later, and I'm still waiting on a new Mad Max movie. This didn't count. This was a Furiosa/Charlize Theron movie. If anyone can aptly portray a rough female character, it's Charlize. And she nails it. Still, calling it Mad Max and having him experience the occasional terrible-CGI-hallucination doesn't make it a Mad Max movie. He's hardly in it at all, and most of his screen time is spent behind a steel muzzle. Character actions, plot holes, and painfully bad dialogue all chalk this up to a solid 4. What it does have going for it, besides Charlize (and I love Tom Hardy but again, he's a pawn at best), is a cool aesthetic (until your eyes hurt and you develop a searing hatred for the color orange) and the first 30sec of the movie. That's no exaggeration; the first half-minute of the movie wields such intense yet simple cinematography, character immersion, and music (or lack thereof) that gets you pumped. Unfortunately, that mood goes right down the drain seconds later. What a wasted opportunity this stinker was. A shame, but to no surprise, that the vast majority of viewers LOVE this movie and every 10 that is on here probably comes from people who gave Birds of Prey a 10, too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved it,"OK so to start off i didn't really click with this movie, at the beginning i was actually quite bored and it was just a bunch of stuff happening, i was like 'what is going on right' now ha-ha, but once it got into it and by the end i was loving it, it was really good i absolutely loved the characters ....all of them, i loved the look of the main bad guy he looked amazing and i think the character that stole the show even tho he wasn't in it a heck of a lot was that awesome guitar guy attached to the front of that truck, Y ??? i don't know ha-ha but he was pretty cool. the story line was good, and there are a few 'wow i cant believe that actually happened' moments like i cant believe they actually did that but yea over all it was a good full on action packed movie right from start to finish literally",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Remember to breath!,"Definitely something new. Visually impressive, not much cartoon CGI. But freaking exhausting: there was only like a couple of lines of dialogue in the whole movie. Amazingly the plot progresses nevertheless, you get invested in the characters and it works. The pacing is brutal, almost non-stop action/ suspense. Only ""problem"" for me was that it was almost about to go Hollywood, over the top ridiculous all the time. It kinda did too, and it was also legitimately funny at times, but somehow the rest of the package redeemed it and the goofiness made ""sense"".

"If you like fire and wreckage, this is the movie for you.","I think I'll begin with what Mad Max: Fury Road gets wrong, because there's not much. If you're looking for a film that contains thoughtful and provocative themes, you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for character development and plot exposition, you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for motivation in your villain that you can relate to on an emotional or psychological level, you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for a swaggering, charismatic hero who spouts one-liners (not that there's anything inherently wrong with that), you're in the wrong place.But, honestly, who's looking for that in a Mad Max movie?Without a doubt, Mad Max: Fury Road delivers exactly what was promised: incredible, long, pulse-pounding action sequences, frantic cinematography, gorgeous, yet practical visual effects, and steady, stable performances by Hardy and Theron juxtaposed beautifully against the unbridled, over-the-top madness of the horde that relentlessly pursues them.In short, everything you could ever possibly want in a Max film.In terms of the performances, I must admit that I had my reservations in regard to how Theron and Hardy would fare in this film, particularly with Theron, as I had never seen her in a film like this. I have to say that I was pleased with both. Theron's portrayal of Furiosa as a tough, yet sensitive warrior for basic human rights, while a bit of a cliché these days, was more than adequate for this film, and endearing in its own right. As far as Hardy's portrayal as Max, or more specifically the role that was written for him, I felt it was both different and fresh, yet true to form for the iconic role. Max says very little, mostly mumbling throughout the scenes, in fact spending a surprising amount of the film's time literally muzzled. His cold stare across the desert sands is really the main prerequisite for Max, and Hardy does it well. He won't win any Oscars for the performance, but he does the role justice. It's kind of refreshing really, to watch the hero play second fiddle to his female lead, and just kind of stand to the side and let the action speak for itself.What really impressed me the most about the film was the fact that I think it's very clear exactly what kind of movie George Miller wanted to make. It's 85% action sequences, basically being equivalent to a two-hour long car chase, an apocalyptic demolition derby in the desert. And although the action begins to peter off by the third act of the film, or rather seem less profound, perhaps, for a film to go as hard as it does for as long as it does is definitely noteworthy. Our hero speaks mainly in mumbles, and takes a back seat, in my opinion, to Furiosa, and the film uses mostly practical visual effects, which, I'm sad to say, is against the norm in today's film making. A welcome change that I hope echoes into other films. It doesn't really break any new ground, but its operation within the parameters of the kind of movie that we would expect is nearly flawless.Bottom line: George Miller takes risks delivering a movie like this to the cynical film audiences of today, and it pays off big. This film is long on action, visuals, and bone-crunching sound, and short on pretty much anything else. And that's perfectly fine with me. It's been thirty years. Welcome back, Mad Max. We missed you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"IMPRESSIVE, EMOTIONAL AND VISUALLY DAZZLING ACTION MOVIE","Set in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland where petrol and water are scarce commodities, Mad Max Fury Road follows Max Rockatansky, who joins forces with Imperator Furiosa to flee from cult leader Immortan Joe and his army in an armoured tanker truck, leading to a lengthy road battle. The movie has awesome and breathtaking action sequences, a great rythm, outstanding performances, a great direction, sound design and editing, and a perfect and remarkable soundtrack. George Miller delivered an impressive, emotional and visually dazzling action movie.Rating: 8,6.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More than just another action film,"Set in a future desert wasteland a woman is hunted down after smuggling out five wives of a cult leader who have been specially selected for breeding aided by a caged slave who is being used as a blood donor.Without drawing comparisons to Gibson and George Miller's previous three Mad Max outings and the countless cash-in Italian films it spawned what's clear from the get go is that with some great camera work Miller knows how to give a film a contemporary look and feel while retaining a Mad Max vibe.Mad Max Fury Road looks absolutely gorgeous, with sweeping shots of deserts, fitting costumes, great make up, sets and vehicle designs. The sub character are likable and the unlikely alliances formed are interesting. Even though the dialogue is limited there is never a dull moment with some fresh, original, dare I say unique action setups. With people leaping from one car to another using poles reminiscent of giant dune buggy aerials to name just one. It's one long road trip in a strange, post-apocalyptic world from start to finish with branding, skin tattoos, siren like females and a combination flamethrower/guitarist on a bungee to name a few.Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris' basic screenplay has plenty of surprises and it tries to move away from the paint by numbers actioner that have flooded the screens for an age.The acting is solid, Charlize Theron has fantastic presence as the one armed Furiosa, lacking any levity which gives credence to the character who is trying to help a group of women (including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) escape for a better life.Tom Hardy is on fine form as the dream and nightmare vision afflicted Max but is on a equal footing with Theron in terms of screen time as they face danger together throughout against rival nomads and the memorable cult leader Joe played menacingly by Keays-Byrne. Nicholas Hoult Nux leaves an impression and characters develop and refreshingly change alliances. Even the eccentric characters and over the top stunts, gun-play and explosions feel grounded because you buy into the world where gasoline and water are scarce.Its not glossy like the Jurassic World nor Terminator Genesys, Fury Road is dusty, gritty, surreal in places, visually impressive entertainment, perfectly executed and more than just another action movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It's nice to see that George Miller has mellowed in his old age,"Slow, uneventful, boring, and subtle. These are some of the words you'd never hear from any sane person describing Mad Max 4. Before I dig deeper I should probably let you know that I'm a twenty year-old man who only recently watched the original Mad Max trilogy, so I don't have any nostalgia attached to them. The first Mad Max film is genuinely considered mediocre by most people apart from proud Aussies, and my opinion was pretty much the same. It didn't leave a particularly lasting impression.The Road Warrior, however, is generally considered as one of the greatest action movies of all time. I was expecting a full-on action fest (much like Fury Road) but unfortunately what I got was a ponderous seventy minutes involving Max titting about with a colony of people protecting fuel before ending with a spectacular car chase. I was quite disappointed and can name several older action films that are far better than The Road Warrior (Terminator 2 and Hard Boiled to name two). Beyond Thunderdome is generally considered as the worst of the lot but to my pleasant surprise I actually enjoyed this the most out of the trilogy! It might have something to do with me being a massive Tina Turner fan, but I thought there was more action and better characters than the other two films.After being largely underwhelmed by the Mad Max trilogy, I had my expectations for Fury Road lowered. Pretty much every review I've read has been astonishingly glowing with many hailing it as one of the best action films of all time, but didn't they say that about The Road Warrior? Fury Road is directed by the same George Miller, a man now in his seventies who hasn't directed an action film since Beyond Thunderdome and whose recent credits include Happy Feet and Babe: Pig in the City, Mad Max 4 is bound to be pretty weak, right? Wrong.Believe the hype. Mad Max: Fury Road is an incredible feat. I have no idea how George Miller managed to pull out something so utterly spectacular out of his bag. Fury Road is the best action film I've seen since The Raid and has some of the best stunt work since The Dark Knight Rises. In my opinion it leaves the original Mad Max trilogy lying face down in the dust. Fury Road is the great big throbbing war machine whilst the original trilogy is some old rusty bicycle. The first ten minutes of Fury Road is far better than anything from Mad Max 1-3 and the entire two hour film definitely contains far more action than the first three films put together. Fury Road is amazing.It opens with an epic monologue from our new Max, Tom Hardy. Mel Gibson never did anything for me as Max. In fact, the character of Max never did much for me. I much prefer Tom Hardy as Max. His accent may be as muddled as Stu's tan in Mrs. Doubtfire but I think he has much more of a presence than Mel Gibson ever did. His famous interceptor is destroyed within the first five minutes which is obviously symbolic. Just like James Bond getting shot in the opening of Skyfall and a TV exploding in the opening of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, the interceptor getting totalled represents a new era of Mad Max. George Miller has completely cut the ties from the original films and quite rightly so! We get thrown into a huge world and feel fully immersed. The imagery is huge and epic. It feels like something from Lord of the Rings with some powerful masked weirdo sitting on a giant cliff and spilling gallons of water to his loyal pale-painted followers. The villain in Fury Road is basically Aunty Entity on acid and curiously similar to Tom Hardy's very own Bane. He's a brilliantly memorable villain who has his very own breast milk farm and an army of seriously sexy wives.It occurred to me about three quarters of a way through the film that I actually cared about the characters on the screen, which I've never felt before during a Mad Max film (apart from Tina of course). The action still comes first, but there's still some character development to keep you interested in the thin plot. Some have complained that Charlize Theron's Furiosa character takes over from Max but that didn't bother me at all. I love strong female characters and Furiosa is definitely that! I cared about the clan of oddballs and their goal. Enough, anyway, to make me care about who is in the action.Talking of action. Fury Road's action sequences are every bit as amazing as you've heard. It's a total intense onslaught of revving action from start to finish. Within the first thirty minutes, we're plunged into a fiery sandstorm with a furious army of vehicles in hot pursuit. I sat there completely mesmerised by what I was watching. There's a jarring moment shortly afterwards where Max slowly awakes from a pile of sand and the slowness of the scene is so bloody jarring! Ninety minutes of Fury Road is just pure full-throttle action. It's amazingly executed with so little CGI and jaw-dropping stunt work. The final chase sequence is completely exhausting.Fury Road is eye popping. I felt like Toe Cutter before he collides into a lorry in Mad Max 1 for most of it. Let's just hope that the sequel will be like The Raid 2. It could easily get better by putting as much focus on character development and plot as well as the action. The Raid 2 did exactly that and produced one of the best films of the twenty first century. As it stands though, Fury Road is a gigantic, towering achievement. You can almost feel the testosterone sweating off the screen. The Fast and Furious franchise can well and truly sod off.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Mad Max: Fury Road - the good, the bad, the grotesque, and WAY over-hyped","(This is the same email I wrote to my brother in law, a movie buff, for blunt and honest commentary verbatim)I saw Mad Max Fury Road late Thursday night. The reaction varied with some mockery at a few weird scenes.My opinion is it's a good movie for what it is. A few scenes are out of place that make absolutely no sense. There's a weird scene that should have been cut as it isn't relevant to the feel of the movie.Director George Miller, an old dude at 70, typifies with his style going for the weird and the grotesque. It shows up again like in the latter two old Mad Max movies.I almost hesitate to see the movie because of the reports and critic reviews that reported injection of feminism especially with the author of The Vagina Monologue, a staple of college indoctrination tour (my first sister was brainwashed with this grotesque/misandric/empowerment feminist bullshit).I express disappointment in George Miller for the move. Not surprising as he pulled the similar bullshit espousing atheism in Happy Feet. I saw the movie and felt that feminism is minimal so not to be detracting. Almost subtle.The movie was fairly intense and riveting with constant action. Sometimes a little too much and over the top. Deserves an R rating for restrained gory violence and also the rarest R rated movie that does not utter any profanity.I look forward to more Mad Max sequels, if it makes some money. But I judged the audience's reaction with my astute observation and the reception is mixed, almost muted, because of how weird the movie is.I noted the underage boys (under 14) accompanied by their fathers upon exit after the movie.If I were the father, I will make exception provided the child is at least 11 and able to handle the violent content.

High Octane Two Hour Thrill Ride,"To be frank this film is hard to explain by plain words... you need to experience IT. Highly thought out script with action packets filled appropriately to make the audience thrilled with out an instance of boredom. The casting, acting and introduction of each and every standout characters were really good especially Max, Furiosa and Joe.Most of the instances of the film is in the desert with many highly customized cars,trucks and bikes (not so colorful ones), people fighting for their survival, impressing their lord (Joe) by doing all the craziest things possible to gain the basic needs to them like oil (from the Oil Town) and bullets (from the War Town). The scenarios and characters can be compared to many real time complex ones but explained intelligently without pointing to anyone specifically. A set of people try to escape with ""assets"" of Joe and gain freedom and hope they have a better life away from him. The Action Adventure starts when Joe and his slaves (War Boys) try to bring them back, later supported by the people from Oil Town and War Town.Max is used as an slave source of (High Octane)blood for the War Boys and he tries to survive and escape doing all craziest action possible teaming with Furiosa (highly skilled mechanic, driver and the Lady to watch out in the game).3D is used at its maximum in the action sequences especially the 10 seconds of climax (witness me scene) is awesome.I watched it in the front row (didn't get one on the back row) and I felt myself in the desert riding one of those vehicles.This is one of the movie (after Gravity) which I felt is worth a watch even more than once in theaters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Modern Action Masterpice,"In an era of CGI-filled movies it's so refreshing and awesome to see a movie like this that uses so many practical effects. The cars they had to build and the explosions, the costumes, the makeup, it was all amazing. You can tell that this movie was made with love and treated with care. The entire movie is basically one big action scene, but there are character development moments and it's never shown through expository dialogue as this is a movie that is told almost exclusively through actions. The performances are pretty good and the world created by George Miller feels real and it's spectacular.There is only one thing I genuinely dislike about this film and that is that there is a moment near the end of the film that the way it was shot it looks completely CGI and it looks like it was just there to be shown in 3D. Next to the entire practicality and realness of the film, it really seems out of place. This is a very minor detail because I loved everything else about Fury Road. This was one of the best movie experiences of my life! This movie was awesome! The action was super intense, but it wasn't dull, lame car crashes (Need 4 Speed). The world created by George Miller is amazing and it has really cool characters too.

The road to hell ... and massive box office,"Following ""Mad Max"" (1979), ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" (1981), and ""Mad Max Beyond The Thunderdome"" (1985), thirty years later the same writer and director, Australian George Miller (now aged 70), offers us not so much a sequel as a re imaging of the eponymous hero with Britain's Tom Hardy taking over the lead role from Mel Gibson. The result is a triumph.There is a plot - but it is a simple one of escape by and attempted recapture of the five beautiful wives/breeders of the chieftain Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who was in the original movie as a character called Toecutter). There is dialogue - but it is minimal and Max himself is so laconic he does not even announce his name until almost the end. But never mind the story or the words, this is supremely a film with an utterly thrilling vision of non-stop action and excitement.If the 15th century Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch were alive today, this might well be the fantastical nightmare that he would conjure. Shot in the glorious deserts of Namibia, this is a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by wonderfully bizarre-looking characters and incredibly-inventive vehicles with war drums and bass guitar supplementing the roar of the gas-guzzling trucks, cars and bikes.The road they race along is properly named and many characters die and many vehicles explode in a fury of conflict and conflagration with barely a pause for breath - and all achieved with the minimum of CGI. Max is aided by two very different warriors: the one-armed, feminist freedom fighter Imperator Furiosa (a shaved-headed Charlize Theron) and a bare-chested, tumour-ridden Nux (white-mouthed Nicholas Hoult) who exhibit more life than the emotionally-wasted (and mad with loss) Max.Apparently Tom Hardy has signed on for three more ""Mad Max"" films which is fine by me.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Who CHANGED the World? Miller did.,"As fast, exhilarating, over the top and relentless as possible, Mad Max Fury Road is exactly the film that we want and that it needs to be. Visionary George Miller shows us that a two hour chase film can simultaneously be a jaw-dropping work of cinematic art in every visual and technical aspect as well as surprisingly deep and metaphoric story.Thirty years after the end of the iconic trilogy, Miller revisits the iconic dystopian world he created and inevitably defined the late 1970's and 80's, boasting a new cast and making use of the best modern technology in the way of practical effects and filming techniques demoting digital effects to bare minimum. Despite being a Mad Max- character centered franchise, Theron's Furiosa gets equal if not more prominence than Hardy's charismatic Rockatansky in a film that raises feminist issues left and right despite its high octane macho cover. Miller does this with such effortless insight and balance that we never feel any kind of unnecessary or forced agenda being rubbed in your faces.Fury Road might certainly not be a film for everyone but its instant classic and landmark appeal is undeniable. Gorgeously shot, impeccably acted and frenetically edited and scored (Brothers In Arms by Tom Holkenborg is one of the best cues in recent memory) Fury Road is an exemplary piece of filmmaking to remember for all the good reasons.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Film making on Meth or jebus what did I just watch???,Film making on Meth or jebus what did I just watch???Seriously...what did I just watch?An action packed car chase musical?It's as if George Miller had channeled Baz Lurhmann in the throes of a post-apocalyptic Meth bender searching for a come down whilst watching The Blues Brothers.Tweaked...and then some.Seriously insane film. Was there a plot?Probably go see it again as we walked in a little late. Think I must have lost something by missing that first 2 minutes of the film.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Crap Max: Fury on the spectator,"Understand first where I come from. I am a die hard fan of the Terminator saga, and particularly loved T2. I watched all previous Mad Max movies and I did like them. And I have seen pretty much every post-apocalyptic movie and TV show there is, because this is how I roll.So when I come to see Mad Max 4 I know what to expect. I know it's going to be pretty much action everywhere, a bit of background story, and some character development to keep it all somehow together. I do not expect more, but I also don't expect less because that is what the Mad Max franchise has been giving us.Then, before I get to see this movie, I read all sorts of great reviews from everywhere. I do not read spoilers, and I do not watch trailers, but I can feel from all these reviews that this Mad Max movie seems to have something going for it. It even ranked number 1 of 2015 in IMDb, the very site where I do all my movie reviews, so I decided to give it a go.Unfortunately, this is what I've found: A Benny Hill-esque type of movie but without trying to be fun. Also without any character development, background story, or pretty much anything other than action that gets boring after the first five minutes of it.And it's not like the story didn't have a change to fill those gaps: The main characters give us a hint, even sometimes a mysterious indication, of things that happened to them and things that they wanted. What happened to character X's past that are so present in the movie? What sort of accident happened to character Y? Why character Z became the big boss of that one tribe? Unfortunately there seem to be no time to answer any of these questions, or any question for that matter, nor time for any development or attachment whatsoever.Speaking of time, you may argue that there was none for all the questions I had. Well, Mad Max 4 is a good 2 hours, so I tend to disagree with that. The movie could easily do without 20 minutes of meaningless vehicle chase and put that time for the audience to learn the bare minimum about the characters so we did not feel we where the audience of some sort of monster truck show.To make matters worse, the movie don't even have the minimum respect to fundamental physics. And nope, I am not splitting hairs here. I am not going to tell you that a vehicle cannot fly that high or anything like that. I am going to stick to the basis: Humans cannot run as fast as moving vehicles at high speed. Humans cannot run for miles without panting for at least a couple of minutes. Pregnant humans on their nine month of pregnancy cannot run as fast as non-pregnant humans. And of course, if going in a hurry from point A to point B takes X hours, going back in the exact same route with the same hurry should take more or less the same time. But not in the world of Mad Max 4. Here everything goes because, apparently, the audience will love the franchise so much that it will justify every single of the many errors of this movie.The funny thing is that for a while it seemed to work. I went to watch it with someone not familiar with the franchise, and for a while I tried to forgive and explain the movie, as in ""well, maybe the vehicle looked like in a hurry but in reality was making 2 miles an hour"" but at the end my companion and I decided to laugh it off even though the laugh was on us because the investors of these movie were the ones pocketing our cash.So my advice to you is the following: Do not bother. Wait until it goes for free on your TV, or you have a long flight and it's on. Or skip it all together. Watch again one of the old Mad Max movies and be done with it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Max rocks.,"The latest Mad Max is a frenzied, endless race of souped-up, well-armed vehicles across a whole lot of sand. The relentless pace makes for a wildly exciting film for which the plot is superfluous and generally unnecessary. There is much mayhem and madness. It is quite good.This is perhaps the best pure action movie you'll see this year; even The Avengers and Star Wars have a fully developed story to get in the way. This one is a shot of pure adrenaline that never lets up. Here, the titular antihero has been captured by one of those omnipresent roving biker gangs I expect we'll all see in the near future. Max is turned over to a slaver/warlord named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who controls water and food for everyone in his stronghold, called The Citadel, doling it out whenever he sees fit. He also uses women for their breast milk and maintains a concubine of several wives, so you know he's not a good guy.Working for Joe - or, rather, idolizing him to the point where they believe he and only he can lead them into the afterlife world of Valhalla - are the War Boys, pale zealots who pilot terrifying vehicles of mass destruction and gain their strength and energy by usurping blood from generous donors - like Max. The War Boys love Max.Anyhow, every so often ol' Joe has to send out an Imperator for supplies; the Imperator drives a huge rig called a War Rig that's exceedingly well armed and customized to the driver's tastes. The driver in this case is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who has another plan in mind - rescue dear Joe's wives and take them to her own birthplace, the Green Place. Joe quickly gets wind of this and sends out a flurry of War Boys. One of the Boys, named Nux, is weak and in need of blood, so he straps the newly captured Max - a universal donor - to a pole on the front of his machine, and the race is on. Mission for the bad guys - stop Furiosa. Mission for the good guys - get to the Green Place by any means necessary.Really, the entire movie is a chase across a barren wasteland. It is a post-apocalyptic world, after all. There's leaping from car to car to truck! Oh, and the War Boys? They attach these long, bendy poles on the hoods of their vehicles with one of their own at the top. Then they can bend to and fro and either jump on the War Rig or maybe sneak in through the sun roof, steal a wife or two, and bounce back. Sheer genius! There's an enormous, blinding lightning sandstorm that accounts for much of the CGI in the film, but for the most part the effects are anything but computer generated. Loved the visual look of the movie, too, with washed-out landscapes and colorful foregrounds. Director George Miller's vision shows a world that appears dead on the outside but with glimmers of that most valuable of commodities - hope. And all of the little details, such as the vehicles themselves (some hybrids of 1950s cars, including an original Beetle) and Furiosa's guns and prosthetic arm, add the right touch. And how's his for strange - 3D is put to good use here, with junk (and people) flying off of cars and right between your eyeballs! For much of the first third of the movie, Max wears a face guard that sort of looks like an upside down pitchfork. One would assume Hardy is used to such gear at this point, having been through The Dark Knight Rises as Bane. Here, he's even tougher than Bane, even after he's had blood sapped from him like syrup from a maple tree. Max's name, incidentally, is mentioned only three times in the movie. Which is fine, of course - after all, we the audience know damn well who he is, and the lack of a name for his traveling companions lends itself quite nicely to his anonymity. He's like an even more badass Man with No Name. But he does have compassion, mainly because what haunts poor Max's every waking moment is the feeling that he let innocent people die (see previous three films in the series). Will that happen on Fury Road? Not on his watch! (Possibly.) Hardy is the figurative bomb as Max, a towering dynamo of nonstop energy. Theron gets ""ugly"" again (note: she is not ugly, even here) with a shaved head, big muscles, and an attitude that would make Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor weep with respect. She should definitely make more action movies, provided they're more like this and not like Aeon Flux. It's always great to see a strong female protagonist, and here we have several; in addition to Furiosa, Immortan Joe's wives aren't wilting flowers but rather ass kickers who can load and fire guns. Pretty refreshing to see that, you know? This latest Mad Max - and will it be the last? - had me on the edge of my seat, which meant that I had to hold on lest I was blown away. But indeed, I was metaphorically blown away anyway, with a much-welcome return to visceral violent cinema in one of the year's top films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Most Intense, Electric, Absurdly Rewarding Ride I've Taken in Years","A triumphant return to the reckless mayhem and guilt-free indulgence of the early '80s action/adventure bubble. Max puts foot to floor right from the opening bell and never lets up, somehow topping itself over and over again, even when it seems like there's nowhere left to go. It's joyous anarchy, a world that thrives on all of society's dirty secrets; completely post-apocalyptic crazy but also a little more familiar than we'd like to admit. Of course, it's a visual powerhouse - a glowing example of art direction, stunt driving, cinematography and character design that's damn near unrivaled in modern cinema - but it's also an audio behemoth. Like Inception's deep bellow or Terminator's ominous rumble, Fury Road can convey a looming sense of dread through its frequent, effective use of bass. You feel that rumble? The ride's starting back up again. Junkie XL's accompanying soundtrack is a perfect tonal match, the right blend of fuzzy, maxed-out guitar licks and incessant, pounding tribal drums. Perhaps most impressively, the film doesn't feel obligated to dig up every last bit of backstory on its way to the finish line. If anything, it revels in leaving that to the viewer, whose imagination is bound to fill in the blanks for such a broad, wildly eccentric cast of characters far better anyway. It's a raucous success, a lethal dose of sensory overload that hits like a two-hour surge of adrenaline. I loved it, constantly shaking my head at the experience and laughing at myself like a little kid at his first R-rated movie. Loved every minute.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Powerfully Visionary Masterpiece,"Director George Miller sets the screen on fire with this visually stunning masterpiece. In what amounts to post-apocalyptic feminist manifesto as well a cautionary statement regarding the code of masculine violence, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron give nothing less than the performances of a lifetime, both sure to receive Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences acting nominations for what they have achieved here. The special effects, stunts, cinematography, and story combine beautifully to create a film that may simply too powerful for the screen to contain. George Miller is undoubtedly set for an Oscar himself for this overwhelming spectacle as well his astonishing career as the finest director of the last fifty years. No one has ever been as imaginative, creative, and technically proficient with his cameras. A motion picture of such magnitude and magnificence demands acclaim and is receiving it in spades as millions flock to their local cinemas to experience the thrills, beauty, and powerful message that is Mad Max: Fury Road.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action! Action! Action!,"This is my first review of any movie on IMDb. But I can not stop myself writing something about this movie. WOW! What a Movie. WOW! What an Action. Simply Amazing. Best Action Movie I have ever seen. Tom Hardy is one of my favorite and he displayed why. Theron is excellent in every way and lives the character 100%. The plot is very basic and simple and there is no need to watch previous Mad Max movies. 3D action effects are awesome and just doubled the entertainment. No one will ever regret after watching movies like this. I have seen all transformers, marvel movies but I bet this alone movie can beat them in action and effects. The locations and background music were great. You should not miss this movie and most probably you will see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
High octane fun!,"This has got to be one of the best, if not the very best movie of 2015. From the get go Miller takes us on a roller-coaster ride of visual, sound and gore that pays full compliments to the original trilogy, and then some!! Hardy is excellent in the role of Max, if anything he should have been given a more prominent role, with Furiosa taking most of that glory, but I can see why Miller did it, and when the going gets really tough it's Max that comes and takes it to another level, so it really bodes well for the next chapter on the Mad Max series! What really got me in this movie, besides the stellar acting, was the superb stunts and special effects, that finally update the Mad Max story and bring it fully to the 21st century, but without overdoing it with CGI and all the better for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max Fury Road Review,"As I previously said in my Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior review, my expectations were set pretty high for Mad Max: Fury Road due to all of the praise surrounding it, and I would definitely say these expectations were met. This is probably one of the better recent action flicks, and it reminded me of movies like Speed where the action literally could not stop. While in my opinion it wasn't better than The Road Warrior this film was still very fun, and felt like it could proudly stand on its own, away from the trilogy.The film follows Max and Furiosa as they try to steal a tanker from an evil dictator and bring his wives to a fantasy-like green place that Furiosa was born in. Unlike the more attached to civilization environments from the original trilogy, Fury Road replaces them with a barren wasteland of dust. I liked this choice for the movie because it makes the audience feel like there is no hope left at all, a theme the film seemed to be going for. To me this film was much more impressive on a technical level than anything else. While I was worried that the use of CGI would damage the film, I was glad to see that it wasn't over used, and when it was used, it was used very well. The lighting and color scheme was also great as the movie changed from the the bright orange day time to the light teal blue nighttime. While teal and orange is defiantly not an original color palette (look up teal and orange movie posters) I thought it was used very well in this film.To me Mad Max: Fury Road did not feel like a Mad Max film, it felt like a post-apocalyptic action movie that was heavily inspired by the trilogy. They changed the character, the landscape, and the plot structure, and while this wasn't a bad choice, it made me leave the theater thinking I didn't just watch a Mad Max movie.All in all, even though it had its flaws, the movie didn't take itself too seriously and was simply fun. Watch the trailer, and if you think it looks like fun, then you will like the movie. Also if you liked this film, I would definitely recommend The Road Warrior because in my opinion it is much better. Mad Max: Fury Road was a lot of fun, and the best action movie yet this year.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wacky Madnees on Wheels,"Both good and bad.That's how I define this Remake.The film is visually a joy, it can not be denied. His photography, staging, installation, chase sequences are shot with force and showmanship by George Miller, no doubt its commitment to offer adrenalin pace and tone really delusional, crazy and wild.But in counterpoint I have to say that history is guilty of being extremely simple, he says pointless.The film itself is silent. A succession of stunts, explosions amid a deafening noise, but here it's all over, there is no real storytelling, a sense of adventure, emotion is as if they had been too afraid to be sliced ​​head with an original story, some witty dialog and situations that really impact, no, the whole film is a continuous evolution of sterile action, the end usual with the dead and the living and bad heroes end. Not that I seek a philosophical film not a melodrama or anything like that, but at least a story to tell me something, I could get involved with the characters or with which they could identify, but has not been well, everything is pure artifice, circus show for the masses. A film seeking our approval with blows of effect, as if to hypnotize us with their action tirelessly to not see the disturbingly empty content that really treasures.The performances ? Charlize Theron is notable for its makeover but his performance is all horrible, poor lighting, with little charisma and strength. Tom Hardy is a flat actor head to toe, is cold and not transmitting anything, and certainly not reach wing Gibson and soles of shoes.But I can not stop this new Mad Max. Because the truth is that his delusional and crazy visual style of futuristic western, his furious and wild rhythm, well shot action gets my approval, a very entertaining and estimable B series, but nowhere near the I consider, as they are already doing hundreds , a work of art.No way.But I like it, mind you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Post-Apocalypse Movie Ever.,"And I thought The Road Warrior would remain the best of the Mad Max movies. Wrong. Enter FURY ROAD!Just saw Fury Road for the 6th time.....and once again when watching this insanely amazing action film, a full spectrum of adjectives flows freely through my mind. I'd say ""overwhelming"" is probably the most appropriate of them.No plot run-downs here, if you want to know that then watch the freaking movie. I will say that it's plot is an extremely simple one, that even 6 and 7 year-olds should have little difficulty in understanding. That being said, this movie is really not for 6 and 7 year-olds. Oh, and to the Legion of Soccer Moms of America, take little Timmy to a screening of Bambi instead - the nation's tired of frivolous lawsuits.Firstly, the most prominent aspect of this film is, obviously, it's amazing levels of violence (and surprisingly minimal amounts of gore). It's mostly one big ongoing series of the most mind-bending vehicular stunts ever to hit the screen. Director George Miller is a verifiable genius (even after a 30 year hiatus from such films) and his wife, Margaret SixelI, who handled the editing (well over 2,000 cuts, no doubt an extremely involved painstaking process) won an Oscar for her contributions. The level of expertise that's evident in its cinematography, is probably the most impressive of the films technical aspects. This was no easy shoot, filmed almost entirely under a blazing sun in the deserts of Namibia; the sheer amount effort (and stamina) it must have taken to capture all the high-speed, dust-covered, fire-spewing action is well, an effort that's rarely undertaken - AND NEVER ACHIEVED SO BRILLIANTLY! With great technical aplomb, Miller and crew artfully capture the vast desert expanse of a brutal and gritty world and Margaret SixelI's award-winning editing shines with much spit and polish. I saw a preview for this film 10 months in advance of it's May 15th 2015 theatrical release and never had I gotten such buzz from a movie preview - as a whole Fury Road, not only met, but exceeded that grand initial buzz.Fury Road stars Tom Hardy as Max, Charlize Theron as Furiosa, Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, and 6 foot 11 Nathan Jones as Rictus. As some others have said, I also didn't find Hardy to be quite as charismatic in the roll of Max as Gibson was, but ultimately everything gels so perfectly it doesn't really seem to matter. Theron may have actually acted out her role better then Hardy did - in any case they were a great duo. No doubt about it, for Charlize Theron this proved to be the role of a lifetime. Now speaking briefly about the hardware, I happen to love all the auto-motive modifications seen throughout this film and in that respect Fury Road is easily the best of the series. Some of these vehicles qualify as characters in and of themselves - see Oscar win for Best Production Design.As for it's Oscar tally, Fury Road was nominated 10 times and won 6 - and should have won several more. Including Best Picture (which usually goes to lame movies - as it did in 2015) and Best Director. And to all the idiotic trolls and brainless, blabbering jackasses that claim Fury Road is ""over-rated"", not hardly, and if a movies overall gross is anything of a reflection of a movies quality - then Fury Road is in fact, under-rated, as it pulled in only $375 million - well below what Warners anticipated.And so not to pontificate too much - I'll wrap up this review with this: Fury Road is a bombastic hyper-kinetic thrill-ride, that's VERY well worth seeing at least twice and is a treat, a triumph and a treasure for (non-pompous) film aficionado's and adrenaline junkies everywhere. Except for China, where it's banned.Thanks a million to George Miller and Warner Bros.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Visually stunning, action-packed yet lacking","I was lucky enough to catch an advanced screening of this movie. After  watching the trailer, I was really excited to see this movie and it did  live up to my expectations to a certain extent.  Max (Tom Hardy) is a cop on the run in a post-apocalyptic world which  is now a barren wasteland. He is captured by Captain Immortan Joe and  his gang for his blood. There, they seek to turn him into one of their  own by branding him. Immortan is an evil lord in charge of the only  water and oil supply. He uses his reserves as a means of power over  other humans and he has a large gang (War Boys) to keep everyone in  check.  Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is working for Immortan but then decides to  make a run for it with a few other women (fertile women are in a short  supply as well) to a greener land. She makes the escape in a truck  filled with 3000 gallons of guzzling (water or oil) to make a deal with  a small pack of motorcycle riders in the desert.  As she is chased by Immortan's gang, she unwittingly takes Max who then  offers her help to escape the gang. The rest of the movie is then set  of the various chase scenes and the attempts of Furiosa, Max and the  girls to escape to the green land.  The cinematography and the visual imagery is certainly stunning, worth  experiencing on an IMAX screen. The chase scenes and the landscape  (especially a few scenes in moonlight) were absolutely amazing. The  various concoctions of war vehicles is amazing as well. There were a  few elements of humor as well paired with some really weird things  (women's milk supply, the various outfits and characters including a  guy playing a fire breathing electric guitar throughout the chase  scenes). The music definitely adds to the atmosphere as well, not to  mention the various stunts. The action really gets crazy towards the  end.  On the other hand, there were some things I found lacking. Character  development is certainly missing and there's definitely nothing  significant there to make a connection with the various characters. The  dialogue is ordinary and cliché. The ending is predictable and certain  things don't make sense (like how a gang with tons of ammo and better  equipped vehicles) is unable to stop Furiosa and Max.  One thing is certain, it was different and entertaining, hence a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An Action Masterpiece,"THE GOOD:Out of all the 263 titles that I have rated on my IMDb page, only 8 of them have earned themselves a 10/10 rating from me. Those movies are (in no particular order): The Matrix, Back to the Future, Star Wars: A New Hope, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (My #1), The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, Cloud Atlas, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. ""But Jovan ol' jolly ol' chum, why do you say this?"" Because, my beautiful amigos, I have a 9th to add to that list. I really didn't think that this film would reach such a status. You guessed it, folks.Mad Max: Fury Road is a masterpiece of cinema.I honestly cannot believe it myself. I am still speechless when I talk about it. I don't know what to say first, I can't even begin to describe what I even watched. Now that I can actually write my review and elaborate on what needed to be elaborated on, I can finally put my thoughts to words. Not only is this probably movie of the year (Star Wars is a top contender) but it could be movie of the decade! The action was mindblowingly awesome! And the best part about it is that most of the stunts were practical! As a film guy, I always appreciate anything done in practical form (also awards bonus points) but for what I saw, it was almost hard to believe that the stunts that were practical, WERE PRACTICAL. Of course there was CGI when it really called for it, but if things could be done practically, they were done so. George Miller is around 70 years old and he puts the WHOLE ENTIRE Fast & Furious films to shame with these stunts! Everything was also shot excellently, and I must add that Fury Road continues to prove that there is no need for shaky cam WHATSOEVER to create a MEGA-AWESOME, PULSE-POUNDING action scene (unlike Bayformers). Of course when the action stops, there needs to be dialogue and character development to further the plot, and the characters were terrific! Not a single hollow character was seen in this film, every character, main and supporting, protagonist and antagonist, had at least one bad-ass moment. Nobody was neglected for a SECOND. I also must start talking about the new spotlight character, Furiosa played by Charlize Theron. She stole a lot of scenes from Max but I had no complaints whatsoever because she was one of the coolest heroines in a film to date (Ripley from Alien is still #1).This films visuals are some of the coolest, most bad-ass, most grotesque in any film to date. Character designs were excellent, top notch, and definitely Mad Max worthy! And the car designs, OH MY GOODNESS THE CAR DESIGNS, are the coolest to date. Nothing beats these cars, not even a fully pimped out, fully-upgraded-anything car in any video game can beat the designs in Fury Road (Unless the Mad Max game coming later this year can rival them). I mean, there's a literal stage on wheels fully rigged out with speakers with one guy on a custom electric guitar that can shoot flames out of its neck! HOW MUCH MORE METAL CAN YOU GET?! The soundtrack I almost forgot to mention but now that I've been reminded I cannot get it out of my head. The soundtrack is also fantastic! It's composed by Junkie XL and he did a fantastic job capturing the pulse-pounding action of Fury Road.The pacing was great, sound design was excellent, trailers were some of the best in a long time and I LOVE THIS GODDAMN MOVIE.At this point I'm just gonna start rambling. So onto...THE BAD:No film is perfect as many of you may know and there probably never will be a perfect movie with ZERO faults. My main concern is Tom Hardy's portrayal of the Mad Max character. I don't know if he was trying to pull off an Aussie accent, but at some parts I could feel a Bane-ey tone coming from him, thankfully, this wasn't consistent. I'm actually happy with Tom's Mad Max, but he could've done better, A LOT better. Mel Gibson still stands as the OG and best Mad Max there will ever be. Speaking of Aussie accents, I am happy to at least hear more than 10 characters speak in the 'straya tongue, but the mains like Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult should've at least try to go for an Aussie accent. I really hope that this can be addressed because we're in the Aussie outback for Christ's sake.THE CONCLUSION:Mad Mad: Fury Road is now marked as the best sequel and return to form of any franchise ever and it more than deserves this 10/10 that it gets. I saw this film in IMAX and I cannot recommend enough that you go see it there too. The movie was MADE for 3D.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

From frame one, Miller paints the cinema screen with a gleefully vibrant vision of chaos and elemental fury. Every performance, every shot, every ingenious switch-up of narrative; It all comes back to George Miller and his prophetic revitalization of cinema. stupendous clarity and craft on display, mainly because Fury Road showcases a sense of confidence that hasn't been seen in cinema in a very long time.This isn't your ordinary post-apocalypse film in terms of the look, and that essential difference comes down to one word: color.

Cinematic Masterpiece,"George Miller has bested himself and risen into a status of film maker legend such as Stanley Kubrick and uh...Stanley Kubrick.. for his attention to detail and love of his art. Some movies are for profit but you get a strong sense that everyone who worked on this was aware they where participating in creating something great and Millers dedication seems to have spread like a plague. The post production was unrivaled and a thing of true beauty. The utilization of frame rates that was experimented with in the previous MM films was honed to perfection and turned into a special effect of emotions all to it's own. Due to the heightened frame rates and extensive frames more movie was packed into a smaller time frame.The manipulation of frame rate was able to subliminally transcend the protagonist plot armor barrier. If I could criticize this movie, it's in not easing up on the viewer throughout the entire film with this subliminal trick. This factor alone makes it worthy of it's R rating and fury title.

Mad Max Fury Road Is A Action Masterpiece,"Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best action films I've seen in a long, long time. George Miller is back with Mad Max after Beyond The Thunder Dome which was 30 years ago. Directors who usually return to a franchise who started it don't end up really good. Some examples are George Lucas for Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Or Steven Spielberg for Indiana Jones 4. But George Miller proves that he can bring a franchise back to life. This is probably one of the best action films of the summer so far. Tom Hardy as Max did a fine job but Charlize Theron as Furiosa is amazing. Her character kicked some major ass. The story was also great and it was very simple. It's just getting from point A to point B. The action was amazing and there wasn't any of that shaky cam. George Miller's direction is amazing because he uses some wide shots which looks amazing. The movie is also very intense I also felt hot while I was watching this movie because it takes place in a desert like area. I really loved how much of the action was done practical because today action films do CGI for tough shots but in this film it was all done with practical effects which made it feel real. This film isn't for everyone. The film is very weird and crazy which most people can't take. If your a Mad Max fan you'll enjoy the hell out of this film. Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best films this summer and one of my favorite films this year. I really hope we get to see more Mad Max films in the next couple years because this film deserves all the money it needs and sequels it needs. I would say that Mad Max Fury Road is considered a action masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Delivers on what the trailers promised,"So trailers promise a non-stop car chase through the desert and this is what the movie delivers.Max is back and he is less mad and more insane. Haunted by the ghosts of lost loved ones he has only one motivation in life, to survive.He finds himself captures by one group of baddies in this movie, he escapes and joins Furiosa and some innocent girls in a quest for freedom and the green land.While the movie merges together the desire for many different fluids (guzzline, water, blood and mothers milk), makes commentary on the socio-political landscape of the world that we live in and has lots of awesome actions sequences, in the end it fails to deliver.The characters do transform and overcome, the tables are turned and the good guys beat the bad guys, but it is not done with any great dramatic flair. Or to put it another way, it started with great dramatic flair and had nowhere to go. So while it ends on dramatic flair, it doesn't build to it.Also while it is a 2 hour long car chase it is still a nuanced movie. It was fun to discuss some of those nuances after watching this movie, but could have benefited by being more explicit about it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max Action Extravaganza,"Mad Max Fury Road is a fantastic Film. The action scenes is crazy and the characters are bad-ass! This movie is enjoyable to watch and it is definitely an action blockbuster! The Premise is simple but the execution of the movie is fantastic.George Miller did a great Job directing the movie,The action is pretty sweet and I can still remember.The movie had some ridiculous moments but it didn't bother me. This a movie worth watching again wit great action and great characters joining together to make it my favorite movie of 2015!This is a 2 hours action sequence that may be good for the average movie goers but if you don't like explosions and post -apocalyptic movie this isn't for you. Anyway this movie is awesome and I recommend you to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If you like action, this movie is for you","This movie was really big on action and had a lot of explosions and violence. I read that all of the stuff in this movie was actually stunts and very minimal CG. I just hate it when a movie hides behind CG. Now onto the movie. There are a lot of things I wonder about. Like the warboys and what their deal was. It seemed like the really loved Joe. How did Joe get his first name? What does immortan mean? I am so curious also as to the back story of Joe. I'd like to see the next movie maybe be a prequel and talk bout what Joe's back story was and what he used to be like. Could be really be Goose? I am not sure. But his horse tooth mask was really neat. As for Max, well let's just say he didn't talk too much. I like his way of speaking though. Kind of reminded me of Bane from Batman actually. haha. The rest of the movie was good. I noticed that they never really stopped almost ever. Even to fix the vehicle they would just keep driving. This was really neat. Did you notice that there was a big difference in color between night and day shooting? This was a nod to the old school which I really appreciated. So, if you like your movies packed with action, you will like this movie. There are also some new techniques of fighting introduced into the fold in Mad Max. I am talking about the pole vault fighters. That was neat. So was the scene were the motorcycles were jumping and throwing bombs. So much action. I give this movie to gas tanks of guzzling up!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jabberwockingly impossible to review!,"*Situation Alert:I watched it in 3D on am IMAX screen*The first scene ripped my eyeballs off from their sockets and plastered them to the screen, and there they stayed, resolutely, unwaveringly.Meanwhile, somewhere else in the upper cranial regions, my mind was being pounded into synaesthetic pulp at what was a surreal, visceral, sensory orgasm of a movie.I have never watched a single Mad Max movie. I have never seen a single trailer or a promo photo of this movie. I just went in, and at the end of the movie, I stayed back to collect the atomised remains of my mind before I could walk out.Had I walked out earlier, I would have been a gawping, drooling retard trying to find the meaning of what movie making is, only to return once more to the screening.If a picture speaks a thousand words, an movie speaks a million; MadMax with its barely-a-legal-sheet-full dialogue mashes the dictionary into pulp and writes a whole new one.If there is one movie you could watch this entire year, this should probably be it.To the makers of the movie, I take my hat off. What a ride it was. What a lovely day!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
F##king action movie masterpiece!!,"Of course I had heard a lot of good about Mad Max: Fury Road. Hell, it won six Oscars! But of course it's different to actually see it for yourself than just to rely on the opinions of others.It's clear that this movie is different from the typical action movies that we get nowadays from every f##king movie studio that exists. There's something unique in the story and of course visually this movie beats any other action movie out there.While the story is a bit dark and it has very serious themes in it, there's a somewhat loose feeling to it. The movie can be taken seriously, but there's a somewhat relaxed feeling to the things they've come up with. The filmmakers are pros and they know what they are doing, so if they want to add a flamethrower electric guitar in there, they can and they should - and it will be f##king awesome.That flamethrower electric guitar reminds me, since I haven't seen the original movies I can't help but feel that I'm missing something. Why is there a guitar and war drums on a car? Is that... normal? Is that a regular thing or is Immortan Joe just a drama queen who needs his own theme music? It's cultural stuff like that that I don't know, but in the end that didn't seem to matter that much. But at least it feels like there's a world outside this movie, that the post-apocalyptic Australian wasteland has a culture, instead of just those three or four tribes we get to see.Mad Max: Fury Road may be a bit long, and definitely feels longer than it is, but it's worth it. The audience wants desperately to see what happen, they desperately want a happy ending, all that. I was on the edge of my seat, even though during the start of the movie I was indifferent towards it.Visually... I've never seen an action movie that looks like this. The editing is amazing, so are the effects, which might have something to do with the fact that they used CGI very little. But the cinematography... It's astonishingly beautiful. Every shot seems to be careful, and the colours are mind-blowing. Also the costume department has done such an amazing job, and all the vehicles look amazing... Everything in this movie just stands out from the typical post-apocalyptic action movie, and it's amazing.Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing post-apocalyptic action movie, that definitely stands out from all the s##t that's out there. It's different, original, and just so damn thrilling and beautiful. It's a f##king action movie masterpiece! What are the originals like? If they are anything like this, I have to see them!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really good but...,"Technically this movie was incredible, and my opinion of it increased when I read that about 90% of the stunts were real, not CG. The acting was superb (I'm not a fan of Charlize Theron but she was exceptional here) and it was great to see women kick some ass. In spite of that, this movie made me so uncomfortable - especially that highly intense opening scene - that while I can say I definitely appreciated the movie, I did not enjoy it. The setting and behaviour of some of the characters is really gruesome, and there's no preparation at all - you're just thrown in head first.Still worthwhile to watch, but be prepared for some horrific scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Insane and exhilarating, but doesn't quite live up to the hype","Mad Max: Fury Road is an insane movie boasting amazing stunts, great action, artistic cinematography, epic music, and much more. It had many good aspects to it but in the end it didn't quite live up to the hype.The latest installment in the Mad Max franchise is essentially all about the action. The action is insane for sure and immensely thrilling to watch. George Miller has such a unique style when it comes to action and it definitely shows in his latest piece of work. The stunts are crazy and very believable as most of the stunts were done practically without the use of CGI.The cinematography on this movie is splendid in it's own way. The colors are very saturated which oddly gives the movie a more gritty look. The camera work also fits nicely with the action.The soundtrack for this movie is thrillingly epic and may be one of the best soundtrack out there. Each piece is electrifying and fits in perfectly with the movie.Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are amazing as the two lead roles in this movie. They bring a sense of desperation to the movie and their characters. The supporting cast is also great in their specific parts.The story/plot is not so important in this movie but it is still there and there are some important plot points one does not want to miss. There were some messy moments on the story but all in all, it felt complete. The pacing was very fast and there was next to no quiet time, but it still felt like the movie was evened out quite nicely. My only gripe is that the characters weren't fully developed.In the end, Mad Max: Fury Road is an exhilarating ride with great action, music, cast, and cinematography. It was gritty and dark but extremely entertaining and thrilling. I had very high expectations for this movie and it didn't quite live up to the hype, but I still think that it's one of the best movies of 2015 so far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max makes a spectacular return onto our screens with a big bang.,"Following the underwhelming and disappointing Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985), Mad Max makes a spectacular comeback with a big bang 30 years later. This time Tom Hardy takes over the role from Mel Gibson as Mad Max. Director George Miller returns in the director's chair having directed the previous Mad Max movies. Mad Max Fury Road was a exciting action packed bonanza from beginning to end.Set in an unspecified period in the future, the world has turned into a desert wasteland and all civilisation and humanity has collapsed. One of the survivors, Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) continues to roam around post-apocalyptic Australia. Max is later captured by a group of scavengers called the War Boys, imprisoned and kept as a live blood bag to keep the scavengers alive. Immortan Joe, (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toecutter from the original Mad Max) is the leader of the War Boys and also the ruler of the community of survivors struggling to keep alive. At the same time, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has been sent out in a huge War Rig to collect gasoline from Gas Town but unbeknownst to Immortan Joe, Furiosa is smuggling out his five wives that he has impregnated. Immortan Joe unleashes an all out pursuit to take back his five wives and to take down Furiosa. Amongst the pursuers is Nux (Nicholas Hoult), Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), and The People Eater (John Howard). After Max manages to break free, he assists Furiosa and the five wives which include The Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Toast The Knowing (Zoe Kravitz), Capable (Riley Keough), Cheedo The Fragile (Courtney Eaton), and The Dag (Abbey Lee) in order to make it safely from Immortan Joe's clutches.I found myself a bit cynical when Mel Gibson was not going to return as Mad Max. Unfortunately, far too much time has lapsed and Mel Gibson is too old for the role not to mention all the controversy that has plagued Mel Gibson's reputation. Tom Hardy did an excellent as Max Rockatansky. Charlize Theron was also suburb as the one armed female warrior Imperator Furiosa. I honestly could not recognise Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, having always thought of him as the infamous Toecutter from the original Mad Max.The entire movie can be described as a spectacular, non stop, fired up car chase from beginning to end. I enjoyed that a lot. Now that's what an action movie should be like! While Mad Max: Fury Road may not be a classic compared to Mad Max (1979) and Mad Max 2 (1981), it certainly erased all the underwhelming disappointment of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985). A sequel to a violent franchise should not be a watered down children friendly movie. Mad Max Fury Road was certainly a spectacular comeback in the series. George Miller should be commended on resurrecting the Mad Max series.Here's hoping there will be further sequels and Tom Hardy will return as Mad Max.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Miller's dream realised at last,"Stunning non stop action tour de force from Miller. Seat of the pants, superbly choreographed stunts, without the obvious fakery of CGI, leading presumably to many injuries from the consummate cast.Hardy is outstanding as the jittery, haunted Max. A man of few of words, many regrets, and plagued by visions of a violent and heartbroken past. Theron's moody portrayal of the rebel Furiosa, whom Max reluctantly assists with escape is equally excellent, reminiscent of a young Ellen Ripley.Visually, Fury Road - with the help of 2000AD's renowned Brendan McCarthy - has refined Miller's post apocalyptic dream to perfection. It is glorious to behold, and sets, makeup and costumes are incredible.Like previous outings for Max Rockatansky, little is discussed about the why and the how, and much is implied through snippets combined with meaningful gazes between the main leads. This adds to the mythology of the franchise, the modern day western, the man with no name.Less is more is done very well yet again by Miller, and this insane romp of a car chase, exploding across a parched land consisting of the broken, diseased and insane remnants of humanity, is presumably what he envisioned in 1979. Then he had the talent in Gibson, but not the money, but still managed to produce a reasonable facsimile of his minds eye.In Fury Road the vision is finally realised, and hopefully in further installments we may discover ""Who killed the World?"" in an attempt to untangle the past, and give hope to Max's future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Now That's Some Action!,"The fourth film of George Miller's Mad Max franchise, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' takes the action genre to an all new level! This is a summer blockbuster that's been made with passion & true effort!'Mad Max: Fury Road' Synopsis: In a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, two rebels just might be able to restore order: Max, a man of action and of few words, and Furiosa, a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland.Despite its stunning spectacle & astounding stunts, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' rests on a very thin plot. Its not an innovative story & even the sequences, minus action, though barely any, aren't engaging. In terms of Screenplay, which has been Written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy & Nico Lathouris, isn't foolproof. It completely relies on action to deliver & luckily that department, is super-strong!Miller deserves an ovation for his sheer imagination & for the execution of the film. He has envisioned an all new Mad Max Legend ingeniously. Visually, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is simply spectacular. I was engrossed & mesmerized by the action-sequences, which undoubtedly, are incredible. The fight between the Good & the Bad, is superbly done. I have never seen a film as action-packed as 'Mad Max: Fury Road'.John Seale's Cinematography deserves a special mention. Each & Every Frame has been captured with utter brilliance. Margaret Sixel's Editing is sharp, although the first-hour, is slightly slow. Junkie XL's Score adds more madness to the narrative.Though I thought I would never accept anyone but Mel Gibson as Mad Max, Tom Hardy dons the part, most engagingly. Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, is in true bad-ass mode. She kicks ass & how! Nicholas Hoult as Nux, is outstanding. His best work to date. Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, is terrifying & mean as hell! Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as The Splendid Angharad & Zoë Kravitz as Toast the Knowing, leave a mark.On the whole, despite its thin plot, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' offers visual dazzle, like you've never seen before. Definitely, worth your time & money!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
★★★★,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a genre film of the highest order, one that torpedoes through its genre conventions in an eruption of smoke and rust and would sooner perish than take a moment to dust off its shoulders. It is a film drenched in gasoline and liquid anarchy, splurting flames out of its umpteen exhaust pipes and rumbling so deeply the back of your skull starts itching. Director George Miller, who also directed the past three Mad Max films, released his last entry ""Thunderdome"" three decades ago, and this one seems to have bathed (or scorched) in the vivid gleam of his wildest fantasies for every minute of them.While Thunderdome has since garnered a reputation for being the worst entry in the series – my thoughts being the exact inverse – Fury Road brings a previously unknown dimension in modern technique to its proceedings that adds to the effect in ways that would never have been possible back in the franchise's time. Miller's latest is an unceasing succession of sensational action sequences– a visceral circus act that isn't content with simply juggling chainsaws; they must be ablaze, while it walks a tightrope that is also ablaze.Max Rockatansky, who we've come to know as Mel Gibson's post- apocalypse persona, is recast as Tom Hardy, whose formidable presence has not been lost upon the chaos and the Madness of the world around him. He is a man haunted by his past trespasses and hunted by whoever is within proximity. This world, brought to a wastelandic extreme we've yet to see from this series, is ruled in part by a tyrannical dictator by the name of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a creature whose mask can only remind viewers of Hardy's previous role as Bane in ""DKR"". His cult is in possession of a spectacular array of vehicles that make for chase scenes that set out to overwhelm and succeed.Joe and his army are in pursuit of Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a female warrior of Joe's who sets out to escape his wrath with his Five Wives in tow. Here is where the film's feminist undercurrent is rooted, in the developments of these women who have none but themselves to look towards in the midst of mayhem. In the previous films, the mere presence of a woman on-screen has been sufficient cause for unease, the promise of death or worse perpetually shimmering on the horizon, drawing ever near with each passing moment. That raw fear has since driven these women to adopt a fierce will to survive while shielding their perceived delicacy from the cruel outside. They are powerful but nonetheless fragile, beautiful but capable; an oasis of purity in what is very much a man's world.Among those pursuing them is a War Boy named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a blindly devoted member of Joe's army who is also Max's captor. He employs him as a ""blood bag"" and a living masthead of sorts for his vehicle. Nux serves his master with a raging loyalty and a belief that his efforts will secure him a place in Valhalla alongside the best of them. They follow the pack into battle, and from this point forward, the film sets a cinderblock upon the gas pedal and hunches over the steering wheel, crazed and with black rings around its eyes. The entire film is in essence one long chase, ebbing and flowing, constantly involving, and always aware of its surroundings. The chase scenes in Fury Road aren't simply a means to a cheap thrill; they explore all that is possible within the boundaries of their convention. They have spatial awareness, making full use of the depth of space around the vehicles. An explosion isn't something that just happens for the sake of an explosion; you see where it is in relation to everything else, how it affects the surroundings, whether it changes the state of play. The cars don't simply inhabit the desert environment; they are integrated into it, which means the stunts are allowed to be as fluid and elegant as those you would expect to see in a Jackie Chan movie.It's gratifying to watch Miller's supercharged imagination run wild across the screen. The characters are all either desperate for purpose or starved of reason. With bodies painted white and faces in various stages of embellishment or disfigurement. They howl, they pant – you'd swear they guzzle octane like OJ. The vehicles are all tattered assemblies of the remnants of our society, tricked out in various ways that suggest a Transformer's rendition of ""Frankenstein"". The set pieces are monuments of modern filmmaking. The initial chase involves a storm, which is all I'm willing to divulge, as I can neither bear spoiling the scene any further nor ever come close to doing it justice. And then the movie tops it with each new sequence. The canvas is saturated with colors that would be too rich for a desert wasteland but for the vision of its artisan.Max, one who for the most part faces his inner demons in anguished silence, seems to take the passenger-seat to Furiosa, who is a force to be reckoned with, as beautiful as she is unrelenting. Her black- sheen brow, shaved head, and mechanical arm all tell stories about her before she utters a word. Applause is also due towards the wives, who escape from the citadel in search of a better world that may not be and never have been. They ground the events in a sense of urgency, a realism brought about by the conviction in fighting for a cause which keeps the film from mushrooming into a 2-hour blowout of unchecked excess and insanity. Well... completely.I just about enjoyed every minute of Fury Road; in a phrase, it was exhilarating. In another, it is one of the year's best films. This isn't a reboot of a classic franchise, or even a proper sequel; it's an evolution.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
His name is Max and his movie is brilliant.,"Oh what a day! What a LOVELY day!Director George Millar returns over 30 years later to add a new story to his original Mad Max trilogy. But this sequel, fitting right in with all the previous entries, pushes the already full throttle franchise to near-biblical proportions. Mad Max: Fury Road is an epic race of humanity versus the utterly insane, and it is stunningly beautiful, a visual feast indeed. Every aspect of it is over the top fun. From its color palette to its extreme costume and mechanical styling, this is definitely a modern day opera.The landscape is empty and bleak, like a blank orange canvas being splattered with white zombie torsos and spiked hedgehog cars. I've never actually wanted to be inside of a dust storm until now. I have never wanted dirt in my mouth as much as I did watching this movie. To be in the thick of all the parched craziness, it's a testament to the visual designers of this film that such extremely hot and dry conditions look gorgeously appealing.As the dust kicks up and the action starts, Fury Road will not let you forget that this franchise is best known for its car chase scenes. If you're a car person, this movie will absolutely make you lose your mind. But if you're not a car person, well... This movie will still make you lose your mind. The high octane, high speed action here is unreal. It's all just absurd, in the best possible way. These scenes are so engrossing that they sweep you right into them, and just when you think it couldn't possibly push any further, it does. This is like watching Gods fight, which is fitting as the film has an overall mythological feel to it. By the time the very first car chase scene ends, you've already been taken on several loops and thrown to the ground, left to ask yourself ""What did I just watch?!"" And that's just the first one, all while fully establishing our main characters.The cast is absolutely on point. Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky is a great succession to Mel Gibson: quiet and strong but still growing madder and madder after all these years on his never ending Odyssey. Nicholas Hoult is quite inspired as Nux. He's feral and tasty, both sour and sweet. The true strength of the film's characters, though, comes in a different form.The women of Fury Road are more than just pretty faces. In fact, they are extremely important to the survival of anyone in this film. They are mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. They plant the seeds of life. They offer the milk of growth and strength. They release the waters to replenish. They are goddesses. The core group of women here, whose perfect supermodel bodies are covered in only wispy pure white cloth, are furies not to be reckoned with. They are sirens and they are oracles and they will certainly be the end of you.Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa is the leader these women need. She's ruthless and does want needs to be done to get the job done. At the same time, she's haunted and not without heart. She's the female equivalent of Max himself, only better. Even Max realizes he wouldn't make it without her and it is a wonder to watch these two work together.They are aided by Junkie XL's down right dirty score. It sounds grimy and savage in itself, with a harsh drum line and textured electronics. If you could get the musical equivalent of rust brushing against itself in an epic thematic score, this is pretty much it.It doesn't get much better than this, as far as action flicks go. This is George Miller's masterpiece. With all the high profile movies coming out in the remainder of this year, I'm already calling Mad Max: Fury Road my movie of the year. I would be thoroughly surprised to see any other sequel or remake coming have this much style, originality and symbolism ingrained into such strong characters.His name is Max and his movie is brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"It's wildly action-packed, oozes with pure adrenaline and it doesn't run out of surprises, really.","Mad Max: Fury Road is no doubt one of the best films this year. It stands out among the rest because of its complex and twisted world building, strong and compelling heroines, stunning visual effects and action scenes and most especially, it's unique and moving story. This film literally has the most dangerous and explosive car chase I've ever seen in any film, and I saw the whole Fast & Furious film franchise. George Miller is indeed a genius, to create such a twistedly beautiful story of survival and to actually sell it is not easy. I am very impressed with the world building, the details, the whole atmosphere and feel of it got stuck on me. I imagined I would not last in that dry and disease infested world where everyone has to fight for food and water. Max (Tom Hardy) and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) are two compelling characters that clearly have different agendas, caught in a brutal world they are forced to be on, but because of a common enemy, undecidedly became the strongest of allies. Watching these two heroines exchange guns and the steering wheel is nothing but exciting and thrilling. Everything about Mad Max: Fury Road is mind-blowing, an edge-of-your-seat experience that doesn't flood you with too much script. This film is all about the goods.

The fresh breath I've been waiting for,"I needed this movie. It is so fresh, the action scenes are unique and the characters are batshit-insane and distinctive, this is the movie I've been waiting for. It is visually stunning, the desert surroundings and the rusty vehicles and weapons really set the post-apocalypse atmosphere the old trilogy had, but in a fresher and more modern way. It is not the most impressive when it comes to story, but hell, it doesn't really matter, it is fun, it is insane, it is freaking MAD. The villains are twice what the original villains were, and the same goes for the chase and action scenes. The one thing I would want to complain about is, it simply doesn't have enough Max. I really hope this isn't the last we've seen of George Miller and Tom Hardy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Visually incredible, great action, interesting soundtrack","This is one of the most visually amazing movies I've ever seen. It makes most movies appear dull by comparison. The yellowy orange sand contrasts with the blue sky and white clouds and overall the landscape is gorgeous and really well filmed. Night scenes have a blue tinge so that we can see everything and it feels like moonlight or the twilight hour. The vehicles are extravagant and spiky and bulky and have all kinds of gadgets attached with cool things I haven't seen before. There is a cliff and an artificial waterfall with poor people stuck on the land below. The cast of characters look crazy, like a freak show or something. This is not a movie going through the paces, it's hugely imaginative and creative and the passion of the film-makers comes through in every frame.Mad Max: Fury Road is not weighed down by anything unnecessary. It is dominated by action throughout and it focuses on that. Exposition is achieved through chase or fight scenes. We figure out what is going on as the movie progresses. There are no sappy moments, characters rarely cry and the movie doesn't bother to dwell on their feelings too much. It's more about survival. But the characters are human enough to relate to and care about. Tom Hardy is stoic and hardly says anything as Max. He communicates through stares and gestures. Charlize Theron is really good as Imperator Furiosa. She's tough and determined but you can tell she still has fears and hopes.It's a great achievement that the film makes use of so many practical stunts and effects. It feels far different from other action movies of recent years. It will not date the way CGI-fests will. The editing makes it easy to follow the action. It can be chaotic, but we know who we're looking at and what is actually happening. The way scenes play out is highly original. People can get snatched out of nowhere, explosions happen haphazardly, vehicles get crushed or flipped, harpoons lodge into trucks and have to be removed with bolt-cutters. But they're not arbitrary montages, they're planned out sequences of events with logical consequences that build tension and excitement.The music adds to the strange, ominous, brooding atmosphere of the film. It uses a range of styles. There are powerful low pulses on strings, crazy electric guitar and tribal drumming stuff (which parallels what's on the screen) and just generally lots of good music that I found hard to categorise.I wish more movies could be as bold and imaginative as Fury Road. I love the stark imagery throughout. The bad guy looks so cool and bizarre. It seems deserving that it has received 10 Oscar nominations. Clearly a lot of work was put into it and it isn't imitating anything but is reaching out into new possibilities for cinema. Why can't a 2 hour movie be one long action chase scene with real stunts? It was also nice to hear so many Australian accents in a movie. It feels like home.The visuals in the movie suggest a kind of hell or purgatory for the main characters. Will they find heaven or at least a stable, happy life? What is the right path to take? Riding off into the unknown or against the odds for a real chance at redemption? Perhaps there will be a nuclear war and maybe this is what humanity will become. But even with this extreme environment, there are parallels to modern life.

What a lovely film !!!,"One thing I noted while watching Mad Max: Fury Road was its simple story told with fascinating execution and commendable action scenes, and that is the beauty of this film which was over-stretched in the climax but was saved by outstanding script.Mad Max: Fury Road is a follow-up to the hugely popular Mad Max series in which Mad Max is captured by cult leader Immortan Joe. He gets the chance to runaway when Joe's imperator Furiosa rescues wives imprisoned to Joe.It has been 30 years since George Miller directed the high-octane Mad Max series and he switched to kid flicks like Happy feet and Babe. Probably the inseparable love brought him back to the popular franchises and he gave his best as both director and writer. The opening scene is probably one of the best scene with well-executed chasing scene will take away your breath away. The story unfolds showing the desperate post-apocalyptic phase with weird and crazy characters you would not even imagine in your life. Once the action rolls out, there is no turning back. This is probably nerve- breaking , ears splitting and eventful action stunts which is jaw dropping. Hats off to both action director , stylish camera work and astounding art direction capturing the rough and tough terrain of Namibia Desert. Screenplay is engaging and will not let you blink for a second. Charlize Theron carries the film on her shoulder. She is indeed amazing and will be loved for her tough role. Tom hardy as Max is wasted. An actor of his caliber should have better characterized. Nicholas Hoult was surprisingly good.A kick-ass action which will pump up your adrenalin.

Over rated,"A real pity that such a huge and epic saga with so amazing resources came out that empty, the film is soulless, the argument is pretty bold, my sensation was that they invested and bet in the visual aspect, which is great by the way, and in the constant action scenes which I've found too long leaving the story completely aside. Another issue that not many people realize is the music score, which for me is very important, in this film just didn't glue with the dynamic of the gesture. The lack of development of the bad guy character who had a lot of potentials was also not exploited as it could.I did love the production design, the costumes and makeup are amazing, the photo is very good indeed, the cars rocked, and the cast is to dream of. I am very fond of the Mad Max saga, and this film was much expected, that is why is so disappointing that this ends up being just another good action movie when it was bound to be a major classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Action, petrol and fury","Every movie carries a target or complex. In the film industry counter you can find a movie for every taste and color. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" - is primarily a striking action, the second - furious action, and the third - ""shooter"" action. Gunman reached their goals even with a reserve. Let us examine the eight-cylinder engine is now on the cogs and nuts.Pilot: the protagonist is quite typical, but very memorable and devoid of distracting roughness. We face a brutal male knight without fear and without reproach, the valiant and noble specimen so ignoble environment fauna. Tom Hardy, may not be the ideal candidate for the role of Mad Max, but after watching the film, we are ready to take him for a forgotten hero of roads. The protagonist: 8 out of 10.Passengers: minor characters contrast and memorable. Study of characters pleases, each character has its own unique style, originality, and their fury. Charlize Theron is a huge clever, though not demonstrated unsurpassed game with thriller genre was more than convincing. Selection of actors: 8 out of 10. Game actors: 8 out of 10.Subwoofer in the rear luggage compartment: the sound and the music is not just great, they are smart! Sound environment and is fully consistent with the actions taking place on the screen, each drum hit adds fury to the action and tension. Now you are bound to love the sound of an electric guitar, you will be delighted, I promise! Sound: 10 out of 10. Soundtrack: 8 out of 10.LCD screen on the front panel: quality 3D acceptable and without revelation, while per-view had instinctively wince a couple of times on the flying body parts and machines in person. Colorful picture, the scope of the number of action scenes and acrobatic flips car tenaciously hold the body in the depths of such unreliable seat theater, simply breathtaking. Fire, fury, explosions, strikes a metal object on the musculoskeletal tissues, shoots and ... of course sand. all at the highest level. 3D: 8 out of 10. Visual range: 10 out of 10. Special Effects: 9 out of 10.Track: the plot, I would call this film quite unpredictable. Despite the fact that in fact 90 steps - is a continuous action, watch the non-stop action it was interesting and in the same breath. It's hard to believe: at least a couple of scenes will make your scale of ""sentimentality"" pull up sharply its red arrow already in the critical area of ​​the division. Yes, my friends, there is drama, there is something to think about. The plot: 7 out of 10.Body painting: the most important that we managed to maintain and even increase - the atmosphere. It emanates from each disc of improvised car, from every grain of sand and shift knob. The era of madness, the era of survival in hostile environments, where water and petrol worth more than life, this is what causes a person to become even more insane than the world around to his madness to make fortune scales bow to him. Hell, I like this world of Max, how sad it would be, in practice, it was not. style: 10 out of 10.Costumes: 9 out of 10. Make-up: 10 of 10. Environment: 10 out of 10. Watchable: 10 out of 10. Fury: 100 from 10.So, looking under the hood, a very cursory examination of each element, so as not to spoil, we can safely sit in the cockpit, squeeze the gas to the limit, and go on the road ... road rage ...!Verdict: 9 out of 10.Recommendations: movies: trilogy ""Death Race"" (2008, 2010, 2012), ""The Book of Eli"" (2009), ""Doomsday"" (2008), ""Priest"" (2011), ""Resident Evil 3"" (2007), ""Terminator: Salvation ""(2009); video games: Fallout 3 (2008), Fallout: New Vegas (2010), Rage (2011), Borderlands (2009), Borderlands 2 (2012), Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (2014), Bulletstorm (2011).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This how a reboot of a movie franchise should be!! Incredible watch!,"Mad Max Fury Road is exactly how an old movie franchise should be rebooted! All the old Mad maxes mashed into one, stamped with an unpredictable script and pumped full of steroids and speed!!! Jurassic park 4 and terminator 100 (whatever number it is now lol) should take note! Don't make a movie franchise because it has a history and you can make money from the name, make a film because you have a great story to tell! Mad Max has quite a story to tell, possibly even seeing a glimpse of what humanities future may even be like when oil and natural resources have run dry.

Non stop crazy action adventure,"I liked Mad Max fury road very much. As a norwegian, the Norse religion elements were interesting, cool and relatable. The movie had everything except sex scenes, which is a good thing. There was great action, creativity, comedy (not tiresome), great acting, emotions, scenery and music. The bad guys are evil and animated and the goood guys equally well presented. There are twists in the story keeping us surprised, even though the action is almost non stop. Someone thought the Max actor didn't fit the character, but I disagree. I found him believable. Quiet, haunted, doing whatever it takes to survive, but clearly a good guy. Should you watch Mad Max Fury road? I think yes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Real Review Of Mad Max : Fury Road,"I will be quick on this review like always.I finally got around to see this movie and I have to say, Fury Road is the best action movie this year.It has a simple script,get to one place and then a lot happens in between.It works for this kind of movie.I thought Hardy and Theron did their roles pretty good.The thing about this movie is your interested and engaged about whats going on the entire movie. Unlike the marvel full comedy hour Avenger movies,the moviegoer feels the action and wants to see what happens next.This is not the best movie made or a super perfect masterpiece like some reviews are raving, but its the best movie out right now.If there is a second Mad Max movie to be made, this kind of formula and filming would be great for this kind of series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mad Max: Persistent Pursuit,"I saw this movie in the movie theater today. It is enjoyable, but boy, what a flimsy story. I reckon if they had invested 1% of the props budget in a decent scenario this film would be better off. Because the props are really fantastic. Great job there. Also, there is plenty of action. In fact, there is too much action. The whole movie is practically one long car chase. And with all things in life, good and bad, too much is too much: Rev up the engine, shoot a few times, fight on the truck, throw somebody off the truck, push a vehicle away Ben-Hur-Style, and repeat 5 times. There is your complete scenario.I've read some reviews here, and yes, the movie lacks dialogue and in-depth character study. And a decent story, but I've said this already.I have a suspicion that people who liked Snowpiercer, are also gonna love this one, i.c. 14-y old boys and hillbillies. The plots in the movie are highly improbable. I actually had a bad feeling after the first scene. And my fear came true. Not Mad Max homage worthy.A game to play while you are watching this film is deciding which model looks best. It keeps you busy the whole time!The budget for this film was 150m dollar. If humanity keeps making such films, surely we are heading for apocalyptic times...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Irritating,I felt like loosing 2 hours from my life and I felt at last the movie ended. Continuous story less madness without any motive and irritating to the fullest. Furiosa is handicapped and drives a big modified truck or war vehicle. Illogical foolish movie making. Don't watch it unless you want to loose your money. And Mad max is a funny goat who shows style in all kind of fools around. Only thing to see are the cars ... The movie starts with Mad max running and remembering his kids or wife who are lucky that they died and did not have to bear this pain that we as a crowd had to bear while watching the same. The music will burn your head.The actions are repetitive.Girlfriends will leave if you take her to this movie.,2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lauded as Great Action and Female-Empowering for a Reason,"I love this movie. Before I knew it, it had crept to the top of my favorite movies. I've seen it about eight times because I keep recommending it to people and then sitting down and watching it with them, but I'm still not tired of it. In this movie, Max takes a bit of a backseat to an indomitable amputee and her companions, women from the harem of the local creepy old warlord. Furiosa is not the only powerful one either—none of these women are helpless or one-dimensional. Tom Hardy delivers a stoic yet truly impressive Max with something like 43 lines. The world is what I love most, though. George Miller creates several utterly unique, colorful, fully-formed cultures, and he doesn't waste the viewer's time with backstory—he assumes we're intelligent enough to figure out relevant details and the rest is up to our fully piqued imaginations. Though the action is non-stop, it never gets boring and drives the plot rather than distracting from it. Plus, bonus points for a lot of practical effects instead of relying mostly on CGI!In summary: powerful disabled female character, fantastic world, engaging action, my favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why are there so many negative reviews?,"This film is great fun!I don't understand the number of negative reviews here on IMDb. Admittedly, a significant portion of this movie's run-time is action, but what where you expecting?An important thing about this film is that the action is genuinely well done; this is impressive considering that many of the 'blockbusters' of recent years (Transformers, recent Die Hard movies, Wrath of the Titans, etc.) often contain action sequences you can fall asleep watching despite being stuffed to the brim with CGI. In areas, this film clearly relies heavily on CGI, but it's never over done. The action in this film is essentially all part of one huge car chase, with few diversions, which allows for a continual steam of exhilarating carnage.The main characters in this film all look very distinct, and have vibrant and entertaining personalities. Tom Hardy is brilliant as Max, and as many have pointed out, Charlize Theron is great as Furiosa too. Also worth mentioning is Hugh Keays-Byrne, who is very effective as a menacing presence in the form of the tyrannical warlord 'Immortan Joe'. There could be more dialogue in this movie, but it wouldn't be necessary- if anything, it would remove from the awesome non-stop insanity of the film.I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is into action films, and feel that general moviegoers will likely find a lot to like here too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Majestically Operatic Insanity 10/10,"Fury Road is a high octane thrill ride from start to finish.

Road Warrior,"Saw it today. Seen all 3 previous Mad Max movies. Loved Road Warrior and Mad Max1. Been waiting for this ever since it was announced. Saw the trailers, read the hype, worried it wouldn't live up. It lived up and some. George Miller is a GREAT action director + his movies have a charming weirdness. I loved this movie. It's like Road Warrior & Beyond Thunderdome mixed up and boosted. Beautiful, well imagined fantasy world. Charlize Theron is fine as Furiosa. Tom Hardy good as Max - not like Mel Gibson but good in his way. Pounding music. 3D is just right, not overdone. One thrilling action set-piece after the other. It's great. Will see again.

Direction is nothing but just sheer brilliance. For an action buff , this has to be their wet dream. A visual treat in all ways. Hands down the best action based movie since 1999.

Frustrating,"Oh I really wanted to like it, but the action scenes, while cool sometimes, were repetitive and too fast. It wasn't about much of anything and felt too fast and had too many villains at random where it was hard to follow. It was hard to keep track and had little relaxation for the next scene. I thought it was very loud with hardly any quiet. It was very well filmed. Visually stunning, but emotionally overwhelming.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What You See Is What You Get,"It's typical of action movie advertising to promise that ""the thrills never stop"" in a trailer with clips from the 2 or 3 best moments. Mad Max: Fury Road has the rare trailer that accurately depicts the experience that you are going to get walking into that movie theater. It's almost non-stop action with a minimalist plot.Now I have seen some people complain about that aspect of the movie - the plot of the film and little character development. And I have to admit that it did grate on me a little, my more accurate score would be 8.5. But that is a very minor nitpick because a movie that is a visual spectacle would only suffer in having a complicated plot. The story in Mad Max: Fury Road is simple, but it works.Typically saying ""much action, little plot"" would be an insult, but George Miller manages to create a masterpiece that, similarly to last year's Lego Movie, puts to shame the inferiors and shows just how glorious things could be when done right.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great action..lacking in dialogue and plot,"This movie has AMAZING action sequences and awesome computer graphics, however the plot is lacking along with dialogue between characters. It is good ""mindless fun"", but not a cinematic masterpiece! If you are looking for a great action movie, this is the right movie for you!Perhaps for any sequels they could go more into how the world became the way it is, and into a little more depth regarding the character backgrounds.Otherwise, I was very entertained and loved the beauty of each scene.

Marvellous,"What a beautiful piece of modern entertainment. Although George Miller decides to completely abandon any narrative structure, and apparently didn't even have a script but just a storyboard when he started the project, he has crafted an energetic, character driven story that simply interests you from the first to the last minute. Charlize is absolutely brilliant. But it's not the individuals, it's the powerfully orchestrated summary of all players and elements that makes Fury Road an instant classic. I especially loved the music. The original Max Max films somehow got lost in the style and stardom of the 80ties. Fury Road translates the franchise into a 21st century context, while at the same time preserving the essence of the original. And probably good choice not to re-cast Mel Gibson. Chapeau!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I remember Oscars that year,"And I remember how absolutely infuriated I was that Mad Max won so many statues (and I didn't even chuckle at that one joke where someone said their name while presenting an award for short film or something similar, and it was a good joke at a time). But now, half a decade later, thanks to Netflix and COVID-19 pandemic, I finally checked off this movie as well. And it blew my mind off.True, it takes some time to understand the plot (this is my first Mad Max movie, I didn't know about the franchise) but once you get the hold of it, it's better than amazing. The best part for me was that first real fighting scene between Max and Furiosa - it really looked like they were dancing. And if watching this movie in my small room left me speechless, I can only imagine how the people watching it on the big screen felt. And now, because I was dumb in my teens, I have to stalk cinemas that play old movies so I can experience that too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
