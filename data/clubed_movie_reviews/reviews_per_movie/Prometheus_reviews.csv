Prometheus extended version,"I just rewatched Prometheus after watching previously the four Alien movies and I enjoyed more than the first time. The reason is because the extended version of 2 hours 31 minutes it's far better that the theatrical cut. More answers are shown and overall the movie script is better. So, if you want to give it a second chance to this, go for it. You won't regret.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
IMDb members – you're such a jaded lot!,"Where's your sense of wonder,adventure, excitement, innocence?? I feel I have to respond the deluge of haters on IMDb for this film, and no, I'm not trolling, I genuinely LOVED this film – and find no fault with it whatsoever! I can't believe such negative opinion and vitriol for this film! I've read and re-read the same criticisms over and over again, and for me they don't hold water.It looks like 99.9% of people have made their minds up, but he's my thoughts on the film, and if you'll indulge me, I'd like to try and change the world.The Prometheus mission is classified TOP SECRET. Even the development of the ship would be done without publicity of any kind. Potentially, they are onto the discovery of a lifetime – like Howard Carter didn't broadcast to his competitors that he was going to go looking for Tutankhamun and where he was going to go looking for it. Weyland would not risk allowing their main rival Yutani to get there first. The ""Magic Eye"" viral posted prior to the film's release supports this, and suggests that Yutani, are constantly using covert means to spy on their competitor, stealing secrets, poaching technology – so as well as this mission being secret, the crew of scientists would NOT be briefed on mission specifics beforehand, or introduced to each other prior to the mission in order to maintain secrecy. Consequently, Weyland would probably not go directly to the scientific community, but rather hire people who could be sworn to secrecy, and their silence bought. Fifield's attitude confirms this, remember the 'scientific mission' is only a smoke screen. This mission is primarily to extend Weyland's life. Period. Science is secondary, it's just that Shaw and Holloway don't know that. That's why the 'scientists' are such a motley crew. Even beyond Weyland's motives, this is a commercial venture, first and foremost – Vickers pretty much spells this out to Shaw and Holloway.In no particular order The nature of panic. When Vickers and Shaw are fleeing the Juggernaut, they are in BLIND PANIC – like when you are running away from a foe and likely run straight towards it. They don't have time to look at the orientation, they see the thing falling, see the huge shadow (remember the Jugernaut is B I G! and blindly run. Even if they ran to the side, that thing is falling heavily, they still might not get out of the way cos it's the size of two football fields!Modern instrumentation in the 21st century When everyone takes their helmets off, they have A LOT of correlating info to support the absence of pathogens, and the presence of oxygen. That's how airline pilots don't need to see out of the window to fly planes. YOU RELY ON YOUR INSTRUMENTS!! So they know they can safely remove their helmets, because the area has been terraformed using engineer technology. Same thing with the head – the instruments indicate no pathogens, and the re-animating procedure would have been successful, but unbeknown to Shaw and Ford, it's the presence of the mutation that causes the head to be in distress and the molecular implosion is the result.And the Pauling Medi Pod is expensive for a reason – don't compare it to a human surgeon, as well as the cutting being ultra fine and precise, besides the staples the machine sprays several fast-healing/flesh-bonding chemicals into the wound, Shaw does stagger for a few hours, but you're up and walking in a matter of hours.Ridley decided to use Guy Pierce in old man makeup rather than hire an old actor in order to maintain continuity with the TED Talk Viral. Everyone says how terrible the makeup is, but I think it's because Weyland is VERY old so his appearance will be that more exaggerated.When Milburn 'pets the snake' he's frightened to death – an analogy would be like when you chance upon a Doberman – you might say outstretch your hands, say ""nice doggy"" – fruitless, but you're trying to handle a difficult situation under extreme duress.And this business with accelerated growth. In the original A L I E N –accelerated growth is shown right from the alien birthing from John Hurt, a few hours later it's ""the size of a man"", so it follows that the Progenitor(s) have this same characteristic. It's also possible that the black goo causes this acceleration/mutation.And David's motives are for the most part not ambiguous, but rather pretty clear – he is first and foremost programmed to work towards the objective of Peter Weyland, all other considerations are secondary. His deliberate poisoning of Holloway is to use him as a guinea pig to observe the effects of the black goo before he advises Weyland on whether to ingest it or not, what exposure to it does etc.And the Pauling Med Pod is programmed for the one person on the ship who might need a heart op bypass, this person is likely to be old - there is only one person who fits the bill, (and he's male!), so it's OBVIOUS the unit is set up for Weyland - the notion that it's for Vickers is laughable – she's shown to be tip-top fit with the push ups. It's just happens to be located in her room.I think Weyland is on Prometheus in secret because no-one would insure a man of his age and condition to go into space, in fact the shareholders would probably forbid it, he would never pass the medical, so the only solution would be to go there in secret.99.9% of people wanted a retread of Alien or Aliens – I didn't, so I wasn't disappointed.And for those of you who want to bash Lindelof – read Jon Spaight's original script – everything that you blame Lindleof for is in Spaight's original script!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A vast, epic, underrated, and ORIGINAL sci-fi film.","Prometheus is one of the most underrated and misunderstood science fiction movies in recent memory. Do NOT view this as a prequel to Alien. It is part of the same universe, but while the first 4 are action/horror films, Prometheus is a sci-fi adventure that explores the origins of mankind. This concept is something I've always wanted to see put to screen, and Prometheus delivers so well that I'm enthralled by it no matter how many times I watch it. The cinematography and score are Oscar worthy, and the direction and visuals are near perfect. I believe Prometheus would be much higher rated if more people went into it with an open mind. The first Alien did have mixed reviews upon initial release, and now it is an all time classic. I really think that one day Prometheus will have the same status, and I hope the sequels are more appreciated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
eminently rewatchable film that provides new layers of meaning with each repeat visit,"Prometheus is an eminently rewatchable film that provides new layers of meaning with each repeat visit. How often does a master filmmaker get to revisit their original oeuvre and recreate an even bigger world around and about it? The myth of the engineers and their world changing experimentation is absolutely romantic, compelling and terrifying at the same time. It hurts even more to see how badly utilized this new mythos was in the follow up Covenant. The true mark of success that Ridley Scott achieved was igniting years of debate around the origin and nature of the engineers and their creations. Deep connections to established historical finds on earth make this origin story even more personal - the myth of alien astronauts, benevolent or cruel giants from the stars with incredible, magical technology - creators and destroyers of worlds.
Getting back to the film itself - such gorgeous cinematography and production values. I recently rewatched in 4k format and developed a greater appreciation for small clues hitherto unseen - for example navigation hologram destinations in a reactivated ship of mass destruction.
David is himself a conundrum and a polarizing figure. Was his programming to blame, or the algorithmic output of his treatment at the hand of cruel masters. The android is a central theme in the alien mythos, an expression of creation and self awareness.
The only criticism I have of Prometheus and the sequel Covenant is the proliferation of human stupidity. Predecessor films did not showcase human hubris and blundering to such a great extent - protagonists always took calculated risks. If anything the buffoonery of crews almost seems to justify their fate and reduces sympathy accordingly.
Ridley Scott may still have time to catapult his mythos to legendarium, if his subsequent sequels after Covenant retain purity of spirit with his expanded universe. I for one look forward to seeing more of this wondrous unravelling and exposition.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Prometheus (2012),"Prometheus seems to have disappointed many viewers. Luckily for me I had no expectations, despite being a Scott film set in the same universe as the Alien franchise. The ship Prometheus goes looking for the beginning of mankind and what created us. It's a rather ambitious idea and the film should be given credit for trying to have some kind of theological and scientific debate. Unfortunately, the script also feels as though it has to give us the scares and frights that we associate with the Alien films. The majority of the film is intriguing but for every positive there is a negative. We get fascinating characters such as David, Vickers, and Janek. But they are mostly pushed aside to focus on the stupid scientist characters. Did the writers not realise how bad their work was? Rapace refuses to let one character take weapons on an expedition because it is a ""scientific"" mission. I call BS on that. No scientist would be so stupid as to explore a new planet, with no information on said planet, without a bit of protection. Characters decide to do stupid stuff, such as approach viscous looking new species etc. and it is here where the film annoyed me. The set design was beautiful, and I enjoyed the quieter moments the film had to offer, such as David's trying to understand emotions etc. The most interesting ideas the film has are delivered in single lines of dialogue, but are never explored. It's head and shoulders above many science fiction films of late, but it also needs a few sequels to clear things up. Unfortunately, that means it wasn't so great as a stand alone film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Pretend it has nothing to do with Alien,"I think this serves as a pretty decent stand alone sci fi. I like quite a lot about this movie. The cast is good. Noomi Rapace in particular is very good.I like the idea of the engineers, I like the idea of the black goo, I mostly like the idea that this all spawns the xenomorphs we know and love but I don't really understand why.Not everything needs an origin story and I preferred Alien when we just thought they were out there somewhere. I don't think we needed an origin/backstory/genesis story.Take out the final scenes which, if I'm honest, felt a little forced, and Prometheus would still have been a fairly decent sci fi.And most notably, Prometheus does teach us not to run in a straight line.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not what I was hoping for,"It's good to see that Ridley Scott still has the same vision for stylistic sets and atmospheric lighting.Lots of dripping water and eery shadows as one might expect from the old master. The special effects are impressive, the CGI is great, the technology is plausible for the turn of the next century. But - and I'm afraid it's a big but - the plot is disjointed, the characters two dimensional and the script is, well, not the best. Far too many things happen which simply make no sense at all, or just don't tally with ""what we know already"" about the Alien universe. Far too many plot mechanisms, bits of tech and even shots and scenes are borrowed from other films - Serenity, independence day, The Mummy, Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, Pitch Black, X- Files. I won't go into detail because I can't do that without using spoilers, but try it yourself. Watch the film and see how many ripped off bits you can spot. Spectacular, yes. A great film? No. sadly not.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott restores his Alien Legacy with the discovery of the origins of Mankind,"WOW. This film was a breath of fresh air and a great restoration of the Alien universe. The franchise took an early hit in its line of succession with Alien 3, 4, and then somebody had a bright idea of mixing it with Fox's dead franchise, Predator. Well, we know how that went.Anyway, Prometheus was over hyped and there was a lot of ""oh it's a prequel, oh it's not a prequel"" talk leading up to its release. Well, I saw the film opening night and I was amazed at how stunning the film was and how philosophical, spiritual, adventurous, captivating the story was. I just recently watched again on bluray and the film is very layered and complex than most people believe. The characters are well developed and have depth. The film is actually both a prequel but not at the same time. It has the same DNA as Alien and it doesn't really connect until the last 30mints but then it doesn't. Confused? Well, that's why you should checkout this syfy masterpiece.A lot of people complain at how slow the movie was and yet they claim to be Alien fans. Hmmm I guess they never saw the first movie and they don't know Ridley Scott. If your a fan of the Alien Films, especially the first two, and have a great understanding of Greek mythology and have an open mind to asking the question of where we came from then I think you will definitely enjoy this movie like i did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Standalone, prequel, or reboot? It doesn't matter, good job!","It is hard to say too much about Prometheus without spoiling it. First of all, those expecting to see the original Aliens are not seeing this movie for all the right reasons. Yes, it is part of the Alien universe and set before the first movie, but it doesn't feature those Aliens and instead tells a brand new story of merging the two worlds together.With Ridley Scott back to directing, Prometheus used the similar setup of making researchers explore an alien world, only this time there is a longer setup and more suspense driven to events unfolding. The ship in this movie is very reminiscent of the one in Alien, although it is different in design and has some new interesting gadgets and pieces of technology we haven't seen before. There's no denying that there are things people will pick up relating to Alien, and I'm really glad they didn't tone down the violence for 12/PG-13 rated audiences. Either way, you can watch Prometheus first before the other Alien movies.On the acting side of things, I found Michael Fassbender's Android character David to be the standout for the movie. I also liked the protagonist Noomi Rapace and the supporting cast of Logan Marshall-Green, Charlize Theron, and Idris Elba. All strong performances, but perhaps if there's only one small complaint I could think of, is that maybe the supporting characters didn't get enough development time. Thankfully, Scott and the team keep the movie going at a very good pace with emotional depth at the right moments.Overall, Prometheus on first viewing was what I expected, a movie using it's original base movie Alien as a structure to produce a new story with new characters/lifeforms to lead up to other Alien story lines. It is highly likely the references will become more obvious in sequels to this, but Prometheus manages to bring a story that works as a standalone but also a prequel at the same time, which is good for all viewing audiences, and I think Scott was trying to bring the grisly/dark atmosphere movies of Alien without being too in your face, which I thought was the right direction for this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
So much of this movie could have been easily fixed...,"Don't get me wrong. It's gorgeous to look at, and I'm definitely going to go and see it again. It's really impressive.But... It's stuffed with scenes without any payoff. Again and again it sets stuff up and then just... walks away from it.In at least one unforgivably stupid scene, someone *literally* just walks away from an antagonist and leaves it there. And then doesn't tell anyone about it. Some of it's really effective. There are some scenes that are absolutely gripping. But so much of it doesn't make any sense...Having said all that I think it's very clear that what I just saw was Prometheus part 1. It's very definitely supposed to have a sequel and I will certainly go to see the sequel. I think both movies taken together might score a 10.But this movie by itself doesn't.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Not in the same league as 'Alien' and 'Aliens', while heavily flawed it was still better than expected","'Alien' is still to this day a tense, shocking suspenseful and frightening masterpiece, one of my favourites of the genre. The bigger and bolder 'Aliens' is one of those rare sequels that is every bit as good as its predecessor. Both are two of my favourite films and the character of Ripley is one of the most iconic female characters in film.To be honest, there were initial doubts about 'Prometheus'. Ridley Scott, as especially proved with 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' and 'Thelma and Louise' has shown that he has a lot of talent as a director, though his filmography is hit and miss. So that he was back on board as director and that there is a great cast promised much. There were worries however as well, due to some negative reception amongst audiences who criticised the script, story and notorious ""plot holes"".Watching 'Prometheus' finally, it was a better film than expected though nowhere near in the same league as 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. That said, it was heavily flawed and there are criticised personally agreed with, though it doesn't deserve the 1/2/10 ratings which indicate that the film had no redeeming qualities at all which is not the case.'Prometheus' best asset is the visuals. The settings look tremendous, of sheer beauty and with a real eeriness, the cinematography complements it perfectly and often powerfully arresting and the special effects are a feast for the eye. Scott's direction has moments where it is superb, if more in the visuals and spectacle than the narrative.More than up to the level of the quality of the visuals is the cast. Noomi Rapace is an authoritative lead, and Michael Fassbender is even better in one of his best performances to date. Charlize Theron and Idris Elba also prove how talented they are as performers. Most of the rest are more than up to their level.While the story is very problematic, it does have its moments. There is some tension, especially in the last act, parts are thought-provoking and there are some thrills. The music is suitably haunting.However, there is a good deal that doesn't work. The script is often very weak, often rambling, clichéd and not very logical with some stupid decision making. The story does suffer from too many concepts not explored enough, some leaden pacing and at times a lack of cohesiveness.Characters are also not particularly well-written, they seemed underdeveloped and there are too many of them, the decision making of some are a cause for extreme frustration. Not to mention lapses in logic, ridiculous science and parts that don't make as much sense as ought.In conclusion, better than expected but heavily flawed and one may question the point of it. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Random and Confused,"Most of what I would say has already been said. I especially agree with the fact that a crew trained in intergalactic travel probably couldn't tie their own shoes. They do so many stupid thing that could have terminated the voyage in a heartbeat. There is no caution, no restraint. I'm not sure we are ever very clear on the mission itself.

Stunning,"Firstly if you don't know anything about Prometheus and the sci fi mythology that surrounds it all the better. Don't go into this film with any preconceived notions. I think the team that brought you this never had a plan to bring you what you expect and it's all the better for it. If you are hoping for the same old with a quick set up with xenomorph on human action and people running around corridors for the rest of the film while they are picked off one by one you may be surprised. If you expect it to spell everything out like there is some master plan, well as I said leave your expectations at the door. This a beautifully rendered film with a much slower pace than others of the same genre. Prometheus is its own film and I think it's all the better for it. The nods to others are nice and for me it was enough, I think in retrospect I'd have been disappointed and bored if they had gone the familiar route. For those that know Prometheus' pedigree notice how I've tried to avoid mentioning it! For those that are coming into the film with no idea what it is about keep it that way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Curiosity killed the Crew,"This needed a second viewing, just to see if not being awestruck was my fault. Sir Ridley Scott's unintended (but obviously linked) prequel to his 1979 classic, 'Alien' is a hugely ambitious film; but is, in a word, meretricious.The story is profoundly compelling, and is an example of why sci-fi can be the most noble of all genres. It's not afraid to ask the big questions – Where do we come from? What is our purpose? What happens when we die? – but cowers into the nearest black hole when it comes to answering them (or at least the last two of those). No film I have seen has handled analogous material better than Kubrick's '2001', and 'Prometheus' could have ensured similar stardom if it chose epiphany over escapist entertainment.The year is 2093. Discovery of a recurring ancient cave painting has prompted a space expedition. A vessel called Prometheus carries a crew of 17 to a destination where it is believed the answers to human origin lie. Interweaving an alien story with the central plot is a major strength, a double-whammy concept. But the delivery is all devilry; pure Hollywood compromise.Despite the voluptuous visuals, stunning production design and preference of manual over computer effects (including a memorable alien abortion sequence), what ruined it for me was the handling of this precious material. Perhaps it was inevitable. Between them, the two writers (Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof) have a limited repertoire which has space for the execrable 'Cowboys and Aliens' and equally distasteful 'The Darkest Hour'.Discoveries are anti-climactic. When the crew discover something of importance, i.e. everything, they are remarkably insouciant. The effect on me was a mutual disinterest. All the elements for suspense are here: dark passages, inexplicable noises, prolonged moments of inactivity; yet there is a lack of the kind of suspense which gave Scott's 1979 film its reputation.One saving grace is Michael Fassbender's David, the onboard android. He gives everyone an acting lesson; one that ship captain, Janek (Idris Elba) doesn't heed, choosing instead to remain impassive throughout. Guy Pearce (in heavy make-up) cameos as the CEO of the company funding the venture. He has only a few days of life left and presumes they will find a merciful rather than noxious God, and further presumes that he will be able to barter for an extension.Other principal players are Doctors Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), and expedition manager, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), who raises her voice to remind everyone who's boss (an interesting discussion point, evoking Scott's 'Blade Runner', is whether she's another android).Once Darwinism has been negated, the crew, particularly Shaw, desperately seek other answers. This is where I felt cheated. Yes, speculation is often more enticing than revelation, but this film is fuelled by its revelations. We're not given the answers, ostensibly to add mystery. But I feel that the script writers had no more to offer. David asks Shaw why she so badly wants to know more. Her response is risible: 'Maybe it's because I'm human and you're a robot'.The conclusion is impetuous and insipid. It is not too distant in tone and style than – I'm serious – 'Armageddon'. The best bit of the film probably won't even be talked about. It's established that Prometheus has actually landed on an installation, where aliens were being manufactured by our 'Engineers' (Gods) to create WMD. Their intention was to use these weapons to destroy Earth, but the aliens escaped captivity and massacred them. What a concept! If you were going to compromise, which this film does, why not show that story? Maybe they will in another prequel.www.moseleyb13.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Atmospheric Sci-Fi,Prometheus lived up to my expectations. I was satisfied with the movie and would recommend it to all Sci-fi fans. Please watch the movie with an open mind and don't make the mistake of comparing it to past Sci-fi movies.The special effects were excellent. Michael Fassbender as the android is the standout cast member.There are some minor gripes. At two hours in length the movie seemed to be too short; it should have been about thirty minutes longer. A longer movie would have allowed for better character development. Some characters appeared to be superfluous and could have been omitted from the final script.Overall I was happy with what I saw and I was mesmerized by the alien world that Ridley Scott created for his audience. Sci-fi is a genre that allows us to escape the drudgeries of our earthbound existence and wonder at what might be. Prometheus did it for me.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Provokes the imagination. Bench mark setting visuals,"If you manage your expectations then you will be in for one of the best sci fi experiences in recent years with some killer visuals.I'm not what you call an Alien trilogy fan boy. In fact I'm not exactly even a fan. Couldn't tell you the last time I watched one of them. They've never hit home with me. From my point of view they are monster movies than anything else. If the originals were set in a research lab in the south pole it wouldn't have changed much.Prometheus is a sci-fi movie at its very core. It provokes the imagination. It will ask questions such as how where we made, why, by who, for what purpose?? The movie will take you on an enjoyable, thrilling and philosophical science fiction experience. Simply put Ridley nailed it. So much so he has simply set a new bench mark in movie experiences.The visuals of this movie are amazing. Proof if anything that when it comes to special effects and eye candy none do it better than Ridley Scott. In my opinion the best use of 3D to date. Couldn't fault the cast. Having said that its clear to me Fassbender turned in the best performance. I feel thats largely due to the uniqueness and quirks of his character vs the more straight up working professional crew. Either way he turned in the performance.Going forward I hope we see Ridley revisit the Prometheus story arc and treat us with some more outstanding science fiction cinema. If he doesn't then it would detract anything from what this film IS. My only fear is this film will draw criticism for what it ISN'T and the disappointment of the fan base for the more tried and tested formula of the Alien movies.I guess that goes both ways though. The original Alien movies weren't for me where as Prometheus was.

Promises of a greatness that were never delivered in the serviceable final product,"Archeologists and lovers Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered several pictographic records from across the Earth's civilizations dating back 35,000 years detailing worship by ancient peoples of giant humanoid beings with shared star maps. Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) the late billionaire founder and CEO of Weyland Corp. Finances an expedition on board the ship Prometheus to LV-223 detailed in the ancient star maps under the direction of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), Synthetic humanoid David (Michael Fassbender), and a team of scientists to locate the ancient alien species known as ""The Engineers"". Upon arrival, the crew find remnants of the Engineers which may prove to be more dangerous than any of them imagined.Prometheus' origins date back almost 10 years prior to its final release where James Cameron and Ridley Scott had jointly pitched a fifth Alien movie following Sigourney Weaver's hesitance to return as Ripley that would serve as a prequel to the series and examine the origins of the spaceship and the ""space jockey"" that had long captured the fandom. These plans were put on hold when Fox decided to prioritize the crossover Alien vs. Predator which both Cameron and Scott aw as undermining the validity of the series putting the proposed prequel on a shelf. Following the negative reception of Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, Fox began salvage attempts for each franchise with Robert Rodriguez making the film Predators and Scott given development resources for the Alien prequel. There was a conscious effort on Scott's part to make the film its own story relatively independent of Alien with more focus paid to building the mythology around the Space Jockey rather than the Xenomorphs themselves. The film was undoubtedly one of the most anticipated films of the 2012 Summer movie season with the direction by Scott and a promised R-Rating seeing as a welcome return to form for both the Alien series as well as a welcome return by Scott to the Sci-fi genre after not having directed such a film since Blade Runner in 1982. While the movie received solid enough reviews upon release, a good number of critics had expressed disappointment with the handling of certain elements of the material with the screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof garnering a lot of criticism for its feeling of raising more questions than answers. When I first saw Prometheus 10 years ago I think I tried to tell myself that I liked it because there are moments of wonder and majesty in the film that are sights to behold, but I also felt this feeling of ""something wasn't quite right"" that's only gotten more pronounced with time.To start on a positive note, Prometheus starts out of the gate feeling like a true epic. From Marc Streitenfeld's sweeping score to Dariusz Wolski's awe inspiring cinematography Prometheus is a film whose sheer enormity in both scale and tone leaves the viewer with a strong sense of grandiosity that serves to make them feel dwarfed by comparison. The movie also features a fantastic performance by Michael Fassbender as David the synthetic humanoid and the opening stretch where he goes around the Prometheus by himself tending to all the ship's functions while keeping himself occupied is one of the best character moments in the film and he becomes something of a core to this movie that holds it together even during its weaker moments.Unfortunately the movie makes a number of missteps in other areas, particularly in its characterizations and story beats. The movie features way too many characters for the kind of movie it is with 17 crewmembers in total on board the Prometheus and many of them just being glorified ""red shirts"" to pad out the body count. What characterization we are given isn't particularly compelling with Sean Harris and Rafe Spall playing a geologist and biologist who not only carry an out of place pessimism that feels ill fitting for this story, but end up doing some really boneheaded decisions that don't make sense in context of what the movie presents us. There's a large number of moments in this film where characters make terrible decisions that don't make sense from trying to pet clearly dangerous wildlife, getting obvious infections and then telling no one about it, or justifying decisions with tired adages like ""because it's what I choose to believe"" that parts of the movie veer off into unintentional comedy with how nonsensical characters act. We also have Guy Pearce in some really unconvincing ""old man"" make-up as Peter Weyland that was apparently only done because the script called for scenes in the past with Weyland as a young man, but those scenes were dropped during re-writes so we're just supposed to accept this on face value. The movie tries to build its own mythology with the Engineers from the space jockey established in the first Alien film and given Scott's professed distain for the AVP series it's rather ironic that he went with the ""ancient astronauts visiting Earth"" stuff that was featured prominently in those films as a backbone for Prometheus (not a spoiler by the way, all this is seen in the first 3 minutes).If you're a fan of Alien then you'll probably find a lot of value in Prometheus with its production design, grand scope, and performance by Michael Fassbender solid points to appreciate, but the dangling plot threads begging for sequels, characters lacking in brain cells, and some really stupid justifications for faith that feel like flowery nonsense.

"""Prometheus"" (2012) - A Visually Stunning but Divisive Prequel","Ridley Scott returned to the ""Alien"" universe with ""Prometheus,"" a prequel that explores the origins of humanity and the xenomorphs. Although it's set in the same universe, ""Prometheus"" takes a more philosophical and existential approach, raising questions about creation, the nature of life, and humanity's place in the cosmos.The film follows the crew of the spaceship Prometheus, led by scientists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), as they seek the origins of human life on a distant planet. Michael Fassbender shines as David, an android with his own agenda, delivering a performance that is both chilling and captivating. Charlize Theron and Idris Elba provide solid support, but the character development across the board is uneven, with some crew members feeling underutilized.Visually, ""Prometheus"" is breathtaking. The film's production design, cinematography, and special effects are top-notch, creating a rich and immersive world that is both beautiful and terrifying. The alien landscapes, the intricate interiors of the spaceship, and the hauntingly enigmatic Engineers all contribute to the film's grandeur.However, the film's narrative is where opinions diverge. ""Prometheus"" poses many intriguing questions but provides few clear answers, leaving some viewers frustrated by the film's ambiguity. The script, written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof, is filled with big ideas but sometimes lacks coherence and focus, leading to a story that feels disjointed at times.While ""Prometheus"" doesn't deliver the intense horror of the original ""Alien,"" it is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that adds depth to the franchise's mythology. It's a film that aims high, even if it doesn't always hit its mark, and is worth watching for its ambition and the questions it raises about creation and existence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Visually spectacle it might be, but it ain't no Avatar.","The good old days of storytelling through film making is on the wane. Great film makers of yesteryear used to make great films. Now they're just about good. Steven Spielberg is one such example. Tintin was enjoyable but it was surely not your usual Spielberg fare. Another classic example in this league of directors is Ridley Scott. Lately the guy seems to be at sea regarding how to tell a gripping story. Robin Hood was entertaining but not endearing at all. Prometheus also suffers the same fate. It is at best a onetime entertaining watch. But it doesn't stay with you. Alien was one movie which haunted me, stayed with me. The tension while watching Sigourney Weaver going head on against the alien was palpable. In Prometheus you feel as if the things that happen were bound to happen. It feels strange that you're making a film on such a scale with loads of budget and you don't ponder over it as to what people would expect and how they would react. I'd say, the writers of fantabulous TV series such as Breaking Bad do better a job than these so called script writers. Noomi Rapace, the archaeologist is compelling, the android is portrayed by Fassbender with delightful precision and Charlize Theron is powerful in her short role. They got the right guys, but they didn't find them the right story. The movie is no doubt a visual spectacle, but it ain't no Avatar.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Could have been so much better,"Interesting enough concept but I felt it was handled rather poorly. The visuals were stunning (but the 3D was weak) and it was great to see Giger's designs fleshed out a little more.On the other hand, we have two young adults who have supposedly risen to the peak of their profession yet apparently haven't grown emotionally beyond being emo fifteen-year-olds. The interplay between them was almost unwatchable and left me feeling the movie was intentionally dumbed down way too far. There's far too many minor characters to even start to sort them out or care about them. The plot is a confusing mess which several times veers off on tangents which then whither and die without going anywhere.And why not cast an old man to play an old man instead of using bad makeup on a younger man?Overall, it was deeply flawed but it was still worth going to see for Giger's art.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This is actually NOT a new Aliens franschise,"So first i watched it in the cinema and i've never seen a movie from the Alien franschise before, and after the movie ended as felt abit ""meh, special effects nothing more"" Then a friend told me i at least should watch the 2 first Alien movies and so i did and now i re watched Prometheus and it is SOO much better if you've seen at least the 2 first ones. It comes of as a new franchise but to be honest, a lot of the things explained and seen in Prometheus were something you wondered about from the 2 first films.So in the end, watch at least the 2 first ones (both really good, the others are not so) before you watch Prometheus",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Seems more like a sequel to ""Mission to Mars""","This movie just seemed more like a hands on approach to ""Mission to Mars"" than a prequel to ""Alien"". In fact it has almost nothing to do with the Alien movies. It wasn't a boring movie but for all the hype it got, it's sort of disappointing. This movie just lacked the tension and intensity that I was expecting. It just wasn't horrifying or anything like that, despite some of the mystery surrounding the planet the characters are in. This movie is more about the ultimate question when it comes to mankind and their conviction than anything else. But has more of the sci-fi elements thrown in. The CGI and everything from the surrounding looks realistic and cool to look at. Even the technology doesn't seem far-fetched at all and very believable, despite one technology that allows you to view other people's dreams. This movie keeps going with the build up without much payoff at the end. Some of the characters in this movie has conviction and wants answers and most audiences as well. Even if it is make belief by the makers of this movie it would be more satisfying to know what the makers of this movie's vision is. Maybe they just didn't have one or saving it for the sequel if there is one, but it was still disappointing. Also these character are probably suppose to be very intelligent people, since trillions of dollars went into the mission they are on. But they make the most stupid mistakes that even average people know better not to do. The casts for this movie is right on target and fit their roles really well. Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron comes to mind but it feels like there could have been more done with those characters. Guy Pearce is alright despite him being in this movie for just a short while and him being almost unrecognizable. Anyways it's worth a watch to see the realistic looking world that Ridley Scott has created but almost everything else seemed a bit weak. Even when planning for a sequel a good ending is when the audience is left satisfied and yet wanting more. That just isn't the case for this and it gives the audience almost nothing. Also the plot holes for this movie is just way too obvious and really stands out.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Prometheus a solid, if not great, film","Over the last year or so, fandom has been awash in hope and desire that Prometheus, the new film from Ridley Scott, and his return, if perhaps somewhat peripherally, to the Alien franchise he began in 1979 would be a welcome return to form for that series after a spiraling set of latter sequels and the infantile spinoffs in the form of the odious Alien vs. Predator films. Well fans, rejoice to some extent: Prometheus is certainly a fair sight better than the above mentioned films. It, however, will leave those who are expecting both a horror film and a very Alien-centric picture disappointed to a large extent, as Prometheus uses only the framework of the Alien universe to tell a wholly new tale, one that is more interested in asking questions than in giving you shocks.Opening in 2089 on Earth in Scotland, archeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered a similar pictorial representation of a star system at multiple scientific digs. Using this information, they have convinced aging wealthy industrialist Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) to fund an expedition to the star system depicted in the images in the hopes of making contact with what Shaw and Holloway refer to as the ""Engineers"", aliens they think may have helped engineer the beginnings of life on Earth. Once they arrive on the planet, the team discovers large structures that contain various chambers and artifacts, mostly small canisters, as well as one decapitated alien body. In the course of engaging in their research and exploration, they find themselves hampered at times by the limitations placed on them by their corporate boss, Vickers (Charlize Theron), and are also helped by android David (Michael Fassbender). But, as things unfold, the motivations of some of the crew begin to come into question, and the things they discover on the planet make them begin to wonder if it was a trip that was wrong to make.Prometheus is very interested in tackling some ""big"" issues: the origin of mankind, the mix of faith and science and the search for immortality. Unlike many other modern science-fiction films, it isn't all slam-bang, hyper edited action. In fact, much of Prometheus is comprised of scenes of dialogue and moments of characters pondering what they have discovered. Science fiction movies with a degree of wonder and introspection are a rare creature these days, so the fact that Prometheus seems genuinely interested in exploring some of these themes is impressive in and of itself.Prometheus doesn't completely skimp on the scare quotient. While I would hardly describe it as a full on horror film, Prometheus has more than its share of jumps, tension and squirms, albeit these moments are often secondary to other elements in the film, but they deliver when necessary. Prometheus definitely benefits from impressive visual design and cinematography from Arthur Max and Darius Wolski, respectively. It also does an exceptional job of revisiting the designs of H.R. Giger that were originally crafted for Alien. While there isn't much new design material here from Giger, seeing his ideas on screen again reminds you of what a unique and interesting designer he truly is.Where Prometheus falls down, largely, is in the character department. Almost none of the main characters are really developed or given more than a cursory amount of personality. They are not neglected completely, but the audience doesn't really connect with them. Most of the development is given to Shaw and her search for answers about man's creation, but almost all the rest are provided with enough dialogue to serve the plot, and not a lot else. One of the most interesting characters in the film is actually the android David, who vacillates between being a helpful assistant to some of the humans to also having ulterior motives that may or may not be in the best interest of the crew. Fassbender does an exceptional job of making David have the outer appearance of warmth and congeniality, while hiding a cold, calculating core beneath the surface. David is a fascinating at times, and proves one of the more memorable elements in the film.For those who are looking for Prometheus to give them some Alien action, they will have to make do with the suggestion of the film setting up some of the material of the first entry in that franchise. Prometheus does borrow some of the feel of the first Alien at times, especially in some middle scenes involving secondary crew members whose curiosity gets the best of them, but this film is not really an Alien movie, but a prequel in the truest sense of the word: it sets the table, but leaves before the meal is served.Prometheus is a good, if unspectacular, science fiction film from director Scott that wants to play in the field of ideas and not just the space fantasy that many other films seem to be only interested in doing. While the lack of depth to the characters can at times keep the viewer at arm's length, in terms of look and feel, Prometheus delivers the goods. May Ridley Scott not wait another 30 years to re-enter the science fiction realm.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ridley's stinking turd,"This film destroyed Ridley Scott's reputation with me. I saw it without reading many reviews, because Ridley was the director. I will never do that again.The script is worse than imbecilic. It is depressing, because so much visual and acting artistry was wasted on such trash. With all the talented writers in the world, why couldn't Ridley find one who knows anything about science or human behavior or storytelling? Has he lost his mind? Or does he just not care anymore?Either way, I won't trust him again. Burn me this badly and it's bye-bye.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I sort of enjoyed it,"The movie tells upon a story about a group of curious people who wanted to know their origin or can say what created them. They collected all the signs which showed them a way to follow and to find out. As they planned, they reached their desired destination.

Something is killing them. David which is a robot design to go along with the mission found something in the cave and surprisingly it was turned out to be an alien which was alive but was in pod and David tried to communicate with it.Were they able to communicate with the alien?What was killing them?Who left signals for them?Were they able to complete the mission?At last, it will keep you wondering and you can not but watching the 2nd part of this movie.I love alien movies that why I choose to watch it.

Disappointing beauty.,"(31/05/2012, Antwerp)Yesterday evening had finally come. There I sat in the best seat of the theatre, the air teeming with the smell of hyped anticipation and slight nervosity. There was a healthy amount of Belgians and Dutch people present in Kinepolis Antwerp, but I wouldn't say the theatre was chock-full.With 3D glasses on (for the first time) I was in anticipation of awesomeness. The first thing I noticed, while watching a cool trailer for The Hobbit, was that I found the 3D absolutely awful. Luckily it wasn't bad at all during Prometheus, which did a very good job as far as the 3D goes. Anyways, I will not be watching movies in 3D again, as I still find it incredibly gimmicky.Okay, on to the real deal. Prometheus.You'd think a search for the origin of mankind would be full of danger, conflict, excitement, wonder and probably a little bit of terror as well. Prometheus shows us it's primarily quite boring.Even people who have never before written a novel or screenplay know the necessity of tension and release, of carefully paced out highs and lows, of a gradual build-up towards a climax. Prometheus proves us even well-paid professionals can be quite oblivious to these basic writing rules and that they can be happy about a story as flat as sweet Noomi's bosom, even though it looks stunning on the whole.I can only tremble at the foresight of the vast tidal waves of hate that will soon reach a certain screenwriter, but I won't add to that. I will however be very wary of any film that this person is involved with from now on, that's for certain. (In case you're still unsure who I'm talking about, it's NOT Jon Spaihts, as I know he is capable of great things.)However, even though it pains me to do so, there is someone else who I'd like to point my finger at in disappointment, someone who I know to be incredibly skilled: Sir Ridley Scott. Someone of his calibre should've recognized the weaknesses in the script and demanded they throw entire pages straight in the recycling bin. ""A very interesting and fascinating take on things, boys, but please do rewrite most of act 2 and especially act 3. At once, if possible."" That's what he should've said.Alas, he did not, which means he was pleased with the result. A very painful mistake, Sir Ridley.Just as troublesome is the fact he didn't deliver what he promised: ""I'm looking to scare the living crap out of people."" The etheric smell of rosemary and mint my boxer shorts are still spreading upon inspection (as always) is proof of the contrary. For an evening of intense terror I'd recommend watching another film (Alien would be a great place to start if you haven't seen it). Even the (minimal) work of H.R. Giger couldn't get me into the state of anxiety I longed for. By the way, it doesn't take long to realize the monster design in Prometheus did NOT spring from Giger's sinister brain, that's for certain.If Ridley truly lost it, then I'm afraid I'd rather not see a sequel to Blade Runner.Okay, all this would almost make me forget all the good things about Prometheus. The cinematography and special fx were absolutely breath-taking (we CAN thank Ridley for the former), the music was really fitting and well-placed during editing (even though it isn't particularly memorable), the acting by primarily Noomi Rapace (I still love you <3) and Michael Fassbender was excellent, and the set design was hot. Yes, hot.To conclude: + cinematography (also excellent 3D when compared to the trailers before the film) + effects + sound + acting (Rapace, Fassbender) + set design - script is ridiculously flat, very underwhelming ""climax"" (if you can call it that) - story tries to be deep, but it really isn't - most characters feel like nothing but cannon fodder, one-dimensional - little emotion - monster designOthers did kind of like the film however, so I recommend forming your own opinion. But be warned. I also want to point out I had high expectations, like most of us. But it pains me to tell you I was wrong. We were so wrong.6/10PS: Noomi, thanks for the mint and rosemary. <3 x",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Left to ponder?,"Anticlimactic, overcomplicated, unoriginal and downright silly. A wasted opportunity. This film started off well, but by mid way through you get a sense that it has lost its way. By the end you get that unnerving feeling that it has sold you short. A Much wasted opportunity. No real scares with no cares. Really can't understand how they screwed this up. And before I get a retort, I will say that I am familiar with the Alien films, but did not watch this film for that reason. I viewed this film because I was hoping that this would place the franchise back on the right track, if not, new direction. Unfortunately the new direction is bastardised, meaning, it stank of re-writes and production interference. You could go as far to say that this film has no lead character, no solid story, bad pacing and it feels like its missing the third act. Its one of those cases were, if the film ran for another 5 minutes towards the end with some sense of urgency, it could have really saved the whole package. Unfortunately the film just fizzles out at the end and your left to ponder why you feel a little stupid.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Just another summer movie,"I just saw this movie yesterday after great anticipation from all the trailers i saw, i even saw the first movie again because it was the best in the series (maybe 4 was to haven't decided yet). First i must say that if you go, go to the 3D it's a must, the effect's are brilliant (and i haven't said it in a long time about a 3D movie although the AVENGERS came close). you can see the ashes fly in your face when they first land, and everything just engulfs you when you get into the movie, the sound is amazing all around just amazing effects. Having said that, The real problem begins with the plot, if i hadn't known the film is directly connected to to the alien series i wouldn't have been so disappointed, but Ridley Scott really disappoints in a big way. seeing the movie i felt like this was the ""Clash of the Titans"" version of the Alien saga, just bad all around. The connection to the saga is well pointed out but the plot is a joke there is a mini plot intertwined that is even worse,i fail to even see the connection of the origin of humanity here, and so those scoot fail to show it.if the point of the movie was that there is no point to everything, so really whats the point to go see this movie at all. The cast includes: Charlize Theron (oh mama), Michael Fassbender & Guy Pearce all great actors and all just waisting away in this movie. Noomi Rapace plays here character really well and that really adds to the dark atmosphere and the conflicts between the characters, but there was no real need for so many frames of her tummy, she looks very ripped, but come on. In conclusion without the amazing 3D and effects there is no real reason to see the movie at all, i am very disappointed with the great Ridley Scott who brought us: Gladiator, Thelma & Louise, Blade Runner and of course Alien.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Totally forgettable, rehashed ideas from other films.","Prometheus starts out a mystery and ends with many questions. What does the opening mean? Neither of us could tell. This is before Alien yet the technology is more advanced than Alien and Alien was further in the future.Also, this advanced technology can show what a person is dreaming while asleep but it can't show what is inside of an ancient, abandoned space ship. It can't show that there are bodies, living and dead, in that same spaceship until much, much later.We were expecting this film to end at a point near where Alien starts but that idea isn't fleshed out completely here.This film is just a mess with ideas sort of flung in the wind that end up not being satisfying. There is a tedious feel to a lot of this. A lot is happening but it isn't very fulfilling nor interesting. The scene that had the most impact is that of a woman crew member who chooses to enter into a surgery booth and have surgery performed on her without anesthetic. The rest was rehash from other films, other ideas we've been exposed to before.Sorry Ridley, this didn't work for me and I won't remember a thing about it 3 months from now. Time for something completely new. I suppose the acting was very good, the film is nice to look at but there isn't anything interesting here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Disappointing, but most sci fi films are worse","Well worth seeing in the cinema, as it is visually very spectacular. The artwork, by H.R Giger is as eery and macabre as ever.It is well directed. I found more than one heart stopping moment where I felt I needed a scotch afterwards. Ridley Scott is in fine form.Unfortunately, however, the story has more than a few plot holes. The characters constantly behave stupidly and illogically, and after a while it's hard to believe in, or feel for, them. Aside from the usual red shirt characters, who are obviously in the film to get killed off early on, pretty much everybody in the film is conspicuously dumb too.There's plenty of gore, with heads exploding and similar. Some people really go for that stuff, and consider it a major attraction. I myself don't mind it, but only when it serves the story. I find it a bit cheap when the causes of these events don't seem to make a huge amount sense.One thing worth noting before you see it is that THIS FILM IS NOT A PREQUEL. The planet it is set on is not the same planet that the original Alien film starts on (LV-426). Instead, it takes place on LV-223 which just looks very similar.

"After 5 years of daily IMDb use, I FINALLY register to respond to some of this rubbish!","I'm a huge fan of science fiction. Alien and Blade Runner are probably in my top ten favorite movies of all genres, and of all time. I had (((HUGE))) expectations for this film. It's the first film I've bothered to see in a movie in a theater in over 2 years.... What did I think of it?EPIC.To all the folks saying this film is utter rubbish let me start here: are you even sci-fi fans? And if so, are you also a fan of the space/alien/action sub-genre? If you are not a fan of this genre and sub-genre, then don't judge this movie based on your personal preferences. Judge it on it's own terms, based on it's actual merit. Otherwise you will be acting like a narrow-minded bigot, who attacks things simply because they are not like himself. It is a lot more honest, not to mention intelligent, for you to just admit that you don't really like space/alien/action films no matter how good they are....And if you don't like sci-fi films with aliens and action, then you won't like Prometheus because that's what the whole movie is about! And if you don't like that, that doesn't make it a bad movie!If you ARE a fan of space/alien/action movies, please tell me what space/alien/action movies actually do meet your lofty standards? You probably like Alien. Any others? Maybe one or two more? Out of the entire history of film making, probably two or three space/alien/action movies are good enough to satisfy a whining, post-modern, ""nothing is good enough for me"" angst. If this describes you, guess what? You're probably not really a fan of the space/alien/action sub-genre! That's okay, but stop trashing Prometheus simply because you don't enjoy the genre.Some reviews of Prometheus by supposed fans of space/alien/action movies, are picky beyond belief! ""The sunset on the alien world didn't have enough burnt orange in it"", and so on. For real? Is this movie perfect? No, of course not. But what movie is? Trust me, I could pick apart ANY movie if I wanted to, including your personal favorites. No matter how good a movie is, there will be flaws that I can attack. But why??? Is that why we watch films?Is Prometheus as tight and powerful as a stand-alone movie, as Alien was? Maybe not. For one thing, Prometheus is not a stand-alone movie. It's a prequel. It has a mission of explaining the origins of what happened in Alien. That makes it a very different kind of movie than Alien, which was a stand-alone movie. Add to that, as one reviewer said, Alien was a haunted house movie in space. Part of the terrifying mood of Alien comes from being trapped and completely isolated out in the far reaches of interstellar space, with a monster on board who is eating us one by one. Prometheus doesn't have that mood because Prometheus is not that kind of movie. It is much more of an action / adventure / exploration film than Alien was. In tone it is more like Cameron's Aliens, than Alien.Does Prometheus succeed on it's own terms? ABSO-effin'-LUTELY. This movie TOOK ME to an alien world, totally immersed me in it, and then thrust me into a terrifying and fascinating adventure which didn't let up until the closing credits were rolling. I was so mesmerized that I couldn't leave my seat even when I had to pee really badly (let's just say I was glad I was wearing shorts and had an empty cup handy! ;) This movie was so exciting and mesmerizing it really could have been 30 minutes longer in my opinion... When I walked out of the theater I was totally blown away (and yes I brought the cup with me! ;) I was ready to give Ridley Scott a big wet kiss on the mouth and that says a lot since I'm a very straight man. As I walked to my car I noticed at some point that I was repeating the word, ""Epic..... Epic..... Epic...."" to myself over and over. Out loud.I can only pray there is a sequel....To all the smug sci-fi Luddites out there who are trashing this movie, please slink back to your Tarkovskiy films, go watch Primer again, or go dust your Philip K. Dick hardcovers or something. You can congratulate yourselves for being so darn intelligent and special that almost nothing is actually good enough for you.Or better yet, just own it that this movie is not your cup of tea because breathtaking and awesome space/alien/action movies just don't turn you on. Whatever you do, please stop trashing this great movie or they might not make a sequel, and I will be very, very sad...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Different beast,"First of all you shouldn't compare this too much with the original Alien. It is actually a good thing that this is different. I wouldn't like it any other way. The fact that Mr. Damon Lindelof co-wrote the script might be an indicator that you're not going to get all the answers here. On the other hand, it was stated that this might be the beginning of a new trilogy or at least ""saga"".Another thing that has been criticized is the scientific accuracy of the movie. But apart from the fact, that this is another society that might have other values, other standards than we know. Even if not, this is still a movie and things happen in here that are not ""true"" to what we know (especially in genre like Science Fiction!).Onto the positive things. Visually this is more than stunning. Especially the beginning left me wide eyed. That was incredible. You may not like the movie as it is, but can't fault the technical achievements. I liked the acting too and I for once also liked the story. It isn't a genius concept, but it works more than nicely for the movie.One of the most memorable scenes from ""Alien"" gets mirrored here and it has to be seen to be believed. It really has a similar impact. Another kind of beast this is indeed, but it still is a very great one",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Best sci-fi I've seen in awhile,"Just watched it in an Avant-Premiere. Great Scott, well done! For all the comparisons to Alien, Ridley was right when he said it's not the same type of story. I don't think it'll be as iconic as Alien and Aliens 30 years from now, but this movie got me thinking harder than those. The camera work was awesome, the story seemingly had a few holes in it, but since it's dealing with very mysterious subjects, who's to say if they're really holes or just something the movie didn't get around to showing us, since it packs a lot into two hours. The acting and one-liners aren't as memorable as Aliens. Regardless, it's the first time this year that I walked out of the cinema feeling like the movie was worth every penny I paid for the ticket and more.Lastly, I know Hollywood probably can't resist the money to be made in a part 2, but I really hope they do...",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""If you go down there, you're going to die.""","We've long awaited this day after Cameron's ""Aliens"" back in '86. I never really cared for ""Alien 3"", and Resurrection is one I rather enjoyed despite its flaws. Once the AVP films came around the sh*t really hit the fan. Many, including myself, thought the series was dead and buried. However, Ridley Scott himself decided to revisit the series and not only take it back to its roots but in a sense go even further.Allow me to start with the cast; all very well chosen and great characters. Guy Pearce is pretty awesome, Idris Elba is damn good and Charlize Theron is as I expected fantastic. Noomi Rapace is excellent in her role, giving off a Ripley-style aura without going to much into it. She's still very much her own character, symbolized by her faith and ties to religion. There's some sensuality but its never overplayed and never feels out of place. Michael Fassbender is just amazing. I don't fear spoiling he's an android because it's damn obvious not but a few minutes after meeting him. He infuses a lot into his character, a mix of Rachel from Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and HAL from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". His performance simply fascinates, and I leave it at that.After the over-laden crapfest of directors like Paul W.S. Anderson and the Strauss Brothers brought to the series, the effects team brings dignity and dare I say class back to the gore. The creature designs are just stunning and quite sickening. They'll amaze as much as they make your skin crawl. And this movie WILL make your skin crawl. Production value in addition reminds you of the original 1979 ""Alien"" with great spaceship sets as well as eerie planet environments.Best part of this movie is how the story is told. Some of it you'll recognize as trademarks of the sci-fi/horror genre, other aspects are things fanboys like myself have been dreaming about for decades but there's also quite a bit of philosophy and ideology weaved into it all. The origin of man, possible existence of a deity, our purpose in the universe, all are toyed around with in this film. Brilliant move it is, the movie will ask more questions than it answers, not only about the saga but about our race itself.

Vey disappointing,"Really, i don't know how to begin with this review... Maybe i should begin saying that i was very excited about seeing this movie?Or i must say the huge disappointment i felt after the movie ended?I waited for something clever but the only thing i got was plot holes.. OK, it has mystery, nice visual effects, but this doesn't always make a good movie.Moreover, while watching this movie, I was waiting for something to happen and blow my mind... but nothing.

I don't get it,"""Prometheus"" is lucky I'm being so generous. The Film seems to have divided people into two groups. Those that thought it was brilliant. And those who thought it was awful. And sadly I find myself swinging more toward the later. Though I can appreciate it for what it really is.I Was always wary off a flick which started out as a prequel, then changed its mind, and started to describe itself as something altogether ""new."" What's the point off connecting it with ""Alien"" if it's not about ""Alien"" then? Like, really? If its something new then saying its set before ""Alien"" is just a cheap marketing ploy. Too help get noticed what is an otherwise pretty standard science fiction movie.Now I wasn't expecting another ""Alien"" movie like some were. As it was explained ages ago that it wasn't going to be one. But the way it keeps changing its mind about how it is even connected is just irritating. I Will admit too actually kind off enjoying it too a point. But when they manage to get the one part everyone wants too see wrong (The Ending that explains the connection) then the whole thing seems rather pointless.I Will applaud the always great Michael Fassbender in this, admit too it having an altogether unique take on the ""chest burster"" scene, and admit too it overall killing boredom for a couple off hours. But it is no work off genius.Just because its slow and mysterious, doesn't make it the next ""2001."" Sorry!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Don't read the top reviews,"Honestly, I've never seen such a ridiculous amount of bad reviews for a film that doesn't deserve it. A common problem seems to be the character's flaws. It's a bloody sci if film. Exactly how much fun do you think this would be if they were NASA trained scientists? They'd run a light year at the first sight of danger and at least impose instant lockdowns. What kind of story would that make? Plus, these character flaws are evident in all the previous/following Alien films. It's the mistakes that are made which cause the story. I'm not saying this film is flawless, it's really no patch on the first 2 Alien films, but it's a very good sci fi film directed by one of the finest out there. Plus Scott has said numerous times that this shouldn't be treated as a direct prequel.You can't really fault the acting (Fassbender is immense) and the visual aspects are very impressive. I won't give away much of the plot, my phone's stupid keypad is doing my head in, but please don't be put off by the overly critical reviews. These are clearly fanboys wanting the best film ever made. 1/10 is frankly an insult. I really hope the rumours of a further prequel are true, the story definitely needs it.So, basically, not as good as the first 2, but well worth a watch.

A wonder to behold and worth waiting every second...,"Prometheus ~ 9.5 out of 10Breathtaking....... all that I could have wanted and more!Truly a brilliant masterpiece, as much as you'd expect from the original ""Alien"" director himself... Though, who better to seam his film together!! It's even on par or better than Avatar in 3D beauty.Michael Fassbender is outstanding, and the original Dragon with the Tattoo actress Noomi Rapace a very respectable protagonist. Charlize Theron is stunning and Guy Pearce, well.. his acting was great, can't say he is looking much like himself in this one..The pace is just right, and there are scenes that will shock you and actually it's the first film that has given me a fair bit of a fright since, perhaps the originals themselves when I was but a child.It's total picturesque and gorgeous scenery, no doubt contributed to high production value and eye for detail incorporated with seamless CGI and 3D integration (which is quite rare these days). From it's opening to the final shots of the film.. Truly eye opening.I loved it so much, I have issue with one part of it (where I shall minus the .5 from my total score) but that is to do with either how they will proceed, as it relates to the latter films.. if it is indeed meant to proceed along into their path at all..I will be seeing this film again and again..

Don't listen to the overwhelming negative (1-2 star) reviews.,"Just because a movie doesn't meet your every expectation or your ""high-standards"" doesn't make it a bad film. The fault lies with the self entitled fanboys who before watching the movie, decided to think of a storyline they wanted to see. It's sad to think that we live in a time where stories are told to appease the viewer instead of taking them on a journey. I walked into a theater with an open mind and I was happy with what I saw. I see a lot of reviews misinterpret key plot points and perhaps that explains their frustration.Prometheus is well casted with stunning visuals and room for a trilogy if successful.The story starts off a little slow at first but necessary for character development. I think there is an amazing plot to be discovered if given the chance and opportunity through a sequel.Are you left with questions at the end? Yes, it wouldn't be a Scott film if there weren't any unanswered questions. Is it flawless? No, there will be some surprises that you'll figure out before they're revealed.Is this truly a prequel to the movie ""Alien""? Not really.

Your mind will fly if you are an Alien fan,"I'm still reeling from the screening I just got out of. The audience was filled wit big time Alien fans all ready for something that I am sure we've all waited for years to see. For an hour now I've debated doing a video review or a blog, but I'll jot my ideas down here.I enjoyed the experience of Prometheus. It has some great archetypal characters and some astounding action sequences. I really don't want to mention anything about plot, scenes or major beats. but i do want to advise fans of Alien to go see this film. If you've got Ridley Scotts original masterpiece engrained in your head you'll easily be having butterflies in your stomach and zillions of thoughts going through your head. There will be scenes where you are paying extremely close attention to details in every frame, if not for the duration of the entire film. The actors provide a great performance and all serve their roles respectively, if not exceeding their duties. There's loads of throwbacks to the originals, but trust me at not point are they thrown in your face like ""The Thing"" prequel. The one key point I can make is that there are several ""Holy ****"" moments where you will laugh the phrase simply by being overwhelmed with a tremendous circumstance happening on screen, be it horrifyingly scary or simply tense and deep.There's masses of people who just hated the film, thought it was a disappointment or didn't tie up the franchise and the questions.

Thought Experiment,"This movie really takes an aim at a lot of deep things like our fascination with God, creation, human nature and religion. Our protagonist Sarah is a Christian and spends the entire expedition with her futuristic human-like Android questioning everything around her especially when she arrives on a foreign planet with her crew. The android and the pieces of rocks they found are ancient and describe Gods on another planet, this makes the expedition possible. Sarah's faith is unique because she is a scientist who believes firmly in trying to find her creators and the fact she believes in God. When the creatures emerge and the plot thickens the movie intensifies and becomes awesome. With a crew that for the first time in a long time aren't dumb, this is most certainly the best Alien movie since Aliens. Curve your expectations this is a Sci-Fi film about exploration first and a Horror-Action film second, in fact the action was probably the only thing I can criticize about this film. The cinematography was magisterial but given it's Ridley Scott that's not surprising.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Quite impressive...,"I had heard a lot of good things about ""Prometheus"", but also heard equally many bad things. And yes, the movie does have some big shoes to fill out. And now having seen this movie, I somehow fail to see the views and the dismay of the nay-sayers. I found ""Prometheus"" to be a very good movie, and a great way to kick off the series of prequel movies to the original ""Alien"" movie.As in the first ""Alien"" movie, the atmosphere in ""Prometheus"" was really great, lots of super cool details and it really had that surreal alien-like touch to it, thanks to Giger's fantastic design, but also to Ridley Scott's great vision. As for a prequel this early in the universe of the ""Alien"" movies, there was a good amount of references that lets us fans get a look at things that were before and do our own adding up to the franchise's movies. And I am sure that the following movies to ""Prometheus"" will be equally great and add more good stuff to the lore of the ""Alien"" universe.The people cast for the roles were doing great jobs. I especially enjoyed Noomi Rapace (playing Elizabeth Shaw) and Michael Fassbender (playing David); they were really putting on great performances.I really enjoyed all the detail in the movie, I mean, both the alien ship and the human ship was full of great visual effects, both small and big. And they had really managed to build up a believable setting for both ships, giving it a very futuristic appearance (on the human ship) and a very dark, sinister (and very Gigerish) appearance to the alien ship.And speaking of effects, the scene with the acid sprayed on the mask of the environmental suit was just amazing.The creatures were also very nicely made. The concept of the parasite organisms was good and gives room (for obvious) evolution into the creatures that we have come to know from the older movies in the ""Alien"" franchise. Great creature concept and visuals, and they really came off as realistic creatures and also as very alien creatures. As for the 'engineers', that was just mind-boggling, so human and yet so alien. I loved those, and enjoyed the back-story that we came to learn about them in this movie, and hope to get more in the upcoming movies. I remember hearing nay-sayers complaining about the creatures in ""Prometheus"", but come on, it takes place a long time before the original ""Alien"" movie, and like humans have, why wouldn't (or shouldn't) these creature evolve as well?And the storyline in the movie was also nice, although fairly confined in its aspect. But for a starting movie for a series of sequels, it did a good job. And I was thoroughly entertained from start to end.I am a fan of the franchise, and I think that ""Prometheus"" really did a great job on expanding on already well-established lore. It did really give me a sense of closure to stuff from the very first ""Alien"" movie, and I am really excited about seeing the follow-up movies. Ridley Scott really delivered with ""Prometheus"". A well worthy addition to the ""Alien"" franchise, and a definite must watch for fans of the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott revisits Alienverse,"This is a dangerous project for Ridley Scott revisiting one of his classic movies. It could muddy that franchise's good reputation if one could leave the various Alien vs Predator movies out of it. Luckily, it didn't do any major damage. It did raise some questions and hopefully answered others.This time the cast consist of Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron. They all are playing with some dark energy. There is no easy story here. It's filled with complications. There are great call backs to the original. It's compelling even if it's a messy story.Guy Pearce is unrecognizable in his make up. And I think it's the most obvious mistake to cast him in this role. It has an easy solution if he would cast an older actor. Pearce just look fake. There are plenty of older actors around.

"Perhaps the dumbest ""intelligent"" film ever made","I am a fan of Ridley Scott and a fan of the Alien series. I had heard a few negative reviews of the film but was completely unprepared for just how absolutely awful the film was.I am tempted to fill this review with a lengthy spoiler-filled rant picking apart all of the ridiculous story elements but you're probably better off watching the ""Honest Movie Trailer"" for the film instead.It's always painful to watch movies about scientists that were written by people who have no concept of what science is all about. Throughout the entire film it is obvious that the writers have complete contempt for their audience, populating this scientific mission with the stupidest crew in the universe. The writers can then hide their own incompetence behind the incompetence of their moronic characters.Nothing makes sense in this movie. The story is one giant heap of plot contrivances that shouldn't have even made it into a rough first draft. How such a mess could've been made by such talented filmmakers (and actually praised by major critics like Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin) baffles me.

"Attention, fans of 2001: A Space Odyssey...","If you never saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1969), then run yourself silly in a giant hamster wheel for 10 minutes, watch ""2001"", then come back and read this review. 2001 is the one that started them all: those scifi epics that blended spaceships with the ontological questions of existence (and no, ontology has nothing to do with cancer. I looked it up). Kubrick's 2001 spawned an entire genre of film in the same way Darwin spawned an entire genre of science. Notable follow-ups to 2001 include Tarkovsky's ""Solyaris"" (1972) and Soderbergh's remake ""Solaris"" (2002), Robert Wise's ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" (1979), the recent Battlestar Galactica remake (2003-2009) and Ridley Scott's own ""Blade Runner"" (1982)... stories that hit on questions of existence, evolution and the creation of life. Here in ""Prometheus"" we have the latest foray into this small circle of films that blend suspense, philosophy... and big things that zoom through space without making any noise (AS IT SHOULD BE).In 1979 when director Ridley Scott made his groundbreaking ""Alien"", it was apparent that he was stylistically influenced by Kubrick's ""2001"". He presented an ominously cold future full of enormous, sterile machines that reduced humanity down to a flyspeck. And from there he proceeded with a classic existentialist struggle of the human faced with an ominous, overwhelming conflict. Prometheus is visually and stylistically a continuing chapter of the Alien world, and in fact there are plot elements that tie into the Alien story as well (although some of those elements seem to be more gimmicky than substantial... tying this story with the enormously popular Alien franchise). From there we are led into an epic tale that blends good ole ""2001"" philosophy with ""Alien"" action. The question is: how do you prefer your balance between the two?Another important question is: how much can you suspend your disbelief? Granted, all futuristic films require some suspension of disbelief, but in this case there are a few moments when you'll need a 50 story tower crane to suspend your disbelief. Others have covered some of these points in their reviews, so I'll just leave it and assume you can deal with it.Regarding the deeper thematic elements (the meaning of life and all that jazz), here's where I'm speaking to the 2001 fans because I feel that's what ""Prometheus"" initially promises us. Much like 2001, it begins with a cryptic dramatic scene on Earth, eons ago, then soon jumps us to a colossal spacecraft of the future. The message being: this film promises to address the question of our existence by examining our future. But my personal feeling is, following this excellent introduction, the film gradually makes too many compromises for the sake of ""momentum, pacing and time"" (3 words which are used a dozen times in the DVD commentary to excuse the cutting of 37 minutes of film). And ultimately, the film delivers a wild scifi/action/fx ride that will certainly get your heart pumping, but not necessarily your brain cells firing.I definitely recommend this film to scifi/action fans because it has an intelligent premise and manages to blend that with a fast-paced, classic blood & guts action story. But for any 2001 fans who might want more, I strongly urge you to watch the 37 minutes of deleted scenes. With only 1 or 2 exceptions, I think they all should have been part of the movie. Not just to further explain the story (which isn't really necessary) but to add dimension and meaning to the characters, expose what drives them and how it fits into the overall theme of searching for the meaning of life.In particular there are 2 scenes between the captain of the ship ""Janos"" (Idris Elba) and the dragon lady ""Miss Vickers"" (Charlize Theron) which take these two characters out of their 2-dimensional, supporting-character roles and flesh them out as real human beings with internal conflicts and complexities of their own. In the commentary the cut was justified, saying that the scenes unnecessarily took away from the main hero's story. As if we're too stupid to handle a subplot. Other cuts were similarly justified for plot momentum (sanctioned by Ridley Scott himself, so we can't even blame some dumb corporate suit for butchering a masterpiece), and you soon understand that it was not Ridley Scott's intention to go so far into 2001 territory as it was to stay true to the ""Alien"" space horror formula.And on that note, I felt a bit cheated because the formula in the 2nd half was almost identical to Alien, almost scene-for-scene toward the end, and I feel like it didn't offer anything above and beyond the original masterpiece. Noomi Rapace is an excellent actress, but she didn't quite fit the tough-as-nails Sigourney Weaver role that she was evidently expected to emulate.Perhaps an unintended highlight of the film was the performance of Michael Fassbender as ""David"", an unusual character whose secret I won't ruin though it's revealed in the opening minutes. Fassbender was easily 50% of the reason why I liked this movie.In the end I enjoyed ""Prometheus"" as I think every scifi movie fan will. But part of me felt let down because of what it could have been. I felt most cheated by the filmmakers' self-admitted compromises for the sake of moving the story along at a brisk pace. But at the same time, nobody can deny how majestic the visuals are, certainly the best scifi special effects I've seen in a long time, and the action succeeded in getting my pulse pounding twice as fast. ""Prometheus"" does make a very powerful, original statement. So yes, go see it. And maybe in a few years we'll get the ""Prometheus full extended cut redux"", or whatever it'll be called, for those of us who can take 37 minutes more. One way or another, I think this film is a step in the right direction for scifi.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
goofball,"The story itself doesn't follow up and is completely goofed up. Is this supposed to be a prequel....i heard someone said its not a prequel and then it is a prequel..A very decent film but a failing plot. Actors are a fraction of the other films in the franchise...... The ending where the ""superhuman"" comes to the pod to kill Noomi rapace, a proto-facehugger shows up....born of Noomi herself with no correlation in form nor appearance just seems ridiculous as far as accuracy is concerned. the logic of how the crew of Nostromo finds this derelict spacecraft with the superhuman with its helmet on with its chest busted and transmitting a WARNING signal into deep space .......doesn't quite fit in.How does Noomi perform caesarean section on herself in that surgical pod seems amazing but then looking like a million bucks and running and screaming all over the place.........duh!By indication my guess is that the superhuman and the spacecraft are at least 2000 years old once they conduct a carbon dating, give and take 200 years before Alien-1Im assuming how did the Nostromo guys not be able to fire this craft up in the firstplace..... This movie doesn't justify that....In this film The crew were a bunch of dud's with idiocy lurking amidst. With absolute no common sense, everything is left to technology. Very predictable. No amount of human sharpness and ability to scrutinize can ever be compromised ..... this is clearly shown in Alien with Ian Holm's character as an android. It is clearly confused and nobody will ever trust ""him"". How do the crew of prometheus trust a droid with homosexual tendencies!? How does he spike Logan's drink with that bug. How does Logan-Marshall greene turn into an alcoholic at some edge of the universe? Immaturity at its finest.In the end after doing everything Shaw and David take off to another place in some other star system to ask these super-humans why they made humans on earth and some other questions.....operating the derelict spacecraft with the help of David ......just seems flamboyantly outrageous.At the end of it all id like to than Mr. Ridley Scott for resurrecting the franchise.

Ridley the Riddler,"From reviews I have read to my own experience watching this movie, I gather there are two distinct groups within the audience. In other words, this is a 'love it' or 'hate it' movie. Like it or not, its either 'yes or no' with only a minority stuck in between. I for one find myself within this minority.Borrowing from Greek mythology where demigod Prometheus was venerated by ancient Greeks in their quest for scientific progression, but feared as an idol of overindulgence and unforeseen consequences, director Ridley Scott's narration finds itself within a very similar paradigm. Conceptually, the film and its core message is the same as being told to be cautious when wishing for something to happen or materialize. It shares the same mythical philosophy as when Pandora opened the box, or biblically, when Adam in his greed for knowledge, ate from the forbidden tree. Set in 2089, it is within this premise where a group of scientists connect the dots to reveal a star map that interprets an invitation to the origins of mankind. We are first introduced to the android David (Michael Fassbender) as he monitors the flight path of the USS Prometheus, travelling at the speed of light. Mission director Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), followed by archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) awake from a state of stasis hibernation, just as Prometheus approaches orbital range of their destination – LV223. After touching down near a monolithic structure, Shaw leads a team of explores in search of clues for alien life forms. As the tagline suggests, what they find not only jeopardizes the safety of the crew, but the entire human race.Like Fox Mulder of ""The X Files"", I wanted to believe. If James Cameron has vested considerable time and money into exploring mysteries of the deepest oceans, I wanted to believe Ridley Scott was on a similar quest, but in the opposite direction. This was probably due to the immense hype made possible through word of mouth alone, and all before the official worldwide premier. We knew Scott was working on something so big, it had every prospect of becoming his masterpiece, not to mention him standing shoulder to shoulder with titans like Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and Peter Jackson. Sadly, and for obvious yet unbelievable reasons, ""Prometheus"" will always remain Scott's big catch that got away before the haul in. From my experience, it was like watching two very different movies. The first hour is a phenomenal piece of cinematic creation with fantastic visuals, ground breaking art direction, captivating atmosphere, and a mysterious story that boldly places us on the verge of THE biggest discovery since mankind learnt the use of fire. What happens during the second hour is a real shame if you ask me, considering Scott's nuance behind the groundbreaking ""Blade Runner"" (1982). The culprit is a fractured script that goes from phenomenal to ludicrous, thanks to the literary creativity (or lack of) of Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof. It is all the more annoying because this film blasts off to a brilliant start, and then out of nowhere, falls out of the sky because it only had half a tank of fuel to begin with. Then there are the astounding questions asked that never receive a plausible answer. This can be frustrating for certain sections of the audience but leaving those questions open-ended also makes the film intriguing but only for a few questions that are attempted with an answer. Ultimately, the final blow comes in the genre-altering second half, changing the story from sci-fi mystery to predictable sci-fi horror, and somewhere in between throws at the audience the notion that scientists, astronauts, and intellectuals of similar caliber lack basic common sense.In all its worth, Fassbender is just about the only actor to look forward to as the calm yet eerie android, who ironically has more soul than most other characters. Rapace comes in at a close second, but given the built-in trend of all the ""Alien"" movies where a female protagonist uses every ounce of strength and courage to survive, Sigourney Weaver remains my favorite alien butt kicker of all time.As a bold and visually stunning narration that tries to answer some of the questions that have been haunting mankind since we discovered the presence of celestial bodies, Scott can be credited with the overall aesthetics of this film. However, in staying true to the genre, this is not the best we have seen from the legend that is Ridley Scott.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What?,Ok so I love this film. Maybe because it's freaking awesome. Now Alien on the other hand was just more of a horror film for me maybe I was too young to grasp the plot???idk. I am seeing the way a lot of people are commenting about the comparison and I get it was supposed to be the prequel I just feel the people who are making these types of comparisons are the ones that like the 1930s Frankenstein and ish the ones comparing the original Dune to the Zendaya one Like don't come with old school mindsets for new school awesomeness. In my opinion this movie is a hundred times different it's an amazing production how can any science fiction lover not like this movie and how can anyone really stick to the whole Aliens earlier films which again was more horror and gore. I just always figured Aliens was more a scary picture than sci-fi movie. I am going to watch the alien films again and make my judgment then but who can really say Prometheus isn't one of thee top science fiction movies ever hands down one of the greats in my book when I watched Prometheus the first time I never got the connection and it's better and I have been waiting for the more of it for far too long.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Good imagery, plot holes, and poor character development","Although I enjoyed this movie a lot, I have to say there were many flaws from it.NO SPOILERSThere were many general plot holes and impractical situations. There was confusion when it came to the antagonist, in that it was difficult to distinguish who was the antagonist and their motives.There seemed to be lots behind Noomi Rapace's character (Elizabeth Shaw) however, because of the scripting and plot almost none of it was gone into detail, which could have added appeal of her character. Elizabeth Shaw's death of her mother, relationship with god and science, and inability to have children could have gone into further detail. MIchael Fassbender's character (, who wasn't supposed to show emotion, sometimes showed emotion which was contradictory. Charlize Theron's character (Meredith Vickers) added almost nothing to the plot. If she was removed from the movie there would be little to no change in the overall movie. Overall the character development was poor and should have been more of a focus of the movieThe graphics were incredible, the landscape and set was superb, that was probably the most consistently good part of the movie.For the acting, I have seen Noomi Rapace in several other films such as the entire Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Series (Swedish versions), and Babycall and I feel that she is an incredible actress. I feel she was not given enough background information about her characters and was not given a very good script to express her character. Noomi did what she could with what she was given for her character and I think she did a good job. Michael Fassbender, did a good job acting like a robot. He was plain and unemotional to the point of creepiness, which I believe was the desired affect. He did a fine job with his acting also. Charlize Theron did a good job however wasn't a very significant character throughout the movie. She did a good job with what she was supposed to do which was act cold. The supporting crew members were completely forgettable and added very little to the movie as a wholeThe two standout performances in this movie were Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender.Noomi Rapace performs the best scene in which she acts desperately, and in severe pain. She makes her pain come alive and vivid for the viewersThis movie could have been very good with a little extra character development and less plot holes, however it did not live up to the hype",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""B"" Movie Ridley","Never thought I would say it about Scott, but once you take the special effects away what you are left with is a really, really poor ""B"" movie. Poor in imagination, poor in dialog, poor in science and poor in execution.The gaping holes in the plot cannot be filled by even the best Blarney you may hear from the likes of Lindenhof. Fassbender, an actor who I have a tremendous amount of respect for and is probably the best actor of his generation, did a lot of Scott arse kissing in the marketing lead up to this movie... well, it is was all for naught, his head ends up in a bag in a scene reminiscent of a really bad school play.Great talent is lost through complacency. Let's hope Scott can find his Mojo and stop believing his own hype... starting with a better script would be an idea.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It's actually not as bad as all the uptight reviewers make out!,"So, just watched this again as I just felt like it on a rainy bank holiday afternoon...Have just read a few reviews and a couple things to note:1) the majority of reviewers have no idea what the 1-10 scoring system means. Let's assume we are talking about cars. A ""1"" would be a car that rarely started, wobbled all over the road, nothing worked, could not drive up hills, barely made 30mph and was shocking quality. A car that was in all effect totally unusable. A ""10"" is almost unobtainable. It is the perfect car in every way. Awesome performance, efficiency, quality and reliability. Everything is perfectly designed and has every option currently available - all for a reasonable price. There is no better car available. Every other car is in the scale - and to be fair, most live in the 5-7 range. Usuable, but flawed in some way. To rate a film ""1"" or even ""10"" is impossible. Even particularly bad B movies with terrible plots, effects and scripts are still only a 2 or 3.To label this film as s 1 is ridiculous. It is flawed, and there are some pacing issues, and not Ed bough depth given characters, but a ""1""??!! Come on, it's perfectly watchable and even though most reviewers feel that they can only offer a 1,5 or 10, it really doesn't deserve to be thrown in the bin like that. If I have to be honest, a 6 or 7 is perfectly right.2) stop comparing it to Alien. The original was a Good film, but not perfect either. It did well with a limited budget and technology available, but there was room for improvement. At best, I would give Aliens a 8, but they'd mainly for originality and working with the limitations of the era. You don't need to compare this film with the original. There are a lot of similarities to the plot, and both sets of characters are flawed and make mistakes. The key antagonist is very similar to a character in Aliens, although the build up is much more subtle. Always review a film on its own merits. On this basis, a ""1"" would be obtuse.I have watched this film twice now, and although I would change a few things, it's perfectly watchable as I said earlier. More character development would have been better, though all the character mistakes such as removing helmets and other actions are spot on. They are not hardened experts. If this are a film about Tier 1 seal operators, I would expect them to be perfect in their actions. But this film contains a collection of mercenaries and subject experts that make irrational and illogical mistakes, just like you and me.If you don't like creature features or science fiction, don't watch it. If you want to watch a film that about those chasing their dreams, only to find something else, then watch this film.Just don' pay any attention to the reviews giving it a 1 and making it sound like a 1 legged centipede trying to bake a cake using only nails. 😎It has issues, but give it a chance!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This film strangely works better when revisited...,"On first viewing I gave this film a begrudging 5/10. It is visually stunning, the larger than life engineers stuck in my mind and I wouid think about them from time to time. This would prompt me to rent Prometheus every couple of years and watch it again. I realised on the third viewing that my initial disappointment was because Scott hadn't made the Alien related film that I wanted to see... it didn't answer any questions that were promised in trailers and advertising blurb so I felt let down. He did however make a good film that is atmospheric, energetic and above all entertaining. This review is based on my third viewing and I really liked it, I wasn't hampered by what I wanted anymore. I allowed for plot holes, various errors in continuity and suspended disbelief, the result was a most enjoyable and much needed escape from reality for a not too long 2 1/2 hours. Oh... and... yes the tall engineers still haunt my mind 😊",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Scott delivers,"Ridley Scott is back in the Sc-fi genre and he really hasn't lost his edge. Prometheus completely fulfilled my expectations and more.The movie started and from the first 30 seconds I was gripped. I didn't check my watch once for the running time or to see how long was left. I was truly gripped to the screen.as soon as the the film starts its really story building on story building on story. This movie really doesn't have a lull at any point. I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise but I went in to this film unbiased and I wanted to give this film a fair review. As soon as the film starts, it couldn't be further away from an Alien movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I found the plot to be truly gripping and I couldn't wait for the next scene to unfold. This is easily the best film I have seen so far this year and I felt it did have a unique feel to it. The actors were very well chosen apart from perhaps Guy Pearce. I felt his character could have had more screen time and his story could have been more rounded. At times the film was creepy but this is definitely not a horror movie. It has the perfect blend of sci-fi, action and a tiny bit of horror and gore but it's not overly done and it works well with the tone of the movie. The 3D aspect works incredibly well. At times I felt like this wasn't a 3D movie and then something subtle in the depth of the screen would catch my eye and I think this is where 3D works best.Prometheus is a fantastic movie and yes I do wish the connection to the first Alien movie was a little more prominent but there is enough here to really answer a lot of questions and open up new ones.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This film should be mandatory viewing in all film schools,"This is a great example of bad editing. I have read a lot of the reviews here and I agree with most of them. But its not the script that is the problem. It is clearly the lack of editing prowess. This film was undoubtedly much longer and was hacked down to allow for more theater play. Chopping a film for view-time happens to all films we see. The original Alien had something like 4 hours of footage that was reduced, with total mastery by Terry Rawlings, down to its theater run time. I have seen directors cuts from most of Scott's films and they are bad. Scott seems to overshoot and expect somehow to be saved by his editors. This time he f'd up bad. His editors obliterated plot, character development, and pacing. What is being shown in theaters now is basically a two hour movie trailer for the next film????? Perhaps a directors cut will contain the whole bit. If you are a fan of Scott's Alien and Bladerunner you are really a fan of Terry Rawlings. A good editor makes a film look like more while showing less. A bad editor can take the best story and turn it into nonsense. - Not that Prometheus was the best story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Why do people not like this?,"I thought it was very good. Although I had not previously seen any of the Alien films, I still expected much from this because of how successful those films were and how Prometheus was hyped up. So maybe people who really loved the Alien films had this too much hyped up and when they saw it, thought it was worse than it actually is.Now, I have to say, on no account is it a masterpiece. But it is a very enjoyable, well thought piece of cinema that is worth watching more than once. The visual effects were amazing, as were the sets. And the 3D was very good.The acting was terrific from all of them, especially Fassbender, who I assume will be soon getting into bigger and better films with Shame and this.By the ending I assume they will make a sequel, which I look forward to and I will be first in line to watch it. A very good film. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Technically very good but the rest...,"Why Ridley Scott didn't use his great talent to make just a sci-fi movie instead of complicating the plot by putting its characters on a search of the origins of mankind which is a goal that would demand a philosophic and metaphysical depth that goes far beyond the scope of this kind of movie? The result is that the movie story has some gaps and illogical unexplained features that diminish its impact and chooses a simple answer to a difficult question. Besides the usual implausible scenes that we always take for granted in a sci-fi movie because of its fanciful nature this movie exaggerates on that field with some incredible scenes like the one of the mechanical surgery for instance. However this movie is one of the best ever made in technical terms. The images, sceneries and landscapes are really overwhelming and appalling and the sound track is fabulous stressing the visual effects in a prodigious way with a music that enhances the general atmosphere of the movie in a remarkable way. And the action is also overpowering indeed. So if you privilege those visual features in this kind of movies this is a good film for you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

it grows on you,"After my first very negative review (I only gave one) and nearly one week after viewing the film I think I was wrong to be so negative. As I try to explain below.I had an open mind before going to see this film, I did not expect or associate it with Alien. I looked at it purely on its own merits.I realize now why my initial dislike of the film was based on its story. Anyone who has read Twelfth Planet (Earth Chronicles)by Zechar Sitchin would understand its not easy reading how we came about and how our creators view us. So I realize that for some people they may not like the film not because its a bad film but it does not fit comfortably with their hopes and beliefs. If this is deliberate by the script writer then it is far more clever and deeper than I realized.However the script is the biggest let down. More holes to fill a black hole. If this film had a better script it probably would have been one of the best science fiction films of all time. There are two very particular holes that made me want to hate the film and believe I had wasted 2 hours of my life and nearly £10 ($15).But the strange thing is apart from the script the film is haunting, it does create an alien world, it does create a believable Robot (Oscar worthy acting), it does create a spaceship landing on another planet, for the special effects, for the cinematography, for the Directing it is exceptional, beautiful and believable.Edit: just bought the DVD and watched it again, its worth it just to watch Michael Fassbender as the Robot, I hope he gets a supporting actor nomination in the Oscars. He deserves to win it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great sci-fi movie,"While it may not be as great as the original Alien movie, this movie is getting a ridiculously bad reputation. I think many people went into the theaters with the wrong expectations. This isn't a horror film or an action movie, it's a science fiction film with some thrills thrown in. I love the feel, tone, and colors used in Prometheus, along with the awesome CGI.People can complain about plot holes or bad scriptwriting, but I don't see this as the case. In my opinion, the best sci-fi movies are the ones that leave their questions unanswered and their plot holes unexplained. Imagine if Kubrick had tried to explain 2001. Or for a more modern twist, what if Looper had attempted to fix it's paradoxes... These movies would have lost their fun.There are several things that still upset me about this movie, but what I do know was that this is the only film in a long time that I felt the need to go out and buy on DVD. This is a movie that you really have to go watch with an open mind.At this point, I would like to note something. It's impossible for me to believe that people actually think this was a 1-star movie. There are thousands of worse movies. Don't review because you didn't think it was worth the hype. Don't review because you need to 'balance out the score.' Review the movie based on how good it was. Just because it isn't what you thought it would be or isn't what you wanted doesn't mean it was a 1-star movie. Don't believe all of the user reviews.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Rammed full of lunacy.,"Well I liked it.Despite the characters frequently deciding to act in a completely illogical fashion; despite the massive plot holes; despite Guy Pearce's dodgy makeup; despite Logan Marshall- Green's character being an absolute bellend; despite all this, and the fact it'll never even come close to matching up to the 1979 original (one of my favourite films of all time) I liked it.It's partly the visual aspect - it does look tremendous. I also really rated Marc Streitenfeld's magnificent score.But most of all, I think I just enjoyed how many batshit crazy ideas Ridley Scott and his writers managed to cram into it. A lot of other films would have had me throwing my hands up in despair, but I just went with this one and I'm glad that I did.Always good to see Benedict Wong on screen, and a rare instance of Idris Elba not being in The Wire and not being completely rubbish.Verdict: Treat it like a massive-budget Grindhouse movie and you'll be fine.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Being a minority all my life ( At least, opinion-wise ) I'm going to sit on the fence here. There's no denying the plot is a teensy bit daft, and the trouble-in-space plot has been done to death.But director Ridley Scott is a dab hand at these sort of cosmic shenanigans, and here again he injects excitement and intrigue into a scenario which could have been deathly dull. Watch out for some truly vile creatures too... If we ever get invaded by some of these beasties, remind me to evacuate the planet. It's a bit overlong too, but fans of the Aliens film...

This was a good movie,"I was a little stunned at some of the other reviews to be honest.The film is not that bad at all, not as bad as some are making it out to be. I am not a religious follower of the Alien films, in fact, never much liked them to be honest.However, I thought this film was good. The story was just right, too many films these days rely on high action scenes which seem to almost dominate movies. I thought there was a good focus on the story itself. Not to mention, the CGI was pretty amazing.I would certainly like to see a second movie on from this.And just to add, also amazed at how serious and literal some people are. It is a FILM for goodness sake. Are we really saying all films need to be accurate or plausible? Seriously? I couldn't give two hoots about how in reality something could never happen etc, or whether someone stumbled around half cut open for too long.

Ambitious implications but that's it,"Incredibly dense with its themes and philosophy that range from intelligent and ambitious, to ridiculous and on the nose. At the same time, it packs all this in a lacklustre script that cares more about what it implies than what is there. The narrative is solely focused on this being a film that needs to be seen with a lot of knowledge about a lot of things instead of saying anything on its own, which is not always a bad thing, but when the dialogues and characters also fail to be solid that really becomes an issue. This is a beautiful convoluted mess. I don't think a longer cut with more explanations could really save it because it's that much indulgent on its own hubris, ironically. Both the positives and negatives of this movie are undeniably the core of what this movie is, that I have to really really admire what it tried to do but can't say it's really good but can't call it bad either. It's a very interesting movie that warrants a lot of discussion if nothing else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

It's not Alien!,"As a self-confessed Alien fan boy I've found it difficult to put down some unbiased thoughts around Prometheus. After the first viewing I was disappointed, I was expecting a direct Alien prequel and this isn't it. The film was better second time as I could leave all my preconceived ideas behind and enjoy it for what it is. There are some good performances (particularly Michael Fassbender), some great set-pieces and for the thinkers it proposes some answers to the big questions: who are we and where did we come from. That's not to say the film is without its flaws, it has plot holes (what doesn't?), can be clumsy in its delivery and at points to fast paced.

ALIEN's aware folks: half spoiled,"the original ""ALIEN"" contains not only the better script and originality in all characters, and is topped w/ sci-fi substance, and suspenseful and climactic ending. This ""Prometheus"" title bears nothing exotic that promises effects of thrill, creativeness coupled with clarity in terms of the script, or portent of any cinematographic virtuoso, and this lack of imaginativeness can be seen in the non-communicative aspect of the film in terms of its non-unified sequence/scenario amounting to a non-climax that would fail to captivate the viewers the same way the 20-year past movie did; that is, the ""ALIEN"" masterpiece this title tries to imitate. If you enjoyed (or are half-spoiled with) the original ""Alien"", be prepared or get ready to lower your expectations, as this film will disappoint, except for one bright spot played by the main character; and even this character does not achieve much in leaving the viewer with lingering (positive) effects when the viewer is walking out of the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Sure, it's not Alien but what heck is this?","To start with, this movie isn't all that bad. The graphics are exceptional, the movie starts in an interesting way, Michael Fassbender is really good as David and so on.The movie itself leaves you with more questions than answers, there are a couple of interesting twists and turns but the movie doesn't elaborate any of them. Instead there are lots of dead ends which leaves you wondering what could have happened. I asked myself lots of times ""why did he/she do this and that?"" or ""why did this happen?"". Noomi Rapace looks like Ellen Ripley but is far from the same quality actor that Sigourney Weaver was in the Alien movies. She is NOT believable as Elizabeth Shaw.This movie makes me really sad because I had high expectations and was expecting a movie that would blow me away but instead I saw this mediocre ""horror"" movie. Where is the horror in this movie? I was looking for the horror but couldn't find it. Sure, there are some scenes that children shouldn't see but other than that, horror movie? Right...This movie doesn't deserve 7,7 rating, it's more a 6.0 movie at most. Someone said in a review that this movie gets better the second time. Come on! Am I supposed to see this movie twice to like. I don't think so! If you have to see a movie twice in order to like it then something is really wrong.If you are expecting to see a movie that you will remember long after then go and see some other movie.

"With Flaws, But Still Worth Watching","A movie that could have been better, but it's not that bad, especially when you watch it more than once.There are some flaws, some of the actions of the characters are illogical and border on nonsense, thus lowering the overall impression of the story.We follow the crew of the Prometheus as they try to reach the destination of their journey and solve the mystery of humanity's existence.The special effects are excellent, and the film itself is superbly directed. The script is flawed, but overall the whole movie isn't that bad, the only thing is that it doesn't really give us some of the answers we were hoping for. It's certainly better than its sequel, Alien: Covenant.The cast is solid, Michael Fassbender is excellent as David, the android who helps the crew. His character is actually frightening and sinister, which we see in his actions. Michael Fassbender is perhaps the most interesting character in the film, and sometimes it seems that he is actually the backbone of the whole story.Noomi Rapace plays Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist who finds ancient drawings and concludes that they are a map.The problem in the film is the incredibly careless reactions of some characters who are supposed to be scientists, meaning they should have basic intelligence and a drive for self-preservation, and in the film they do some truly incomprehensible actions.The film is visually great, starting with the depiction of the environment and the technique itself, the creatures look interesting and terrifying.Indeed, the film could have been better, but still, even with all these flaws it is worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I Was Wrong... It Was So Wrong...,"I was wrong... It was so wrong... to think that Prometheus might be a hidden gem that will reveal more of its treasure on repeated viewings. Because watching it again only refreshed my memory of what disappointed me two years back. Is it really a prequel to Alien or is it a standalone feature that shares only strands of DNA with that horror masterpiece? As it turns out, there is still no definite answer to this question.Set in the late 21st century & taking place in the same universe as other films of Alien franchise, Prometheus concerns a team of explorers who discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth in the form of a star map & embark on a journey to meet their makers. But what they actually end up discovering is a threat that could lead to the annihilation of entire human race on planet Earth.The movie opens with some breathtaking shots of landscapes that you generally expect in a Terrence Malick film & from then on it's a journey downwards as it neither scares nor thrills. Directed by Ridley Scott, it's heartbreaking to find him ruining the very universe which guaranteed him a spot in film history and although he plays with many themes in the story, not one of them is executed properly.The screenplay is an utter nonsense as the plot is full of loopholes and even though it raises some pretty good questions through its thematic elements, it never answers any of it & provides an excuse of an unnecessary sequel as a cover up for its lazy script. Cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, Editing could've chopped so much here, music hardly contributed anything. but Visual effects is pretty impressive & wonderfully detailed.Coming to the acting department, the entire cast of Prometheus delivers a forgettable performance with only Fassbender & Rapace managing to impress in bits n pieces. Other than a handful of characters who didn't do much anyway, the rest are present as death fodders only & there isn't one moment that made me care about any of these dull people's lives. Even the creatures aren't scary or intriguing by any means, damn it.On an overall scale, Prometheus isn't just a disappointing feature but is badly filmed too as almost nothing works in its favour & this wasn't expected from the director who defined this very genre with his 1979 masterpiece. The only consolation comes from its visuals but that's also useless when you don't have an engaging story to back it up. Ridley Scott's movies either work big or fail big. And Prometheus, unfortunately, belongs to the latter.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A Visually Stunning Exercise in Wonder and Terror,"Prequels are always a dicey proposition, as director Ridley Scott discovered with his recent take on Robin Hood. This is especially when there is only the most tenuous connection to the original. But he's beaten the odds this time around. Not since Close Encounters has a science fiction movie filled with such wonder as Prometheus, and not since the original Alien has one filled me with such terror. And few movies from any genre have ever given me so much to ponder.The wonder of this film comes from the first half. It begins the moment we first lay eyes on the barren world. I do not know where these scenes were shot, but I know that if it is a real place that I must go there someday. Rarely has such utter desolation ever held such magnificence as these craggy vistas and bleak flats. And the sense of wonderment (with an undercurrent of dread) only grows with each development. The discovery of breathable atmosphere inside the tunnels. The holograms that David the android activates. The perfectly preserved, 2000 year old body of a humanoid alien before a great door. And especially the room that lies beyond.The crew thought it was a tomb. I thought it was an Ark, a repository to hold the species' genetic information for their future revival. We were both terribly wrong. It's here that the sense of wonder begins to mix with one dread, one that only grows as in an alien necropsy scene that for me evoked spine tingling memories of a near identical sequence in Howard Hawks' seminal The Thing from Another World. And then the real terror begins, because something is alive, something worse than any of them ever imagined. And like the original, every time you think it's over, it's not. There is always another horror.Noomi Rapace deserves only the highest praise for her performance, and for even agreeing to this role. The ordeals she- and her character- endures in Prometheus are beyond even what she went through in Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Ripley had it easy by comparison. She may have been trapped alone in space with one of the universes deadliest predators, but she never experienced a violation on the order of what Doctor - Shaw suffers. Many observers have commented on how the Alien from the previous films is basically a metaphor for rape. Prometheus takes it a step further- though thankfully not in the way that first comes to mind. Still, it is hard to overstate how disturbing parts are. This is not a film for the faint of heart.A far different effect comes from watching David (Michael Fassbender), the first character seen aboard ship, and who looks far too gorgeous to be true. And indeed he is. He's an android, a fact that is made clear to everyone very early on. His beauty and obvious intelligence are captivating, even charming. But at the same time there's an almost paradoxical sense that he's too perfect. And it's clear that he knows more about the mission than he's sharing. In some ways, mainly his total lack of emotion, he reminds me of HAL 9000. Yet he still manages to come off as more human than Miss Vickers (Charlize Theron) the mission's commander. She is an absolute ice queen, aloof, condescending, impeccable in speech and manners, and supremely self confident and in control- in short, a cast iron B. She is every bit David's equals in the looks department, and there is some question among the crew as to whether she might be an android as well.Nor is it only the people who are beautiful. Besides the barren plains and mountains mentioned before, there's the Prometheus itself. Far from the cramped, darkened corridors and ducts of the tug in the original Alien, the Prometheus's interiors are gleaming white. The early scenes in which David roams the ship alone to the accompaniment of classical music are a clear homage to Kubrick's 2001, one that contrasts markedly with the ugliness to come. And nowhere is this film more beautiful, more enigmatic, or more like 2001 than in the breathtaking pre-title sequence in which we first lay eyes upon what I call the Alabaster Man. It may produce utter bafflement at first, but once understood, this scene is as magical as any ever put on film.Then there are the questions: the questions of our origins and purpose which the scientists seek the answers too, and which mankind has asked itself for as long as we have existed. And the true genius of Prometheus is that it does not provide a complete answer. For one thing, any answer it gave would ring hollow, and lack any weight outside the context of this film, resting as it does on the idea that we came from aliens. But more importantly, within the world of the film, the partial answers raise even more pressing questions, ones that we may not want to know the answers to.People will see this movie to be scared. They will be scared, and they will be awed. But more than the terror or the wonder it creates, it is the imagination and inquisitiveness it displays that makes Prometheus a work of art, and a truly great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
too high expectations?,"Well, Im one of those that has the opinion that the original Alien was far the best (having watched a lot of those debates were people were arguing about Alien vs Aliens). I loved the atmosphere, characters and the tense that built up throughout the movie. It was really really superb. After having watched Prometheus I became some kind of frustrated, how can something that is made so beautiful leave you with so little thrill? Yes Prometheus is incredibly beautiful, Im really amazed on that part. But sadly, that was the only thing that amazed me in a positive way. The characters in this movie are completely non-interesting, David with a few exceptions now and then. And even then David joins the rest of the crew on the train that in my world is called ""non realistic characters"". Sadly Prometheus are filled with characters that you get to know so little about that you don't care for them at all. The actions of the characters often makes very little sense. In that way I didn't find them believing. Thats one big minus for the movie in my opinion. Another thing I didn't find in the movie, was some tense scenes that could put me to the edge of my seat. I hate to admit it, but even Alien Resurrection had that. But that was also a thing Prometheus did not deliver.So watch this movie for the art of the cinematography.

"Flawed, but spellbinding","I was fortunate enough to grab seats to see Prometheus in IMAX 3D at the Metrocentre in Gateshead for the opening midnight screening last night.This is the first feature film I have seen in IMAX 3D, and I should start by saying that the 3D was actually a lot less obtrusive than in other recent releases films. It may not have added much to the experience, it didn't bother me either. From a technical aspect this is one of the best Sci-Fi films I have seen in a long time, with stunning visuals many of which were shot in stark, earthly landscapes such as Iceland and the Isle of Skye, but which both Ridley Scott and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski manage to make seem brilliantly ethereal and extraterrestrial. All other technical aspects of the film are wonderful.As far as the story, script and acting goes, most initial reviews that I have read seem incredibly divided, but I was largely impressed. I think Rapace and Fassbender were both highly commendable in their respective roles as the curious, eager scientist with a strong survival instinct and the mild-mannered, mysterious and yet unpredictable and slightly sinister android. Theron and Elba are satisfying in their roles as the icy corporate overseer and droll ship's captain, but the rest of the cast were largely forgettable as cannon fodder. While it certainly lacks the characterisation and naturalistic feel which Alien had, I believe the two films set out to achieve very different things and do them very well; Alien was a much more low-key, personal thriller which focused on character development to create tension, whereas Prometheus focuses on grandeur and spectacle to create awe and adventure. From a story point of view, there are a couple of moments which retrospectively don't make sense, but I found most of these easy to overlook at the time and they really don't bother me too much.I would also go so far as to say that Prometheus works better as a horror film than Alien did; Alien never repulsed me especially as I knew what was coming due to heavy exposure, but the horror in Prometheus, while strongly reminiscent of the subliminal themes of sex, fear of pregnancy and rape which were strongly implied in Alien (albeit shown in a more overt way in this film), was done in a fresh and surprisingly disturbing way which did repulse me, and I don't say that very often about horror films. I feel that the horror in Alien, while iconic, is not nearly as agonising as it is in Prometheus, as the characters suffer for a short period of time in Alien.Finally from a philosophical point of view, many have complained that Prometheus raises more questions than it does answer them. I think it, along with a little prior knowledge of the Alien franchise and what Scott originally intended it to be, allows the viewer to construct their own thoughts and conclusions whilst leaving a little open for debate and contemplation should another film be created. For instance, the question which keeps coming up is ""why?"". Well I have my own answers which I was able to make based on what I saw and what I already knew had been speculated about the origins of the Space Jokeys and the mythology of the Alien franchise in general. Furthermore, as a fan of the original Alien, I felt extremely satisfied by how they tied in a lot of the elements to the original film, and am willing to see how Scott chooses to expand on this story, as there are lot of ways it can be done.On the whole, not a film for everyone, and it will divide opinions, but I really liked it. Is it as groundbreaking as Bladerunner or Alien or any of the classic Sci-Fi epics? No, but I do think that it will be remembered as one of the best Sci-Fi films of its time, and easily as Scott's best film since Gladiator. I gave it 9/10 initially due to the sheer enormity and breathtaking beauty of the world which Scott created. Having had time to ponder some of the flaws, which are evident but did not bother me as much as in other films, I will give it 8/10 (maybe 8.5 if I'm feeling generous), but I would still highly recommend it and put it in the list of best films of 2012 (so far).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

all good writers still on strike???,"I'll start with a disclaimer: I've always been a big fan of science fiction, loved first two (even first three) Alien installments etc. Also I believe visuals matters -movies are a form of visual art after all. So I really looked forward seeing Prometheus. Sci-Fi, thriller, Ridley Scott, big bucks, modern CGI technologies – nothing could go wrong, right? Wrong! I will not go into details (many other commentators already did that), but there are countless plot holes of every size and form! It was only about 5 minutes into the movie, when the first MAN-WHATTA-HELL-WAS-THAT? happened. OK, to cut it short – it appears to me that all good writers in Hollywood have moved to making movie COMMERCIALS instead of movies itself (the best part in attending a movie theater is commercials, have you noticed that?). What is wrong with great directors, good actors that they are accepting such shitty screenplays? Money and production deadlines are the answer, I know that. But it's so sad, isn't it I rated the movie 6 because of visuals.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Visually amazing, but...","I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers who noted the visual impact of Prometheus. Truly it's a beautiful, eye-popping movie to watch. The scenery is just immense and the CGI work on the backgrounds - the terrain, ship, and even some of the creatures - is outstanding. However, as a movie I left feeling let down. In thinking about it, my disappointment stems from three main problems:1) Character development (or lack thereof rather). Of the 17 characters in the movie - yep...SEVENTEEN folks to keep track of - I really felt that I only got to know (and consequently cared about) three. Noomi Rapace's Dr. Elizabeth Shaw is pretty much the focal point of the movie and is probably on screen 60 - 70 percent of the time. Thus, as an viewer I got to know her and mostly care about her as a character. Similarly, Michael Fassbender's David is on screen about the same amount of time and I really got a sense of him and his perspective on things. While he may or may not be a character the audience cares about, you definitely get to know him. And I must admit, Fassbender's performance was great as far as I'm concerned. He was really enjoyable to watch. Lastly there was Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers is provided ample screen time, to say nothing of key character development scenes to get to know her. Further, these three characters actually behave logically for their characters, so it seems that their development was thought out. Of the other 14 characters, I can remember 4 of their names, but they were given so little development and any motivation for their presence that I just didn't care about them. I was thinking about this in contrast to the 7 characters in the movie Alien - of which Prometheus is loosely related - and even after some 40 years I can remember each and every character from that movie - their names, their roles, their personalities, etc. I cared about those characters, and when they had problems or died, the movie had impact. In Prometheus, that impact was not there for me. Forget any problems with alien lifeforms or alien planet weather or things like that - I didn't even really get on board with why they were going to an alien world to begin with.2 Which brings me to a related issue - Character motivation. I always love the comedic play on the clichéd actor's angsty ""yeah, but what's my character's motivation?"", but the fact is decent writers and directors making decent movies usually do provide actors with some guidance in this area so said actors can...you know...indicate to us, the audience, that their characters do, in fact, care about what they are doing. Again, I got that from Dr. Shaw, David, and Vickers, and to good extent Dr. Shaw's Partner Dr. Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) and some from Peter Wayland (Guy Pierce). The one person I was really expecting this from was the ship Captain Janek (Idris Elba), but all I got was 'eh...I fly the damn ship'. Heck...I kind of thought that maybe I'd see some enthusiasm and wonder from the two other ""scientists"" - geologist Fifield and biologist Millburn, but not so much. The scare quotes around scientist, BTW, is to denote that as far as their presence and actions went, they really appeared to be scientists-in-title only.3) Which brings to the last point - story scope. Good stories, at least to me, focus on some particular plot element. In most cases, really good stories - and by association really good movies - can be boiled down to one sentence synopses. Alien is pretty much ""alien life form gets on a ship and crew find they are in jeopardy if they don't get it off"". I can't come up with one for Prometheus. I really feel it's scope was way too large for the story. As others have noted, this was a movie made specifically to be part of a larger framework - at least a sequel and probably a trilogy. That said, I felt overwhelmed by the number of elements that the movie was trying to get across. The meaning of life, immortality, the punishment by the gods, the meaning of being human, evolution vs creation, religion vs science, do androids dream of electronic sheep, the desire to create and destroy...it's all packed in there. And it's tough to unravel a story from all those threads, let along care about said story with all that going on. Basically I just found it too cluttered with all these messages and by the time the alien life forms show up, it's hard to fit them into the context.I will throw in one other note. Not so much a criticism, but just a let down based on expectation. I really thought this was supposed to be a scary movie and it really wasn't for me. And I mean at all. It certainly had some disturbing scenes and some gore, but there was no ""haunted-house"" spook factor. No startles what-so-ever as far as I'm concerned. Alien, Aliens, Alien Cubed, and Alien: Resurrection and even the Alien vs Predator movies all made attempts to have jack-the-box startling moments - admittedly some more successfully than others - so I was expecting that kind of scare tactic in Prometheus. Not so much. There were some decent gruesome moments, but overall this was more an adventure movie than a horror-scary movie for me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Retarded Film,"Few words: This is one of the most incoherent pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen, with the laziest execution of writing, the most ambitious special effects (which are the only good thing about the film), and a visual masturbation from Ridley Scott, trying to feed us mystery and ""answers"" to the great questions of the universe. A failed attempt that only works on minds drugged by their love to the ""Alien"" series or people who don't really think much. Riddley Scott was trying to make an epic space horror film, touching on deep subjects of human nature. Acting is good, it's amazing that they were able to say the lines that most of the time make no sense, either the actors trusted that Riddley Scott wasn't retarded or they really just wanted to get paid and go home. Did no one on the set ever say: ""Mr, Scott, I respect you but this script makes absolutely no sense and we are being extremely retarded and incoherent""",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"By Scott, It's Undewhelming...Again!","It certainly looks the business, all beautifully composed sleek shiny surfaces and rugged epic landscapes. Unfortunately Prometheus is dull and flat in terms script and of direction, as the majority of Scott's films are. That's not to say he can't deliver, he can, but there are more passable Ridley Scott films than visionary ones - to be fair, most directors never once deliver a film that changes the cinematic landscape while RS can lay claim to at least two, even if they were a chunk of time ago.Prometheus is set in the same universe as Alien but it's not a direct prequel. If the Alien franchise is about the alien, in all its variations, and how humans tried to deal with it - badly - then Prometheus is about us humans. All the talk about the alien is a sideshow, it's not central to the film, and arguably the film might have been a lot more interesting if it didn't feel the need to deal with the creature.But it does. And not in a satisfying way.Instead of being one thing or the other, the film stumbles about and falls flat on its face. It asks the big searching questions about who we are during the first half, and in the second half it decides they don't really matter when all you're doing is trying to survive. Which is what happens when you potter off into the vast unknown in search of something with nothing but belief to defend yourself.Alien was wound tight in terms of its minimalism, a handful of actors confined to a small place faced with a dangerous alien. Aliens took it up a notch and swapped hidden terrors for relentless battle action. Both films were strung out on tension, with the humans under siege and in danger of being wiped out.The problem for Prometheus is that it's not tight enough to have the elegant simplicity of Alien, nor relentless enough to pull you along in a rush of excitement like Aliens. The characters and dialogue are mostly inept and shallow, there's simply too many people who have no purpose other than to be bland, mumble something inane and die. Not one character is as memorable as the crew of Alien or Aliens.Fassbender's David is fine (Bishop was better), Rapace's Shaw is fine (Ripley was better), Theron's Vickers is fine (Burke was better), Elba's Janeck is fine (Dallas was better), and that's the problem: everything's okay up to a point, a bit above average in terms of surface gloss and celebrity heads, but with nothing that really stands out as being clever or memorable (aside from the youtube virals that preceded it). Even the few 'gory' bits are uninspired and lackluster and CGI meh - herself was completely comfortable with what was served up and she gets tense watching Harry Potter.That it's that safe (being not in the least bit scary/thrilling) and that dumb (with a plot that leaks like a sieve when any logic is thrown at it) is hugely disappointing. That's a big problem for a franchise that once traded on thrills and spills.6/10 is being generous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable,"It may not be perfect but Prometheus still is an engaging sci-fi flick that comes with a mix of mystery, science, horror and some notable solid performances.Director Ridley Scott tells a story that dealt with the search for answers regarding the origin of humanity and similar to his 1979 classic Alien, Prometheus has a star ship and a crew with a mission. At the same time, the famed director made great use of the technology and with his technical team delivering great cinematography, striking effects and most of all a great sense of immersion into the story.The first half of the film had a strong sci-fi exploration flavor in it laced with mystery. In the second half, the tone changes into suspense, horror and shock all delivered in a fine pace. Along the way, there are lots of elements that connect Prometheus with Alien and for sure the nerds or the more observant moviegoers will have a blast connecting the dots.The casting is a mixed bag although it is somewhat justified by the time the film ends. Sure there were crew members who are pretty shallow and not worth caring for. Of course, the more notable roles such as David (Michael Fassbender), protagonist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) somewhat made up for the lack of depth from the others.Noomi Rapace delivered a fine performance as a strong-willed woman who not only searched for answers but also came up with the courage to survive against tremendous odds ala Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in Alien.Charlize Theron is excellent as the beautiful but very cold-hearted Meredith Vickers, and for the most part her presence attracted a feeling of animosity from the viewers. Still, there is also that feeling that before you want to get rid of Vickers, you also would want to know what she knows, what she is after and more.Michael Fassbender, in my view, stole the show as the android David. He is no copycat of Ash (Alien) or Bishop (Aliens) but rather he stands out as an android that not only tirelessly works to accomplish his goals but also learn about humanity as well as the search for answers on the galactic level. Quite symbolically, David is very much like a living, walking version of HAL (2001: A Space Odyssey) as well as a more sophisticated version of Star Trek: TNG's Data.Will Prometheus end up as a timeless classic like Alien? That is something we won't find out until decades to come. No box office numbers or any wave of media reviews will be able to justify that because clearly only time will tell if Prometheus will be remembered whether as an indirect prequel to Alien or as its own sci-fi story.In my honest opinion, Prometheus is a very solid sci-fi flick on its own and definitely it is one of Ridley Scott's best films in a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
disappointing,"After reading all of the other reviews I'm not going to add in detail to the exhaustive list of plot foibles of which there are many. Whilst this movie would be passable in it's own right I am saddened by the way it's linked into the aliens universe. The dead host alien in Aliens turns out to just be a big human dude in a suit which clearly wasn't the case in Aliens and I might be mistaken but didn't they use it's skull in one of the predator movies? And Aliens are created from this big humans biological weaponry??? Really???? Adding an alien in the last 5 seconds was a pretty weak link. The visuals were stunning the plot was poor the characters were as in both the two AVP movies bland and alien fodder non of which do you empathise with at any point. Fass was awesome and Theron was great and is stunning as always but most of the characters couldn't die fast enough the 3d (I have to confess this was my first 3d movie in a theatre) was stunning inside the ship everything popped out everywhere else it felt a bit lack luster and for me the story just detracted from the Aliens universe. As a HUGE aliens fan as a stand alone movie this is worth a look as a aliens movie it's not good.Alien - awesome Aliens - AWESOME Alien 3 - it grows on you Alien 4 - tat a poor rip off of 2 the only thing worth watching is Ripleys basketball shot Predator - awesome Predator 2 - OK Avp - complete tat Avp2 - more tat Predators - great movie Promethues - so so, although the visuals are very slick",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"To be honest, I still like this one a lot.","A friend of mine wanted to revisit this tonight, and I hadn't seen it since it was in cinemas, so I thought why not? I remembered really liking Prometheus warts and all (and some people really hone in on those warts), and 10+ years later, I feel the same.There are some dopey moments, but to me, these are fairy minor distractions overall, rather than movie-killing. If some dumb characters doing a couple of dumb things ruins a movie for you... hey, maybe it's ruined a movie before for me, too. But not Prometheus; not for me at least. All the stuff this movie does right keeps my mind away from the dumb stuff. I can concede its frustrating moments (inconsistent helmet-wearing, touching the scary space snake for no reason, etc) keep Prometheus away from perfection, but everything else about this is kind of great.This is a gorgeous looking movie. All the technical qualities are stunning. CGI and practical effects are blended so well throughout. So much of the film feels real and visceral to me, and all the sci-fi designs are cool and unique. Set design and production values? Superb stuff to this day. I think it's also paced well and has an intriguing premise with moments of action, wonder, horror, and mystery spread generously throughout a two-hour-runtime that's never really boring.I also appreciate how this ties into Alien very well without just feeling like a retread of Alien. It goes for something different tonally, narratively, and also sort of thematically, and many of the risks pay off for me. I still find myself liking Prometheus a lot, and believe some people get too hung up on the flaws without appreciating all the stuff this does right. It's just a stunning looking and sounding film, it's entertaining, and the story has some genuine intrigue, plus there's a sense of awe and true exploration you don't often get to experience on this scale in sci-fi movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I Bet the Science Adviser Asked for an Alias,"Prometheus (2:04, R, Imax, 3-D) — 6 — SF, biggie, originalPrometheus is solid science fiction riddled with mushy science. These are just the blunders I bothered to note: A tracking shot of the night sky used 3-D effects to show some stars nearer than others. At interstellar distances, no parallax would be evident. The 6-circle pattern the archeologists recognize from a variety of ancient drawings all over Earth was not of a distant star system but of a distant PLANETARY system, as if the planets were always in the exact same spatial relationship to each other. The atmosphere on the surface of the world our team is exploring supposedly has too high a density of carbon dioxide to breathe safely, but once they go DOWN into a cave, it magically disappears. But CO2 is 54% denser than air; if anything, it would be MORE concentrated the deeper you go. By the same token, if it really were well below zero (whether Celsius or Fahrenheit) as reported, you wouldn't have running water, and you WOULD be able to see your breath.Here are some additional improbabilities that aren't exactly unscientific but don't really make any sense: The crew has been kept in suspended hibernation for the 2-year journey, except for David (Michael Fassbender), the android counterpart to HAL 9000. After they're revived, they're briefed on what to expect. There's no reason the briefing couldn't have been conducted BEFORE they departed, when some serious questions could have been raised about what to be prepared for when there was still a chance TO prepare. The non-aerodynamic starship Prometheus arrives over its target world and just heads on in, without conducting a preliminary mapping survey from orbit. There is no obvious or stated need for haste. The captain (Idris Elba's Janek) makes everyone else sit down and strap in, but he himself stands without support behind a big metal railing looking out a big shatterable window smack dab in the front of the ship. The chain of command of the 17-person crew is horribly screwed up, with a captain, a pair of archeologists (Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw and Logan Marshall-Green's Charlie Holloway), and a company woman (Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers) each nominally in charge. This too would have been cleared up before departure by any sane planner. The equivalent of the Colonial Marines are more like street thugs and perform poorly under stress. Really? A planetful of mercenaries to choose from for this trillion-dollar expedition, and this is the best they could come up with? It's 2093, and we have a European scientific team quoting inches. INCHES! Upon discovering the unaccountably low CO2 levels, this team of ""scientists"" decides it's OK to remove their helmets, because after all, what could possibly go wrong if the air is breathable? Equipped with anti-gravity laser mapping spheres and navigational beacons that can transmit thru mountains, 2 team members wander off and manage to get lost in the tunnels of the cliff-like ""pyramid"" they're exploring. They drag this dessicated head of a space alien back to the ship to perform an autopsy on it, and who gets to do it? The doctor? No. The biologist? Nope. It's the archaeologist! Way to put together a team, guys! A woman is impregnated and gives birth via C-section less than 12 hours later to something that looks like it runs a good 5 kilos. Its sole source of that material was her body, so she should be exceedingly debilitated, to say nothing of having been sliced open and summarily stapled shut. Yet she performs like a trouper for the next hour. I will cut the aliens some slack over their unaccountable preference for lumps, bumps, ridges, wrinkles, corrugations, and protuberances in their architecture. It doesn't make any sense from an engineering standpoint, but hey, they're ALIENS! And here's a final hint. If you're fleeing desperately from a giant rolling wheel, do not run directly away from it. Run crosswise to its path. Idiots!The acting here is horribly mannered. I was hoping for just ONE naturalistic moment like the famous ""Game over, man! Game over!"" that Bill Paxton reportedly ad-libbed in Aliens (which was set in the same universe about 80 years later), but no: Stiff and stilted is the order of the day.What, then, all downers? Not in the other departments. The production design is fantastic in both senses. The story is gargantuan in scope. There are moments of genuine suspense and heroism, believably depicted. There are at least 2 layers of mystery, cunningly resolved. There is a fall and redemption. There is another fall that just keeps going. Corporate greed is pitted against superstition and religion, a battle which I liken to vampires vs. werewolves vs. zombies, in that I hope they all lose, and for the most part they do. There was effective use of 3-D in the opening waterfall scene, in the long slow glide over the monochrome wasteland of the distant moon (actually Iceland), in the thrashing tentacles of one of the bit players, and especially in the holographic maps that showed the progress of the exploratory team.Sadly, these genuine accomplishments don't suffice to make me overlook the one-dimensional performances and the many incongruities and improbabilities — ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED if the writers (Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof) had consulted a decent science adviser. Or even me.I had high hopes for this film. Director Ridley Scott, after all, gave us Alien and Blade Runner, plus the non-genre films American Gangster, Black Hawk Down, and Thelma & Louise, so we know he's got greatness in him.

"Great cinematography, decent acting, mediocre character design, extremely flawed story line","First of all, cinematography was excellent. Scott implemented the same typical design as he did in the alien series.Overall, the acting was alright, not great, alright. Especially Michael Fassbender shines in his role of an android with its own agenda. I found character development throughout the movie to be flawed. Especially the character played by Charlize Theron. She plays the daughter of a rich entrepreneur: a physically tough, cold hearted woman desperately to fulfill the role of the son her father never had. However, despite her harshness and tough manners, she easily beds the captain of the ship halfway through the movie, and also her demise at the end of the movie leaves questions as to what her purpose in this film really was. Other than David, an intelligent parallel to the struggle between mankind and its creator(s), the rest of the characters consist of archetypal tough guys, scientist and fools and do not add much to the movie. The storyline, to my opinion, is extremely flawed and leaves the watcher with lots of questions: In the opening scene, an 'engineer' drinks a substance after which his body falls apart. Did he sacrifice himself on purpose to create life on earth? Also, the star system depicted by the several different cultures, why did they all point to an 'engineer' military outpost that was purposed to wipe out humanity? Why does the Fifield character gets lost in the complex whilst he has 'pups' that had just mapped the complex entirely? Why do some of the infected ones become raging zombies and why do aliens larvae explode from the bellies of others? And lastly, the operating scene: very, unrealistic, anatomically incorrect and over the top.All in all, I was disappointed in a movie that had great potential.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Scott's disaster,"Just saw the movie in Geneva. A real disaster. I expected something that would surpass the other Alien movies specifically Scott's first masterpiece.

There are many clichés borrowed from the other alien movies to make the viewer more comfortable. But getting lost in the story from the first scene, reason for the creation of humanity and science versus religion theme, till the last,is inevitable.I got the feeling that its write as you shoot movie.

An ambitious effort that didn't quite work in places...,"OK So yeah, this was a film that I must admit; I've been literally dying to see ever since I heard the name ""Prometheus"" being whispered around in quiet corners of the movie world. Ridley Scott is a director in the heavy weight division and his films have stood the test of time And of course, Alien and Aliens (the others are not even worth mentioning!) have attained legendary status among most sci-fi fans so, it was with great anticipation when I finally got to see this filmOK The Good As is the case these days with modern films chock full with special effects, the CGI, visuals and camera shots were all very impressive. It is quite simply, a visual treat and, some of the more gory bits may leave some of you with a weak disposition to watch those scenes firmly behind your trembling hands!The tension was simply no where near as intense as Alien or Aliens. Sure, there was some tension but, given the 15 age rating you could sense that they had to play some of that down.The acting? Well Nothing special. This was a bit of a shame!

A few good wise cracks from some of the supporting cast but, nothing notable comes to mind considering I just watched the film just over an hour ago. In short, the dialogue, acting, wise cracks etc was simply no where near that found in Aliens.The story? Well now, this is when things got messy Without giving anything away just be prepared to get very confused in places! You will go away from this film with a LOT of unanswered questions. Perhaps too many. But then, Ridley is obviously trying to whet our appetites for more upcoming films and boy, he's left a crap load of loose ends to tie up! So, take this point as you will Is leaving the movie theatre with more questions than answers a good thing? Then you're in for a treat. Otherwise you will get frustrated period or get frustrated waiting for the next instalment(s).There were a couple of very weak twists in the story which the astute amongst you will quickly work out in no time. So, apart from the premise of this film with regards to the Big Question, it's totally non-taxing on the brain Well It IS the 21st century after all!Personally, it would have been nice to have gotten some concrete answers but I guess Ridley hasn't quite finished with us yet!The action? Not much. And what was there was a bit silly in certain places. You want action? Stick with Aliens!OK So in a nutshell, no this film is NOT Alien or Aliens. In some ways it's not even close. Not necessarily a bad thing but then one has to ask, is it a good film on its own merits? Well here it's a very mixed bag. Some things simply just didn't work, unless Ridley intends to resolve such matters in later films. So perhaps some patience is required. Some will undoubtedly pour scorn on this and some will be eager for more films I think this is pretty much where the battle lines for fans and trolls of this movie alike will be drawn over the next few months. However, overall, not a bad film but it's not great either Assuming that Ridley gets his wish to make more films, I guess we will all have to simply wait and see how this new take on the Alien franchise will play out.But it has to be said I for one am intrigued!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Amazing prequel that stays true to the mythology and still goes in its unique direction.,"This is a great movie that serves as the perfect prequel to the Alien series of movies. What stands out about this one is that it goes beyond just the mythology surrounding Alien and the xenomorphs, beyond just the CG effects, the jump-shots and action pieces, and asks some real interesting questions. It is rare that you see a movie that has enough references to its predecessors while still managing to be a unique story in itself.Great work by the director, Ridley Scott, as well as the actors involved, especially Noomi Rapace. Can't wait for the sequel! P.S.: Given that the story mostly revolves around Christian theories concerning creation, as well as the fact that it takes its own direction independent of the preceding movies, I don't find it surprising that it has invoked a ""Love it or Hate it"" reaction in most people.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Forgettable,"I love the Alien franchise. When I heard about Prometheus around 6 months ago I had been waiting in anticipation ever since to see how it fared against the original.... 'Alien' is a classic. Great cast, great spread of character personas and just has a feel of quality. Prometheus lacked memorable characters, in fact they were drab to say the Least. The story had me excited in the beginning especially being one with lots of questions about humanities past and civilizations pre history but the more the story unwound the more I felt disappointed. I honestly feel it was poorly written and the score lacked creativity and passion. It could have been a masterpiece......yet I feel it was designed to be more of an introduction to a new separate cluster of alien films....more of an entrée than a full course meal and in that give it the benefit of the doubt.......you know those films where you watch 2 hours and think ' a lot of nothing really happened' ? It could have been condensed into a 1 hour TV episode...... I'm going to see this film again to see if it was just my frame of mind on that particular day, or if I hyped this movie up too much in my own mind but as it stands it didn't live up to what it could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A fascinating sci-fi exploration of the 'Alien' universe,"A return to the ""Alien"" universe from the man who originally envisioned it? Hard not to sign up for that adventure, even knowing that ""Prometheus"" appears to be quite far from an ""Alien"" movie. This film dares to ask bigger questions about creation and the purpose of life while thrusting us into an un-fathomable sci-fi mystery rather than a moody horror opera set in space. Yet for every way it is different, ""Prometheus"" also feels like director Ridley Scott's homage to his own work, as if he too was fascinated with the lore he helped create.""Prometheus"" begins with the slow unraveling of a world that despite the irony of phrase, feels vaguely familiar with all kinds of technology, stasis pods and the on-foot exploration of an unknown planet. The film completely propels itself on fascination, hoping that its audience has a strong scientific curiosity and a nose for wonder and imagination. The impact of ""Lost"" writer Damon Lindelof on the script is apparent, as with more knowledge comes more questions, questions that sometimes get in the way of themes and character building, but never stop awing.The Prometheus (the ship) expedition is essentially launched on a hunch. Scientists and archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient drawings of a giant man pointing to a star cluster in ancient civilizations all over the world that couldn't possibly be connected unless they referred to a creator. They believe a race of ""Engineers"" live on this planet (a moon, specifically), LV-223. Dying billionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) funded their quest in hopes of unlocking the greatest discovery in human history.Unlike the Nostromo, Prometheus has a much larger crew, so there are many more stories to focus on and people to care about. In addition to Shaw and Holloway, there's the ship captain (Idris Elba), the resident android, David (Michael Fassbender), and Weyland Industries overseer Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) among others. As they explore the pyramid-like structure they've discovered it becomes clear that there are multiple agendas going on here, which anyone who's seen ""Alien"" would be prone to suspect.The scope and scale of ""Prometheus"" and the way that this world is silently explored at the beginning echoes ""Alien"" rather closely, except that rather than narrow into a story of a dangerous alien on board a ship, the scope of ""Prometheus"" only continues to grow, with questions mounting on how these films — 33 years apart — ultimately connect. The answers are more exciting than profound, but the tension makes the ride worthwhile.Like Ripley, it's not until the final act that Shaw truly emerges as the main character we want to root for. From start to finish, it's really David who fascinates the most. Fassbender gives another brilliant performance. His obvious hidden agenda complicates his character in our eyes, and for his cold and calculating manner, there's still a creepy amount of internal processing going on. You get the sense that things interest him, that he's driven by the same quest for knowledge of his human counterparts, and it makes him eerily human. He is, in a sense, a microcosm of the greater idea at play of mankind meeting his maker, as he is a creation of his peers, who look for answers about their creation. There's a brilliant exchange between him and Holloway about how we create because we can — no other reason — yet as a sentient creation, it's a maddening explanation for existence.""Prometheus"" should age well with these questions, as repeat viewings will eliminate the seemingly endless quest to figure out what's going on and temper the abundant flaunting of production design and visual effects that can at times disorient the viewer. Without those distractions, the script's brighter moments and thoughts will shine through much more.There are no chinks, however, in the visual spectacle that is ""Prometheus."" Everything is so believable, pristine and fascinating. Whereas ""Alien"" left so much to the imagination, ""Prometheus"" just keeps feeding it, and that's the fundamental difference in the film as far as tone and genre. ""Prometheus"" goes into much more high-concept science fiction whereas ""Alien"" is predominantly horror. As such, those who loved ""Alien"" for its horror qualities will likely be the group most disappointed by ""Prometheus."" Both films, however, contain lasting and memorable visual imagery.Why so much comparison between the films? Well, ""Prometheus"" invites it. After all, the letters of the title appear line by line almost exactly as they did in '79, first thing in the film. You can call it ""Alien DNA"" if you like (based on comments made by Scott and Lindelof), but story-wise it's truly a prequel as it sets up/provides and explanation for the beginning of ""Alien."" The reason Scott and Lindelof have avoided the direct nature of the word ""prequel"" is because of the tonal difference in their film and how ""Prometheus"" is driven by different (and much bigger) questions.It seems that over the last three decades, Scott's curiosity about the universe he and H.R. Giger designed in 1979 only grew. Rather than return to the ""Alien"" world to re-invoke the moody and atmospheric tone, he returned to it in hopes of expounding upon the lore that he had left so wide open with the fallen ship and the Space Jockey.Pardon me for going way meta right now, but Scott's journey back is for similar reasons to the characters of this film: a desire to understand its origins. His results are not all that different from their discoveries either, as ""Prometheus"" is striking, daunting, tense and messy, yet the prevailing drive of it all is a never-ending fascination.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Typically flawed and over hyped but enjoyable nonetheless.,"So I saw the long awaited ""Prometheus"" tonight. Overall, rather good, but the characters annoyingly and jarringly flaunted so many basic health and safety regulations regarding potential contamination, infection, quarantine and exposure to physical injury from not wearing adequate safety equipment in an unfamiliar extra-terrestrial environment etc. Maybe we're just supposed to be careless or stupid in about 80 years' time. Tsk! Also, while not being pro-god or creationist as such, it did kind of take a dump on Darwinism and the role of evolution in our existence.Being in 3D was fairly pointless. I even had to check that it was by taking the glasses off. It was, but barely noticeable.Gorgeous sets and imagery, but I wasn't too happy about what the Engineers or ""Space Jockeys"" look like under their bio-mechanical suits.It was plagued by thoroughly unbelievable and rather unprofessional characters as well. Dumb scientists and ship crew lacking the professional integrity you'd expect from a trillion dollar mission. Oh, and the old Weyland guy was a bit rubbish. Just Guy Pearce with lame prosthetic wrinkles. How about using an actual old man actor with an actual old bone structure? He stuck out like a sore thumb. Anyway, I have to pick fault, but it's very much worth a watch and most people aren't as picky as me I guess.I still wish they'd stop making films as if we're all dumb 15 yr old kids without any real intelligence though. And it should have been purposely made to be an 18 certificate (in the UK at least).",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Disappointed,"While not a disaster, it was hard to view this ambitious attempt to expand the Alien universe as anything but a disappointment.And maybe it was the ambition itself that this movie tripped over. Trying to juggle too many themes, too many characters (doing amaterishly stupid things in order to move the plot along), even too many monsters without clear and focused connections, it just ended up feeling muddled and disjointed. Characters that you would have liked to get to know, only get a handful of lines. Situations that should have been built up and slowly dragged out to pump up the tension, are instead rushed over. Then other scenes are flashed to that look silly and cheap. Along the way most of the menace and wonder that should have been dripping from a movie like this was just lost, and that was just brutally disappointing. Every 15 minutes or so there would be a shot, an idea, an action that by itself was cool, but more often than not it was brushed over and forgotten about, or simply misplayed if not. Even the creatures created from the ubiquitous black goo felt like they were lacking in menace and imagination. Its very disappointing that we have seen similar creature work before in far less ambitious movies over the years.As for the big mysteries that people complain this movie raised but did not answer, that did not bother me nearly so much as the mysteries which WERE revealed. The entire Alien universe, which started out so dark and frightening, felt like it was lessened by this movie. The awe of the engineers has been stripped. The curtain was pulled back from what lurks out there in the dark of space, and what lurks behind it just isn't terribly scary after all. They say what scares you in a good horror film is the stuff you DON'T see. Well I think the same thing applied to this movie -- it was the unknown terrors of a hostile universe that tickled the imagination in Alien. Frightening questions that would make you never want to leave home or set foot on an alien planet again. Here our very stupid scientists pop their helmets off to smell the air like they're on vacation, and get to reveal far far too many of the Engineers' secrets, and with the mystery goes the fear.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What i expected!,"The Prometheus was exactly what i expected. A set of answers. My expectations we're not an action movie with intense terror or evil, but a search of issues that i've always kept along the Alien saga. However, a set of responses, but also new issues with the touch of suspicion for movie sequel. Apart from the flaws of the casting (apart from the Elba, Fassbender and Harris that should have been more used), the fact of not knowing if I do not like Shaw or i like Rippley too much, and too many cut scenes that should have appeared (come on DVD, i see them all), my opinion after this film is as follows: if you not an Alien fan, do not see Prometheus, it makes no sense. If you are an fan, remember that this is no battle to overcome the first Alien, because it is impossible to overcome a masterpiece. And if you see, get answers, delight with the set, ask for Ridley Scott to bring a second Prometheus with the errors corrected, and more sets even more spectacular, and then go see the first Alien because masterpieces are to be reviewed whenever possible and never forget. And quoting David: How far would you go to get your answers?",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not bad but.... I expected something better,"I went last night to watch this movie with a lot of excitement. It was from the ALien universe with its original director.The good?: from the beginning you notice the photography and specially the music. Overall, production is top! With planets like that, you wanna be a space cowboy and go into the adventure. Also the acting is quite good, specially the main characters. You don't get to know or care a lot for the others in other hand. The movie also rises questions: who are we? who created us? which is good to have a chat after the movie with your friends.What I did not like?: Somehow the scrip gets rushed in the second half, with some unlikely situations and things seem to happen very fast in the last minutes, as if they ran out of time and had to end it up quickly!Sadly maybe, it's not ALIEN, and it shows. But let's you understand quite a lot about what we already know about that movie. I'm not sure that this movie will cause the same impression in others like ALIEN caused. For me, ALIEN changed the way I felt about movies and still today is one of the best movies I have ever seen and remains as one of my favourites.At the end you spend a fun time, enjoying the trip to another world and feeling amazed with the incredible views of the movie.Mi rating is 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

#53,"This film serves as a prequel to the Alien franchise and follows the crew of the Prometheus as they journey to a distant moon, led by religious scientist Elizabeth Shaw and her supportive yet skeptical partner, Charlie Holloway, in search of answers about the origins of life and their creators, known as Engineers. However, as crew members start dying and they come face-to-face with the Engineers and their deadly new creations, they quickly realize that some questions are better left unanswered. Now, they must prevent these horrors from reaching Earth and wiping out the human race. Overall, due to an absolutely star-studded cast, visually stunning backdrops, brutal kills, and a compelling story, this movie was an excellent addition to this series, and even though it runs a little slow at times and is very different than the other installments in this universe, I thoroughly enjoyed it and love how it expands upon the sagas lore and its profound conversations about faith and the human condition, make it much more than just some silly Alien film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A really Smart and Unique Sci-Fi Movie,"This is a really smart iteration of the Alien universe from the man who created it all.

It is tied to the Alien universe, but it is also a stand alone of epic proportions. This movie involves the exploration of space to seek the origins of mankind. This mission in the spaceship Prometheus follows a series of maps found on Earth that creates a mysterious link between Eartha and Space and man and his creator. It is visually stunning.

"First it was boring ,re watched then it was interesting","Prequels: a film category exuding potential – the putty is there to be molded, but with whose questionable capacity? (2007's Hannibal Rising is almost taking up too much of this word count to even mention. Ugh.) In our case, Ridley Scott returned to the helm and constructed a horror odyssey, impressive in its scale and energy, in the universe of the Aliens series, but removed from its original story (for now let's just overlook 2017's Alien: Covenant).Scott's Alien (1977, first in the series) is an obvious classic and still slickly stunning, so maybe you didn't see Prometheus because, like, why would he mess with that? Or worse, you did see it, but endured the company of a snobby franchise fanboy whose criticisms pummeled into your own psyche, skewing your perception of what is, in reality, sci-fi horror gold.So watch it, or re-watch it, but this time really drink in all of those lustrous special effects, meditate a bit on those worthy themes, and maybe even make notes because if you're ever going to have to perform an alien abortion on yourself this may serve as your only reference.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Could be a masterpiece but it is not...,"The search for our creator(s) is an eternal agony for human race. Film tries to give an answer by introducing us those giant size ""mechanics"" that are mentioned in many human mythologies. Film is starting well (although some of Prometheus crew seem a little bit ridiculous) with an epic approach. Technically is very well made. Effects are of the first class and actors are quite convincing in their roles. What makes this film not a masterpiece is the unsuitable high pace and the immature idea of extraterrestrial monsters that are being used as a ""hi-tech"" weapon. I don't like the idea of a human female getting pregnant by an alien monster and I also don't like the idea of having a kind of abortion all alone and being almost ready to fight just after 10 minutes.

The story is interesting and compelling and the action is consistently intense and riveting.It poses larger questions, too, and grapples with themes such as creation versus destruction, and selfishness versus sacrifice. In questioning why the Engineers chose to create then destroy, one has to ask themselves why us humans do the same thing.So many movies of this same type suffer from bad visuals, a bad cast, or bad writing.

Prometheus. Are you Really Seeing This? Laughing.,"'Had heard so many bad things about this one but when I got the chance to watch it last night, I didn't look away. After all, at the very least it has Noomi Rapace and Charlize Theron. Anyway, five minutes after the opening sequence I decided that it was going to be a comedy, you know, the so-bad-it's-good type. After that about the first 40 minutes were so dull that I found myself dozing off at times. The 'comedy' takes over after that as the film leaps from one cliché to another, one idiotic situation to another until the very end. The caricatures, I mean 'characters' are mind-numbingly stupid. While their actions already support that, even the dialogues are incredibly dreadful (but they do provide some good much-needed comic relief, unintentionally of course). I doubt the actors can be blamed at all especially when they're given such horrendous material to work with. 'Prometheus' has no depth at all and that would have been okay if it was trying to be a cheesy sci-fi horror but that isn't the case here. The score is abysmal and creates an atmosphere of melodrama as if dictating how the viewer should feel. The special effects are okay. I wouldn't say Ridley Scott is among the best directors but in my humble opinion, this is amongst his worst. On the positive side, it's visually detailed and looks 'realistic'.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It's cool... but it hurts,"Here it is. The long awaited prequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece Alien is finally here. But the question on everyone's minds is, is Prometheus really a prequel in the way we would have all hoped. The answer... not exactly. It definitively puts a backstory on some of the unexplained aspects of Alien (ie Space Jockey) but all in all Prometheus is its own story. It tells the story of a group of scientists who venture into space to discover where all human life and creation began. They hope to find all the answers to civilization, but instead they find something much more incriminating and far more dangerous than they expected. The story is full of twists and turns, and it opens the doors for many new ventures into the Alien universe. Prometheus is essentially a prequel to Alien with its setting up of how the events in Alien came to be, but the main focus of the film's plot is its own original idea that is more or less inspired by what Ridley Scott put together back in 1979.As far as this original plot goes, it's nothing groundbreaking. It's not much more than what we've seen before, but it still manages to be intriguing and engaging, as well as a whole lot of fun. The verbose storyline here makes for a winding tale of chilling adventure that is equal parts cool and creepy. There's a lot going on here, some of it Alien related, some of it not. The new story developing here is nothing extraordinary, but it will certainly keep you entertained.Now, when you begin to look at Prometheus as the prequel to Alien, it then starts leaving a little to be desired. The explanations attached to the mystery and ambiguity of Scott's horrific science fiction masterpiece are nothing exceptionally creative or earth shatteringly profound. It's something that makes you go, ""Oh neat,"" or, ""I like what they did there."" Different people will have different outlooks on this but, as far as I'm concerned, if you're not going to make your prequel astoundingly brilliant, it's almost better to leave the mystery as just that, a mystery that fans of Alien get to speculate about for years and years.Honestly, a part of me is a little disappointed that I now know the backstory to these events. It's a little crushing to know that this is the true explanation and there is no refuting it as it is Ridley Scott's universe, and Prometheus is a Ridley Scott film. As much as I enjoyed this flick, I'd be lying if I didn't say a little part of me died when all was revealed and that beautiful veil of ambiguity was lifted to reveal a less than groundbreaking explanation to it all. It's a Wizard of Oz type experience, and I can't say it doesn't hurt just a little bit.But all nostalgic nerddom aside, it really is pretty fun to be back in the Alien universe and to experience something of a glimpse into what the backstory behind all this is. And that is just what Prometheus is, fun. It's creepy, it's gross, it's action packed, and it's got some truly great visuals that any sci-fi fan can get excited about. I can't say I didn't enjoy Prometheus but in retrospect I realize what I've lost in seeing this movie. It makes this a terribly bittersweet film, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and won't let my science fiction nerdiness get the best of me. Prometheus is a fun film. Definitely see it, but don't allow it to get too rooted into the beloved Alien universe which captivates your mind.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Discovering Humanity's Forerunners May Lead to Our Extinction,"What created humanity? Why are we here? Who created us? The answers to these questions are what the characters in ""Prometheus"" seek in this two-hour sci-fi film. In this magnificent two-hour adventure of exploring our beginnings, we are taken to a moon located in a distant galaxy named LV-223 where clues and secrets to humanity's beginnings are kept and where dangers against undiscovered species await.""Prometheus"" is a prequel to 1979's science-fiction horror masterpiece ""Alien"", also directed by Ridley Scott. It's been over 33 years since that critically acclaimed film influenced the movie industry and aside from James Cameron's ""Aliens"" released in 1986, subsequent films in the series (and that includes the two crossovers ""Alien vs. Predator"" and ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem"") have brought disappointment and it must have been painful for Ridley Scott to watch his beloved franchise crumble into pieces. But that all changes with the arrival of ""Prometheus"", the long-awaited prequel to the original ""Alien"" film.The first moments of ""Prometheus"" show us the beautiful sceneries of Earth in the distant past. Is it Earth? We don't know. Then we see an alien with extremely pale skin and well-built standing by a massive waterfall. However, we don't know where the scene is set. The alien drinks a mysterious black liquid and then vomits. He then disintegrates with his remains falling into the bottom of the massive plunge pool where it morphs into something alive.We then travel into 2089 where Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover mysterious markings in a cave located in the beautiful Isle of Skye located in Scotland. After comparing these markings with previous markings found in other locations, the archaeologist couple believe that this is an invitation from humanity's ancestors, which they call the Engineers. Then we go to 2093 where we arrive in LV-223 using a vessel called the Prometheus. Then the violent and gory adventure begins.""Prometheus"" is divided into two parts. The first hour focuses on discovering the magnificent dome located on the moon and examining the various extraterrestrial objects while observing some beautiful visual sets. The second hour of the film is when action sequences become more prominent, when it gets more violent and gory, and when there are many deaths.Most of the film takes place inside the dome or pyramid located on the moon. It is where most of the story takes place. At first, it seems like an ordinary network of corridors with nothing interesting but as we get more into the film, we discover some horrifying stuff here and the movie starts to get more interesting from there on. The horror scenes are reminiscent of those present in the original ""Alien"". We discover multiple vases filled with disgusting but deadly black liquid, a massive statue of a humanoid head, and corpses of giant aliens (believed to be those of the Engineers').Even though most of the film takes place in dark and gloomy spots, the visual effects of the film is still one of the strongest highlights of the film. The murals on the ceilings of the dome are very detailed and beautiful. The carvings on the walls of the pyramid are intricate and very meticulous in detail. One of the scenes where David discovers a room and finds a star map highlighting Earth has amazing visual effects. It's one of the bright scenes in the film and is the best scene in terms of visual effects. The holograms and everything incorporated in that scene is a job well done. The 3D is also excellent and it does not disappoint.Let's talk about the characters now. Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley is now replaced by Noomi Rapace's archaeological character Elizabeth Shaw. She is a strong believer in God and throughout the movie, she still believes that God is the ultimate source of life and creator of everything. However, she's less bad-ass compared to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley but a scene in the movie depicts her sense of feminine strength. Accompanying Shaw is her love interest Charlie Holloway portrayed by Logan Marhsall-Green. Unlike Shaw, Holloway is not a strong believer in God and skeptic. Onboard the ship is the android David portrayed excellently by Michael Fassbender. He is an android who doesn't show feelings and is envious of mankind's feelings. There also others on board the ship: Meredith Vickers, Captain Janek, Millburn, Fifield.The characters were portrayed excellently from their respective performers. Noomi Rapace didn't give an Oscar-worthy performance but she still delivered a powerful performance. Logan Marshall-Green's portrayal of Charlie Holloway was also strong. Charlize Theron gave one of the more powerful performances in the film as Meredith Vickers. The minor characters were given excellent performances too. However, Michael Fassbender's portrayal of the android David grabs the spotlight. His performance as the android is intriguing and very powerful that for a second, I thought he was portrayed by a real android.The characters in ""Prometheus"" are driven by intrigue and curiosity. They are so interested in discovering their origins that they would pay any cost to uncover the truth and reach the answer. Their sense of curiosity is what caused the disaster. ""Prometheus"" is later on fueled by extremely intricate sets and amazing visual effects and accompanied by solid performances (a special note to Michael Fassbender's portrayal of David). Whether it's a prequel, sequel, standalone film, ""Prometheus"" is a magnificent film. It's not perfect and it has some flaws but ""Prometheus"" is a must-see film of the summer movie season - and in 3D.Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: It may not be perfect but the fantastic sets and visual effects accompanied with extremely powerful performances, especially Michael Fassbender as David, assure that ""Prometheus"" is a must-see movie of the summer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I blame myself... I got my hopes up,"This review is not so much a way to influence people's opinions about this movie, but more of a way for me to vent. (Btw, I have seen core of the Alien movie series, but am not basing my review off it's connection, but as a stand alone)First the positives! The musical score was without a doubt the most sweepingly intrinsic score in a movie I have heard in a long, long time. The low tones and rich depth just make you want to stare out at the stars and wonder. Bravo!Michael Fassenbender was amazing. He was the most interesting character in the film and created such a great persona, (despite the weak dialog he was given and the plot holes he had to keep jumping over along with his fellow actors). The monotoned delivery of his lines and the manner in which he carried himself was beautifully subtle. He really reigned back his emotions which made him so untouchable and rather chilling.The effects: the creatures, makeup and cg was top notch. The best cg is when you don't think about it, it just blends into the movie without dominating it, and this film succeeded. The makeup, except for Guy Pearce who looked like a poorly painted prune, was great. The white aliens were simple and elegant in look and design, and not like many aliens that go for an over the top, complicated, silly look.The visuals of landscapes,setting, and cinematography were at times breathtaking. However, here is where I really begin the critique: The scenes were so quick I was never granted enough time to fully appreciate them and take it all in. I'm curious if there is one complete scene that lasts more than 3 seconds before it cuts to another (except for the rather superfluous stretched out scene of a ship/shooting star flying through space).Also, what was with the dialog? Conversations between characters (there were too many characters and therefore weren't given enough time to be developed) was pointless. Why not fill moments with character development instead of non-plot progressing, cheap dribble? I didn't care if a character lived or died because I never got to know them! When will Hollywood learn the order of important: #1, interesting characters. #2, interesting, coherent plot. 3#, thought-out dialog. So long as you have these 3 in order we won't be critical of anything else!The plot: simply put... full of holes. Now I'm more forgiving of sci-fi films when it comes to having mystery and unanswered questions in a story. But when you leave the film with more questions then answers there's a problem. There were too many loose ends and unexplained or unreasoned elements that chopped up the flow. It's almost like, as an audience, we weren't let in on the joke, and not allowed the ""ah ha!"" moment. We weren't gently lead through the plot, but forced along on a nonstop ride that lead down multiple paths to... nowhere.So, while I expected this film to be added to the lofty ranks of sci fi brilliance as a mind bending, thrilling work, what I got was a sensory pleasing, yet confused film about humans and aliens.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Sci Fi Horror at its best,"Perhaps the trailers are a little bit misleading. This film is not dedicated to terrifying you from beginning to end. it is not a haunted house. It is dedicated to making you think, and ask questions, with or without the benefit of seeing the Alien series.But it will terrify you.The film develops its characters well. The acting is convincing, especially from the likes of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender. Ridley Scott has once again devised a great female lead (the notable other being, of course, Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver) who you will respect, admire, and root for, whether or not you agree with her religious beliefs (I did not). Fassbender plays a great android. Doesn't sound like praise? Trust me, it is. Everyone else is more than satisfactory, as they all react realistically (I can assume) to what they deal with.I won't give anything specific away, but there are multiple genuinely horrific sequences in the film, and the ending... well, some of you might like it, some of you won't. That's for sure. I loved it. That is also for sure.Go in with an open, thoughtful mind, and you're in for a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Captivating and Stunning!,"Some people are too caught up in criticizing the film to a ridiculous extent and end up giving it a 1 out of 10, which is absolutely insane. Actually, anything below ""7"" is grossly unjustified. Meanwhile these same people end up giving lousy films like Chernobyl Diaries and Battleship much, much better scores?? These people are just utterly retarded and have absolutely no scarcely detectable amount of ability or talent to discern and recognize a work of brilliance when they see it. They are really abusing their privilege of leaving reviews, which are anything but fair and reasonable.Prometheus is brilliant. The visual effects and concepts are stunning, breath-taking and ingenious. The storyline is intriguing, thrilling and leaves you at the edge of your seat. The characters are engaging and fascinating.This is definitely my top favorite of the entire Alien ""franchise"". The story is big, and I appreciate that the film does not try to jam all the answers in one go, but instead opens the door to further possibilities, and the continuation of the theme.Those who are not familiar with the Alien films, may not apprise and empathize the full scope of all the nuances in the film. However, if you can appreciate an extremely high quality film with a captivating and suspenseful storyline, you will surely enjoy Prometheus.

It's a big Universe with lots of Aliens,"I laugh at all the reviews about how Prometheus wasn't this or that.

Prometheus was an Excellent movie in the realm of the Alien Universe, and don't forget it is not a direct prequel to Alien.To all you hard core Alien fans don't fret cause it's not linked to Alien but for a Strand of DNA just like Scott said.Just go see it and enjoy it for what it is, a great movie ride and a very thought provoking story about what could have started human life on Earth.I've seen it twice all ready and plan to see it again while it's in the theaters...Great job Sir Scott.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing of the year ! The trailer is better then the movie !,"I am a fan of Alien series. I am generally indulgent with any SF movie. But this is the biggest disappointing of the year ! The suspense from the trailer is lost after 10 minutes from the beginning, there is no horror in this movie. Except Charliz Theron character and the android , the others 15 characters from the crew are so unconvincing ,they are almost invisible. Maybe Naomi Rapace is a good actress, but is not fit for this kind of role and movie. The director fail to keep the pace of action, compared with the first Alien I felt like watched a cartoon movie, even my girlfriend didn't felt any thrill. Another bad thing about this film in the illogical behavior of the characters. There are some elements stolen from Species in this movie, inserted without explication .Riedly Scott accomplish nothing in this film. Even the final is bad directed, it does't seem heroically !I give this a 6 because I am an Alien nostalgic, but it is not worth the shifting to the theater!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Delivers as Promised and More,"I don't remember being this excited over a movie in a long time and by god, Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi PROMETHEUS is as close as we could get to a modern day masterpiece.PROMETHEUS does as promised in the ad campaign and fan expectations; it serves as a semi-prequel to ALIEN but it's also a standalone story by itself. It delivers the space-bound horror in true old-school fashion similar to the original ALIEN; you don't really know what's killing the cast but it's still the stuff of nightmares. But what really impressed me was that the movie does a lot more than that.The film throws in some existentialist themes that fit in the storyline and don't seem forced. Other films try to do this and instead of sounding deep, they look stupid. PROMETHEUS on the other hand does it seamlessly; nothing is shoved down your throat and no one idea is shown to be better than the other. Mysteries are dropped left and right; not everything may be answered by the end but as one character said in the film, the answers may be irrelevant. What I really liked about this film was it got me thinking a lot even by the time the credits rolled. Sure, connections to the ALIEN universe MAY help answer a few questions and speculations but there is no definite answer. It's really up to the viewer to figure out some parts for themselves. In a time when every answer and plot detail is served on a silver platter and very few movie makers want to make the audience think, PROMETHEUS stands out and confuses you and leaves you asking a lot of questions... and you'll love every second of it.Visually the movie was engaging; what you'll see on screen is one of the most beautiful yet haunting settings ever imagined. It's also interesting to note that a good number of the places on screen were actually sets, not purely CGI. I've always had a thing for practical effects over CGI ones and the ones used in PROMETHEUS do not fail to awe. The world's desolation and hidden horrors come to life in one hell of a planet.The cast did their parts really well (props to Rapace, Theron and Pearce) and as mentioned by a lot of people before me, the character David (Fassbender) stands out in particular. What's interesting for me is the fact that there is no one definite protagonist. The whole film could be Dr. Shaw's story of discovery as much as a story focused on David. The only comment I could give about the cast was that I wish Theron and the rest got a bit more screen time since their characters were all engaging.Another very minor problem for me was the soundtrack placing. Yes, I agree, the score was beautiful but it popped up in some of the most inappropriate moments but this does little to hinder what I feel is the best sci-fi film I've seen since DISTRICT 9.PROMETHEUS is a god-send; it's one of the few movies in recent memory that got me so pumped up I actually wanted to save money just to watch this on the big screen instead of waiting for the DVD release. Close to 30 years may have passed since Ridley Scott made a sci-fi film and yet he still shows us he's got the skills. It's horrifying, intriguing and makes you think a lot.If you watched ALIEN from the start or you just love sci-fi, you should see this; it's really worth the wait. If you're new to it, you're still in for one hell of a sci-fi film. Sure, there are a lot of people claiming that this was a ""disappointment,"" ""a complete failure,"" ""amateurish,"" etc. but rest assured these are false. These kinds of reactions always pop up when some popular movie comes out... just look at the reactions that THE DARK KNIGHT, THE AVENGERS and INCEPTION got among others; expect these kinds of reactions every time a good movie comes out (case in point: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES). There will always be someone out there saying that ""X movie is such a rip-off of Y"" or something along the lines of ""OMG this is the worst movie EVAR"" and the like.PROMETHEUS delivers one the best sci-fi stories ever put on the big screen; so far it's one of the best movies of the year and you won't regret watching it. It's worth the money, the long wait and the experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Oh dear...,"Something tells me Ridley didn't intend for this film to turn out the way it has. It's a bit of a shambles, unfortunately Alien nostalgia isn't enough to save this films credentials. It could be forgiven if the film hadn't been built up the way it had. The human element was missing, the gut feeling which the audience connects too, the mystery of movies to make one feel was not present.Quite spectacular at times, a sort of the 'tree of life' meets Avatar, it certainly does not deserve another film and quite frankly Ridley would know this. Character connections are an issue, not only the connection between the actors own characters and the way they interact, but the connection with us. I'd suggest to see the film on 3D and at least get some kicks out of their hard work.Better luck next time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Criminally Underrated,"No other movie that I know of has such a conflicted audience. You either love this movie or you hate it. Usually in matters of taste there can be no argument... But about Prometheus, the haters are simply wrong.I kind of get it, I don't think I understood what I was looking at the first time I watched it either. That could be part of the problem: people aren't really prepared for it, and hence, they don't know how to view it.Let go of your expectations, open yourself up, and what you'll get is: an all-star cast, interesting/complex characters, beautifully shot scenes, a stunning tone and visual effects, heady themes, great mystery, horror, suspense, and a dive into the fragility of humanity.The critics want their hands held and to be beaten over the head with all the answers. ""Prometheus"" provides all the material, but invites the audience to answer the questions. Along the way, it's an extremely entertaining spectacle. It's a movie you can basically figure out, but it might take some time spent unraveling your thoughts, or with friends or family. The endless rewatchability offers more depth each time you return.Critics quite honestly nearly expected the movie to answer the meaning of life and if there's a god or not. Spoiler: it can't do that.But it does invite you to.Lastly, come on, it's Ridle Scott, what more is there to say?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Explains the Alien storyline - Movie mostly for aliens and sci-fi fans.,"Well I was just in the theater and watched Prometheus.As an avid Aliens fan, I know all the movies, and have read most of the books out there. But I also read the interview with Ridley Scott, saying that this was not an Alien movie. So I went in, not expecting any aliens, but a good story.And the story was good. It explained a lot of the story before the alien movie, and answered a lot of my questions.I don't know if Ridley Scott have read a lot of the aliens novels out there, but it seemed he had the same ideas as to what has been written about the ""Space jockeys"". I really liked that, intentional or not.Most of the characters, were unfortunately very shallow, lacking depth. Too many introduced, and no real focus on them. Pure stereo types of some sort.Fassbender did really well though as David, the android.The visuals were amazing, nice and crisp. Good looking and well worth watching in the theater. The 3D part though, while great looking, was too few and far between to be really necessary to watch in 3D.Again, as an avid Aliens fan, I will only rate this a solid 7. Where the original Alien is a 9 and Aliens is 10 in pure awesomeness.But unless you are an alien or sci-fi fan, i would not recommend it for ordinary watching. It will leave you with too many questions, and too many things not understood.Especially as some of the characters, are seen in more detail on the internet commercials and TED talks. If you haven't watched them, you will not get their points and meaning.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Greatest sci fi movie of this young decade. Go see this,"Visually spectacular, and not one boring moment from the get-go. Very well done. I had very high expectations for this film, and it most definitely exceeded them. I don't have any idea why the hell anyone would say they didn't at least thoroughly enjoy this film. Great performances, especially from android Michael Fassbender, who constantly had me wincing at his antics. Did I mention the visual elements? Oh my god. Enough beautifully colored holographic displays to blow any science fiction fans mind. I don't want to say much more than just go out and see this because I don't want anything ruined for you potential viewers. Remember, Roeper gave it 5 stars if that means anything. Don't believe anyone who says this movie sucked, they are obviously very stupid and hard to please. This movie delivered in so many aspects. I am going to pay my money to see this film again. Maybe even a few more times, it was that good. I cannot wait for the sequels to come out.

(the open ending). Also what is the connection with the Predator.I also see there is Prometheus 2 announced for 2014-5, and I beg the director not to mimic or borrows ideas from other movies. It would be best not only for the fans,but for history of film-making and of course for all of the mankind as future explorers of our galaxy(and more) to see UNIQUE,BRAINSTORMING and PURE stories.It was a breathtaking experience for me watching the humans going on remote moon and exploring.What about a planet next time?! :) This is getting long....

"Visually stunning, terrifically engaging","Wow! I cannot say enough good things about Prometheus. I admit, for months before this I was already polarized after seeing only the trailer of the film but after so much waiting, I must say I am overjoyed at the finished product. Firstly I'd like to address the copious criticism of the film that it has received by viewers on IMDb. It appears as if these people were clearly looking for a frame-by-frame remake of the original alien. Surely Ridley Scott has more intelligence and creativity to throw the same stuff back at the fans. The hate is mainly due to the different angle of approach. I walked into the theatre with no bias, never having seen the originals. Later, after being so thrilled with the movie I watched both alien and aliens. I admit, Alien was the stronger movie of the two, but people are clearly expecting the movies to be the same with few deviations!

Don't listen to the haters! Watch it and enjoy!,"Sure my vote of 10 stars is perhaps a little overboard, but I did it to counter the unbelievably low rating some people gave it (1 star, honestly? grow up). Regardless, I would still rate it at around a 8.5-9 because there were a few inconsistencies. However, they were for the most part trivial and in my opinion should not be taken in to consideration. For instance, how did they find the temple on the surface so quickly? WHO CARES!? Aside from the people who are intentionally trying to find faults in the movie how many of you actually want to see them scanning the planet's surface for however long that would take? My guess is close to none (other than the aforementioned haters). This is only one example of the trivial reasons people voted the film down. Read the other reviews for yourself and decide if they would honestly make or break a movie for you. Nowadays everyone wants every aspect spelled out for them. You need to leave some of it up to your own imagination. Sure I noticed several inconsistencies when I viewed it but I didn't get hung up on them. Overall I enjoyed the hell out of this film.

"Not as good as I hoped for, but not as bad as I feared.","Just came back from watching it a little while ago.Could it live up to what we hoped for? No Was it as good as we could hope for/expected of it? Yeah, think so. So, no, it's not perfect, but I kinda liked it anyway.The story? - clearly a lot of thought has gone into making it and it does make sense...mostly. Unfortunately is has the same thing that most horror movies also do - people doing something VERY stupid ...that doesn't make ANY sense - other than advance the plot and f00king things up even more for the characters ...and doesn't even bother to TRY to explain WHY. Unfortunatey it can't rise above that very basic stupidity and that's too bad. I'd hoped for more.But a lot of things works really well too. Despite a few scenes that really rubbed me the wrong way for being a little too familiar compared to scenes from earlier installments - I like how it meshes really well with the already established universe. Mythology established in Alien 3 are here, and built upon, while setting up its own stuff...and even something that establishes something major from Aliens are set up here as well....and leaving it wide open for a sequel, naturally...which I hope we get. :-)However, overall it suffers from being almost too slick. Like too many other ""big movies"" it has, what I call, a ""hyper-optimised"" script. It's predictable, unrelenting in its forward storytelling momentum, and nothing is there by chance - everything matters and the time of red herrings and ""fun little things"" are a thing of the past. We don't get ""small insignificant things"" anymore - only big plot holes that are unexplained and too big to ignore.Visually it's stunning though. Nothing effects-wise to complain about.Some negative stuff there, but how could I not mention it. But I loved it and I'm looking forward to seeing it again (and again). I won't splash out extra on 3D the next time, though. The 3D, while good, is in no way needed for anything and although it may add depth to the world, you won't lose anything by only watching it in 2D.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Not a sci-fi movie,"Amazingly beautiful and ridiculously senseless film. There is no ""science"" in the sci-fi, it's more like future fantasy since none of it makes sense. Ridiculous characters do ridiculous things for unknown reasons that make no sense. The worst part is that Ridley had to prequel/rip-off Alien because the writing team was so uncreative they couldn't come up with a realistic and unique plot line. The movie even ignores the laws of Physics whenever it wants, characters can survive being blasted with the exhaust of an interstellar starship and outrun multi-thousand ton structures toppling on them.By all means, open your face masks and turn off your air supply when you enter the theatre, it will make the pretty pictures that much more enjoyable if you try not to think during it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An original story of a prequel to Alien,"Prometheus is a prequel. It takes place any year's, before the events of Alien. It's a prequel that attempts to tell the origins of mankind, but at the sametime, shows us the origins of the xenomorphs. There are creatures in the film, but they are not the facehuggers, chestbursters and xenomorphs that we are used to.The Space Jockey is partially revealed, in terms of what it is and its intentions, but it's origins and connections with the creatures/xenomorphs is not explained. That is left open to the next film (not Alien).The film is stunning to look at. Beautiful cinematography, sets and designs. I recommend a 3D viewing.The script/story is frustrating, because it doesn't answer questions, but raises them. It teases, but it'd still fascinating.The action scenes are intense, even though the film doesn't have very many of them.There isn't a lot of character development, but Fassbender, Rapace, and Theron, all do a good job.Remember, this is supposed to be an original story, set years, before Alien. It's telling us the events that lead up to the Derelict in Alien, but it's going to take a few films to do it. Enjoy the movie, for what it is.

A wonky script and some of the dumbest characters of all time hurt an otherwise good and thought provoking movie.,"I know there's been a bit of a ""re-assessment"" of Prometheus in the 2020s as *actually* a masterpiece, and I can totally see why. Prometheus is a truly gorgeous movie; every aspect of it screams excellence and like all Alien movies, it's reflective of the professionalism and technological leaps we've made, where essentially, everything looks pristine.What I appreciate the most about this movie, visually, isn't that it just gives us gorgeous vistas, disgusting creatures, an unmistakably unique costumes and sets. It also is steeped in the visual language of the original Alien; there are overt and visual references that make the connection between this and the 1979 classic clear. The suits the Engineers wear, the proto-face huggers, the retro-futuristic spacesuits...it all FEELS like Alien.I also have to applaud this movie's commitment to big ideas and themes. The original Alien was a purposefully mysterious sci-fi film that just happens to become a claustrophobic horror tale. There are a lot of unanswered questions from that movie, I really like the answers that Prometheus provides. As a ""prequel"" to Alien, it's not all that bad.The performances are mostly pretty good. Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace? Fantastic. Charlize Theron and Idris Elba? Who doesn't like to see them? Logan Michael Green...feels very miscast here. It's virtually impossible to really buy his character, to be honest. Overall, the entire crew lacks development, and while there is a narrative reason for this, it's hard not to compare it to the great ensembles of the past.But, the reason Prometheus is so polarizing is the same reason people hated how Game of Thrones ended: it's the script, stupid.Some of the dialog is just flat out bad and the film speed runs through things that really ought to be fleshed out more to make sense. (Why is Peter Weyland hiding? Like why is it necessary to keep that a secret - wouldn't a ruthless megacorp sponsoring a scientific mission with no obvious financial upside ring some alarm bells?) Let's not even start with the Engineers, whose plan and existence raise even more questions that (frustratingly) never really get answered and probably never will be (see Alien: Covenant and Romulus).But of course, we all know the Prometheus's biggest sin. It has some of the dumbest characters in film history. You're telling me that a crack team of scientists exploring a new planet have NO qualms with removing their helmets and breathing in the air, without understanding what pathogens may be on the planet?You're telling me that the guy responsible for building the map of the structure can't retrace his steps back to the ship? Really, a biologist treats a terrifying snake-worm hybrid creature as if it's a little puppy and goes RIGHT up to it? Really, Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace), you don't think weapons are necessary on an unknown planet, because it's a ""scientific"" expedition? That's like a person going into the woods and not bringing bear spray.SERIOUSLY, Vickers (Charlize Theron)?! You can't just run sideways instead of towards the front? REALLY, Weyland (Guy Pierce), you think after all you've seen, it's STILL a good idea to talk with the Engineers? And these are just the dumb plot moments and character decisions I can recall; the movie is literally rife with them.Look, I get all movies require a suspension of disbelief, but surely there are less contrived ways of getting from point A to B. The characters make inexplicably dumb decisions over and over again, yet we're supposed to believe these are...for the most part, smart and capable people.Prometheus is like that fling with an incredibly hot, yet kind of dumb person. You know it's not going to go anywhere, you know their appearance can't compensate for their lack of intellect forever, but you can't help yourself from wanting a bit of fun. Yet, it kind of falls apart when they start acting like they're smarter than you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Old school stuff from the master. Forget the haters!,"I almost believed the IMDb haters, and I delayed this title till last night.So wrong to read what some people think about cinema in place like this. This is good stuff from Ridley. It's intense and visually stunning compared with lots of crappy new generation movie in these days. Some people like stupid nonsense sophistication, thank God Ridley is still human enough to deliver great sci fi in old style manner. Great vision, great design, great suspense, no silly unbelievable cartoon situation. The story is simple and has the same ingredients like first two aliens movies, men vs dark hostile places in Universe, nothing new here, but I don't care. Is still a great premise for a good movie, and this is what Prometheus is. No fields with millions of Predators and Aliens here, no poor CGI animation, no useless dialogues about nothing. This is serious. An updated classic style of a great cinema genre. Still ahead of many dull movies you see today. Even if this isn't something new like the first Alien was in '79, is still enough to trash two decades of sci fi garbage in oblivion. In fact this is the whole point here: return to simplicity is still a great exercise, a great source, in making good movies.

Film making at it's best.,"Not many words are needed to sum this film up. For years I've imagined what led up to the events in 'Alien' and this certainly didn't disappoint. The script-writing is superb, the acting is superb and the endless unanswered questions from the '79 classic are all there. It's not often I watch a film and during it have that feeling of ""wow"" on more than one occasion but I'm happy to say this film manages it without any unnecessary effort. Tarantino has managed a similar thing with the new 'Django' movie, being true and respectful to the original, and this achieves the same. Certainly a film to savour and it you don't get goosebumps watching it, then you don't appreciate clever, well written, though-out film-making.

Inspired story development can't satisfy dulled minds.,"After the first three Alien movies, the franchise went downhill fast. Even the third and fourth films were essentially a repeat of the first one, the third set in a prison and the fourth back on a spaceship with a cloned Ripley resurrected. Then there came the Alien versus Predator car crashes and all hope was lost ... until Prometheus.What unfolds in Prometheus is an intelligent merging of horror with wondrous adventure and the balance was struck well. The story played out with conviction and grabbed my interest so much that it felt exciting that they would Try to source the origin of those horrific Aliens and take it full circle back to the origin of humans on Earth. Exciting and very interesting with an ending that promised a huge jump forward in storytelling for what had become a tired broken record of a franchise.Unfortunately, those who love being spoon fed the same dribble over and over again failed to see this film for what it was and that negativity influenced the sellhout that was the sequel to Prometheus, Alien Covenant. It was a massive step backwards from an adventurous smart story originating in Prometheus and a shame really because I can't help but feel that we've lost a story that would have stood the test of time due to studios caving into the lowest common denominator of fan.Severely underrated, Prometheus is the only original story in the franchise besides the first film and it is endlessly rewatchable unlike the mediocre jump scare tropes of the other films in this series.As the old saying goes, there's no accounting for taste. If you watch the first film and then Prometheus in sequence, it makes for a marvellous story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Prequel to Alien Very Good - Prometheus,"This prequel to Alien is very well done. At times, it is a bit over the top and a bit too violent, but then again, the universe is a naturally violent place. It is possible that the film could be viewed as an original exploration of the origin of mankind. However, since there are several scenes that mirror those of Alien, it might be wiser to go with the view that it is a prequel. And a very good one at that. The woman protagonist wins the survival of the millennium award, as she survives more disasters than ten Titanics. Make no mistake; this is a classic of horror and science-fiction combined. Ridley Scott has gone all out to outdo himself in comparison to his earlier efforts. The special effects are among the best in the history of cinema. The opening sequence is unforgettable. Highly recommended for thoughtful exploration.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
H. R. Giger is credited in the end,"Both Dariusz Wolski and Arthur Max are underrated. Both masters of their craft, both outstanding visionaries and their talents collide here guided by great Ridley Scott. Visuals are always stunning and 3D is used as a powerful tool to underline the mesmerizing sets. The critics as often have no idea what this movie is really about. They keep blathering about lack of philosophy (what philosophy?). Make no mistakes, this is pure Alien franchise (read the header). I really don't get how can anyone, let alone movie critic can miss this. That is why Scott succeeds here, he reprises the perfect combination, which he has pioneered many years ago of Sci-Fi and Horror genre. What philosophy? The summer has just started, you movie critics. This movie is closer to ALIEN than ALIENS ever was. Ridley Scott's direction here should be taught in film-making text books. It starts off as an adventure, progresses into the thriller and ends up a hard-core gore monster horror, all the three inside the science fiction genre. Never it is an action movie, like ALIEN and unlike ALIENS. Never it is boring or outdated. Some scenes are if not revolutionary then unique in their technique of execution as well as their dramatic impact. During the birthgiving scene, I actually was dangerously close to fainting. Basically, if you prefer ALIENS over ALIEN, then I got nothing to say to you, but if you don't, then you are in for a ride you will never forget.

Too much like aliens.,"""The movie disappointed me because it went in a different direction than what I had hoped for."" That's my opinion, and also a good analogy for how overused the ideas in the movie is.At times I was frustrated by the predictability. Some movies have a solid story, and can provide surprise twists in a natural way. Other movies have less of a story, and then they have to experiment with doing the opposite of what the audience expects. Ridley Scott apparently does not feel he has to do anything to create twists in this completely mundane storyline.You will see unprofessional crew, scientists vs soldiers, obvious expendable characters, young actor with ""oldman mask"", stereotypical alien base, stereotypical aliens, casual making the greatest discovery in human history, and so on. I believe they are ""TV-Tropes"" or whatever...I don't understand why there must be retards on spaceships that make tons of stupid mistakes just to further an empty plot. JUST LET EVERYONE BE SMART, AND MAKE THE ALIENS SMARTER! One good thing about the movie is the main character played by Noomi Rapace. Heck, all performances are at least decent. The CGI is great, it has some very beautiful sceneries. The story isn't terrible either. My beef is mainly that a movie about aliens should feel alien, shouldn't it? And the idiot/expendable characters... FFS.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Cinematography great, actors fine, story lacks","As the title of my review summarizes, I liked the cinematography of the movie really well. The actors were doing a good job, with Michael Fassbender as the android David standing out. Charlize Theron as enigmatic director was OK too. The rest of the cast was very well replaceable, especially due to lack of screen-time. Having seen the Alien movies, it is not very original what happens in the movie - just slight ""gene shifts"" of the story spiced up with some hints of a creator/creation story. I must say that the ""leaked"" story-book that was reported about a year earlier sounded much more interesting than the final result. Overall a bit disappointing - I'm not sure that I would see any sequel that this movie heavily hints at.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great entrance into another Alien Saga,"Wow! This movie was fantastic. It really goes to show that great directors can still be great with age. I feel that the experience Ridley Scott has at directing fully benefited him when he directed this movie. The movie takes place in the same universe as the other Alien movies and that really spells trouble for the team that investigates an unknown planet. The moral of the story is really felt and grasped onto by the viewer and you won't be disappointed by the outcome. I am really pleased having viewed this movie. You should go see it as soon as possible you won't regret it. If you enjoyed the other Alien movies than your definitely in for a treat, this movie is filled with those action packed scenes that we all come to expect. Just from viewing the trailer you can sense a spot of gripping and suspense filled rides and that is all accomplished through out the film. You will be grasping and sitting on the edge of your seat at times and that is what to come of great films. I give it 10/10 solely because this movie lived up to my expectations and that it was superbly directed. Go see this awesome flick as soon as possible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Oh dear Ridley what have you done,"As an avid Scifi fan I was really looking forward to this 'alien' prequel and perhaps therein lies the problem but this film is flawed on so many levels I do not know where to begin but I will begin with the biggest and most fatal flaw of the lot. I did not care! The characters are so under developed that not only didn't I care about any of them but didn't really understand why any would behave in the ways that they did. Fassbender was OK, Rapace wasn't bad given her command of the English language is less than perfect but all others were vacuous and frankly pointless. Theron suffers particularly for this poor lack of development and just comes across as wooden rather than cold which I suspect was the intention.The second problem is plausibility. Now I know it's a scifi and you need to suspend disbelief but that should be limited to the premise. As it is we are asked to believe that these so called scientists, educated and measured people would disregard scientific methods and become mindless idiots, wandering off from groups (cliche) and prodding and poking things as soon as they see them. Collecting samples in what can only be described as a duffle bag is among the worst of these actions.Finally and perhaps most disappointingly for Alien fans is where is the menace? Alien and some of the sequels succeeded because you were anxious almost all the way through the film. Here there was none, no egde of your seat moments, no heart stopping scenes, just a collection of uneven scenes hastily cobbled together to minimal effect.It is beautifully shot hence why I've given it 4 stars but other than that very poor and for me the most underwhelming film I've seen in a long while!",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What's With Ridley Scott?,"I understand that Mr. Scott didn't much like not being invited back to do the sequels to ""Alien"", even though ""Aliens"" was almost as good as his effort. I understand that he maintained that ""Prometheus"" was not going to be a sequel, even though it has 80% of the elements of the first film.I guess Ol' Ridley decided to let this terrible movie, with its inappropriately inadequate cast, be his ""gotcha!"" to the studios.It's not just a bad, inconsequential movie; and it isn't that it returns to the ""stupid scientists"" ideas of his former work(""Hey, why not treat alien life forms like pets or cute fuzzy animals, ignoring any protocols we might have about that!""); it isn't even that it doesn't add anything really relevant to the Alien concordance.It's a half effort by a talented director, and it isn't a very good half. If I had known what a letdown it was going to be (and I had my misgivings) I would've saved my money.Let's all hope Ridley doesn't (not) make a sequel to Blade Runner.....",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Utter science fiction brilliance.,"This has to be the best film I have ever been to the cinema to see.Genuinely original : most of the time these days with modern films, you can pretty much work out the entire story within a few minutes of it starting, you genuinely can not do this with Prometheus, providing you don't probe the internet for spoilers, you will be in for a film where you really don't know what is going to happen.Quite frightening : really, the horror is different and chilling.Believable characters : Every Ridley Scott film is filled with characters that feel real, organic, not rigidly type-casted to fill time space in a script.Entertaining for those with an intellect : Admittedly when I left the cinema there were people whom were voicing there negative opinions about the film, mainly because they couldn't understand it or were expecting something else, most films are dumbed down for ease of understanding, this is not, it has a philosophical depth to it which makes you think.I do not believe in spoiling the surprise that awaits them, enjoy Prometheus for what it is , A genuinely original science fiction horror, Ridley Scott delivers a masterpiece that I will be purchasing on Blu-ray when it is released.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Broken promise,"In hindsight, the promotional videos ended up as an excellent predictor. The short ""viral"" film about David the Fassbender was brilliant, and his parts in the movie were great. Guy Pearce in the ""TED talk"" video came off as Eldon Tyrell's phony, pompous kid brother - and that's just how his whole plot line played. The trailer was visually spectacular, but sounded pretentious without much to back it up. We hoped it wouldn't be so, but it is.First things first, Scott knows how to direct, and Prometheus may be the best-looking movie of the decade. Just for that, I don't regret putting down $15 for a 3D screening. After all the weak CG and derivative action we've been watching for years (orcs on jet-skis in Avengers, anything by Bay or Snyder), it's good to see amazing practical sets, tasteful computer graphics, and effects that FEEL REAL.It's just too bad that the screenplay is murky, overwrought twaddle without a single memorable line or character. Fassbender is good. Noomi Rapace is good in distress, although, after a certain point, one has to wonder how she could run and jump without massive bleeding and hemorrhages. Almost everyone is flat, disposable, irrational and stupid.The biggest bubble of them all is when people praise the movie for ""raising questions."" We're science fiction fans. We've read Wells, Asimov and Clarke. All these questions have already been raised long ago, we've been thinking about them for decades. Clarke did panspermia in ""Cradle,"" Sagan did theology in ""Contact,"" and Scott himself did gooshy monsters, evil androids and space ruins in ""Alien."" What Prometheus should have done was explore these questions, and it didn't.There are dozens of reviews here right now from furious Brits who list the flaws, the plot holes, the perfunctory theology, the pointless twists, the stupidity of every character. There's not much I can add to that, but I would like to tie the awful science of it together. Man, the biology was bad. For a movie about genetic engineering, holy Christ was the biology bad.So check this out. In the beginning, Earth appears barren. Giant, pale alien humanoids seed it with life. In the first inexplicable move, one of them has to drink some goop and disintegrate into a waterfall. But why?? If they can travel through the galaxy and create biospheres from scratch, surely they'd have found a way to do it without killing off one of their own guys.OK, now DNA is in the water. Now what? Do we start out with microorganisms that diversify and organize themselves into multicellular life? Do they radiate into plants & animals, fungi, extremophiles, occupy every niche on Earth and and go through the evolutionary history that we know and love? Does this process take 3.8 billion years, and leave fossils in every geological strata? In that case, the DNA that ended up in the water must have been chopped down into really small, basic chunks. After all, if humans and holothurians have a common ancestor, it must have been pretty simple. Then how, after billions of years of mutation, did Earth produce bipedal humanoids that look incredibly similar to the ones who seeded it in the first place, down to six-pack abs and everything? Wouldn't that be vanishingly unlikely?But wait. In the movie, they run a DNA scan on one of the aliens... and it matches human DNA exactly! But how? Didn't we evolve from goop on planet Earth? How in the world did we end up with the exact same genetic code as the beings that poured some DNA into a river billions of years ago? Even two populations of the same species, if they are split up, will begin to lose their similarities due to genetic drift.Maybe, somehow, the Engineers programmed Earth's biosphere to produce, among millions of species in every conceivable environment and niche, with every conceivable body plan, chemistry and life cycle, something that had their exact DNA. However, those guys are nine feet tall, completely hairless, and pale like cave slugs. Wouldn't there be some differences between their DNA and ours? How come we aren't nine feet tall? How is there a genetic match with so many phenotypic differences?You can either bash nitpickers and use the generic IMDb response, ""But it's just a movie! It's entertainment!"" Or, you can try to defend Prometheus as intelligent science fiction. But intelligent science fiction can't have dismal junk science. You can't break biology, then try to ride out on ""raising questions.""Sometimes, it feels like we've entered the Age of People Losing their Touch. Indiana Jones 4... The Star Wars prequels... Now this. Ridley Scott... you sure know how to shoot movies, but please, get a decent writer next time...",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Calm before the storm,I think the main problem people had with Prometheus was they thought of the film too much as a direct prequel to alien even before they saw the finished film.Promotheus is a very indirect sequel film concerning it has different tone and theme(s) than the all the other alien installments.This film is the most scifi out of the franchise.Like most other people who saw promotheus michael fassbender 's performance is well done.But for the whole cast was good the way they played there characters all brought there ideas and themes just from the characters which I really liked.Noomi rapace does a great leading lady in her role by someone who is driven by her work and as the story unfolds her work begins to test her limits.Idris elba plays the typical space ship captain who has a simple of request of just getting payed.This film does get intense it does have great both practical and cgi effects.Ridley scotts best film since American gangster.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
some good moments but also disappointing,"And again I was afraid to see a movie in 3D. I mean, most of them are done to attract people because producers are afraid that their flick would flop. The same here, everybody was expecting so much of this prequel to Alien (1979) also directed by Ridley Scott. Naturally Ridley also moved forward in film making and were Alien didn't had a big budget, Prometheus had big money and it shows. The effects used are really unbelievable at some times but of course effects doesn't make a movie.It does, but that's for other science-fiction flicks with no history. But here everybody wanted to know what happened with the ship found in the original Alien. Remember that the crew of the deep space mining ship Nostromo are awaken from hypersleep to investigate a strange signal from a nearby planet. While investigating the signal, they discover it was intended as a warning, and not an SOS. This is what Prometheus is all about. Why did they send that warning signal.I was expecting aliens and facehuggers and all of that but nothing here at all of those creatures. In fact Prometheus was out in space to search for the origin of mankind. It's done by archaeologist couple Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green). They discovered that star maps of different ancient cultures (Sumarian, Maya's, Egyptian,...) all show the same configuration. Of they go to find the planet (LV-223) with money from Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce). Weyland do rings a bell toward the original Alien but the planet was LV-426.From there on we do have resemblances towards the original one, they have an android (Michael Fassbinder) on board and they do travel in hibernation. Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), the mission director is a bit afraid of the planet and warns them not to touch anything. Of course they do due circumstances and things go awry on the planet.From that moment I thought that it all would start but we already had a lot of talking and special effects. Sadly the monsters do attack and enter throats of humans but they leave soon and we have to wait until the final before some kind of octopus alien returns and attacks.The special effects do their work but still it is a bit of horror science-fiction and I was left with a hunger for the aliens to attack. This movie is more about the origin of mankind then were the aliens were coming from. There's indeed on alien to see in the last minutes, not as in the other alien flicks but an earlier version of it.On part of the acting I found Noomi Rapace doing well and somehow she reminded me of Ripley. Fassbinder was also doing very well but Charlize Theron couldn't convince me. Again she's playing some kind of ice queen and we all have seen that before.This prequel did remind me a bit of the prequel to The Thing (2011). It was just made to earn some money on the cult status of the original flick. Although that the ending of The Thing (2011), in fact the scene's seen in between the end credits, was stronger than Prometheus.Overall it wasn't that bad at all but it would have been better that it didn't had anything to do with Alien and it's followers. Here we do see the Gods (called Engineers) out there to destroy mankind, Nothing of that in the other flicks. Okay, maybe when they enter that terrestrial spaceship in Alien you can see an Engineer sitting in some kind of chair but nothing is said about that. I really was left with a bitter feeling. People who hasn't (anyone?)seen Alien will love this, you will see attacks of a squid kind of creature but for the followers it just doesn't deliver and explain.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Dr. Shaw is ""Kick-Ass"" and my next superhero. Scott Ridley not your best work but clever!

"Thank you, Ridley Scott!","To the Alien franchise fans, Prometheus will contain precious answers they've been looking for since 1979, with brand new avenues expanding the ""Alien"" universe to new boundaries.Don't be mistaken though, Prometheus works very well on its own.To people that are not familiar with the ""Alien"" universe, Prometheus offers an experience rich in entertainment, visual prowess, imagination, and a fascinating script that both succeeds in being a beautiful ode to life/genetics as well as being an effective, imaginative science-fiction/horror story of its own.Direction is wonderful and true to the genre, visual effects are amazing, characters are engaging, and the score is both beautiful and haunting. From the opening sequence, you'll know you're in for a cinematic treat.The script changes levels at about mid-point of the film : Prometheus starts off with a pace very faithful to the first entry of the ""Alien"" franchise (lethargically nightmarish), while the second half unfolds in a more conventional way, with a blend of stressful situations and edge-of-your-seat action.A genuine sci-fi film, and a very welcome expansion to what has now become a legendary universe to sci-fi fans from all around the globe.

A Real Disappointment,"What started off as a great movie, went downhill fast and never really got interesting.

To many directions to go with to many possible story lines to fit it all in.

Prometheus,"In 1979, Ridley Scott made what is, in my opinion, the greatest horror movie of all time, as well as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. But even in the hands of talented directors, the series went downhill after the first two masterful installments; the series never again reached those heights. Now, 33 years after that first classic, Ridley Scott takes back the helm to try to return to the franchise's glory days with Prometheus.First off, I'm not going to go into detail about the plot, as I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone. The basic skeleton is that two scientists in the tail end of the 21st Century find a series of artifacts suggesting that mankind was visited by a race of people from a very distant star system, and that these people may have been our creators. And then crap gets real.It's tough for any movie to live up to the hype and expectations heaped on Prometheus's lofty shoulders, and it's difficult to look past this hype and look at it as a standalone film (or as the ending would have you believe, a standalone franchise), which is what Scott clearly wanted it to be. While much of this film's imagery informs what is seen in it, this is not a direct prequel to Alien. This works very much in its favor. It's tough making new scares when the audience knows where everything is going, so making a world where the iconic facehuggers and Xenomorphs are in early, primitive stages alongside very different, more advanced creatures helps keep things interesting. Still, it's impossible to not to compare it to Alien. Don't do this too much; it will make Prometheus seem much more disappointing than it really is. I started off doing this, and it made my opinion of the first twenty minutes or so sink. Once I forgot that, and just sat back to enjoy the ride, I liked the movie. A lot.There's a lot to recommend Prometheus. Unsurprisingly for a Ridley Scott film, the movie looks fantastic. It's worth shelling over your nine bucks just to marvel at the scenery. It's beautiful, mysterious, unsettling, and terrifying all at once. While Alien was small and claustrophobic, it's clear the Scott made this film to be an epic, and it takes great advantage of that scope. I chose not to watch it in 3D, as I think that 3D is a dumb gimmick made by greedy executives to drive up ticket prices that needs to hurry up and die for a second time. But like all good movies, Prometheus is still great in two dimensions. Good sets and cinematography are still good sets and cinematography regardless of whether they're flying at your face. The acting is very good all across the board, but the show is stolen by Michael Fassbender as the android David 8. He's marvelous, and needs recognition come Oscar night. Seriously; he's that good. Not to anger any Bishop fanboys out there, but he's the best android the franchise has had since Ian Holm. The special effects are also top notch, though there was a bit of an over reliance on CGI. Still, it's some fine CGI.But it's not perfect. The script sometimes fails Scott and his cast, with pieces of clunky dialogue that didn't need to be there. Some of the characters aren't well defined enough, most notably Charlize Theron, who tries her best despite being given next to nothing to work with. And much as I love Guy Pearce as an actor, they should have actually cast an elderly actor as the ancient CEO of Weyland Enterprises. Pearce, as always, does a fine job, but he's undone by laughable CGI aging. I hate to break it to Hollywood, but special effects aren't that good yet. There other things that let me down or made me scratch my head, but due to spoilers I won't talk about them here.It's not Alien, which was flawless, nor is it James Cameron's sequel, which was very nearly flawless. Prometheus is far from perfect, but there's still a lot to recommend it. It may not be Alien, but it's still good enough to be worthy of its proximity to it. There's very clear sequel bait at the end, and I eagerly await that next installment, hoping it answers the many questions that Prometheus left. Still, it gives the audience a lot to talk about.

Disappointing prequel with sloppy story writing,"Was very much looking forward to this film when it was released in 2012, but sadly it was quite the let down for me, a long-time fan of the Alien franchise, especially, of course, the first two films.This one invokes a little too much deus ex machina and open ended story arcs to really satisfy as a sci-fi marvel like the first two were, and on a much more limited budget I should add.All in all this was a fun watch if a bit too long in duration, but it's good enough in this age of lackluster sci-fi movies and endless, usually disappointing (Last Jedi - UGGHHHH!!!!) comic book and Star Wars movie remakes/prequels/sequels.My personal belief is that 7.0 is too high for this Ridley Scott offering but I'm not complaining even if I do feel a bit betrayed as a fan of his earlier work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An Intelligent Return To Science Fiction,"While there are indeed some moments in the film that make you want to shout at the screen and say, ""Don't do that!"" Prometheus manages to be one of the most intelligent science fiction films made since Duncan Jones's, ""Moon,"" and Christopher Nolan's, ""Inception."" The film is a brilliantly executed 3D masterpiece, with sets that will undoubtedly inspire film-makers and movie-goers for years to come, and a story that not only intrigues, but leaves one terrified and squirming on the edge of their seat during some of the most horrific scenes I've ever seen done in a suspense/ sci-fi film. Just like Scott's, ""Alien,"" the movie has an incredible sense of mystery blended perfectly with just enough terror and suspense to leave one begging for a sequel. ""Prometheus,"" also deals with concepts that haven't been touched since the likes of Stanley Kubrick's, ""2001, A Space Odyssey.""

"Prometheus: in space, old habits die hard","It's no great insight to say that Hollywood seems to have run out of new ideas, but recently this has become embarrassingly evident.The past few years have seen a relentless succession of high-profile remakes and sequels. In a changing marketplace, in which big media companies continually refuse to adapt, film studios seem to have become increasingly reliant on the Sure Thing. The trouble is that as much as we may despise such shameless regurgitations, they tend to make an awful amount of money. The 2010 remake of Desmond Davis' 1981 fantasy classic, Clash of the Titans, was critically panned but made almost $500million at the box office; Men In Black 3 may have you craving to have your memory wiped by a secret agent, but has already brought in a cool $300million in its first few weeks.However, while this increasingly unimaginative atmosphere has produced a fair amount of tripe, certain genres seem to be able to provide the potential for quality as well as commercial viability. Alongside the irrepressible comic-book adaptations, science fiction has once again thrived with such prequels as JJ Abrams' Star Trek and Rupert Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes being greeted with critical acclaim as well as financial success.So it seems that a well-conceived science-fiction universe can provide ample fodder for worthwhile blockbusters. However, given the Alien franchise's steady decline over the past few years, Prometheus seemed to have its work cut out for it.Directed by blockbuster powerhouse Ridley Scott, Alien (1979) was a masterstroke of conceptual simplicity and stylish execution. The crew of a cargo ship unwittingly bring a beastly, man-eating alien on board and it picks them off, one by one, in a claustrophobic and spine-tingling couple of hours that quickly cemented itself in the Hollywood pantheon. Unfortunately, its brilliant simplicity also made it readily replicable. Aside from James Cameron's decent 1986 follow-up, Aliens, the same blueprint was marched out for a further two abysmal sequels. The 2000s saw the eponymous creature rear its ugly head twice more in the crossover catastrophes that were Alien vs. Predator and Alien vs. Predator: Requiem, which turned in a considerable profit margin despite being excruciatingly naff.It is with a certain trepidation that Scott has returned to the fold to direct this latest outing. Eager to distance himself from the franchise's formulaic trappings, and in lieu of making a direct prequel, Scott instead decides to focus on one unexplained aspect from Alien and expand it into a very different kind of story. In the 1979 original, the malevolent creature is brought on board the cargo ship, Nostromo, when the crew discover alien eggs in a crashed spaceship. As they explore the wreck, they also find the remains of a giant, fossilised creature, which sits in the ship's cockpit. Scott has said that the enigmatic 'space jockey', as it became known, has always bugged him, and this film sets out to explore its origin, setting a new group of characters on a distinctly more philosophical journey, which may hold the key to the meaning of human existence.The year is 2089 and archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover a celestial map left by humanity's alien forbears in the ancient cave paintings of Earth. They are commissioned to lead a scientific expedition to follow the path the paintings lay out, taking them to a remote and desolate moon where they find the ruins of an ancient civilisation. Initially, Prometheus feels encouragingly different from the rest of the series. The journey the ship Prometheus takes is set up as a voyage of discovery rather than a voyage of the damned and, with stunning visual effects, Scott begins to craft a tantalising new world in the distant reaches of the Alien universe.Unfortunately, it isn't long before Scott begins falling into old habits. As they explore the ruins, the crew find more than they bargained for and unleash the wrath of the race they hoped would enlighten them. Thus, the film realigns itself with the very moulds it set out to break and Rapace, taking her lead from Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in the original series, is left to run around in blood-stained overalls, narrowly escaping the fate of her shipmates, who are all killed off in a range of rather unpleasant ways.The script then descends into a series of clanging nods to the original, with several scenes almost completely mirroring the most iconic moments of Alien. As it reaches its end, the film hastily returns to the philosophical questions it first posed, yet with so much time taken up in reliving former glories, this only serves to underline how quickly the film drifted away from what was supposed to set it apart.Recognising that a direct prequel would only lead him into all-too- familiar territory, Scott sidelines the iconic extra-terrestrial in order to tell a more human and complex story. Yet, in its almost compulsive backsliding into the Alien formula, Prometheus is little more than a tame rehash, whose only merit will be making an obscene amount of money.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Way ahead of its time,"Was Darwin theory flawed? Were humans on earth created by extra terrestrials only to be annihlated in the future to make earth their second home. Prometheus captures this superbly with amazing CGI way ahead of its time (released in 2012). David as the humanoid creates an eerie effect coupled by the suspenseful plot which revolves around the crew trying to meet and greet ""our creators"".",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Though somewhat of a disappointment Prometheus is still grand and ambitious science-fiction.,"Prometheus is something to behold. It's an ambitious science-fiction film. It's been a long time since we've seen a good Alien film. What Prometheus does, however, is something different since it's a sort of prequel to Alien (1979). One may not even call it a prequel because it's barely related to the other films in the franchise. Ridley Scott (the old Englishman who gave us classics like Blade Runner and Thelma & Louise) returned to direct and it's obvious that he made an effort. The special effects look fantastic. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is beautiful. Even the actors do a good job, Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender being the standouts. The action scenes, when they are there, are exciting. But, it's just too bad that the script by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof is so poor. It's filled with unimaginative dialogue, and it raises questions to which it gives no answers. In addition, the characters aren't well developed. So, there is very little substance for an ambitious premise. Still, Scott delivers some of his best work in years. There are few things here on the level of his old films but some scenes are genuinely breathtaking. Considering this it really hurts that the script is poor because just about everything else about Prometheus is good. If the script was good as well we may have had a good, if not great, science-fiction epic. As it is Prometheus is somewhat of a disappointment. It's structured a lot like the previous Alien films though it doesn't improve on them. Another thing worth mentioning is that the designs, of the aliens and the technology, are very impressive. I should mention that for me it became obvious that the script is poor when Shaw and Holloway were talking about ancient civilizations. Clearly the screenwriters don't know about Carroll Quigley's theory of civilizations, the best work on the subject out there. Despite this, Prometheus is definitely a film worth seeing. I doubt that it will scare you but it will certainly amaze you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not spectacular but better than the reputation,"I wouldn't call myself a MASSIVE fan of the Alien franchise but I've generally rather enjoyed them. The original was classic sci fi horror cinema from Ridley Scott, with its sequel indeniably the best entry in the whole series, coming from the master of sci-fi action/horror James Cameron. The subsequent films were admittedly not staggering, but something about the atmosphere of the Alien stories kept audiences nevertheless coming back for more.There hasn't been an Alien film since Resurrection (excluding the Vs franchise) so there was certainly a bit of expectation about this; it being a prequel explaining where it all began, and also being the only one in the series without 'Alien' in the title.Prometheus sees a project ship of the movie's name traveling to where it is believed the creators of mankind originate; 2 scientists, Charlie and Ellie having discovered what appears to be intergalactic maps pointing to the destination are aboard said project ship leading the expedition, trying to find out answers. Naturally they get more than they bargained for.Prometheus wasn't made to be a masterpiece, it is pretty clear it was made as an enjoyable tale which endeavours to explain the backstory of the Alien arc, and in that respect it does a pretty good job.Michael Fassbender is technically the main character (David) as the ship's 'host', an odd-job handiman employed by the project to, among other things, learn multiple ancient dialects in order to communicate with alien civilisations. He is not human, and in a very subtle nod to Scott's earlier masterpiece Blade Runner is an effective replicant - a manufactured human without 'a soul'. He does not want, desire, or feel emotion. He serves. And is pivotal in the progression of the story, with possibly questionable motives despite his limbo state. Fassbender puts in a fine performance and steals every scene he is in.The cinematography is impressive, with some eye-catching panoramic scenes and Scott's direction is its usual impressive self. One thing this isn't is boring.Other performances are decent if not striking, with Kate Dickie's Ford particularly struggling. Whether it was just her Scottish accent contradicting the others I'm not sure, but her lines were rather forced.One thing I'm confused by is the really poor reputation in terms of word of mouth this movie has. It scores 7.3 here but most people I've known who've seen it did not like it much, and the critical reviews were scathing. Yet, I'd agree with the 7.3 overall.Sure, it's not as good as Aliens, sure, it's not Scott's finest. But it's still a pretty decent couple of hours of entertainment which does a better job than many prequels of filling the gaps in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining,"Good, but not great. Good action and special effects, and broad plot. However, the finer details of the plot contain many holes, which erode the plausibility of the story. Ultimately, the movie degenerates into twists-from-nowhere and action for the sake of action. A tighter, less twisty, plot would have made this a great movie.Also, the deliberate attempt in the movie to link this to Alien, so it could be billed as a prequel to Alien, was silly. (Yes, I know Ridley Scott directed Alien too). The movie doesn't have to exist as a prequel to Alien - it is fine as standalone movie.Good performance from Noomi Rapace in the lead role. Charlize Theron is surprisingly unconvincing in her role - maybe she just had the worst dialogue, or was involved in some of the sillier plot holes or random jumps.Disappointing, but entertaining enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A fan-boys delight,This is the one that made me join IMDb just to caution other fans not to be downed by non fan cynicism. Do yourself a favor and avoid too much before knowledge. I saw it at a sneak peek on the 30th in Denmark and WOW. I had no problem following the story and using my imagination without getting it all on a silver platter. maybe being a lifelong fan i tend to make excuses but there is nothing too jarring in this new chapter. Nothing is perfect and to please all is impossible. with that in mind enjoy the brilliant 3D and a more than usual storytelling that actually made me think about the Weyland/Alien universe anew.

"A good start to a new set of ""Alien"" movies","I was really impressed with the direction and subtle approach to the origins of the ""Alien"" franchise. David is the best ""android"" yet. The ""invitation"" seemed a bit of a stretch seeing how there are no cave paintings at all of early man worshiping stars and large beings. Would have liked for Scott to have used something more historically real. No big deal, I just like being titillated by a little history that somehow connects our future. I like Scotts approach to fate. Its so much more mature for a director who respects the fact the more than 80% of the planet believes in some form of Diety. Its nice to see someone in Hollywood respecting people of this planet as opposed to mocking them. It obvious from the people who ""hate"" this film, there is a large portion who dislike it based on the ""faith"" premise. I understand not believing in a God, I was one myself for 30 years. But the new batch of anti-Christians (they are really anti-Creationist, but as most only seem to criticize Christianity, that what I call them) just flat out cant handle any kind of mention of faith at all. Its sad really, don't we all deserve respect for what we believe? This movie does a good job expressing that respect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"You feel that it becomes more interesting over time, but in the end, it only disappoints.","I'll start with the positives; the staging is fantastic, with some minor drawbacks, but overall, very well done. The film manages to engage you in its narrative, at least until the last few minutes, which can be described as generic. This is more aggravating considering that the film builds up great anticipation towards its conclusion, resulting in disappointment.I also liked the performances, especially that of Michael Fassbender, which could be described as intriguing.Now, I must make a small mention of the inconsistencies with the rest of the saga; the technology differs greatly from what was shown in Alien (1979). Being a prequel to it, the more advanced technology of humanity has no justification. It turns out that if the original saga did not exist, this would work better, but for some reason, they decided to move away from the original aesthetics, bringing something more ""contemporary"" that ultimately doesn't quite work.On the other hand, most of the characters are terrible. They are supposed to be scientists and a well-prepared crew for that mission, but most seem brainless, making the most implausible decisions.Finally, the movie is enjoyable above all and presents interesting ideas. It deviates from the action-oriented focus of the previous installments (Aliens, Alien 3, Alien Resurrection) but also doesn't return to the horror of Alien (1979), providing a refreshing change. What stands out are its visuals, which make you feel small in front of the structures displayed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
To prequel or not to prequel?,"The big question is, is it a prequel or not? While Prometheus is set in the same reality as Alien, and it does transpire preceding the events that take place on board the Nostromo, this movie is by no means a direct lead in or set up to the original Alien.This being the case Prometheus needs to be viewed and judged as a stand alone film of the Science Fiction genre.So whats it about? Well a super old super rich dude funds a trillion dollar exploration into deep space to find our creators in an all out attempt to cheat death.Along for the ride is his trusted android assistant, ruthless daughter, a crew of scientists, and a collection of truly expendible space men and flight crew.However what they discover is not the heavenly fountain of youth they were expecting, but an abandoned alien WMD factory. Chaos ensues and the reality of what lies beyond the stars is revealed. It all leads to a stunning climax in which the remaining crew sacrifice themselves and the star ship Prometheus in order to save human kind.The audio/visuals in this movie are stunningly breath taking. The story for me fell a little flat. I went in expecting a slow dark and truly horrifying sci/fi thriller, when in fact the movie turned out to be more of an action adventure.Science Fiction being my favourite movie genre i did enjoy the film, however i remember walking out of the theatre feeling a little disappointed. Didn't quite live up to the hype. Looking forward to a directors cut, and interested to see how this will influence future Sci/Fi's6/10 for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"All in all, just a movie","What I believe to be the quintessential charm of the Alien series is the way it actually portrays human nature without seeming to do so. Yes, these were simply revolutionary monster films. But behind the whole horror theme, unanswerable, yet elegant questions are raised, without ever having to be uttered by any character. We simply take note of the situations and automatically ask ourselves: What if there really are aliens, but they're not the advanced demigods we hope they are? or Is humanity really that disgusting? and much more. These are philosophically valid questions that emerge subtly from what we see on the screen.""The keen fan will recognize strands of Alien's DNA"". I personally thought that what Scott meant was exactly this feeling that I got from watching Alien: that unexpected ideas pop-up without someone putting them into words. It was not the case. All the questions are diligently posed in Prometheus. They are all answerable questions, so they don't frighten the viewer as much. Yet, the answers are not delivered. That is why, from a philosophical and mythological point of view, all this seems superficial, it feels as if someone is trying to trick me into thinking that the film is highly intelligent, when actually it just inherently begs for a sequel.Disappointing as it is in this department, Prometheus is still a thrilling visual experience.All in all, just a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
My expectations were fulfilled,"You can say a lot of things about Prometheus but one thing that you can't say is that is a bad movie. Ridley Scott delivers again a good movie with good scenes, spectacular visual effects, strong performances by the well chosen cast and a beautiful soundtrack by Marc Streitenfeld.All this combined gives us the movie that we were expecting to have. I got surprised and my expectations were fulfilled. This movie gives, in a smart way, some of the answers that we wanted know but some questions do not have the answers and that is because of 2 possible reasons: - Will be answered in the Prometheus sequel - Are questions that do not need to be answered because that is what gives the mystery to movie, not having the answers.People complain about the answers to the questions but also sometimes we don't need, they to give directly to us the answers sometimes all we need is a little push.Great movie and for me, Ridley Scott did a good entrance to science fiction films. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Breathtaking and profound,"Please, do yourself a favour and ignore all of the haters regarding this movie. If you want a smash em up, loud and noisy action sci fi such as Aliens, this movie probably isn't for you. Don't get me wrong, you get a fair taste of that, but that isn't what this is about. This is a profound movie that asks questions about who we are, why are we here and who made us. It also tackles the human pursuit of finding our makers. The storyline involving David the droid needs special attention. This movie asks you to think and demands that you listen. You will need patience and the ability to concentrate. Oh, and after the credits start to roll and you still tell me this isn't a prequel or related to Alien, you need to have a serious hard look at yourself. This movie is in every way a prequel to/in same universe as Alien.

In my opinion, it seems to be a well done side story that does not fit in well with the rest of the Alien movies. I would've served better as its own stand alone Sci-Fi film. I will definitely give this movie a revisit in the future to see if it still holds up for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Exactly what the doctor ordered,"Ridley Scott's grim return to the sci-fi genre is one of the most marvelous comebacks a director has ever pulled off. Prometheus has reinvigorated the space flick like no other movie since the immortal 2001: A Space Odyssey.This is a Scott film in every sense of the term. The landscapes are picturesque, the set design is magnificent to the simplest detail, and the visual effects are cutting-edge. It has that great Ridley Scott pacing, too. Few movies in Hollywood today have the courage to make an audience wait for the action, but Sir Ridley always has and the payoff is truly awe-inspiring here.The score by Marc Streitenfield is amazingly incorporated. It gives each dramatic scene an added intensity. One of the highlights of the film is the editing, though. There is seldom a scene that feels misplaced, and the arrangement creates a layering that builds the suspense until the breaking point. This deserves to win the Best Film Editing Oscar this year, not to mention Sound Editing.I am not familiar with Noomi Rapace's work, but she gives a strong performance here as Elizabeth Shaw. I think Sigourney Weaver would be proud to know that the role was aptly reprised. The casting was even superior to the original cast of Alien. David, I'm proud to say, is the greatest android of the entire franchise. Scott has finally given some life to the character, and is no longer trying to deal with morality. The other crew members also make the movie more suspenseful and sometimes funny.Prometheus has instantly established itself as one of the all-time great science fiction films. It is all around a near perfect resurrection of the franchise, and in my opinion Scott's second great masterpiece, next to Blade Runner. Some may not immediately fall for it, as it is quite shockingly graphic and colossal in scope, but without a doubt, Prometheus is the best of the year so far and exceptionally worth seeing. If you're looking for a movie that fulfills the sci-fi/horror/thriller tag like never before, look nowhere else.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"I suppose I'll start with the plot, at least in so far as Prometheus has a plot. There are holes big enough to drive a tractor through. The most frequent problem is that throughout the film either things happen for no reason whatsoever or that the characters come to conclusions without any real reason to. An example of this, without spoiling it for you, is a scene where one of the main characters goes through a very grueling surgical ordeal, only to come out the other side, covered in blood, and be completely ignored by the other characters as well as the plot. Another example is a character who spends the entire film doing next to nothing to contribute, yet somehow towards the end he magically knows exactly what is going on. I can't even begin to sum up the sheer amount or holes in the plot, suffice it to say there are a lot.As for the characters, if you can call them that; I can draw stick figures with better personalities. One of the crew is a robot, but in my opinion they might as well all have been robots for the sheer lack of emotion and growth they showed.The acting is reasonable, given the material the actors were given they did a competent job. I sensed there was a lot of ad libbing going on, most likely desperate attempts by the actors to squeeze a few drops of personality out of their cardboard cutout characters.So the writing is mediocre at best, what about the directing? This is where Prometheus salvages itself. Scott is a competent director, even if the script he was working with was a more horrible abomination than any of the monsters in the film. The tension is first rate, and despite all the holes he manages to still keep you wanting more. As for the visuals, if you have seen any of Scott's other films (Ailen, Blade Runner, Gladiator, etc.) you should know by now that Ridley Scott is very much a visual director. The cinematography is amazing, and the stunning visuals alone are reason enough to watch this film.So is Prometheus worth watching? I have to say when I left the cinema the first and only thing in my mind was: What did it all mean? And that wasn't just because of the bad writing, but by the questions raised by the film overall, and a film that makes you think and try to interpret it afterwards is a good film, regardless of its flaws. Therefore, in my opinion, Prometheus is worth watching. However there is a lot of wasted potential here. Going in I thought: this is a prequel to the Alien franchise, by the creator nonetheless, he couldn't possibly go wrong. Little did I know that Scott had gone full George Lucas on it. Perhaps my expectations were too high.Whatever the case may be, I can recommend you watch Prometheus, just don't expect too much from it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Annoying stupid characters,"First let's make a couple of things clear. This will be the second time that I've seen this movie over a period of circa two years. I know that this movie originally had a perfect script, biblical almost, but it has been Hollywoodnised (I know not a word). And lastly, I haven't completely seen any of the ALIEN movies. I have partially seen movie 1 and 2 but for some reason I just never got around to it. So NO I will not be comparing to the alien franchise, but I will be referencing it a little. I know not seeing the ALIEN movies is a cardinal SIN, but there are so many good movies in the world, plus it's not like everyone has seen ""into the wild"" (one of my favorite movies  ), so let's continue.As some of you may know ""Prometheus"" is a prequel to the Alien franchise and it tries to tell the origin story of the Aliens. It all starts on prehistoric earth where an alien species known as the engineers laid the biological foundations for humanity. We then jump cut to the end of the 21st century and scientists discover that these engineers have left clues in the form of coordinates. After a long journey we finally arrive at the engineer's planet only to find death.Let me first start with what was good about it: - The quality of the visuals is gorgeous. People, who know me, know that I really dislike the fake feeling of CGI or the fake look of green screen effects. While not perfect this movie has great effects that provide depth. In addition, great set pieces and props (I like big props). It is a shame though that this was mostly limited to the first arc of the movie.Produced and directed by Ridley Scott. This doesn't mean that it is a good movie but it does give the movie a feeling of grandeur, which is something I've come to expect from him.Soundtrack, the movie didn't really have a lot of music but the little sound it did have gave the movie a mysterious and tense mood.One single bland character that held the movie together, which can be considered the saving grace of the movie, I will elaborate it later. The point is, in this movie there is a robot that discovers almost everything and he perfectly relates to the movies main them, which is life or the purpose of life to be exact.So let's rip this movie apart: - The visuals may be good but this alone doesn't make a movie. Even though film is a visual medium it is an art form that tries to convey a story. The story of Prometheus does have potential to be good however, sometimes during the movie it becomes obviously clear that certain scenes have been changed or added to please a more ""general"" audience, which in the end killed the overall second and third arc. So basically what I'm trying to say is that it becomes boring at the end of the movie and this is truly a cardinal SIN! - But my main grime with this movie is the characters. Who thought that it would be a good idea to put preschoolers into adult bodies, because that is how the majority of the people behave in this movie. They keep doing stupid things that a normal person wouldn't do (e.g., person X sees a creepy alien worm. His reaction how adorable I want to pet it) and that really makes you lose interest in the movie. The only explanation for why they behave as they do is to move the plot forward, which is a perfect indicator that to script isn't done yet. The only person with a descent story arc is the robot and he is a bland character.It knows that it is related to the Alien franchise and it has many easter eggs. This can't be considered a good thing, because the movie doesn't have enough substance to stand on its own.The movie was bad and I can go on for hours ranting about how to improve it, but the truth of the matter is I've seen this movie a second time. The story and characters may be bad but it is the combination of the mood and visuals that have a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" that makes it interesting enough to re-watch it. It is definitely better than the mindless piece of ""PEEP"" that Michael bay is producing. Do I recommend this movie? Yes, but only for one time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
My take on Prometheus...,"I'm a huge fan of the Alien culture, even though the franchise didn't come up with anything substantial in the last fifteen years. After all this time, no one came close in creating such an iconic sci-fi universe which is in the same caliber as Alien. I would have given away my left kidney just to see a modern, mature Aliens movie which is faithful to the classics. Years have passed by, then director Sir Ridley Scott announced Prometheus . I wasn't sure what to expect from this title until the first trailers appeared. Watching these almost made me buy a cryo chamber to freeze myself until the release day. Now that I have finally seen the movie, I must say that the enormous hype, and the wait did pay off: Prometheus is my favorite movie of 2012 so far, even surpassing the highly regarded The Avengers by far.Prometheus raises questions about ""who are we, what's our origin"", the Creation itself, without answering it. The film starts off in the supposed past, where a humanoid drinks a liquid material on a ridge of a waterfall, which makes it's body disintegrate conjugating it's remains with the water. But is this planet is Earth, and is this how life was created?Shortly after this scene, we hop in time to the late 2000's: two archaeologist, Elisabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall Green), find ancient, undiscovered cave drawings which they interpret as an invitation from their supposed creators. These paintings points them to a planet, LV-223, where they expect to meet them, the ""Engineers"". But will they find their genesis here?Though the premise sound good, the script isn't flawless though. Certain elements of the story were left to our imaginations, and I didn't really got David's (Michael Fassbender) brilliantly acted, but unexplained motives. Character development leaves a lot to be desired, but the acting was spot-on for the most of the time. What makes Prometheus good though, is the fact that it's not afraid to experiment with new ideas. It differs both in tone and suspense from Alien, and still remaining solid and entertaining.Visually speaking, there is much to behold here: mind-blowing special effects, (including the detailed Prometheus and the Engineer spaceship, the sandstorm, the aliens) crisp, vast array of colors, and 3D (which didn't seem forced at all) all packaged into an impressive scenery. I can't recall any better looking movie in recent memory. Audio-wise, the soundtrack was great. It didn't always fit the appropriate scene with the highly orchestral sounding, but overall Marc Streitenfeld did a terrific job.Prometheus is an intelligent experience, and is not for everyone. You have to walk in the cinema with an open mind, and don't expect it to be a prequel to Alien, because you will be disappointed. Don't seek the scary, action packed nature of Alien/Aliens, just pay attention to the message the movie is trying to deliver.more reviews @ dumika01.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Positive features dragged down by negatives,"This film has much to recommend it for. Visually excellent, as is to be expected. The film nicely fleshes out some elements left obscure from the beginning of the Alien saga, and adds a new direction and dimension of urgency, the ""Creators"". It feels fresh by not merely adding complications to the end of the saga, as a sequel might, and has done in Resurrection. That said, the film has serious problems. The characters are mostly unconvincing and out of place. The crew of scientists chosen for this important and ambitious mission seem to be far from the cream of the crop, rather like a bunch of immature, irresponsible bungling idiots with behavioral problems. Other crew also show a relaxed attitude to the mission that seems out of place. The plot is somewhat ludicrous. The crew recklessly, repeatedly and consistently ignore the very obvious signs of biohazard, in a rushed approach that is driven by no apparent reason or urgency. What should be serious characters repeatedly skirt discussion of their situation, and rather wander blindly - repeatedly at that - into a threatening situation. Contrast that with the first Alien film, where a crew that should be of a considerably lower caliber carefully appraise their situation before acting. Elizabeth's feats in her medical condition seem unlikely, to say the least. Some characters have problems with motivation, especially David, although that might be resolved in a sequel. Nevertheless, a film worthy of repeated viewing - use local anesthesia for the problematic parts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not nearly as bad as people say.,"Yes, the plot has holes. Yes, they do act a bit stupid. But the thing is that we viewers all know that there's going to be death.

Rewatching Prometheus, I find myself still appreciating what Ridley Scott sets out to do as he returns to the universe he first brought to life 33 years earlier. Instead of delivering straight-up horror like Alien, Scott shifts gears, focusing more on the big questions-where we come from, what it means to search for our creators, and the darker implications of those answers. The movie tackles these lofty ideas while still giving us enough of the eerie atmosphere that made the original film iconic.One of the things that stands out is Marc Streitenfeld's score, which some have criticised for being too hopeful. Personally, I think it's pitch-perfect. It captures the sense of wonder and exploration that's at the heart of this film. Prometheus isn't about pure survival like Alien; it's about the curiosity and ambition that drive us to look beyond our world, and the music complements that beautifully.This time around, our crew are scientists, not blue-collar workers, on a mission to discover the origins of life. The shift in focus is refreshing and gives the film its own unique identity. The cast is undeniably solid, with strong performances from Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Idris Elba. Fassbender's portrayal of David, in particular, is a standout that's one of the film's high points.That said, it's hard to ignore some frustrating flaws. Despite being trained scientists, the characters often make incredibly dumb decisions-like horror movie teenagers who should know better but wander into danger anyway. It's the kind of writing that pulls me out of the experience and makes me question what these supposedly smart people are thinking.Overall, Prometheus is a visually stunning and thematically intriguing film that stumbles at times due to its uneven character logic. But if you're a fan of the Alien universe or enjoy ambitious sci-fi, there's still plenty here to sink your teeth into.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 10.0

oh dear,"A crew of idiots who would not be allowed to cross the road unaccompanied in real life are somehow presented as the plausible elite chosen to fly on humankind's most important mission ever. The mission itself has been launched based on dodgy cave paintings that it takes a great leap of faith to believe point to the origin of our species. Our specified idiots seem to represent devolved rather than evolved humans, as they now smoke in their space suits, bait clearly dangerous alien lifeforms, and hide symptoms of illness from their colleagues in this hostile, uncharted territory.

5/5 and 0/5. Total score: 5/10.,"Considering this is supposed to be a sci-fi/action film, I'll analyze those two parts separately.Regarding Action: The movie is awesome. It does the job, and it does it well. It freaking delivers. Not the best I've seen, but freaking good.Regarding Science Fiction: There's neither. It doesn't have any science at all, and the scarce science it has, is just so wrong it's not even funny. It doesn't have fiction either. Fiction implies there is a story. There is none. I can't consciously categorize this as science fiction. I think the right definition is more like religious delirium.The whole movie doesn't make sense. It's Alien all over again, but without the incredible atmosphere of the Alien franchise, and with a fake, inconsistent xenomporph. And for some reason the entire crew of the prometheus, including the scientists, are the most mentally unstable people you will ever meet. I think they only recruited scientologists.When I say there's no story, I mean it. The characters nor their actions make any kind of sens.And when I say the science is wrong, I'm talking about instantaneous out-of-the-box carbon-dating an unknown life-form in an unknown environment in an unknown natural satellite that happens to have an atmosphere very rich in C02, messing up speeds and distances, incredibly advanced automated medical procedures that close wounds with metallic staples, androids with no apparent power source (as its body and head continue to work independently after being separated), animals that grow 50 times their size literally creating matter out of thin air, etc.The movie is enjoyable, to a point, but if you are a science fiction fan, it'll drive you crazy.And the religious overtones will drive you mad.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"With a somewhat confused story, the film is worth the visual and technical spectacle, as well as the good performance of the cast.","I don't want to pretend to have an audience, but I believe that if a more patient and kind reader has taken the time to read some of the notes I've written in other films, there's something I let on when I write: I don't usually read much about a film before seeing it. I follow my instincts a little and let myself be surprised or disappointed, leaving the readings for before writing these notes. That's what I did with this movie, watching it without realizing that it was a kind of prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise. I realized it later, in the final part of the movie.The film begins with the stellar voyage of the exploration spacecraft ""Prometheus"", which sets off in search of a moon where there supposedly would be conditions for life, the home where primitive astronauts who, millennia ago, gave rise to life on Earth will have come. Of course, there are latent tensions within the crew: some believe strongly in the existence of these ""engineers"" (that's what they call the so-called ancient astronauts), others not so much, while the ship's commander seems to have a kind of agenda of her own. What will they find? It's better to see the movie...The movie was a lot better than I expected. I'm not a fan of the ""Alien"" franchise, and I'm not the best person to judge how well it articulates with existing movies. I think the script makes good use of the ""ancient astronauts"" conspiracy theories, which were heavily publicized by TV shows dedicated to them, but I confess that there is a lot of confusion in the script, things that I just don't understand. There are somewhat disconnected, loose scenes, and moments that I couldn't understand. The direction was in the hands of Ridley Scott, who did a very satisfying job, basing the film on a mix of sci-fi with visual effects and quality CGI. Unfortunately, I think a lot of the scientific concepts used in the movie are more sci-fi fantasies than serious science.The cast has several strong names, and almost all of them are in excellent shape and give us impeccable work. I particularly liked Noomi Rapace, Idris Elba, Michael Fassbender and Logan Green. Despite being talented and fluent in her role, I think I've seen Charlize Theron in better shape and more at ease with other characters and in other works.Technically, the film is remarkably visual: in addition to the best CGI you could find, the film makes good use of very careful and skillful cinematography. The extraterrestrial world we are introduced to is as familiar as it is strange and unusual, and it manages to create in the audience a sense of permanent tension that becomes increasingly sinister. The visual, special and sound effects are the best there is and work well. The soundtrack is critical to the tense environment and works satisfactorily.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Had to see it twice before I could really decide how I felt.  Incredible movie.,"I have been anticipating this movie for several years. There were a hundred ideas in my head of what could be in the film. Obviously a two-hour movie can only deal with a handful. Also, even though I knew that I shouldn't expect Alien all over again, it was my only point of reference and so I did expect an Alien-ish movie to some degree.Then I went to a midnight screening. I saw it in 3D on a fairly small, older screen. When Prometheus was not Alien and turned out to be something else entirely, I kind of had a knee-jerk reaction and was left dumbstruck. There was so much going on it was difficult for me to wrap my head around on the first viewing. I knew there were heavy themes and mysteries left unsolved at the end, but then again that is the hallmark of good science fiction.I saw it a again tonight. This time I splurged on XD 3D(A huge screen with a great sound system), but much more importantly this time I went in expecting Prometheus, not Alien. HOLY MOLY what a difference that made. I actively searched for all the things some people have been complaining about on here, but on close inspection all of the supposed problems with continuity and editing melted away and the characters became more likable and understandable. I also payed close attention to subtleties in an attempt to unravel some of the mysteries, and while some things are left purposefully vague, I have some solid, satisfying theories now. This time I was left awestruck rather than dumbstruck. I can honestly say that the second viewing was one of the best theatrical experiences of my life.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Visually Stunning but Ambitious Sci-Fi Odyssey,"Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott, is a visually breathtaking science fiction film that attempts to explore profound existential questions within the framework of a prequel to the iconic Alien franchise. While it showcases Scott's exceptional eye for visuals and boasts a talented cast, the film's lofty ambitions sometimes overshadow its execution, leaving viewers with a mixed experience.From the very first frame, Prometheus immerses audiences in a visually stunning world. The production design is awe-inspiring, with intricate spacecraft interiors, alien landscapes, and mesmerizing special effects. Scott's knack for creating atmospheric and immersive environments shines through, enveloping viewers in a sense of grandeur and wonder.The film benefits from a strong ensemble cast, including Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron. Rapace delivers a compelling performance as the determined and resourceful scientist Elizabeth Shaw, while Fassbender captivates as the enigmatic android David. Theron brings a cool and calculated presence to her role as a corporate representative. The performances anchor the film, adding depth to their respective characters and driving the narrative forward.Prometheus attempts to delve into weighty themes such as the origin of life, the pursuit of knowledge, and humanity's relationship with its creators. It poses philosophical questions that are thought-provoking but sometimes feels muddled in their execution. The film's ambitious narrative ultimately struggles to strike a balance between exploration and delivering concrete answers, leaving certain plot points and character motivations frustratingly ambiguous.While Prometheus succeeds in creating moments of tension and suspense, it also suffers from narrative inconsistencies and questionable character decisions. Some plot developments feel contrived, and character motivations can be murky or inconsistent. As a result, the story occasionally loses its momentum and fails to fully engage the audience, detracting from the overall experience.Despite its narrative flaws, Prometheus remains a visually captivating film with standout moments of sci-fi horror. The film's visual effects and cinematography are exceptional, immersing viewers in an otherworldly and eerie atmosphere. The pulsating score, composed by Marc Streitenfeld, enhances the tension and adds to the film's sense of foreboding.Prometheus serves as a visually ambitious attempt to expand the Alien universe and tackle profound questions about humanity's origins. While it falls short in delivering a cohesive and fully satisfying narrative, it remains an intriguing and visually impressive entry in the science fiction genre. For fans of Ridley Scott's atmospheric filmmaking and those willing to embrace its philosophical musings, Prometheus offers a visually stunning, albeit flawed, cinematic experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It's not what I had expected --- it was way better!,"After seeings so many bad reviews about this, I have decided to write my first review ever.For those of you who take this as an direct Alien prequel, it might be disappointing since the actual link between the Alien series is loose and unexplained. But if you take this as an independent story that happened in the same universe, you would love it! I find the whole movie intense from beginning to end, and enjoyed every bit of it. Some plots are so mind-blasting that I replayed it over and over in my head, and one incident comes right after another. The storyline itself was so interesting and un-cliché, that you have no idea how this movie will end. Best of all, the trailer didn't reveal much, so don't read any spoilers to spoil the fun!A lot of negative reviews refers to unexplained behaviors and no character development. Hey, this is true to many other blockbuster movies, so I didn't find this a problem.Last but not least, read the FAQ section AFTER you finish the movie, and that would pretty much explains any confusion you might encounter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great start let down by some writing issues and inconsistencies,"I don't usually write reviews, but I felt compelled to express my opinions on this film...my expectations were maybe a little unfair - I was expecting something monolithic and thought provoking. Being a big fan of Alien and Aliens, I think I subconsciously demanded more from this film, which many had touted to be an introspective journey into the origins of man and the philosophy of religion. Whilst the original Alien worked on a suspense/horror premise, and the sequel followed with suspense/action - I was probably expecting too much of the former and something more meaningful from the plot.It turned out that I was lulled into a false sense of security from the start - what begins as a colossal journey into the depths of the universe ends up a pretty simple creature feature with plenty of nonsensical action sequences which seemed to do nothing to further the story. I was also surprised to find that there were a fair few plot holes in the storyline (which I'm sure die hard fans will find some way to explain!) and also plenty of puzzling behavioural issues with some of the ships crew.It seemed many of the crew member characters were wasted and no screen time was spent on them at all making them not much more than 'the guys in the red uniforms that die on away missions' in Star Trek. Whilst certain characters in the Aliens sequel were not given much screen time, there were plenty of characters that did, all of which played an actual 'role' such as the skitty nervousness of Hudson, the reassuring calmness of Hicks, the bad-ass duo of Vasquez and Drake and the slimy, profit chasing Burke; not to forget Bishop who was there to put Ripley on edge The characters in Prometheus are very one dimensional - not much time is spent fleshing anyones back-story out and a lot of the characters are forgotten a few minutes after viewing. There are also some laughable scenes where stupidity is paramount and one or two characters sense of self-preservation are forgotten about, making them nothing but creature fodder. Some of the scenes just seemed to have been created as an excuse for something gory to happen...Don't get me wrong, the film is great to look at - there are some beautiful scenes, and certainly everything looks chunky and authentic - with the ships reminiscent of the ship in the original Alien film, but there are just too many silly moments and too much bad writing for the visuals to compensate. It's not a bad film, it's just not a good film If you are a die hard fan - watch with cynicism and you may enjoy it more than I did. For people new to the franchise, watching it won't hurt, but may leave you wondering what all the fuss was about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

But, at least show a little respect and do not call others stupid among other things because they enjoyed it, by doing so you're just showing your own ignorance.The only way for an individual to really like or hate this movie is to see it.

"In context of the franchise, this is a very good film.","After the Alien franchise's disappointing or bonkers sequels. Prometheus brought hope that with Ridley Scott returning, he might bring it back on track. I recall being underwhelmed on the release of Prometheus, but will a rewatch help? It's certainly got an epic feel to it. The opening shots filmed in Iceland are gorgeous as a bald muscled bloke drinks something and disintegrates. Explorers Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) in 2089, find cave paintings in rugged Scotland, depicting alien worshipping. Leading them to board the Prometheus, a spaceship floating far from earth in 2093. I'll be honest, it's a clunky start. On board the ship, with the latest rather prim Android, David (Michael Fassbender) we get to catch our breath a little as he kills time while the crew hyper-sleep. They're a classic crew/cast. Rather star studded, but playing the usual collection of personalities with all the frictions of social class. Some know why they're there, some don't care as long as they're getting paid. Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) is in charge, but it's Shaw and Holloway that have convinced Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) to seemingly posthumously put this mission together. They've found what all those cave paintings and carvings are about, a planet they think is inhabited by folks who they call 'The Engineers', creators of life as we know it and that's where they're headed. Although the rest of the crew are rightly skeptical. So Shaw and Holloway are in a power struggle with Vickers, while the crew captained by Janek (Idris Elba) moan and David ominously hovers around. Now we just need some Aliens. It looks marvellous. Still. It really is shot beautifully and everything from the ship to the costumes feels perfect. A lovely balance of human tactility and future tech. The planet too is full of intrigue. Tunnels and doors, mysterious symbols, giant human head sculptures... and a body. It's rather tantalising. It's clear that David and to a lesser extent Vickers, have their own mission, but the discovery of life is distracting the others. All but Millburn (Rafe Spall) and Fifield (Sean Harris), who have their own distraction. Trapped in a storm on the planet, away from the ship they encounter some updates on the face-huggers. It's very slow burn, but there's a good solid narrative here and the acting is generally very good. True, Elba is a bit wasted and Theron too. Fassbender lays it on thick, but that works for David and he really steals the show. Even from Rapace who does a lot of the heavy lifting. An an out and out action movie it's not. It's much more concerned with lofty notions on the origins of human life, but it's not without its gnarly moments and those prepared to be patient will get their bloodlust fix. Yes it's a bit bloated, a bit indulgent, still missing the purity and brilliance of Alien, but it is an interesting film. It's trouble is it's not that entertaining and for a film like this, it really ought to be. It does have possibly the most amazing face-hugger in the franchise (so far) and a new Alien. I'm intrigued now to venture on and see what Alien: Covenant does with the new baby. It's still lacking, but the rewatch helped me gain a new appreciation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Simply put, amazing!","The long awaited movie ""Prometheus"", directed by Ridley Scott, has finally hit theaters and I couldn't be happier. This is a film that I have been waiting for sense it was announced and to see it finally done and ready for the eyes of the public just fills me up with so much joy. I love Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" and thought it was such a well done and beautifully directed movie. Did ""Prometheus"" capture that same Ridley Scott feel? Why yes, yes it did.Let me start off by saying this is not, in terms, a prequel to the original ""Alien"" film from 1979, its more of an origin story taking place within the same ""Alien"" universe. I can laterally sit and talk for hours about how I can connect ""Prometheus"" and ""Alien"" together. I have thoughts and theories of how the story, characters, evolution, and more can connect and make sense, but I will not go into that because I don't want to bore you for hours on end.The story in ""Prometheus"" is that a group of explorers set out to find the origins of mankind which takes them to a far away galaxy to search the only planet (which is just a moon to a bigger planet) that can sustain live forms on it. While the explorers are there, they discover major secrets, and huge discoveries that may just be looking bad for the human race. Personally, I thought that the story was awesome and it brought a lot of back story or added story to the lore of the so called ""Alien"" universe. I didn't find any weak points in the story, and I felt it was a tense, suspense, and flat out entertaining thrill ride.The movie stars Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon tattoo, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows), Logan Marshall-Green (Devil, Brooklyn's Finest), Michael Fassbender (Inglorious Bastards, X-Men: First Class), Charlize Theron (Hancock, Snow White and the Huntsman), Idris Elba (Thor, Takers), and Guy Pearce (Memento, The Hurt Locker). While all the performances given in the film were solid and believable, four stuck out the most.Fourth, Charlize Theron again just kills her role as a more evil/mean type character and just gives off a cold, but powerful, performance. Third, Idris Elba just knows how to deliver a believable, really human like, role by not feeling like he is forced to read lines, but make it sound like a normal, everyday, human conversation. Second, Noomi Rapace really showed me, in this film, that she can really act and be a really awesome lead role/heroine type character. First, Michael Fassbender delivers probably one of the best acting jobs I have seen in a very long time. He plays an android/robot character, built to look like a regular human, except he doesn't really show emotion, and he is exceptionally talented in almost anything. Seriously, Michael Fassbender deserves the award for best actor in every award show there is.I went to see the movie twice in IMAX 3D on the same day (opening day) if that says anything. The IMAX experience for this film is incredible, with the sound cranked all the way up and the picture quality looking to good to be true. Now the 3D was actually really well done. It didn't have to many things flying out of the screen (except for the storm scene), but the depth in this movie is so well done and looked so good compared to some other movies who just had lazily done depth just to make a movie in 3D and earn a few extra dollars. I recommend seeing the IMAX 3D version of ""Prometheus"" in theaters.I really do love this film and I like all of the story elements that it adds to the ""Aliens"" universe. Also, the use of practical and CGI effects blended so well together, that everything looked so real and I felt that the set was a real place and not just a staged/built set. If I could, I would go on and on about everything I liked about this film, but I don't want to spoil anything. In my opinion the movie is fantastic and its a must see.Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Changed my mind,"The mistake I and most other reviewers made was to expect a straight prequel to 'Alien'. It's certainly what I wanted, as a lifelong fan of the Alien genre...(apart from Alien 3. I'll never forgive them for killing off 'Newt'.) After watching the film last night, I was disappointed that there were no eggs, face huggers, xenomorphs, colonial marines, very little explanations leading to the presence of the derelict spaceship on LV 426. And yet, there were references and explanations of sorts; just not the ones I wanted, and then even more questions to answer, obviously paving the way for more sequels, or is it prequels? In the end, I think it was all just a bit too clever for its own good, it terms of origins. The science is probably a bit questionable, bearing in mind it is supposed to take place about fifty years before 'Alien'. Some of The technology would certainly have been out of place in the 'Alien' universe.......mapping devices and surgical pods: that said, the adverse effect of the hyper sleep process on the travellers was suitably 'retrograde'. 'Cumbersome' would be a good word, and I certainly agree with many of the other reviewers that several of the crew characters were not only unnecessary, but particularly annoying and one dimensional. I will watch it a few more times, and sincerely hope that the next prequel will take us closer to the Ripley experience.........it's not too late Mr. Scott.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Nothing too new, but well done for sure","Short version: hey, I thought it was pretty good but I get the complaints. So, while I do think Ridley Scott retread QUITE a lot of ground in this one, in a lot of aspects I think he improved upon his original works. Visually, this movie surpasses Alien by a million miles (even though I think Alien's visuals worked for it's tone, just in terms of detail Prometheus wins). It is kind of disappointing how exactly in many ways this followed Alien, but there were a lot of nice new touches. The opening scene was really the direction I wish the whole movie had gone: more reserved, more ambiguous, and visually more naturalistic than the series is. I also loved the effect of David's memory viewing; I wished touches like this were added in more often. It does sort of descend into schlock near the third act, but it is enjoyable schlock nonetheless. Even though I would like to know all about the Engineers, people who complained about this seem to forget Ridley Scott is a fairly A-list director, and followups to his most famous movie series will probably come by easily (so just be patient, I guess). I would definitely recommend this, just to not take it as seriously as most people seem to have.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Great,"Ridley Scott never fails to disappoint (most of the time) and his 2012 movie Prometheus shows cases that. From the beginning I'm captivated by the landscape. Every movie has yourself questioning where are we? Who are the main characters really? And the nature of the events. But more so than most movies Prometheus makes that feeling. The casting is pretty good, the highlight of course is Micheal fassbender as David. Everything down from the way he walks to his unblinking souless eyes portray an android perfectly. I guess you could say the same about Meredith, which is later used for a ""getting laid"" joke. Some minor issues are that 1. Most of the characters in this film are complete idiots and 2. The movie seems to have a pacing issue? Like there is a important plot point in the film that is explained by a character that should know nothing about that, and it feels like it could have been explained better by the alien himself. Also that's another issue, the aliens feel like brutes instead of sophisticated lifeforms. Like they should have made them at least talk a bit to explain their reasoning for their actions. However where the move highlights is in it's philosophical questions and of course, visuals (always count on Ridley Scott to create one hell of a stunning and atmospheric image) I like how the movie displays the questions of where do we come from, who made us, and what happens when we die. Making the main character Christian is also a nice counter to this. However in the end the movie feels a little unsatisfying, as it doesn't answer the main question posed at the end.

There's no depth to anyone and the story falls as flat as can be. They totally missed the boat in terms of exploring the origin of life or the nature of faith. They mention each but only as a vehicle for them to get to a few lame horror sequences. The visuals are as touted and are quite well done but that in no way can save a story that is this poorly crafted.

A few scares and good effects but suffers from not knowing what it wants to be.,"This is another really delayed review, except this review is nearly 8 months late. I saw this film when I wasn't in a place to write reviews and I never got around to doing one but now I want to review all of my 2012 viewings, so Moonrise Kingdom review will be coming soon but not until after a third viewing. Unfortunately, this review is based on that single viewing but I don't really want to see it again. I don't get why people are still making a fuss about it, I never gotten into its blockbuster marketing campaign and I only saw it out of general hype. I am a huge Alien fan, and the prospect of a prequel was very intriguing, but after the disappointed reviews came out, my expectations were very low. I did have one expectation, and that was great special effects, which it does actually have. Way more impressive than Avatar or any of the visual effects films which creates whole worlds.Unfortunately, the screenplay has lots of problems and that's mostly due to not really knowing what it's doing. It ends up feeling like an accidental homage to the B-movies (breathing on planets, monsters, etc) while it's trying to take itself far too seriously. Granted, a fun Alien film would have stuck out like a sore thumb, but it really would've benefited this film. Michael Fassbender is great as David, but he and every other character is under-utilised and used as mere props. It does have a few scary moments, particularly with the surgery machine, but it lacks a lot of tension, and any moment it tries to build with tension, it's ruined by illogical moments and clichés. Prometheus may have been better if it actually was a prequel to Alien, but the ending lays the tracks for another pointless sequel. At least it was inconsistently entertaining when it wasn't doing its wishy-washy spiritual stuff.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A fun watch with too much going on.,"A well made sci-fi movie--Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" is an entertaining science- fiction film, all the more intriguing because it raises questions about the origin of human life--and doesn't have the answers. Viewers should understand what they're getting; it has less to do with action, than with an exploration of space as a means of learning about what it means to be human.The majority of the movie takes place during the final weeks of the year 2093. The 17-man crew of the science vessel Prometheus is awakened from hypersleep when the ship approaches their destination - a desolate planet orbiting a distant sun-like star that may be the home of space visitors who intervened in early human history. The creations have come in search of their gods to ask one of the most basic questions of existence: Why? Although this is the stated goal of the mission, several individuals have their own agendas.The lead scientists are Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green). Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) is in charge--and she makes it clear that if aliens are found, contact is not to be initiated. Prometheus' captain, Janek (Idris Elba), is content to remain on the bridge of his ship and watch on monitors as the expedition departs. There is also an android on board (a precursor to Alien's Ash and Aliens' Bishop): David (Michael Fassbender). The initial expedition discovers a series of massive underground caverns and chambers, as well as the corpse of one giant humanoid, but nothing is alive. That quickly changes, however, and the life forms that come into being are not friendly. The most spellbinding scenes involve the crew members exploring the passages and caverns inside the pyramid, obviously unvisited in aeons, and their experiences with some of the hibernating alien beings.Noomi Rapace holds her own as the lead of the film, playing a bit of a precursor to Ellen Ripley. Her character is tough--adorable and complex--and she can be both the victim and the hero. The star that outshines Rapace in this film is Michael Fassbender as David, they synthetic human keeping control of the ship. Fassbender has been impressive in both indie and mainstream films lately. It's an understated role, but like any great character, there's as much in what he doesn't say and do as is in what he does.If there's an obvious element missing from ""Prometheus"", it's a strong identification with the humans, who are underdeveloped and underwritten. Most of what's interesting about the story has little to do with the protagonists.""Prometheus"" is not without problems but, for the most part, they are problems that result from overreaching rather than playing it safe. ""Prometheus"" has a little too much going on. It's a story of big ideas and, as is often the case with movies designed to be about something--the human characters get marginalized.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very well made sci-fi movie which is a good thing,"My quick rating 7,5/10. This is an excellent sci-fi flick. Interesting way to start a review, eh? It looks spectacular visually and editing as well. The story itself is unique (i believe it was a comic book at some point) but either way the plot will draw you in. Noomi Rapace does an excellent job in the lead, but no surprise there, she is a great actress. I did find the other characters a tad bit irritating aside from the Captain. Charlize Theron was used sparingly so not much to say (I read she was also considered for the lead). The action scenes are paced nicely and are used when needed not overdone. When the action scenes were used, they were filmed so well even with the mix of CGI often but I almost didn't even notice, well, almost lol. The obvious influence of the late H.R.Giger was also a nice touch, giving homage to the great artwork he graced us with. At 2 hours long, I was hard pressed to even notice how long it was since I was that into the film. One way to end this short blurb is I am looking forward to the sequel which is coming in 2017. I believe any sci-fi fan would agree and will be looking forward to it as well. Non sci-fi fans most likely will appreciate an interesting story and well made movie so my final thought, see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Prometheus,"Ridley Scott is back in the Alien universe, reminding us that he is one of the best filmmakers in the world via a taut and well-conceived origins story that answers a few questions about the titular creature that has for decades thrilled and terrified filmgoers. The crew of the Prometheus are on a mission to discover the origins of humanity, via star map they found in some ancient Earth artefacts. Of course, they reach the planet and discover they aren't alone, leading to some very tense scenes in a pyramid of some kind. There are a few good surprises late in the film. If 'Prometheus' starts off a little slowly, it certainly comes home with a wet sail.I liked Charlize Theron as the no-nonsense.

Disappointing,"Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors. I was extremely excited at the prospect of Scott coming back to helm a new chapter in the ""Alien"" franchise.I just came back from catching an 11pm show at my local theater and can't seem to make sense of it. Not the movie or plot points so much as the fact a man like Ridley Scott could have put his name on it. The script was not compelling, the performances one dimensional and the direction...surprisingly weak.I saw the non-Imax 3D version. To me the 3D was more of a distraction than anything else. It didn't add to the visuals in any significant manner. Many of the 3D movies out today (like Prometheus) aren't truly 3D so much as they simply push the background away from you. It's more of a generated effect than something that makes you feel closer to what's happening on screen.There was nothing established for me to care about- no threads to follow or objectives to reach for. The science crew seemed not the brightest... taking careless chances in unknown environments with not even the most basic of scientific precautions. Characters act in ways that just never made sense or brought me in enough to care about them.There are a lot of allusions in the story towards religious and philosophical themes. One gets the sense screenwriter Lindelof was trying to make a cerebral epic along the lines of ""2001 A Space Odyssey""- along with its flat performances (he even has Guy Pearce made up similarly to Keir Dullea at the end of ""2001""). Unfortunately Lindelof forgot that even the most sophisticated of metaphors & plot themes require some minimal levels of storytelling structure, character development and logic.Prometheus opens the door to more sequels/prequels/whatever- a prospect that years ago I might have have looked forward to. But as I watched the credits, I thought to myself, ""when & if they do come out with a sequel... I'll just catch it on video"".",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The story telling,"Promethius and Alien covenant both treated the philosophical question of the impact of AI on our lifes in the near future and the real values of morals , ethics in science . A serie of movies treating this type of existential necessities has a very profound impact on the viewers , an impact that makes them think and question these topics themselves . But, what I didn't like in the movie is the story telling , the actions where not profound as expected and the caracters did not play their role as they should .The movie is good in general

They all don't know what comes next.

"The perfect Ridley Scott movie, executed far from perfectly","Based on Ridley Scott's directing repertoire (and dodgy success thereof), it was impossible to predict how this movie would turn out. The premise, however, seemed like Scott's most creative since Blade runner. Of course, I then wanted this movie to be Scott's best since Blade Runner, but that just set myself up for disappointment.Its many flaws aside, the premise (and most of the story) of Prometheus are brilliantly and profoundly creative. Upon first viewing, the story may just appear like a series of arbitrary and poorly explained scenes, but it's far more meaningful. There are subtleties throughout that transcend the seemingly aimless plot Once you catch them, its delightfully spine-chilling. Unfortunately, the plot is weakened some by the characters' demeanors. Initially, the main characters have some stereotypical identity imposed upon them by a fairly mediocre script. Then, throughout the movie, these characters inexplicably and utterly defy the disposition originally associated with their character. Much of this character dissonance is just stupid and corny, akin to the stereotypical ""investigation of the scary noise in a dark forest"" slasher film mentality. I've researched this largely disappointing element of the film and have come up empty handed - assuring its nature as a flaw, rather than symbolic deliberateness.Poor acting accompanies the poor scripting. Apart from Michael Fassbender (maybe), the performances were altogether disappointing. I really wanted this movie to be a sci-fi masterpiece, and it was - executed horrendously. The story I will forever defend as intelligent and original, but the poor characters and script spoil the experience. The film resultantly blurs the line between creative ambiguity and pointlessness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The best film ever,"This film was awesome. I do not understand why people are giving a lot of negativity, the film is awesome, Now there are a lot of confused people about weather or no this is a prequel to Ridley Scott's alien, Well i can tell you it is. The storyline itself can stand as a movie alone, but the background of the film is an actual prequel, The storyline is just not about how the human race started but also how the alien race started. Noomi Rapace does an awesome job as Elizabeth, which really remind me of Sigourney Weavers character Ridley, In alien. The Film Is Standing On an 7.8, Which it does not deserve, It deserves at least a 8.5. This film is the best Film I have seen in my life, its the best film of the century.Davids character who was played by Michael Fassbender on the other hand, did not do as well as i wanted him to do. His character was not written very well, i think that they may have rushed his character a little bit, his dialogue was bad and Michael Fassbender did not suit the part. His hair style was atrocious, and should just be left blonde or black, do not mix the colors, they do not go together well. Irdis Elba did a suburb Job in the film, and i think he was the best actor in this film besides Noomi Rapace.

A Fantastical Sci-Fi Journey: Engaging Yet Unbelievably Amusing,"This science fiction film takes a bold, albeit unrealistic, dive into the alien genre. Its narrative centers around an ambitious but far-fetched idea involving extraterrestrial creators and a mysterious planet. While the film's premise is quite fantastical, bordering on the ridiculous, it somehow manages to engage and hold attention till the end. Despite its lack of realism, which I found amusingly laughable, the movie succeeds in being an entertaining watch.

Review: Prometheus - Welcome Back Ridley Scott!,"In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a figure who represented the human fight for more, and the quest for more scientific knowledge.The meaning of life, the process of creation; from The Big Bang Theory, to religious prophecies, to dinosaurs and cave men; it's been something humans have been trying to figure out since the dawn of time.Ridley Scott was determined to answer the question of creation, by going to the future, and taking a ship where it's never gone before.Noomi Rapace plays Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, one of the two main scientists for the mission aboard Prometheus along with Logan Marshall-Green who plays Dr. Charlie Holloway. This has been their life mission, and their biggest discovery to date.They are recruited by Meredith Vickers, a distant, cold, money and power hungry woman played by Charlize Theron. Theron does a good job as the quasi-antagonist with an agenda. The most interesting character they encounter is David, he looks like a human, but is indeed an android, played by Michael Fassbender.With rumors swirling for about two years that this was a prequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 gold mine Alien, Scott made it a point to shoot down said rumors any chance he could. He stated that Prometheus was strong enough to stand on it's on as a film, even though it would take place in a similar universe. Still the skeptics did not believe him.With Scott coming back to the Sci-Fi genre, you knew he wasn't going to half-ass it. And it shows. The film is so beautiful, the visuals, the universe which the film takes place in. From the structures, to the discoveries, it's awe-inspiring. The special effects are few and far between, on purpose by Scott who was determined to use as much ""real"" footage as possible as to not tarnish the movie, or make it look like a joke.This film is all about the thought process within. The search for creation, and answers to our beginning are beyond complex, and after watching this, maybe you'll understand why it's better off not knowing.Fascinated by their purpose to find answers, the oddity of the film lies with David, played brilliantly by Fassbender might I add. In a role unlike he has ever played before, when we are introduced to him, you can't help but be confused by his mannerism, his speech pattern, and eventually the reasoning for his actions. Being an android means, you're not human, with no feelings or conscious. David states all these things many times, as he is aboard the ship to help those on board with anything they may need. Here's a major connection I madeBack to the mythology...The titan Prometheus was a servant to the Gods, which aptly describes what David was created for, and, what his role was aboard the ship. Fassbender delivers the best performance of the film, the best performance by any actor in a film this year,so far, and I will be shocked if he doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.More kudos have to be given to Rapace, who leads this film with force. Her character Elizabeth Shaw is so strong, believable, she fights for her cause, and is willing to risk it all. Rapace is sheer brilliance on screen, and is featured in a scene that will be remembered for a very long time for it's horror, gore and shock. Prometheus will be the vehicle that drives Rapace to becoming a household name.I can't over state how aesthetically pleasing this film is. Forget the nonsense like Avatar, this may be the most visually beautiful film I have ever seen. Nothing is given color unless it is needed, every structure and stone served a purpose, it didn't look cheap, and it's simply mesmerizing.If we are looking to minus points from the film, the one thing I can point to where the lack of character development, and the inability to defend the actions of the characters. This mainly is attributed to too many chefs in the kitchen, or characters on board the ship in this case. There was not enough screen time, or story to make each of them meaningful. It's almost as if there were major scenes cut out of the film that would have better explained certain actions, and reactions. These issues can be overlooked, but during the film you are often wondering why someone did what they did, and unfortunately there is no definitive answer.We can also attribute the above to Damon Lindelof, who just so happened to write the hit ABC sci-fi, mind-bending series LOST. There are major plot points at the start, middle and end that go unexplained, just like LOST. From the actual opening scene during the credits, to actions David does to Dr. Holloway. Gotta give us some closure!I made it a point to tell as many people as possible to temper their expectations for this film, fearing, from the marketing, trailers and general taste of science-fiction films that it would be very hit or miss. If you go into a film expecting greatness, chances are it will disappoint. Maybe that helped me enjoy the film as much as I did.Ridley Scott is a master of his craft, and we should thank him for coming back to the sci-fi genre. With this picture, he has produced another remarkable notch on his belt, as the direction, cinematography, and beauty of this film cannot be stressed enough.Prometheus is the most entertaining, thought provoking, and visually pleasing film of the year.

So why would they change their tactics for a race they created.With that cleared up, I enjoyed the cinematography, the acting and some very similar scenes that relate with alien, and Fassbender's performance as David was spectacular.

Drop the exp. for topping Aliens please! This is pure class horror in space!!,"This film is by far one of my favourite films ever. And my second fav. to Alien& Aliens!! I do not understand the score-1 reviews and the unfair hatefulness. Yes its diff. than the first 2. 
So, still this film is a masterpiece in every form. Stop the utter-unfair revs for Ripley's sake!
I tend to feel for aliens/god's, questionary subjects like this. Since most people do not and deny all & everything that is not in old books. Its somewhat clear to me. But no just stop the bullies crap!The colours, actors, shots, sounds and pacing are perfect. Period. 
I do find the 'convenant' far less smart. covenant is very brutal but lacks much depth. This film does not!! Its beautiful in every way! Again; Its in my top 3 films of all films I've seen. Thats partly due to the lack of quality in all existing horror and Sci-Fi movies. But i actually have seen it more than the aliens... cos it pleasant to see to hear and its above all prob the hardest job in the world! Making a better Aliens movie.... Please for god sake!!!! I somewhat understand this movie wasn't in everyone's expectations. I think most peeps wanted it to be topping the already ( close to perfect 2 alien movies) i think you do not miss the point, but simply might not be able to respect quality.

Full of blunders,"Below are just a few stupid mistakes that came to mind during watching...1. Prometheus is a four-thruster exploration ship? This is nonsense. First off, four-thruster configuration is needed only on military ships, to provide utmost maneuverability. Exploration ships will be built with engine configurations optimized to reach farthest distance, using single-thruster engines.2. For a mission of such magnitude and budget the ship would surely be weaponized, so there would be no need ramming into the alien craft to bring it down.3. Not a word on how a spacecraft on four conventional thrusters managed to reach a remote world in just 2 years.? Really? Sorry, I didn't know there was yet another earth like planet in the solar system, because that's about as far as they would get in two years on conventional thrusters, or just about in the outer frontier of the solar system.4. For a mission that cost billion dollars to hire a crew of idiots... Especially the guys with red irokez, who gives out this line: Not here for your damn friendship, just to make money . I mean, come-on, is this the best that a billion dollar can buy in the near future - a skank and a mule? The mission of such magnitude is expected to have the best professionals from the earth, not some trash. A real Mr. Weyland would be ashamed to surround himself with such people.5. Prometheus appear to be using a lot of standing controls, i.e. one must stand in front of them freely, instead of being tightly strapped, like to see the captain standing at various consoles and shaking buttocks during the ship's landing looks real stupid.6. In a mission like this to start instructing people on what it is all about only after they have reached their destination? Is that a quick top-secret military op? Really? I was under impression scientific missions are normally planned a little more thoroughly, like a few years in advance...7. Just as Prometheus lands, nearly the entire jock bunch rushes into the alien caves. This one just beats them all. In reality they would acquire a complete scan of the place first, and then send android there alone, to evaluate the environment before any human attempt to go there, which would likely be a group of 2 or 3 people at most, never most of the crew as was shown. On top of it, they almost immediately remove their helmets, while an alien world could easily have undetectable to them contaminants, that's just outright stupid.8. Imagine you are on an alien world, lost in a damn dark and creepy cave, full of dead aliens and scary stuff, and suddenly a creepy alien tentacle emerges from some disgusting-looking liquid. What do you do in this case? - Crap your pants and run away for 10 minutes scared to even look back? Well, that'd be my guess. But according to the genius of Mr. Ridley, you just pretend to be an American tourist - you start taking pictures, you try to give it a hug, and even tearful, you will probably try to kiss it - for real, my first alien, yo! 9. The discovered aliens appear to be the lost cause. They synthesized some genetic mutators that they failed to control themselves - how stupid of them! That was some buggy specimen they ""engineered"", however, they did make it creepy as hell, so we applaud them here...10. Holograms manifest themselves almost spontaneously. It does look creepy, alright, but I think even in our underdeveloped age there is understanding that a hologram does take some equipment and energy to create, they don't just run through the rock by themselves.11. DO NOT TRY AT HOME: The girl gets herself wide-open by an operation equipment, then simply gets stapled nearly all the way across stomach, and then just walks away. The droid says - that's the spirit, I like, and we applaud - Na-a-ii-ice! And to think that I was hoping for something more intelligent...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece that will be examined and analyzed as classic science fiction always should be for many decades to come!,"'PROMETHEUS': Five Stars (Out of Five)Director Ridley Scott's long awaited prequel to his classic 1979 sci-fi horror film 'ALIEN'. The film is not a traditional prequel as it takes the popular franchise in an entirely new direction and actually does very little towards building towards the first 'ALIEN' film. It does set up a possible new prequel trilogy (if the films continue to do well financially) and I think this prequel series will be a lot more interesting and fan pleasing than George Lucas's. The film was written by Damon Lindelof (head writer and co-creator of 'LOST') and Jon Spaihts and stars Noomi Rapace (the original 'GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO'), Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron (in another deliciously villainous role, following 'SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN' just last week), Idris Elba and Logan Marshall-Green. The movie is nothing like what I was expecting and is an incredibly lot to digest but I can say it's without a doubt a masterpiece that will be examined and analyzed as classic science fiction always should be for many decades to come.Rapace stars as Shaw and Marshall-Green co-stars as her lover Charlie Holloway, a team of archaeologists who find a 'star map', in a cave on Earth in 2089, that they see as an invitation to meet mankind's makers. They find funding for an expedition, from the elder CEO of Weyland Corp. (Guy Pearce), and begin a mission to a far away moon named LV-223 (where they believe the map is taking them). They travel in cryofreeze aboard a spaceship called Prometheus, while being watched over by an android named David (Fassbender), and arrive at their destination in 2093. The crew is awakened and Shaw and Holloway inform them of their goal, to an uneasy response of course. They then enter a large structure they land next to on the moon and what they find inside changes the world and life as we know it forever more.The movie is full of biblical references and high concept philosophical ideas. I found it to be quite a new and original take on the 'where do we come from' story premise; kind of like a science fiction version of last year's 'THE TREE OF LIFE'. It asks a lot of questions that it doesn't answer but that's in large part because it's waiting for the sequels to do that. I look forward to them and really hope James Cameron writes and directs the next one (or maybe co-writes it with Lindelof). Cameron had a strong interest in doing the original prequel several years ago but when the studio opted to do an 'ALIEN VS. PREDATOR' film instead he thought it would forever kill the validity of the series and gave up hope. The script is brilliant, thanks in large part to Lindelof's rewrite. Originally it was written as just a straightforward prequel but then Scott and Lindelof decided to do something different with it, which ultimately disappointed a lot of the die-hard horror monster movie fans. Classic 'thinking man' sci-fi fans will love it though. Scott's directing is superb and the visuals are astonishing (the 3D works beautifully as well). It's a little too serious and cold but characters like Elba's 'Janek' do liven the film up. Fassbender probably gives the best performance of the movie in the most interesting role but Rapace does rival Sigourney Weaver as the action heroine lead. Of course Theron is beautiful and superb once again as well. The characters aren't quite as developed or likable as Cameron's 'ALIENS', which is one of the reasons that film is my favorite of the franchise. I'd put this one right up there with the original though. It's one of those movies that creates a ton of conversation and leaves a lot for the viewer to think about (you always have to give a film a lot of credit for that!). Scott's return to sci-fi should please any true fan as well as fan's of the franchise. Let's hope they do something equally impressive for the next installment.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OntHz3aWug",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"In this age of sci-fi as action tentpole, an amazing accomplishment","Pure sci-fi. Not action, not horror, but a blend of elements and philosophizing that, in this age of sci-fi as action tentpole, is an amazing accomplishment. There are a lot of questions left unanswered, but much like life, the journey has to settle as the answer (for now).That may seem like explaining away what could also be blandness, lack of imagination or incoherence, but in this beautiful and spectacularly crafted film, it's hard to believe that's the case. Just because something doesn't have a concrete explanation doesn't mean it doesn't have an answer. This is a visual film and also an emotional one. The characters don't understand what's going on and they're not supposed to. They're supposed to act and react.It observes the creation of life on many levels, including some not often thought of - Parent and child, Man and machine, God and man, God and other creatures, even God as mortal creator.And of course Michael Fassbender's David steals the show.

Curious about how the movies connect and if they should have made this a standalone movie. Definitely would like to see a second part of this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
technology is killing story telling,"The title is apt because it should be punished for attempting to do more than it should. Like the Star Wars prequels, we are provided with a back story that is infinitely less interesting than the one we were invited to imagine.While in Alien the audience experiences the film with the characters, we merely watch the characters in Prometheus. When everything gets spelled out in the end it's a singularly deflating experience for a fan of the franchise.It's looking like all the brilliant movies of the late 70s and early 80s were so compelling due to technological limitation more than anything else. That, and they weren't all colored navy blue and orange.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Prometheus,"Prometheus is a visually stunning and ambitious sci-fi film that explores the origins of humanity with a deep, philosophical twist. Directed by Ridley Scott, it serves as a prequel to Alien, though it stands firmly on its own. The film's strengths lie in its breathtaking cinematography and eerie atmosphere, making every scene visually captivating. Noomi Rapace shines as Elizabeth Shaw, while Michael Fassbender's portrayal of the android David is mesmerizing. While the plot raises big questions about creation and existence, some narrative gaps and unanswered mysteries leave it feeling incomplete. Still, Prometheus is an enthralling journey into the unknown.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
ALIEN v. Prometheus - I want a Prometeus 2,"I had a TERRIBLE 2012, I had no chance time to see any movies. I'm taking 2013 OFF. My first objective was to CATCH WITH 2012 MOVIES. Ridley Scott was one at the top of my list. I'm a HUGE FAN of ALIEN movies. The stories, the sounds, effects, the thrill of being scared outta my mind. I was a teenager when ALIENS (Alien 2) came out; I was hyped for it, I was young and was fresh off the memories of watching Alien. ALIEN 2 blew me away; absolutely top notch. I was delighted and surprised that Prometheus was a branch off ALIEN, exploring that original seated Alien now known as an ""Engineer"". Absolutely brilliantly written, thought-out, filmed and cut together. I could ask nothing more from this film after my initial screening. Yes, I was a ""director's"" cut. I want more and I wants PROMETHEUS 2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"The concept of 'Prometheus', not Alien","We are welcomed to an earth like planet, uninhabited, clean and beautiful. We see a humanoid alien by a waterfall, a space craft in the vicinity as if it were watching him. The Humanoid takes out a flask of sorts and drinks its contents. Its body disintegrates and flows down the waterfall, yet we see new life form being generated using what remained of his DNA.In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover some cave paintings dating back 35,000 years. Seeing the consistency within the paintings, depicting a star map, and the inscriptions, the two are convinced that this is an invitation set out to mankind to meet their makers or engineers if you will.With the help of funding provided by Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) aboard Prometheus (the ship) commanded by Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) they set out following the map to the distant moon LV-223 with extremely earth like characteristics. Aboard the ship are 17 crew member including android David (Michael Fassbender), responsible in taking care of the crew. The crew find what looks like built structures and decide to investigate...What awaits them in the structures? Will the Humans meet their maker? Will they finally be able to solve one of the great mysteries of life, and the question of who we are? Or will this be the biggest mistake they could make?I could have put more into the plot, but I imagined it could spoil the movie.Let's begin with the good points of the movie, as is with Ridley Scott, with reference to 'Alien' (1979), you can always associate him to being the best in the business in terms of cinematography and visual effects. When you compare the budget of the ""awesome"" cinematography / visual effects movies that have been out over the couple of years, for example, Transformers: dark side of the moon $195 million, The Avengers $200 million and then see Prometheus budget of $30 million you can't help but let your jaw drop in awe of the amazing stuff they have done with such a small budget.The acting was really good overall, I am continually being impressed by Michael Fassbender, and he was extremely effective as an Android. Noomi Rapace did a great job as the lead, you could certainly feel the intensity of her beliefs and the situations she was put through. She started of emotional and fragile and ended up strong, with nothing to lose, but the transition wasn't abrupt but well built.The story lacked a bit of substance though, it felt quiet slow and yet you felt there were many things missing. At times I felt as if the story followed the same pattern of Alien and then towards the end changed it as if to imply, what if this had happened. But that's probably because I have watched it Alien and even though I tried had I couldn't help but compare the story to the original which was a masterpiece. Probably an unfamiliar audience will have a better appreciation for the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Nothing Short of Breathtaking,"Following the discovery of a series of cave paintings all depicting the same other-worldly beings cradling a series of galaxies, a multi-billion dollar mission is funded by the enigmatic entrepreneur Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) for a group of scientists headed by Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) to visit a moon on a planet trillions of miles away investigating the ultimate question: can we meet the Gods that created us?Ridley Scott's finest science (fiction?) epic ever poses a million questions and does something rare in having the audience try to find the answers themselves. Damon Lindelof returns to the same thrills that drew similar viewers to ""Lost"" by penning a script with Jon Spaihts that stuns and thrills while never trying to oversimplify its message.Charlize Theron and Noomi Rapace head the cast as strong, independent, willful women who travel light-years away to prove their power. Both turn in strong, Oscar-worthy performances aside a supporting cast including actors such as Idris Elba as the tough captain of the ""Prometheus"" vessel and Logan-Marshall Green as a scientist desperate to find the meaning of his life.Michael Fassbender here plays an android, David, created by Weyland to keep maintenance of the people involved and the mission itself. As the humans around him try to find out who created them, he lives his life knowing why he was created, and it torments him. Fassbender's performance alone wins the film ten stars. An Oscar is not enough for his work here.The worlds we may never know in our lifetime are brought stunningly to the screen using breathtaking cinematic effects that are not used strictly as a budget expense, but as a character in themselves. The score written is profound and beautiful, using the entire orchestra to emphasize the profundity of what these characters discover. The combination is pure movie-going magic.There will naturally be a sequel and it will naturally not be as good as its predecessor. Perhaps that will be because it answers the incredible questions asked by the first film. But is that not the question ""Prometheus"" asks us to ask ourselves in the first place?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Where did you come from, where did you go?","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ridley Scott jumps back into the sci-fi genre 30 plus years after his two classics: Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982). Since then, he has avoided sci-fi and had some ups (Gladiator, American Gangster) and some downs (too many to list). Of course, in the film world, one need only create a single masterpiece to be forever worshiped ... and the Alien lovers have always held out hope their master would return. With a sly approach, Mr. Scott has delivered a prequel that should keep the geeks happy, while also having the ""wow"" factor to generate multiple viewings.In the year 2089 we witness an archaeologist played by Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) discover an ancient cave map. With remarkable efficiency, four years later, the Prometheus space ship is landing on the moon depicted in the drawings. It's mission is to discover the origin of life. The crew make-up is almost identical to the crew in Alien, only this time we get an ice queen corporate director, played by Charlize Theron, to emphasize corporate greed and the lack of love for science.Once the ship lands, we pretty much know what the search crew will find. That doesn't ruin the impact of the images. The strength of the movie comes from the visuals and effects. We never doubt that we are in a far away galaxy or that the aliens are real. This is one of the RARE times that the 3D version is recommended. Despite the dulled images caused by the glasses, this one was actually filmed in 3D and the effects really pop a few times.There will be much debate over this film because it looks effectively creepy and fascinating ... downright phenomenal. However, it has many of what I call ""stupid movie character moments"". You know, those times when a character does or says something that just makes no sense - other than to create an opportunity for the filmmaker? There are plenty of those present here. The script is co-written by Jon Spaihts and ""Lost"" guru Damon Lindelof. The overall idea is brilliant and worth pursuing, however, the details and gaps are quite disappointing. We know there will be minor characters sacrificed in the name of creating fear in the survivors, but couldn't we have more than one strong character? The Noomi Rapace character has much in common with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, but the others here are pretty generic.Idris Elba plays the ship's captain, Guy Pearce plays Peter Weyland, the old man funding the mission and seeking immortality, and Logan Marshall-Green plays Rapace's partner and lover. The only other character of interest is Michael Fassbender's android David. He models himself after Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, right down to the golden locks. Android technology has come a long way since Alien and David can be quite a wry smart-ass.In the end, the sci-fi geeks will decide if this one deserves to live on, but for me, despite the breath-taking technological effects, it's not at the level of Alien. It was kind of humorous to hear a score that bears an uncanny resemblance at times to the iconic score of Inception. It seems that film's impact is nothing short of never-ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Brilliant performances, 3D at its best, imaginative storytelling, MUST SEE MOVIE!","Prometheus is THE summer blockbuster that everyone should be flocking to see in the next week. This film holds such an original idea and marvellous visuals (3D is amazing) that you would be an absolute FOOL not to watch this in the cinema. Even the darker scenes are beautiful in 3D(compared to the horrible 3D in Avengers) This film should not just be watched by sci-fi fans, but also the typical moviegoer, as it provides on of the best 3D visuals I have ever seen, rivalling Avatar. Performances are Oscar worthy, especially the fresh take of an android by Michael Fassbender. He portrays a sense of humour that would have typically not have existed in this type of film. Although this movie was conceived by a scene in Alien, you do not need to watch that film to fully appreciate this film. This film caters for everyone, to the sci-fi nerds, the horror enthusiast, and the action fans out there. I can't stress enough how this film is for everyone.Im trying not to spoil this film for you, so all I will say is that this film is a must see, forget watching MIB3 or Dictator or any other film, this is the one of the best films of the decade. Its originality surpasses Avengers, its visuals goes 'pound for pound' against Avatar, and its performances by the cast rival The Dark Knight.

I think the cast was good, not perfect but good enough and the entire science-fiction picture line was perfect. I hope i can speak for all Ridley Scott fans when i say i watched Prometheus, 124 minutes with open heart and high interest,and I'm looking forward for Prometheus II. If Prometheus II will have the same flame and high hopes and good ending like first Prometheus i don't see why we shouldn't hope to see Prometheus III.

"Flabby, absurd, characterless, and flat.","This feels like the incompetent regurgitation of someone who has watched a bit of Alien, a bit of various Star Trek, probably something else but failed to understand what makes any of these sources tick.It is so hackneyed in the situations and dialogue it is embarrassing.No wonder then that it s impossible to get any performances of merit out, despite some good actors (Fassbender, Pearce). Elba, for my money the most overrated current actor, is well suited because of his hammy predictability but even then can't pull anything off.Plus the most essential performance of all in Alien, the environment, is simply taken out of the cupboard with nothing new but all of the old atmosphere missing. Maybe modern higher resolution just doesn't work for it. More likely it is the cinematographer getting things wrong. But I'm not sure.The story itself doesn't even seem to offer any answers. It leaves more questions than before but not in a good way, not in an ""I want to know"" way. Simply in a ""huh?"", yawn way.Such a disappointing film.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Underrated,"A very underrated film in my opinion, sure it's very easy to compare to it to the film it claims to be loosely attached to (Alien, 1979) but as a standalone film it tackles some unique and fresh sci-fi. Focusing more so on the science and themes of the creation and origins of the human race, it doesn't boast to put action first which is a step in the right direction although not, what I assume the audience might have been expecting. Overall the film's pace does appear somewhat disjointed but the miraculous locations and CGI well but make up for the slower sequences set on places other than the ship.In terms of acting, the casting and quality could not have done better. Both Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender deliver brilliant performances that have a chemistry that I hope will be expanded upon in the second film (if it comes to be). All in all it's completely understandable why some people may not bond to this film so easily but amongst all the fan boy reviews comparing it to Alien or Ridley Scott's other works I hope you go into this movie with an open mind and enjoy the film as it stands, not bringing in any exterior comparisons.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Terrific!,"I don't know why everyone hates this movie!I had the same response to this as Avatar: that some gifted artists had worked incredibly hard on a terrific piece of storytelling. It's big, utterly consuming, terrifying, well cast and fun at times. It uses modern cues to create a spellbinding vision--there is certainly beauty amongst the mayhem.The movie got derailed somewhat in that they set out to find the gods and end up fighting for their lives. When they finally meet their maker, he displays no interest in them--which was a let down.The intent is recovered at the end as they disappear in search of more adventure. But the heroine confuses ""God"" with ""alien races"". And that hints at more carnage to come if they make a sequel.P.S. Fassbender is a freak and I look forward to more of his work!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"I'm a total fan of Alien and Aliens, and this is a worthy pre-cursor...a visual explosion","Prometheus (2012)Prometheus in Greek myth created man from clay. This is the key to the movie, and the original notion of this creation is told in a brilliant vivid opening sequence before the titles. Prometheus's body dissolves into the waters, his DNA disconnects, and then it reforms, as if from nothing, and a more known sense of evolution begins, with the pre-ordained final outcome being a human species. When the current story begins it is openly an exploration to find the origins of human life, which are thought to live on a distant planet.Prometheus is also the god who gave fire to humans, and this is a secondary but important aspect to the story. Not only does the space crew find hints of the creation of man, but also the creation of man's ingenuity and destructive potential. It's good stuff, well done.This story does not on the surface rely on the Alien movies but it does connect to them both in chronology and in feel. The director Ridley Scott is the same as for the original 1979 ""Alien"" and he's probably the best of the ""franchise,"" (no offense to James Cameron and his second, also excellent film, ""Aliens""). The set design is inspired by (with acknowledgement) the brilliant H. H. Giger, which is now archetypal and remains terrific.The plot line is similar in a broad sense--a group of rag tag mostly American-seeming space travelers find this planet with some suspicious looking traces of civilization and, eventually, new life-forms. Things are not benign from there. There is the familiar inclusion of creatures inhabiting, and bursting from, human hosts and there is a great android/robot central character. And there is a fight to the end and a near death for our heroes, male female and otherwise.This gives nothing away, unless you've never seen a movie before. In fact, these are requirements for this series, because the audience is there in part to see how everything is faring. And to see how the Sigourney Weaver ""replacement"" is doing. And this younger actress (Weaver in her 60s was not right for the part of a young doctor with dreams of having a baby) is Noomi Rapace and she's very good in her own distinct way. It's inevitable for awhile that she is identified as the original ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" She is less fully filled out here, but I think that's because of the kind of film this is, where all the characters play types rather than real full blooded characters. Any attempt to fill in her psychology and inner being are short-circuited by having to survive the ongoing threats all around. And I mean ongoing and all around.Likewise for the talented Charlize Theron, who is stiff and wooden to the point that even one of the other characters asks if she is really a robot. The confirmed robot is the second main character names simply David, played with perfect restraint and cool detachment (he's a robot after all) by Michael Fassbender. Robots are complicated in nature but emotionally rather simple, and this conflict is a fascinating aspect to the film.The biggest draw, and the best reason to see the movie, is the experience of being there, of seeing and feeling the places so incredibly conjured up and atmospheric. It's amazing stuff, and the director has to share credit with a whole slew of art directors and set designers. And editors and photographers (photography being the first step in a heavily post-processed final image).Don't expect an emotionally deep drama, of course. And you'll have to look the other way at a few improbabilities, even in this world of wonderful improbability. For example, why would a billion dollar several year expedition have several disgruntled and apparently unprepared and uninformed crew members? And can someone really have a major abdominal operation and then spend the next hour running, leaping, and gasping (at least)?But if you do in fact look the other way briefly, you'll be swept away and blown away, and generally pretty darned impressed by yet another take on the confrontation of mere humans with superior species. Which may or may not be related to our own, as you'll see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Prometheus: Simple. Brilliant.,"Only 7.8/10? This film deserves a lot more.I watched Prometheus today. Set in the last decade of this century and in the Alien universe, it is a film about a group of explorers who set out on an expedition into space on a ship called Prometheus to discover the origin of human kind. But when they reach their destination, they discover something really dangerous not only to them but to the entire human kind.This movie is scientific fiction at its best. Dark, adventurous, horrific and highly creative, it is a signature Ridley Scott movie, highly reminiscent of Alien (naturally, as it is happening in the same universe). There aren't any absolutely unforeseen plot twists, but the magnificence of the movie and the way it is filmed will keep you rooted to the edge of your seat. The story is plain and simple, there are certain scenes where you'll know what's gonna happen but one must understand the film is not about complex plot twists. It is pure sci-fi, a captivating story brilliantly told. And also, there is a big surprise waiting for you at the end.If you are not a hard core sci-fi fan, there is a chance you might not like this movie. If you are, you will find that this is one of the best sci-fi movies in recent times. There are some questions left unanswered, certain scenes which require more explanation, but hopefully they'll be cleared in the extended cut or a sequel. But in either case, rest assured that the film would have left some sort of impression on you when you leave the theater. It would definitely make you think.So, overall, is it worth the money? Yes. Go watch Prometheus. The 3D is really good too, though there are not many scenes where you'll find the effectiveness of the 3D.

How far would you go to get your answers?,"It takes a very courageous person to review this film, as the fan-boys will be all over you for the slightest error.

It is a beautiful film and a real pleasure to watch. Of course, that is an easy statement to make as the visuals did receive an Oscar nomination. I thought the soundtrack was also very good.Michael Fassbender, who played David was amazing, and probably deserved greater recognition for his performance. It's the best I have seen him since he played Bobby Sands in Hunger.Naomi Rapace was also very good. I am slightly prejudices as I have seen her several times in the Millennium trilogy.

Overrated....unfortunately,"I am a huge fan of the first 2 Alien movies. They are my favorite movies of all time. I have seen both more times than I can remember.This movie was NOTHING like those 2. I probably would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't hyped as being a prequel that is comparable to those 2. I think most of the reviewers are blinded by the fact it was done by Ridley Scott and they seem to believe he can do no wrong.The movie was OK but (with the exception of the automated surgery scene) never really captured that totally unique experience of believable suspenseful scifi like the first 2.I also thought some of the casting was off like Charlize Theron. Seemed to me she was just thrown in there because some movie executive somewhere said the movie needed an A list female character.Being a prequel to Alien, they should have also made sure it was consistent with that. There is a huge inconsistency at the ending that doesn't fit with that. I can't go into more details without it being a spoiler.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

It felt natural.The story was fun and exciting.All in all for me, this was one hell of a ride! I have seen all the other Alien movies 10 times or more since the 90's. And this movie delivered for me!

Good Movie at least as good as Alien,"I almost didn't go see this after reading all the negative reviews. Thay are undeserved. People complaining ""It doesn't answer questions"" don't understand the movie. The search for the creator and answers to the meaning of life ARE CHARACTER MOTIVATIONS not questions the movie is promising to answer. I also disagree the plot is thin or unbelievable. It is as believable as Alien or more so. The movie was satisfying to me from beginning to end, which is all you can ever ask from any work. Lastly it is definitely a prequel to Alien and IMO Scott is going down the Lucas road and I think we are going to see several more installments in the way of Alien prequels from the PROMETHEUS jump off point.

Scott's stunning return to sci-fi,"Seeing Prometheus left me in a stunned silence. For a moment I sat in my seat and thought to myself: ""What have I just seen?"" After a moment of silence I asked myself ""Is this a good or a bad question?"" And in all honesty I enjoyed of what I saw, Scott taking me for a ride in the future, playing around, teasing me with oh so familiar bits and pieces from Alien. In many places Scott dangles the bait, winking, ""see, this is Alien... but it is not. And then again it is."" Visually Prometheus is stunning. Scott proves that he's not just at the top of his game, but he has given everything to create Prometheus a visually astonishing movie despite the alien planet is visually less interesting than some other alien worlds. But that bleakness of a dying world is mesmerizing and Gigers designs are just as pleasing as they've always been.Basic story is as simple as it gets: We go somewhere we shouldn't have and we pay the price. But in this simple story Scott asks some grand questions, which he doesn't answer. And those grand ideas are what left me stunned.I don't know if Prometheus will become a classic such as Alien is. But what matters is, that Scott still has it and he is much bolder than many other sci-fi directors out there. He doesn't want to let you go to the world where good and bad are basic concepts.

Not what I was expecting,"Where to start, OK when I first heard the rumours that Ridley Scott was going back to the Alien franchise I was so excited I could nearly explode. The potential of one of the greatest film directors re-visiting a genre defining film but with the advantages of 30 years of experience and modern techniques and equipment could be one of the greatest films ever.So to say the least my expectations where high.The trailers and speculation online and in print had whetted my appetite and the marketing machine in full swing had built my desire for this film to be good like few films before.I found myself reflecting during the screening on what made Alien such a good film, and also films like Aliens and Jaws. Directors I think work best when they have real restrictions in place with budgets and the equipment and technologies available to them. When you have to build tension through style and cinematography, when it's more about what you don't see than it is about what you can show the REAL directors step up to the plate and can deliver stories of real impact.This like so many other films lacks originality, spends far too much time celebrating how good CGI can be and doesn't bother to imbue its villain with any kind of personality or character.The basic plot is covered in the trailers, discovered all over Earth across multiple sites and throughout all history there is a common recurring theme of a star map, a location, an invitation?? So of they go, a rag tag group of scientist and industrialists with one Android looking after them in hyper sleep. From there you already know the story because it is exactly what you think it will be, only unlike the original Alien there is no tension and little conflict, no horror, no suspense and nothing original. It would be hard to invent a film language like he did in the original, but here he has followed the conventions of sci-fi like a paint by numbers film, lazy story telling but beautifully put together.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Prequel or not a prequel? Really good film (spoiler ish).,"SOME SPOILERS IN THIS.It is difficult not to be really love this film. Waiting for over 1 year for this release was bad enough but when it was released, you just had to watch it.This film was filmed in 3d and the only choice for me was to watch it in true 3d hd in odeon. I watched it in real3d and was really surprised how good the 3d effects were. Ridley Scott made sure it was not overwhelming and not too much 3d. I would say a fine balance. I would need to say to the real die hard 3d filmers, this film is not too dark for 3d. Ridley Scott made sure this was just about right. As there are not much mention about the 3d, I would say roughly 30% of the film was in 3d. The tunnel part early in the film was amazing. You felt that you were in the tunnel itself.Enough about the 3d and more about the film.Although the film is mentioned that it is not a direct prequel of alien and more a new film. I would say for the die hard alien fan, that there is enough to answer most of the questions about the alien in the cockpit. Plenty of nice little clues about the alien!I don't want to go too much about the film as it would ruin it. I believe the advertisements of the film was kept to a minimum, in order for everyone to understand the film from start to end. Thank you for not ruining the film due to advertisements.I got to say that visual effects are very much superior and very very good.I myself, would say this film is a direct prequel to alien. No matter what they did to the film, it was much better than thought.8 out of 10 for me.Although there was a classic ending to the film, I would like Ridley Scott to make sure that he takes a clever decision on if they want to continue this film via a sequel or not. All I can say, if he did leave this film like it is, it will definitely be good as it is.Anyway, everyone enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Maybe it'll make more sense in the extended director's cut.,"One of the most enduring and engaging aspects of the whole Alien series has been the speculation concerning the origin and evolution of the xenomorph, and the conjecture about whether the creature's existence is somehow linked to that of the human race. Ridley Scott's sci-fi prequel Prometheus sets out to answer some of these questions, while providing viewers with further questions on which to ponder until the inevitable arrival of Prometheus 2.Of course, inviting the audience to study every last detail of a film in search of answers is only a good idea if the script has been so carefully crafted that it can withstand such intense scrutiny, which is most definitely not the case with Prometheus: between them, writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof have somehow managed to cobble together a mess of ill-considered plot progression, moronic characterisation, and weak exposition that is a million light years away from the perfectly profound experience that was undoubtedly intended. In short, the script sucks.It's a good job then that director Ridley Scott has made his film such a magnificent feast for the eyes, the impeccable visuals being its one true saving grace. Such is the incredible quality of the CGI, the amazing spectacle of the action, the pure majesty of the scenery and the sheer inventiveness of the production design, that I actually found it within myself to cease dissecting Prometheus and simply enjoy it for the incredible over-blown spectacle that it is. F**-off big spaceships, impressive alien landscapes, an exploding 2000-year-old decapitated head, thrashing tentacled squid-like creatures, powerful mutants, and Noomi Rapace wrapped in skimpy bandage-like underwear: that'll just about do me until something resembling a well-thought out plot comes along.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ambitous yet muddled prequel fails to deliver,"Riddled with plot holes and sorely lacking in suspense this Alien prequel from the director who started the franchise with writer Dan O'Bannon back in 1979 shamelessly exploits the original mythology for what is ultimately a highly flawed and frustrating to watch sci-fi thriller.Taking the mystery of the previously unexplained creature discovered by the crew of the Nostromo, piloted by the charismatic and now legendary character Ripley, prior to their exposure to the famous Xenomorph that picks them off one by one, Prometheus creates a back-story for this bizarre entity, once dubbed the Space-Jockey and now referred to as an Engineer. Set 100 years before the original Alien took place, Noomi Rapace steps into the central protagonist role this time around as Dr Shaw, a scientist who believes that the answer to the meaning of human life lies with these advanced beings after discovering ancient cave drawings referring to a distant galaxy where the Engineers seem to have travelled from to visit Earth millions of years ago. Cue a lengthy mission statement from Charlize Theron as Meredith Vickers, an employee of the fictional Weyland Yutani corporation that is spearheading and funding the mission, the true reason for which is revealed later, and Weyland himself, oddly played by Guy Pearce in aged prosthetics and make-up. Much time is spent between the crew bickering and debating ethics and morality and the should they/shouldn't they nature of the expedition and once the film picks up interest it's lost yet again due to more banal theologizing and philosophising which comes across as a failed attempt to inject deeper meaning into what is a rather simple plot that doesn't really beg to be dwelt on.Prometheus suffers from a disjointed and muddled narrative that crams so many different potential threads into 124 minutes but never fully follows through with any of them, apart from perhaps the existential quandary facing multiple characters that arises and is summed up with one line of dialogue that fittingly surmises the film itself; ""there is nothing"". As if to distract us from the banality of the characters and script Scott goes to town on the visuals with some truly breathtaking imagery, the only trouble is that the initial awe is hardly replenished due to the fact that the whole thing is set in one general location with only the crew's ship, the Engineer's structure and the planet surface as sets, and whereas Alien used the confines of the industrial ship to claustrophobic effect Scott here tries constantly to mine as much grandeur from these locations that it becomes tedious.To demystify the mystique which lent Alien so much atmosphere and boosted its terrifying impact I would argue that there should be a worthy reason to do so and at no point in Prometheus did I feel that the weight of the story and concept was fully realized. In fact most of the major occurrences in the film come and go so quickly and often inconsequentially that you start to feel as if you are watching a show reel of high tech special effects sequences with no narrative continuity. Alien kept you on the edge of your seat due to what you didn't see, and the power of the imagination was provoked to startling effect, whereas with Prometheus Scott shines the brightest light he can find onto the story and shows us too much of the locations, creatures and dwells heavily on the concepts and ideas raised while eschewing emotion, suspense, horror and feeling.You could argue that this is a standalone film and that it should be judged on its own merit but even so it still boils down to being a spectacle-driven film conceived as something more intellectual that fails to reach its own ambition. To not compare it to previous Alien films is impossible due to the fact that it borrows so heavily and directly from each one. Human-alien pregnancy, hybrid mutations, chest-bursting, rape subtext, androids and of course the alien itself, I don't criticize them for taking some of the best elements from the past and revisiting and revising them but unfortunately the new creatures in this film aren't scary at all and the characters are so unlikeable that the sense of threat is heavily diminished, the other elements are wasted apart from Michael Fassbender as the android David who is at least one saving grace. One of the most inspired scenes that hearkens back to the underrated and brilliantly dark Alien 3 involves an alien pregnancy and the removal of a gestating alien from one of the human characters but unfortunately there is such little build up to this that it lessens the impact of what could have been a much more tense and unnerving situation and then it's forgotten so quickly that you feel slightly cheated, which becomes a pattern throughout.As mentioned Fassbender is one of the film's best aspects, but Theron and Idris Elba also do a great job considering the shoddy material they're given and the bizarre and incongruous character motivation, which you will no doubt be questioning at every narrative turn. Noomi Rapace seems oddly cast as Prometheus' Ripley-esque protagonist, lacking the humanity that would have perhaps made her more likable. The minor characters are appallingly written and really detract from the otherwise serious tone and atmosphere.Those hoping to find direct links to Alien will be disappointed and most likely angry. The planet which is visited in Prometheus is LV-233, not LV-426 which is the planet that the crew's nightmare begins on in Alien. Instead of tying things up nicely the film raises more questions than it answers and ends in such a way that demands a sequel to actually finish the story, but if it's going to be as confused and ineffective as this than it's one sequel I can definitely do without.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Either you're smart enough to get it, or go back to watching Michael Bay.","According to Greek myth, Prometheus the titan molded man from clay and stole fire from the God's; a fire which can nurture life as much as destroy it when misused. For his actions, Prometheus is punished to suffer eternally. After the discovery of ancient star maps across several ancient civilisation ruins, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Halloway postulate that extraterrestrial beings were somehow the progenitors of the human race; the star maps reveal other planets that the so called alien ""Engineers"" may have visited . They are tasked by the Weyland Corporation, under supervision from the cold calculating Merdith Vickers, to lead a team to a distant world in order to discover the mystery of humanity's origin. Yet some among them would follow in the mythical Prometheus' footsteps and dare to plunder the secrets of these alien ""gods"" for their own gain.Big ideas and double metaphors abound in Ridley Scott's spiritual successor and very loose prequel to his 1979 ""Alien"" masterpiece. Though set in the same universe, Prometheus has less in common with Alien's chilling, shock horror genre and more in common with the contemplative 2001: A Space Odyssey; yet it's marketing campaign leads us to believe otherwise. Thankfully, a lack of scares does not mean a lack of suspense. Questions are slowly unraveled through the course of the film while maintaining palpable tension and a sense of ""something is not quite right"".The well paced mystery plot is complemented by some fine performance, most notably Michael Fassbender as the android David and Charlize Theron as Vickers. One a creation embracing his creator's traits, the other a woman burying her humanity. Similarly, most of the characters exist as mirror opposites of each other that break the typical stereotypes for such familiar characters in a science fiction movie; the faithful Shaw and the skeptical Holloway, the overly cautious hot headed Fifield and the overly curious Milburn. Even Captain Janek, whom the scientists originally think of as merely a dumb space jockey (pun pun), breaks the stereotypical ""tough black guy"" mold. If it were not for their terrific chemistry and realistic portrayal of their characters, the dialogue heavy nature of the film would have weighed it down.Where Alien's look was dark, claustrophobic and eerie, Prometheus is generally bright, wide and grand though still equally unsettling. Weta, the company behind the special effects of James Cameron's AVATAR have once again brought their best efforts to the table giving Prometheus much visual splendor. From the intricately designed vehicles to the surreal alien constructions, every effects shot is a work of art in itself. The film score by Marc Streitenfeld and Harry Gregson Williams keeps this feel of grandeur; the kind of wondrous uplifting theme that invokes images of explorers braving uncharted frontiers in search of the unknown. It is a positive theme, which makes its coupling with the unsettling tone of the film so much more disturbing.But what is there to set this apart from your typical space exploration, extraterrestrial encounter movie? It is how this movie challenges the audience to think. Within Prometheus' many philosophical touches runs a cautionary tale of mankind's increasing hubris. When analysing the DNA of a dead alien Engineer, Dr Shaw exclaims, ""It's us"". Thus, the metaphor is complete: the Engineers represent humanity's dark future. Like their extraterrestrial creators, humans have created life in their own image, personified in the uncannily human ""David"" android. They seek to transcend mortality, they seek to create, to conquer; their greatest pride is the creation of their greatest weapons. Should their creations not satisfy, they have no qualms about eradicating their ""mistake"". In the process of self advancement, they lose their fundamental humanity, becoming cold, distant, inhuman. Alien. But in seeking to become like Gods themselves, their greatest pride will one day become their undoing.Aside from a predictable final 5 minutes, Prometheus is almost perfect in every way. Overall, the film might not be the Alien prequel some were expecting. But it manages to be Science Fiction at it's finest with something for everyone to enjoy. Hardcore science dudes would have a thrill picking apart the metaphors and throwing out wild predictions on the various mysteries presented.For fans of the Alien franchise, be on the look out for the numerous references to previous titles and a delicious little teaser. For the casual crowd, there is enough eye candy here with great performances set against a gripping suspense tale. Only adrenaline pumped action junkies may be a little disappointed by the lack of said action. Like Alien before it, Prometheus seems set up to open a whole new universe of sequel possibilities.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An enjoyable experience,"I'm not the biggest sci-fi fan, but with 'Alien: Covenant' not far away I thought I better take the time to check out 'Prometheus' and familiarise myself with the prequel series. I wasn't quite sure what to expect going in. I knew there was a lot of controversy, debate and divided opinions surrounding it. I had heard it described as both confusing and ambiguous. I happen to like confusing and ambiguous films because they leave a lot of fun to be had after the movie discovering people's theories and opinions.The product I discovered however wasn't really either of those things - at least not to me. I followed the story pretty easily and the things that were left up in the air really didn't bother me. I was happy to wait and see whether they were covered in either of the two planned sequels. I did quite enjoy the film though I have to say. Firstly, the characters were all terrific. There was tremendous diversity in the cast and every character worked and played off each other perfectly. Secondly, I found the story and the action scenes really interesting. I believed in the characters motives and that drove the plot ideally.I generally think that if I can enjoy a sci-fi film, then it must be good, because there are very few out there that I do like. 'Prometheus' was one of them. In fact it has me quite excited for the next two editions in the planned trilogy. I just hope there isn't a 5 year wait between the second and third ones too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Most movie critics know nothing.,"Don't believe anything you hear from know-nothing critics because this movie is better than most ""Alien"" movies including ""Alien vs. Predator"" which I happened to love.Okay so I am a huge sci-fi fan who has been waiting two years for this film (it is part one of two, BTW) and would have seen it last night except I have been out of town on business. What is really sad is that every review I have read has been mediocre to bad with one review (Toronto Globe & Mail) actually containing some spoilers. So, my wife and I decided to see it today (IMAX 3D version) and can tell you all that this movie is great. It is better than ""Alien vs. Predator"" which I loved, and at least as good as the original ""Alien"" or any of of the Alien sequels (number 3 was a real stinker). Now the person who wrote the review in the Toronto Globe & Mail must have seen a different movie than us because all the spoilers he described were different than what we watched. But I have seen this before with sci-fi movies; Many patrons and critics hated ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (some walked out; some demanded refunds; prompting Kubrick to cut scenes ""in the theatre"") and it was never fully accepted by the public until about a year later (many complained that it had a weak plot which may be true; thank deity I had read the book before watching it). Even still, many people today consider 2001 the best sci-fi movie ever. But not me, for my money it has always been ""Blade Runner"" which was also not liked by the public for quite some time. Let's face it. Only sci-fi people can fully appreciate this stuff.""Just my 2-cents""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Craft and Style but no Substance,"The movie is a good blockbuster. I did enjoy the movie. I saw it in 3D on a 70FT screen and it really does have a mood. It's all there - the bio goo, the Geiger backdrop, robots in the uncanny valley. As much as I enjoy escapism and the cinema of sensation there are 3 major flaws that show themselves at least every 3 or 4 minutes destroying any ability to lose yourself in the world Ridley has created.The first is a visual flaw. Some of the shots were clearly there for the 3D experience but too many of them exist outside the reality of the story and you are shown a shot that has no relevance to anything other than the technique of 3D. This highlights the technical fabrication of cinema and so destroys the illusion of reality. You know you are watching a technique and it is so clumsy and ill fitting to the story that it breaks the spell. Still as an experiment in 3D I can forgive this and some of the 3D is stunning.The second flaw is the countless and seemingly endless plot holes or parts that are just weakly scripted. Again they are so frequent they destroy the reality and illusion of the film. They really are outrageously bad in parts. You think OK it is Hollywood just eat your popcorn and keep watching but you expect more and are given less and so you are let down.The final and fatal flaw is in the characterization. The characterization is patchy and haphazard - with some characters seeming to exist in different films types. You are not sure who you are supposed to root for as there is no strong lead and as a result you do not care about any of them meaning there can never be any tension no matter how loud and staccato the music gets or how gory a scene becomes. You just do not care. If there is no lead you should then fall back on a great ensemble but again the characters do not gel. They never come together as a team. They are not believable as humans or as characters. This is not a reflection on the acting but rather the characterization and script development.I enjoyed the film, the visuals, the experience of 3D, the extension of the Alien universe - I just wish it was a better story with more believable characters. The fact that one of the 3 flaws I noted shows itself at least every 3 or 4 minutes really makes it difficult to let the film carry you away to it's world. Too much technique not enough heart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Movie But Might Disappoint Hardcore Fans,"I love the Aliens series and I thought this movie was amazing and well worth ticket price, but many people who watched it spent the whole time nitpicking and comparing it to the originals.

The movie is definitely not for the squeamish mainly because of one scene in particular. But overall Prometheus tells a great story with a ton of symbolism and the only real flaw I found was unanswered questions.

"Beautiful to look at, but not without flaws","Ridley Scott's Prometheus is a sci-fi film about a group of scientists who, after discovering clues about the origin of mankind on a cave wall, embark on a harrowing journey to the deepest parts of the universe in order to learn more about man's creators. What they discover on their journey is much bigger and more frightening than they could have ever imagined, and they are forced to fight for their lives as well as for the survival of mankind.This film may seem ambitious in scope, but it is actually a sort of revamped spin off of Alien (1979) and its sequels. Alien is a film about a group of people on a mining ship in space who investigate a distress signal and ultimately end up finding more than they bargained for. The sequels expand upon that premise and follow the female lead as she continues to fight the Aliens.Filmmaker Ridley Scott, who is known for classics like Blade Runner (1982) and Gladiator (2000), directed the original Alien as well, which garnered widespread critical acclaim and an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. The film is a hallmark in sci-fi cinema and remains, even 30 years later, one of the best sci-fi films ever made. That said, there are some definite links made between Alien and Prometheus that make Prometheus out to be a sort of prequel to the Alien films.In terms of film quality, Prometheus is an incredible feat of cinematography. The visuals in the film are stunning. From the vastness of Prometheus itself to the alien landscape, the film is simply beautiful to look at.The horror aspect of the film is also well done. It has numerous scenes that will undoubtedly crawl under the viewer's skin and make him or her cringe in a combination of disgust and awe. It is certainly not for those who are squeamish.Additionally, although the acting in the film is not particularly notable, there are some standout performances by actors Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender. Rapace's character, Elizabeth Shaw, is a passionate scientist with a strong sense of morality while Fassbender is particularly convincing in his role as the apathetic humanoid who accompanies the scientists on their journey.There are, however, some aspects of the film that are lacking--that being the storyline and the characters. I found some of the characters' actions questionable and some aspects of the plot to be simply unbelievable. It is understandable for a sci-fi film to have certain otherworldly qualities, but those qualities are generally believable in that film's particular universe and context. In the case of Prometheus, there are moments where a viewer really has to suspend disbelief in order to continue enjoying the film.I also found myself not really caring about some of the characters, which made me wonder if they should have been in the film in the first place. Despite these things, I was intrigued by the ideas that Prometheus introduced, and the film itself was visually arresting.I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the Alien films as well as to sci-fi fans in general. There are many links between this film and the original Alien that I think old fans of the series will appreciate and that will lead newcomers to check out the original, like I did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece,"Prometheus is a sci-fi horror masterpiece. I was floored by the cinematography, the acting, and the horror. This is arguably one of the best sci-fi horror movies ever made. The Christian protagonist is a welcome change in a positive role. The story and film-making were as good as you can expect. The cast and acting were excellent. Ridley Scott met my expectations after his Alien film and James Cameron's Aliens. Although Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection were tolerable and entertaining, Prometheus returns the high quality film making and script writing, and problems associated with artificial intelligence robots, back to the franchise. My only disappointment was the portrayal of the geologist, does not appear realistic. This is supposed to be part 1 of 3 in a series of prequels to Alien 1, which explains why we do not see the recognizable ""alien"" or xenomorph until the end, but other horrors precede this.

Ridley Scott knows better,"When I knew that this was a new Ridley Scott movie with ""alien DNA"" I was anxious to see it. The 3D effects are good, the sounds are GREAT, the realism of the scenarios are superb, the aliens are great, but... But the plot is poor. Very, very poor. I didn't recognize Ridley Scott here. The plot is not realistic. Even on a totally ""out of this world movie"" like Avatar one can have realism all the time. Realism, meaning that all the scenes are logical and justified under the circumstances. Do you know how big is a planet, and how difficult would be to find a surface feature like the one we see on the movie just by chance? Or why that all the people-""meat to die"" are just dumb people? They are suppose to be engineers, geologists, people with high qualification, otherwise they would not be there, in a spaceship. But in the movie they look like dumb people, just meat to die or be killed! Or the ""enforced"" heroes in the end dying for a cause that they don't probably understand yet. Do you know that the basic instinct of all living things is to survive. They would fight to survive before thinking on the living things they left behind on Earth. You don't decide that you are giving your life in 3 seconds for a cause that you don't understand yet. You would at least try different options, them just try to survive even if it would be delaying your death. Only after heroes would emerge. And I could continue writing. This ""small"" mistakes destroyed what could be an extraordinary movie. The movie looks like it was released before the final editing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott did not forget where he comes from...,"This is one of the most interesting SciFi films in recent history.... maybe the best since Inception. The atmosphere is so intense, you could cut it with a knife. It alone creates the thrill of the film almost on its own.Another aspect are the hand-crafted sets. They are incredibly impressive and huge and have some kind of a nostalgic feeling so every SciFi fan just need to be impressed. It is good to see directors still know what real set design is and do not create everything in the computer, which mostly looks artificial. Not to mention, the real sets have big impact in the plausibility of Prometheus.The cast is chosen well. Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender do a great job and you really feel with their characters. Seriously, I don't get why so many critics think those characters are not memorable. They are. Even if they are quite flat and mostly are written in standard alien film clichés. Yes, you got those ""the stupid guy"", ""the nerd"", ""the freak"" characters. However, even those have some good scenes which they do not get in other Alien / slasher films. Even those flat and useless characters find or reveal something useful for the plot or for the myth.The images of the landscapes are mind-blowing. Island really is a beautiful country. It must be inspiration for the whole planet's CGI. You really want to see how everything looks in this foreign place.Thanks to the clear and non-shaky camera works (thank god!), the 3D is one of the best since Avatar. It is used for building up depth and atmosphere, not for stupid ""grabbing the audience"" effects. Which is great and makes the film even more believable.Of course, there is some action but this is not the main aspect. If you want to see Alien bang boom shock slasher, you really won't like this film. Everyone else, who is bored by non-stop-action, has to go watch it.The ending is great and makes every alien film fan cheer. It is a good ending and I don't care what other critics say. They mostly have no idea what they are writing about, nowadays.AND! The most satisfying part: The music! This film has a melody! There are still film melodies on this planet. Praise the composer for having more talent in making a score which is very memorable than a lot of others of his kind.This film is great. Not perfect, but if you don't care about flat characters and some minor mistakes, you will enjoy it. Please go revisit this film.

They were going for epic human exploration rife with deep symbolism and meaning. Questioning the origin and meaning of life, the existence of a creator, science vs faith -- This was not supposed to be your mama's Alien, and in that and perhaps that alone, they succeeded.But despite their effort towards well-thought out intelligence and some beautiful moving pictures, ultimately the film suffers from some horribly written dialogue, pointless characters, completely illogical character choices, and gaping plot/story issues -- and makes me scared shitless at the possibility of Ridley Scott going anywhere near Blade Runner again, which he full intends to do.

Absolutely loved it.,"I wish Covenant had stuck to the uber-large Engineer humanoids, but they didn't so we got only white-skinned people, basically (even tho Ridley Scott said they were Engineers, um, they obviously weren't). I'd gladly take an Alien:Awakening that had the actual Engineers find out that their little band of white-skinned people got annihilated and then go after David in space. Now THAT has potential.But anyhow, back to Prometheus. It rocked. The 3D was BRILLIANT and came at a time when all the big Producers were showing their talents (Avatar, Hugo). Trust me, if you didn't see it in 3D, you didn't see Prometheus. Get a 3D projector or TV and see it the way it was meant to be seen and I guarantee you, you won't be disappointed. Even with some of the storyline slightly iffy, in 3D none of it will matter. And to be fair, the storyline was largely actually pretty darn great. The whole concept of the black liquid creating monsters was ace, along with the Juggernaut actually being a death-dealing weapon, altho Holloway's metamorphosis should have stayed with their first concept with the Alien-esque transformation, versus the Mars Attacks banal that we ended up getting.Still, all being said, I loved the dark and morbid tone of the entire story and it set the mood for way better than it got in sequel. Maybe with Awakening there can be some redemption. Take the big budget and do something revolutionary with Those Elephantine Gods. Heck, if Lord of the Rings can put a huge Gandalf next to a minutia Frodo, think of what can actually be accomplished with a decent Engineer plot (even the ending of Prometheus managed a few decent shots of similar proportions).

It's not quite predictable though it certainly has a few 'doh' moments where real people surely wouldn't be as dumb as some of the characters are at times. It's an interesting plot but it's one of those films that raises a few more questions than it answers.... at least at first. I'll have to get the DVD and watch it some more methinks....It's not the classic film that Alien was and is certainly not as cut and dried - don't be surprised if you find yourself scratching your head at times.

Underrated top-notch science fiction,"I think that the main reason that there is very few (or none) good sci-fi movies nowadays is because the audience today is, impressively and unfortunately, far more close-minded than a couple decades earlier. I am almost absolutely sure that Alien would not have such an impact if it was released today. Same with Blade Runner, or any other sci-fi classic.It seems that today the audience have a hard time untying the bounds with the ""Status Quo"" or our reality as we experience, and if you don't let yourself go a little, a movie that has such strong concepts and a message underneath the surface such as ""Prometheus"" can disappoint because it has nothing to do with ""that's the way scientists react"" or ""a living form could not evolve so fast"". Ridley Scott tries (and, in my opinion, succeeds) on creating a whole new universe and mythology and for that, he hold no concern on a scientific approach of anything that legitimates a universe that is beyond our comprehension, and therefore he has no intent on explaining everything on screen.One that could see beyond that ""barrier of the far-fetched realism"" can enjoy a masterpiece of the science fiction, a movie very rich in subtle meanings and concepts, an approach on origins of man that is rarely original. Ridley Scott is one of the very few directors that still have courage to make a movie that is full of layers, not intended to only make profit or please the audience, but to make you think. If you watch Prometheus more than once, you can experience a whole different movie over and over again.It is not a perfect movie, though, and it's certainly not Ridley's best, but it is, 30 years later, the universe of Alien revisited, you can feel the atmosphere, you can celebrate that feeling once again, and you can see the the master of science fiction on the screen, which is such a relief, comparing to what the genre has providing us recently.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""Sometimes, to create one must first destroy.""","Within the pure sci­-fi genre, Prometheus is arguably one of the best movies in years. Fortunately, it's an utter failure as a prequel to Alien, which allows Ridley Scott to expand the universe created by himself and to explore other aspects of science fiction. Instead of another monster movie, this is a hardcore science film that gets its inspiration from the best of them all: 2001: A Space Odyssey.The opening sequence is incredibly captivating and immediately sets the tone of the film: dark, but not too much, and bold. Besides, it'll have you thinking about it throughout the whole movie and trying to connect it to the main narrative. In the same fashion of the monolith in 2001, that creature will leave you wondering how did that being end up there and what exactly did it (he?) do?.After that, the main characters are introduced and the first half hour is fast-paced and what every blockbuster should be. Between beautiful imagery and exhilarating theories about the origin of mankind, there is a lot to enjoy in Prometheus. In the mean time, the giant human head seen in one of the posters finally makes its appearance and the lack of attention given to it is rather surprising, especially considering that it is one hell of a mysterious artifact. The mid events are not as interesting as the ones from the beginning, but towards the end it gets a lot better again. Besides, there is never real suspense and the main thing that keeps the viewer glued to the screen is that opening sequence and the eternal question: who put that there?.Michael Fassbender's android David has to be one of the most underrated movie characters ever. Fassbender's performance is smooth and unique, which slowly builds up David's intellect and many of his actions are opened to personal interpretation. However, some characters are poorly written and, therefore, uninteresting, such as Charlize Theron's Vickers, who plays an unnecessary human (is it?) villain. Idris Elba's Captain Janek is a cool character, but not as cool as they thought he would be. And Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw, aka supposed Ripley, is a pleasant female lead, but not that exciting. Oh, and the guy who plays the other lead character is a horrible actor.Many elements in the movie seem very surreal, which makes sense given the constant references to surrealist artists, and that only enhances its mystery. Obviously, not everything will be deciphered upon the first viewing and that is, or should be, the main goal of any movie of any genre. Yet, some mysteries will hopefully be unravelled in the sequel.Ridley Scott definitely knows how to sell a movie and everything in this one looks absolutely terrific; the visuals are literally otherworldly and there are no wasted shots nor annoyingly noticeable CGI. Prometheus is a visual treat, and its experience gets even better with the amazingly effective score.Prometheus is a very solid and satisfying sci-fi movie and it should be an inspiration to blockbusters in general. The closing sequence, when the birth finally occurs, is brutal and it reminds you of why you love movies in the first place. And the question remains.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Above average  sci-fi film in the Alien universe (but not making the alien the star),"I loved ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", mainly because of the older, mature cast in different situations: The first Alien was a horror movie, while the second one was an action film.That being said, when going to ""Prometheus"", know that it takes place in the universe as Alien/Aliens, but occurs many decades out, on a different planet, and touches on the actual alien itself in passing. I feel that too many viewers are expecting a direct Alien prequel, which it definitely it isn't. Also, I would classify this more as a sci-fi mystery/drama.I actually appreciated this film a lot, as it touches on some pretty interesting concepts from ""Bladerunner"" (many reminiscent of Roy Batty's quest to the Tyrell Corporation). The most fascinating character in the film is easily David the android (played brilliantly by Michael Fassbender), whose cool and calculating demeanor are in some ways central to the emotive mirror in the second most fascinating character, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace, who I thought was on par with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley).Special effects and set designs were fantastic. There were many Giger elements in here, and the sets and landscapes were beautiful. I did not see the 3D version, but I may reconsider as there are some beautiful scenes that 3D would have accentuated well. If I had an issue, it would be that the tech shown appeared to be much more polished and advanced than what was seen in Alien/Aliens.As for the story itself, I have seen many reviews ripping on the logic of some characters and their motives as well as some of the scenes. I think a lot of it can be explained away (there is a nice ""FAQ"" on this site on the forums explaining the many issues). If I did have a criticism, though, was that the movie was paced a little faster than I expected. I would have really liked hear more of the David/Elizabeth interactions, which would have brought a more intellectual bend to the movie. As for the Lindelof treatment of leaving things hang, I actually do appreciate it. At least that way, I know I am expecting a sequel (I am sure there will be one). I will, however, be let down if the sequel has nothing to do with path followed by the lead characters at the end of the film.Overall, great film. I would recommend those who have not seen at least the first ""Alien"" to watch it for some (small) background. I also think that time(and quite possibly the sequels) will determine if it is a great film or not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A decent sci-fi scarefest with pretensions of profoundity,"Greek mythology, the origin of humankind, the nature of consciousness all decorate what is actually a haunted house sci-fi scarefest. Squid- like creatures jump out and impregnate space travelers, and duplicitous androids poison people who mutate in Frankenstein Monsters. The film feels very much like underwater alien scare stories like ""Deep Six"" or ""The Abyss"". Of course, woven around this is the Alien mythology who seeks to make the non-Darwinian argument that humans are alien creations themselves much like the old ""X-Files"" mythology does. If you like these ""ancient astronaut"" stories you'll adore the film, if you think they are a lot of hokum, you'll still find some entertainment here. The cinematography, set design and visual effects are masterful. Noomi Rapace, despite her wandering accent, is a mesmerizing actress very much in the mold of Sigourney Weaver. Charlize Theron, who can do anything, frightens as a cold-blooded (or possibly no-blooded undercover android) corporate manager. They work well with a sometime clunky (""I didn't come half a billion miles from any men to get laid"") and wildly unrealistic script. For example, after landing on an alien world some 10X23 kilometers from earth, finding an ancient military base, and leaving 2 crew members to die there, the whole crew settles in to get either high or drunk. I would imagine someone actually in this situation wouldn't need to artificially liven up the day by getting baked and would be too damned scared to throw a few back. More time spent on the script would have helped realize the films potential of being a true classic which it may achieve anyway depending on the success of the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I wanted to like it so bad...,I originally have it a 7 then wanted to change it to a 1 but am happy with the 7. The visuals are outstanding. I semi liked the story. I am just tired of everyone in the recent Alien universe being so utterly stupid. They can't move the plot without it. Lazy writing. Surely they can think of better ways to advance the plot besides humans making epically horrible choices and being so utterly stupid??,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I do have a desire to see the movie again and pay closer attention to the little details.,"I've put off writing about ""Prometheus"" for a while, because I wanted to be absolutely certain on where I stood in regard to the much-deliberated question of whether or not it works. And, if it does work, on what level? And in what way? This Ridley Scott production, a prequel to his 1979 horror masterpiece ""Alien,"" has caused a bigger intellectual, fan-based firestorm of opinion than any other movie released in 2012. So I decided to first let the flames, if you will, simmer down and approach the movie, having heard both sides of the argument, with an open mind. Ironically enough, and perhaps to nobody's surprise, I wound up smack-dab in the middle in terms of my reaction.The best way to approach ""Prometheus"" is as its own stand-alone premise. I have the feeling that's what Ridley Scott wanted to do: he probably only tied it to the ""Alien"" franchise for better box office assurance; hey, the guy's got to make money to make more movies, after all. He might have also felt the way I did when I first heard about this project: was a prequel even needed? Did we really care who dispatched that signal that drew the inter-stellar space crew of the first ""Alien"" movie to that dark, wind-lashed planet? Did we care what the fossilized extra-terrestrial seated behind the chair in that big spaceship look like before his insides exploded? And first and foremost, did we really care just where those slimy, bug-like monsters that terrorized Sigourney Weaver in four different movies originate? Me personally, not at all. I was much happier letting my imagination fill the blanks.But that's okay, as far as ""Prometheus"" is concerned, for it only provides a handful of those answers. In fact, in regards to that fossilized alien's origins, it only teases us with an answer; it never actually provides one. Just when we think we've figured it out, we realize we've got wait for ""Prometheus Part II."" What this film would really like to do is be a sort of modern-day ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" It's more concerned about philosophy, about religion and anti-religion, and the never-ending debate on man and his relationship to the universe. And on that level—the raising of philosophical questions—""Prometheus"" is a success. It also has a very strong sense of majesty and wonder about what lies beyond the atmosphere of planet earth. Whereas the only mindset of Alien was downbeat terror and discomfort, ""Prometheus"" persists in throwing big streams of splendor and astonishment. When the characters of the movie, a team of scientists and military protectors along with an android, start venturing into that big cavern on some remote, uninhabited planet and start awing at the cave drawings, the skeletons, and the architecture, I was hanging my jaw along with them.In fact, I enjoyed the sense of science-fiction wonder—the scientists believe they are visiting the homes of an alien race that genetically manufactured mankind—that I wish the movie had not gone the way it did in the second half. I did not want violence, I did not want encounters with alien life forms. It was all fine—and one sequence involving a self-ordered dissection to remove an alien parasite was genuinely scary—but I was happier when Mr. Scott was simply probing questions. Again, it really does feel he wanted to make this picture with no franchise-strings attached.Maybe that is also the reason why the characters of ""Prometheus"" do not stand out as individuals, as people I could get involved with. They were merely stick-figures: the scientist who places knowledge before safety, the stern military professionals, the foul-mouthed mechanics, the emotionless robot devoted only to his programmed mission, the cocky pilot and his crew. They also seem to come from all corners of the earth; every other crew member is a minority. To make one more seemingly irrelevant comparison to ""Alien,"" the cast of that movie were also, fundamentally, stick figures. But they were stick figures breathed full of life by sharp writing and strong performances. Each person had a personality that was distinctly their own. But there are no fleshed-out people in ""Prometheus."" Late in the third act, the ship's captain is told by his Asian helmsman not to take the controls, and they laugh over the remark that he cannot fly to save his life. Just a hint for a dynamic that is never explored or dealt with on any level before. There is also a third-act twist regarding another endless question (what if a man could live forever) that pushes itself into the movie too quickly and ends itself much too soon to leave any sense of resolution or, in this case, futility.But this is the ultimate strength of ""Prometheus"": as long as you don't demand answer-after-answer, it is a movie you will want to see again. This review, after just one viewing, might be too little and too soon. I do have a desire to see the film again and to pay more attention to the little details, the small jabs of dialogue that probably contain more potency and irony than I gave credit for at first, and how moments connect to one another. And it is also worth admiring for Ridley Scott's flair: his ability to convey a sense of scale and epic proportion so sadly rare in movies today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
You've  Received an Invitation,"On release, Prometheus seems to create mixed emotions. My belief is that if you go expecting to see an all-out Alien movie, there's a chance that you'll leave disappointed. But if you look a little deeper, there's a masterpiece here. A very, very clever movie. What we have is a movie that may baffle in the present (and make no mistake, it's always going to leave unanswered questions) but given time, it's going to become much more accessible and open up to a fuller audience. But first, it needs to be slowly digested and understood.For comparison, I'm drawn to The Matrix. Long, before it's reputation was destroyed by the sequels (and please Ridley, don't do that to Prometheus), the Matrix was just a great sci-fi movie. Within weeks though, people started to discover that it was much more - the Wachowskis had placed a message in there. It held something deeper. Now, that movie is a legend: discussed extensively on philosophy forums, dissected by students and in no small part, because of that philosophy, we see it as a classic. I see Prometheus in the same vein. Look past the Alien franchise and you'll see something much, much deeper. Not necessarily more satisfying but definitely something to chew over. And definitely something that makes it a great.In my quick review, I don't want to concentrate too much on the sci-fi story, the acting or the cinematography. What I want to concentrate on is what I would call the ""soul"" of the movie. In my opinion, it's raison d'etre. What we have is a message concerning the very depths of each individual's existence. You can't be given that message directly - only pointed towards it. You have to grab it for yourself.Yes, after the general sci-fi story we've got the layer of the Prometheus myth. But below that is the true essence of the movie - Gnosticism. Each character plays a part in that Gnostic structuring. Their actions and characters are based on it. We've got disciples seeking gnosis, demi-gods, atheists, popes, dogmatic followers and even the Church pops up in the guise of the Company. Scott was very smart. The legend of Prometheus was used by Gnostic religions in early Christian history, so it fits nicely with what he's presented. It's layered beautifully. True, sometimes layering the simple with the complex results in what looks like a plot hole and on it's release there are many complaining that those holes are there, but look properly and you'll see that the vast majority of those holes aren't there - if it doesn't make sense on the superficial level, it's probably explained at the next. Confusing? Only if you don't look properly and that's not a fault that can be laid at the door of the movie but rather a viewer who needs to open his eyes and study a bit harder.If you only see ""Alien"" you haven't even scratched the surface. If you see the Prometheus legend, you've gone a bit deeper but you aren't there yet. The real depth of the movie is that Prometheus is presenting you with the opportunity to study Gnosticism. The study of yourself. Some will say that Prometheus is too conceited, that it's messy or that by hiding that message, it's become bloated. They're missing the whole point.Prometheus is much more than a movie. It's a message. In one of the main character's words ""It's an invitation"". It's totally up to you if you want to receive that message, let alone act on it and accept the invitation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Loved it!,"Saw this film in IMAX 3D and it was just amazing! Out of all the film I love this one is very high up on the list, I haven't even seen Alien or any of the other Alien films but I understood all of it, found it very enjoyable to watch and thought the plot to it was very good, hopefully the sequel to this 'Paradise' will be even better and I have no doubts on that because if they make this film because they want to surprise us the fans and not just make some money then it should be very good, I also thought the actors in this were good but my favourite guy in this is definitely David, his character played by Michael Fassbender was very entertaining and they choose the right actor for it too, the way he was so calm with everything he actually made me think he was a android.

Giant Bald Dudes Are Cool,"Ridley Scott's return to the Alien universe is a surprisingly philosophical terror mystery that blends so many different elements and themes, I had to watch multiple times just to digest everything. Watched this initially at Marcus Theatres with my little brother back in 2012 just like we always do, and then many times since on dvd and digital. On first viewing, this movie left a sour taste in my mouth and I didn't quite know what to make of it. As I've gotten older, I've really grown to enjoy the blend of sci fi/horror/philosophy as well as the larger than life ideas being presented. Although the crew can make questionable decisions at times, this cast was stellar! Michael Fassbender giving us his first performance as ""David"", Noomi Rapace was so outstanding I love her, Marshall-Green was great in what scenes he had, and Elba + Theron both giving worthy performances. I'll also give a nod to the scientist/biologists (Harris + Sall) who had some hilarious and good natured moments. On top of that, we have incredible costume design/sets/practical effects. I mean wow I love the futuristic yellowish aesthetic, and those blue and orange suits are so gnarly. I admit the movie seemed to struggle in pulling everything together, confused with which way it wants to go. The payoff never seems to feel as satisfying as it should either, and the ending leaves you wanting more. But overall, Prometheus has stood the test of time and dared to ask questions you hardly see in movies/tv while still being competently entertaining. A high 7, if Scott ever makes the 3rd film I hope we get something along the lines of this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not a Prequel!,"This is a pure spin-off. Anyway, Prometheus. Hmmm, what can I say about this film. Well, it was very interesting. It wasn't as scary as I would've thought but more philosophical. The plot was defiantly interesting and there was a twist or two. I liked the CGI, that was fantastic and the creatures great and had some awesome scenes but then I can see where people get a little confused. This film gives out a lot of questions all the way through but then it only answers, like, 2 or 3. You literally have no idea why most of the events are happening. Its a fun movie to watch if you like sci-fi, aliens and thriller-like concepts but for the people who think about the story arc and look into it, you mostly base your views on theories. The end was one of the best parts and it defiantly sets up a sequel. So, I don't quite know who I'd recommend it too; sci-fi fans defiantly, an people who don't care about the story lines, but also people who do because you want to know which makes you keep watching and yearn for a sequel.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Visually Extravaganza but Ordinary Story brings the whole movie down.,"I think people are too harsh on this movie. All I read was negative review after one another. It was so bad that I decide not to watch this movie. Several months went by I decide to give a try, after all it was Ridley Scott's film. I glad I decide to watch because I really enjoying this movie. Maybe because of the very low expectation but I truly enjoy it.Synopsis: A team of explorer travels the universe in search of the ""Engineer"" the creator of human to ask them the meaning and origins of mankind. The journey turn fearful as the answer they seek is about to reveal.I thought it was a great idea to mix sci-fi with mythology and they managed to do that very well. I also like the way it slowly link itself to the Alien movies. The main problem was the lack of character development and the suspense that were there in its predecessor. I suppose that was the thing that people are most disappointed about. Not just only that most characters are so underdeveloped to the point that you don't feel for them whatever what happen to them; but also some of the scene are quite impractical and plain out silly.Now despite all that, even if you don't know if it was Ridley's film you will know that this is not an ordinary film. The art and craft are clearly showed this is not an ordinary direction because the visual, the direction and the production was stunning; and this cannot be don't if you don't have years of experience. Visually the CGI are just breath taking (especially the opening credit) As for the cast I thought they did a very decent job. Fassbender as an android steal the whole show and is by far the best actor. Noomi Rapace also did a pretty good job too. Apart from these two people I hardly see any reason for other character particularly Guy Pearce who appear for like 2 minutes and the other appear here and there briefly.I enjoy the whole film and wish it was a little longer. Yes, the story was not good it wasn't a real mess; it is still watchable and pretty much enjoyable if your expectation was very low.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"That strange little living creature inside you - why ""Prometheus"" is better than Alien","Now I grabbed your attention with this provocative title of my review, we can start.First of all, why this movie is better than ""Alien"" - well, it's not because I'm dissing or ignoring cult bliss was original movie (and sequel from sci-fi action mastermind Cameroon), not at all. I'm saying this because it's totally different movie.Bummer, isn't it? Unfortunately, FOX marketing had little choice than market is as Alien prequel, but if you are looking for better ""Alien""/""Aliens"", you are in for disappointment (and what quite a number of internet reviews indicates, you won't be alone in this). Because this movie, while it has very strong horror shocks (girls, you are totally warned for certain scene in this movie, be ready to close your eyes), is totally different beast - with ""brain"" I would say. It is very provocative, much provocative than current Darwinism versus Creationism discussion about our roots - from where we are and what's most importantly, where we are going. It doesn't assume anything, it let's story flow trough scenery and you. And yes, there are questions to be answered, but as any good movie, it rises quite a few itself. It's set in Alien universe, it has lot of common with original, but it goes in totally different direction.What can and will rise confusion that it feels that something is missing - authors choose quite risky path intentionally not telling whole story (reason why people passionately love/hate movies constructed as flashback series). However, lot of things you will get after very long hours of thinking about this movie - like beauty and significance of the first scene. It is intelligent and enigmatic and can be frustrating as any of your friends-smartypants when they smile secretly and give you small doses of information while refusing to tell big picture in one big swoop.In visual sense this movie is astonishing masterpiece - this is how space sci-fi should be made, guys (and it's cheaper than Green Lantern). Cinematography, music, sound and crushing performances from Michael Fassbender as droid David (I request an Oscar for this guy) and Noomi Rapace (NOT a Ripley, but with survival instincts and soul on her own) are things what makes this movie instant classic. What most important that waiting for another cinema grandmaster to do 3D has total payback here, Scott has done amazing things with it, first time I didn't want to throw up and run to 2D.So in nutshell, even if you feel you'll will disappointed because of direction ""Prometheus"" took, go out and check it by yourself, because it's worth admission. Even if you won't like it, it will make you think.p.s. one interesting thing - yesterday I thought my score will be 8, this morning 9, but now I'm ready to make it to the 10. All because of afterthoughts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Confused? No. Unsure? Absolutely,"The tone and tension of this highly anticipated film is so very different from any Alien film made to date. This really gives the audience the sense that this is a stand alone film with different ideas and a different approach in many different ways. This is especially true later into the film.From the start no time is wasted on having the audience knowing who is who and what the general goal is for most of the main cast. After this the film keeps a steady pace and it keeps asking questions for which you are so involved at this point, you can not wait to find out the answers. Unfortunately some of the answers do not come and the ones that do you a left with asking yourself 'why did they do it like that?' and 'it would have been better if this happened.' The film takes a path which is based on mythos and big questions with a couple of actions scenes which just felt thrown in for the sake of it, which were not anything special either.The more I write about the points I felt were a negativity in the film the more Im thinking I should put it down a star... but this flick does have it's good aspects though. The sfx were really fantastic although the 3D was poor and irrelevant like most 3D films. This obviously gave the film a dark back light and I was definitely wishing I had seen the 2D version but hey I was too late for that showing so what can you do? The cast were solid and It was a pleasant surprise to see Rafe Spall with a minor part as well as that creepy fellow from a lonely place to die. Noomi Rapace had a solid performance once again and Logan Marshall-Green put in a good performance too, even if he did feel like a poor mans Tom Hardy (Kind of like how Dennis Quaid is to Harrison Ford).Michael Fassbender on the other hand had the stand out performance and every new role he has he just looks better and better. Fassbenders performance is one of the real qualities of the film which also reminds you that this is set in the same 'Universe' which held Riply and a whole lot of Xenomorphs (Aliens).Ridley Scott's Prometheus is not without it's flaws but none the less this is a good watch and definitely one to see at the Cinema. I give it 6/10 because it is better than average but not particularly great but let's hope we get a Director's cut to answers a few more of those questions.

The search for the ""engineers"" that made us what we are today, is a very interesting subject, and theories regarding this issue will always be the motivation for directors all over the world. Trying to explain who our makers are, is very challenging, but also a difficult and delicate job to do.Great job Ridely Scott!

The Desert,"This has been coming a long time now. To my knowledge, the earliest mention is in promotional interviews for the first Alien, with Scott explaining he would like to explore 'origins' in a possible next film. And again when he was contacted in the early stages for the third film, which he would only do if he could 'go back' to the Engineers. So, Scott had a lot of time to think about ways of messing this up, and by the time he finally secured the funds and go-ahead, enough clout as a movie man to do it his way.His way is never really interesting. He is, like Kubrick whom he has modeled some of his best work after, someone who makes films by obsessively inch-by-inch controlling as he envisions, it never just springs - unlike Kubrick, he doesn't graft this in some bold narrative gambit. Because of this, he has made some epic but soulless films, or of artificial soul.Alien was so powerful because it wasn't done his way. He had some control. He was as still is on occasion, a powerful cameraman. But, the fabric of the film was the product of visionaries other than whoever happened to be on studio payroll - Moebius, Giger, Foss, guys who designed in coherent damage. And he was open to the adventure of working with these guys, open to incorporate lights from a nearby rehearsal of a laser show by The Who, Texas Chainsaw in his visual arsenal -at the behest of O'Bannon- and so forth.The result was something machine-controlled -reflected in the Mother-Ash controlled narrative- but injected with chaos from this journey of discovery. It had many kinds of logic, different walls and types of camera - wonderful stuff all-around, one of the best.This is a failure in a number of ways. The frequent complaint is about the script, which incorporates ideas originally left out from O'Bannon's first script. The whole business with astral visitors for one, typical Von Dainiken crap. Tying this to religion in an obvious , non-intuitive way. Unimaginative 'xeno' creatures. All sorts of other things.Mainly though, you will see why he gets it off in the replicant. He is our main anchor in the film - someone who is empty inside, so has capacity to be filled by anything he encounters.We're shown clips of Lawrence of Arabia, which he watches on the long journey to discovery as everybody else sleeps in cryobeds, the only one awake among dreamers. Two quotes by Lawrence, both of them powerful stuff.""There is nothing in the desert, and no man wants nothing"" is the first - the desert of existential soul-searching, which is the main narrative thrust.""The trick is not minding that it hurts"" the second, even more resonant about the quest for answers and meaning.The thing is, we didn't want to know about the Engineers, none of us. We only thought we did all these years, because as viewers we don't know how or why storytelling affects us deeply. We don't know that when you set us up for nothing, you rejuvenate our capacity to imagine and see unobstructed horizons. That this blank spot in the first Alien enhanced everything else.We don't know that we incorporate this in our lives every time we surprise ourselves, by loving, by creative passion, by inexplicable inspiration. That we don't ""mind"" that these things often hurt, these intangible non-things. Deep down, that when we lose ourselves in something, this invigorates because we only lose the self that ""minds"" in the narrow limits of thought.Scott should know. The main reason we come to see the more serious stuff is because the filmmaker knows better than we do, he can tune and play us in a new way. This closes portals, limits us as viewers.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Revisiting the horror,"As a big fan of the very first ""Alien"" movie, the third and fourth installment brought me nothing but disappointment, regardless of Sigourney Weaver's efforts to revive the one and only Ripley.""Prometheus"", as it should be, is a prequel to everything I always wish I could further understand: the birth of the acid bleeding monster we so much love. It's a big production that leaves nothing to be desired, from the hands of our beloved Ridley Scott. If too soon to become a classic, it should not take long to belong in that category, making me believe that, if ""Alien"" was ever destined to be a trilogy, this is it. It doesn't really start with the first movie, but actually with this one. It's sleek, subtle and most of all, has the special touch of a great director who understands his craft and the passion for the story. It's great not only for the fans, but for everyone who fell in love with the franchise a long time ago. Now it's time to experience it all over again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"May be best of the year, but not best of the genre.","I like Prometheus, i like the idea, i like the plot, but may be some of the part can be better?No doubt, this is a big hit in year 2012, and for a sci-fi thriller film, it definitely a must see, but just personally feel that there's still have some ""missing part"" in the entire story line. Still not the perfect yet, thats why may be they want it a sequel?Ridley Scott, one of my favorite film director. The way he directed the thriller was really classic! Now as for the prequel of Alien, and this is the most attracted me to watch this film! The ""stage"", sets, effects, feel of thrill, Ridley Scott can deliver such a detail in this film. And the performance of Naomi, is a break through! Naomi is real talented.Prometheus definitely will deliver the intense, the darker of a sci-fi thriller, but not another classic yet. Anyway, I did enjoy the whole film, and will wait for more on the DVD features and also sequel of Promotheus.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Perfection from a Master Film Maker,"Im amazed on a regular basis by how vocal the ""Haters"" are these days. Life's rejects have found a voice in computers and the Internet. Thus, they feel powerful when they get to rip apart movies such as PROMETHEUS. Despite the poor reception many of the tiny voices are offering here, I wish to stand on a mountain top to proclaim my absolute LOVE for this film. I expected everything and walked away with so much more. I was just a boy when the first Alien came out, yet I remember it like it was yesterday. I received the large Alien toy for Christmas. It's been a long time... And well worth the wait. Prometheus is the thinking mans/woman's science fiction film. With each door that closes, 3 new ones open up. I was in awe of the majestic beauty of this film. The utter awesomeness that unfolds. I was transported to another universe and the worst part of all of it is that it eventually ends. It's magic the way it's plot opens like the blooming of a flower, or the unfolding of the flaps on an alien egg. Does it satisfy? Does it answer all our questions? Do we see aliens? Does it do the series justice? I think so... But that's for you to decide. You can either have a small voice and complain and be bitter or you can sit back and enjoy the art and majesty that is PROMETHEUS.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Groundbreaking it is not, but Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi is visually astounding, grippingly-told horror that thrills and intrigues as his original 'Alien'","How thoroughly distressing it must be for Ridley Scott to watch one of his beloved creations desecrated by one filmmaker after another with each successively disappointing entry in the 'Alien' franchise, so much so that after a thirty-year hiatus from the science-fiction genre, Scott has decided once more to revisit the very series that has defined his entry into Hollywood. And what better way to return than to go all the way back, even before the point when the spaceship Nostromo first picked up that unknown signal from what seemed to be a desolate planetoid.It should come as no surprise by now that 'Prometheus' is the first of a two-parter meant to explore the origins of the iconic extraterrestrial lifeform known simply as the 'Alien'- but in doing so, Scott has also boldly attempted to uncover the very origins of human life. Where do we come from? Why are we here? Indeed, these are the big questions at the heart of the movie- though in the minds of 'Alien' fans, the more important question probably is this: How is the search for mankind's beginnings related to the beginnings of another creature so far ahead in the chain of evolution?Not many summer blockbusters have the gumption to play with such abstract ideas and concepts, so kudos to Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof for their ambition. Don't expect however an easy answer at the end of the film- in fact, it's likely that you'll be left with even more questions than answers, a deliberate but undeniably effective ploy at whetting your appetite for the next one to come. Though not fully explored here, its thematic question of the nature of mankind's creator- given our twin propensities for creation and destruction- is fascinating while it lasts and should serve well as intellectual fodder for the sci- fi geeks.Nonetheless, it's likely that they will be- like us- already geeking out at the similarities between this movie and 'Alien'. In place of Sigourney Weaver is 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's' Noomi Rapace, the latter an archaeologist named Elizabeth Shaw whose discovery of similarities between ancient cave paintings from different parts of the world has led to the said life-finding expedition. Like Weaver, Rapace epitomises the strong-willed independent heroine- and nowhere is this more apparent than in a classic-in-the-making moment where Shaw climbs into an auto-surgery machine to remove a non-human foetus from inside her womb.Similarly, Ian Holm's Ash has found its equivalent here in Michael Fassbender's android David, whose loyalties and humanness are just as necessarily suspect. Whereas Holm's identity was kept hidden till halfway through the film, Fassbender's is known right from the beginning- and that knowledge only makes you admire his class-act performance in human verisimilitude even more. Mirroring both his looks and diction after Peter O' Toole's in 'Lawrence of Arabia', Fassbender nails the portrayal of a half-human half-machine confused over its own identity, and is easily the standout among the ensemble cast.Scott is fully aware that character is key for his audience to be invested in the adventure, so he avoids the obvious stereotypes in the rest of the supporting crew. Despite being Shaw's academic and romantic other half, Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) turns out to be on the opposite side of the fence in the debate between God and Darwinism. More than just another seen-it-all captain, Idris Elba's world-weary Janek gets a nice heroic turn as things go from bad to bad-ass worse. And ice-queen Charlize Theron's corporate rep Meredith Vickers turns out to be more than just another easy villainous target in a late twist that reveals much more to her background for Weyland Corporation, the company which had bankrolled the current voyage.Just as in 'Alien', the dynamics between the various characters keep the pace humming and the tension rising- in particular when David's agenda is finally revealed, together with the surprise appearance of Guy Pearce in almost unrecognisable makeup. Demonstrating his assuredness as a filmmaker, Scott juggles both the character dynamics and the story developments confidently. The first two-thirds of the movie basks in the same sense of eerie intrigue that made 'Alien' such a discomforting but utterly gripping watch, as Scott lets his audience acquaint themselves with the crew of the 'Prometheus' as well as the elaborately designed labyrinth of chambers and tunnels within which the imminent terror awaits.The latter itself deserves special mention- Arthur Max's set design is stunning, expanding H.R. Giger's original designs of both the 'Alien' spacecraft to an entire subterranean world complete with a Mayan-temple like chamber that houses a humbling statue of a human head. Just as breathtaking are Dariusz Wolski's epic vistas of the rugged planet, even more spectacular in 3D- demonstrating once again how the third dimension can be exploited to its full potential at the hands of filmmakers at the top of their craft. On top of it all is Scott, the once-commercials director continuing to impress as a visual storyteller, synthesising the cinematography, set design and art direction into one seamless and visually astounding whole.Yet despite its strengths, it's very likely that 'Prometheus' will still be greeted with some disappointment especially from fans looking for Scott's return to the sci-fi genre to herald a seminal epic in the vein of '2001'. To be sure, it doesn't reinvent the genre, even though its philosophical musings of creator and creation may suggest that it has something groundbreaking to offer. But it more than lives up to the legacy Scott had created with 'Alien', and this thoroughly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thrilling sci-fi horror breathes life once again into the 'Alien' mythology that no other entry since 'Aliens' has been able to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A brief take on Prometheus,"Just back from seeing it (only about a dozen people in the cinema so wasn't disturbed, which was good).Generally I liked it, there was much to niggle however, it could have been brilliant and it could have been a great direct prequel to Alien with a couple of tweaks.I won't go into the story itself but just rank the elements:Visuals - Superb, bar a couple of minor niggles, even the 3D worked quite well 9/10Sound - Great, lacked the jump moments of previous Aliens films though 8/10Soundtrack - Superb, linked well to Alien, sat well in the sequences 9/10Characters - One of the weaker elements, quite frankly I didn't give a monkeys who lived and who died (I would have quite liked a couple of stasis tubes to have failed before they had even arrived), most of them were pretty unlikeable, however David was excellent and Shaw improved as the film went on 5/10Plot - Didn't explain everything in detail, that's fine I don't need to be spoon fed, though the instant and often wild speculation offered was rather pants, several of the twists were quite frankly stupid and there were enough holes to traverse a Commercial Towing Ship along with it's massive Mineral Ore Refinery through 5/10Overall - 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This Visually Stunning masterpiece is 100x the 1979 Alien...!!,"I just watched this movie in the theater. My first reaction was to watch it few more times..!! I think i should thank Ridley and his crew including the Lost creator.. for helming this superb piece of cinema. I know after today, this movie will be reviewed and criticized further more till we get a Directors cut..:-). For me, having watched almost all 1970+ to 2010+ sci-fi thrillers, this is for sure the best movie i was ever watched. Why i say this is 100X the 1979 alien.. the original alien has a simple sequential single threaded horror story .. which in itself was a masterpiece and trailblazer, setting benchmark for other alie**nistic movies. I cant describe enough to say how visually stunning the special effects are for this movie.. its simply outstanding..On the acting department, Noomi, Charlize, Idris excel and make us believe their excitement. Michael Fassbender is a revelation and gives one of his best controller performances.. I think this movie can spawn multiple sequels and spin-offs .. firstly on the origins of the engineer and their planet.. secondly the plant like alien which thrive on this planet, thirdly the egg containers and their alien like creatures.. fourthly how these creatures spawn the evil xenomorphs.. aka aliens. There are lots of open ended questions that remain to be answered.. and perhaps will be answered in at least 2 sequels i think.. I wonder those who criticize this movie .. what were they thinking in their head.. to see another horror story of alien rampage of humans?? I think this movie is beyond all of it.. and more importantly the ever curious notion of the origin of mankind. One thing i want to warn the viewers is that .. this movie doesn't start slow and ends with a bang.. it just opens up in few different directions and ends with too many directions.. which is why this may not be as horrifying as the 1979 Alien classic. This is a pure sci-fi breakthrough movie which will surely leaves you in awe and speechless. Another note is.. please watch it on 3D.. as its multi-layered screens hots and its so complex scenes can only be enjoyed with 3D. Someone said.. the music in this movie is loud and deafening.. its nothing like that.. and music is actually good and effective. I look forward to the following sequels.. Space Jockey, Engineer, David, Weyland enterprise the beginnings.. Alien.. origins.. etc etc..!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
My theory: It's the studio's fault,"Don't compare it with the first two Alien movies and you might enjoy it!Prometheus for me is the most disappointing movie in history. Maybe it's because of the buzz, trailers and overall marketing campaign being so intense and promising that basically no movie in the end could live up to that.BUT: I believe that Scott's original cut was at least 30 minutes longer. Some scenes from the trailers & teasers were not in the final cut (f.e. ""you're smiling"", and when Shaw stands in front of the mirror folding her hands to pray (a very powerful scene by the way), the powerful speech of Weyland (and this is the only reason why they haven't cast an old actor for the role...and Guy had to go through all the make- up torture). And this might just be the tip of the iceberg. It explains why there are so many plot holes and the film seems so rushed. There is basically no build-up of suspense, it feels rather like a plain ""ticking off"" project milestones. I would even go as far as to say that the movie has no soul - something that made the first two Alien movies so magnificent.So basically with a big budget movie at hand I guess the studio's options were either an R rating with not more than 2h running time, or PG-13 with 150-180 minutes (like Avatar). Unfortunately they decided to go for the first option. And as far as the R rating is concerned: there are not more than two or three scenes in the movie that justified an R. The movie could have been easily toned down to PG-13 without losing a lot of intensity.This all being said, it's still a decent and entertaining movie, the look and the cinematography are superb. Just don't expect anything near the first two Alien movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Full Circle...,"Much has already been written about Director Ridley Scott's PROMETHEUS. Many who detest it see it as dull, talky, and lacking enough action or ties to the original monster. Those who love it see it as a ""thinking person's science fiction film"", with a tremendous story full of suspense, excellent characters, and astonishing visuals.Personally, I fall somewhere in between these views. Scott's movie is actually far better than it might have been if studio ""geniuses"" had gotten their way. As it stands, my only real complaint lies in its length. At just over two hours it feels rushed, and another 45-60 minutes would have enabled the story to unfold without seeming to be in such a hurry to get to the climax. Some tales need time to be told, and this is one of them.From the moment the crew lands on the mysterious orb, the pace of this movie quickens. Scott allowed the original ALIEN to take its sweet time, and Cameron's ALIENS, for all of its explosiveness, had a nice, slow buildup. Is PROMETHEUS ruined by its speedy delivery? No, it just would have benefitted greatly from a slower pace and a longer running time.Still, in spite of this, PROMETHEUS is a very good, modern science fiction film. Noomi Rapace is a solid female lead, the story is intriguing, and, yes, the CGI is used sparingly, and only when practical effects wouldn't work. There's also a thick atmosphere of dread that aligns with the horror aspects of the first ALIEN. This movie can be viewed as either a prequel or as a standalone film...",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Movie Opinion In Viewing Sequence,"""This movie reflex back to the first movie of ""Aliens"" with (Sigourney Weaver)when they first discover the alien crash ship.This movie tells the story about the early beginnings of the alien menace that came to exist that lead to all those movie's.It's about time we got to find out where all those aliens came from.I say, good work on providing a movie that should now be the first one view before all the other Alien's movies being seen to fully understand the complete saga story line.As far as I figure, here is the sequence the movies should be viewed!Prometheus - 2012, Alien - 1979, Aliens - 1986, Alien 3 - 1992, Alien Resurrection - 1997, Alien vs. Predator - 2004, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem - 2007.To view it this way will provide the full story line.This is what I think, how about you?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Alien Remix,"This film feels more like the product of a Ridley Scott brainstorming session rather than a fully realised story - take some Alien, some philosophic sci-fi and some mythic tropes, then reheat with great actors and production design. It doesn't really work as a story, although its solid enough and there's plenty of interesting ideas with Fassbender's robot and the thankfully still mysterious origins of the alien (for instance that prologue); it reminds you why Ridley Scott has been such a great sci-fi filmmaker.So, more intelligent than you can rightly expect from an alien film at this point, but I can't help feeling that it would have been stronger if they'd abandoned the connections with the earlier film altogether.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Disappointing,"Prometheus wants to be a prequel (or at least connect) to the ""Alien"" saga, including the stories narrated in the two ""Alien vs Predator"" movies, so the story, in a way, has to fit the bill.Prometheus also wants to move away and go beyond those movies to create a saga and mythological world in which all the stories are included and embedded, but it has its own autonomy.Prometheus also wants to pose some philosophical, theological and ethical queries about human nature, the soul of androids, and the origin of life, very much in connection with many of the themes explored in ""Blade Runner"".Prometheus wants to provide the viewer with a science-fiction teleological mythology infused with philosophical and metaphysical queries... it sounds pretentious. Well, it is pretentious.I love action movies, but if you want to mix action with metaphysics, you better work hard on putting together a story that links well all the elements, create engaging characters that have an emotional background, are well connected, and have a purpose within the story. Most importantly, show respect to the viewer who is willing to believe anything if it has inner logic and makes sense.The film is very sleek, and some of the scenes are wonderful and unforgettable, grandiose and spectacular, as well as the special effects, especially those filmed inside the departure chamber, utterly gorgeously, if that can be said. The blue, golden brown and white-ish tones of the film are perfect for the story and create the right mood, from warmth to cold, both physical and emotional. The photography, mostly shot in Iceland and Spain, is beautiful, and the landscapes chosen really look out-this-world. On the contrary, I did not find Marc Streitenfeld's original soundtrack especially inspired, and it sounds like hundred other science fiction movies soundtracks.The male and female characters are unevenly treated by the story and the result is that the actors who play them, shine or not depending on it. Naomi Rapace is completely wasted as Elizabeth Shaw. She does her best at doing what is requested of her naive passionate and a-scientific scientist character - no acting would have saved it. The same can be said of Charlize Theron, whose talent is wasted in her role of Meredith Vickers, the intriguing ice-cold beautiful manager of the expedition; not much is demanded of her, beyond wearing styling super-tight clothes and moving like a supermodel on a catwalk.On the contrary, Michael Fassbender is brilliant as the quirky witty android David. David is the best drawn character in the movie because it has a sense of purpose, a background, an inner logic, and a well-defined ""psyche"" and a soul that is missing from the human characters. Fassbender really brings his character to life, and gives him both mechanical and human color in movement, facial expression and performance. What a great actor he is.Guy Pearce is good and almost unrecognizable in his role as Peter Weylan, the patron and sponsor of the expedition. The rest of the supporting actors are just OK in their respective roles. They do what is requested from their roles, which is not much at times.Prometheus is a super-production that does not deliver what it promises. This is an action movie with amazing visuals and interesting premises that gets lost in itself. It is hedonistic at times, superficial and preposterous most of the times. The movie feels like a blockbuster made to utter wows; yet, the wows are never uttered because there was no previous thinking, the story and characters are just sketched, and the viewer is expected to disregard ridiculous events, completely unscientific behavior by scientists, and even the laws of Physics. Furthermore, Prometheus seems anchored in old philosophical queries that, despite still being valid. are presented as if the world had not changed much since the 1980s, science and technology were far less developed, and their impact on Society were less profound, and new queries were needed to be present for the film feel contemporary in that regard. There is a lack of focus in the project, and the result is a chaotic film, that is enjoyable at times, ridiculous and stupid others. Visuals and style are never enough to make of a movie a good one.The movie ends with unanswered questions, on purpose, as a sequel has to follow. Oh dear.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

After countless hours thinking about the films I started to like it more. It's not all action but that has all been done before so something new I thought was quite good.The film is a little all over the place and in places rushed plus, some of the acting isn't great either.I think this might be a grower.

Scott's intriguing LV-223 Sci-fi,"The near future 2089 Earths historical artifact's and ancient paintings prompt an expedition into space to find our makers but puts the crew of the Prometheus in grave danger when they land on LV-223 in 2093.Veteran director Ridley Scott gives Prometheus its own unique look and rightly so as the action, suspense takes place on LV-223 not LV- 426 as in Alien(s). Without getting bogged down with Alien (2122A.D) comparisons, this is a science expedition not a mining vessel. This change in location allows Prometheus to sit as a stand alone film.Questioning our origins in a reasonable intelligent way the story written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof is intriguing and makes this film stand above your average sci-fi. That said, Prometheus does raise more questions than it answers yet it's ambiguity is what makes this film special and allows for the set-up of future instalments.It's excellently cast and includes international actors Guy Pearce (who is sorely underused) Idris Elba as everyday man Janek and Logan Marshall-Green to name a few. Charlize Theron is astounding as Meredith Vickers, a hard nosed corporate mission director. Notably is Michael Fassbender as David who is every bit as interesting as Bishop and Ash with added a quirky 'fondness' for Peter O'Tool. Main protagonist Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace is not your typical Ripley clone and carries much of the emotion for the film.The effects are first rate, with the Space Jockeys, scenery, ships and Aliens wonderfully realised and rendered. Some of the effects are practical and look organic for the most part. The location and environment feels real and makes everything more palatable. A nod should go to Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and Pietro Scalia's editing.Scott delivers a few standout creepy scenes some particularly gut turning, notably the arm breaking, infection and decontamination scenes-  it captures some xenomorph magic.Marc Streitenfeld's music score is an effective mixed bag although is a little over used. Both writers and Scott ensure to include a few character twists and wisely incorporate some elements from the Aliens series (in keeping with that world) whether it be a vehicle, a line or setup to possibly appease die-hard fans but for the most part it feels fresh. That said, some character motivations need to be teased out by the viewer for clarification, not all the t's are crossed and the i's dotted.The film took the Alien series in a direction I was not expecting. As a long-time fan of the Alien series, and with this new Prometheus course I can say I'm satisfied, it's edge of your seat, gory-suspense - director Ridley Scott is on pretty good form.Prometheus tackles themes of origin, mortality and biological warfare to name a few and although it feels a little rushed it's a grower just like the spores themselves.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Not quite the prequel Alien deserved, but then its not really Alien","Well when Prometheus was announced some time ago I was more than a little excited, one because Alien is one of my all time favourite movies, and two Ridley Scott was directing. All these added together was more than enough to send my anticipation into a frenzy, then the first trailer came out. Oh my lord, that was it, I had to see this film at all costs.Then something happened, another trailer was released, then another, then another. Then viral videos, then behind the scenes stuff, then more trailers. Then I kinda guessed the storyline and the outcome of the film, and now I've seen it, I was by and large correct. The marketing over load on this film, may have been overkill. Such a shame because the teaser trailer was so promising, but I did still go and watch it and I did still enjoy the film despite guessing the storyline.Without giving too much away the film is set a few years before the original Alien film and explores the origin of mankind to the far reaches of space, but what they found may not be what they were expecting. One thing that did baffle me slightly was the technology used in the film, it made the future technology seem redundant, as the past seems far better equipped than the future, odd. But then this is both a positive and a negative, the positive being the film looks absolutely stunning, the set pieces are beautiful and detailed, the CGI is fabulous and photo realistic and virtually everything - down to the nearest speck of dust - looks good.The cast is a nice mix, but character development is missing on most of the crew. The vast majority of them are totally forgettable, so you feel very little for them, something that is usually fatal in a ""horror"" film. But the main guys are great in their roles; Noomi Repace is well cast, though not a scratch on the Ellen Ripley character. Charlize Theron is fine in her cold commanding officer role, but is totally under utilised. But Michael Fassbender is on terrific form and completely steals the show, as the synthetic David.Where my main issue with Prometheus lies is in its similarity with Alien, its more of remake than a prequel in a way. Thats not to say its exactly the same as Alien, but it feels oddly familiar and strangely lacking in originality despite trying its best to be original. The idea of the crew of Prometheus searching for mankind is very interesting, but in the end comes off as redundant and kinda lame. It tries to steer the film down a certain path, but it comes off more as ridiculous than ingenious. In the end you know what's going to happen which is another problem, and there is no real payoff at the end of the film. Not only that the film seriously lacks scares, the music is too loud and in your face. There is no gentle creeping and no silence to keep you on edge. The film therefore comes across more as a bad action film, than a good horror.The trouble is Prometheus tried to distance itself from Alien and in doing so made itself less believable and predictable. But in a weird way I did like how they did it, could it have been better, hell yes, but did I ultimately enjoy the film, hell yes.Prometheus isn't the masterpiece it set out to be. Its not as creepy and horrific as Alien and not as thrilling as Aliens, though it does have its own merits away from the franchise. If a sequel is made I won't be queueing round the block to see it, but I do want to come back for more. So despite a bit of mixed bag, I would still highly recommend Prometheus.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

I've seen it twice with multiple groups of friends (some of which hadn't ever seen an 'Alien' movie). Excellent and worth many viewings!,"For those who are fans of the 'Alien' saga, you'll love this film. Director of the original, Ridley Scott, does a great job exploring themes and ideas about the origins of life on Earth, and how they might tie in to the events of the 'Alien' story.The strength of this film, is it's balance of creepy horror and truly deep storytelling. From a horror stand point, the creep factor of 'Alien' has always been in the nature of the Xenomorph life cycle (I don't want to spoil anything here for those who aren't familiar with it), and this film delivers it's share of horrific moments. However it's never just for horror's sake, and the moments always lend themselves well to the intellectual storytelling. The kind where the viewer has to do a little bit of thinking on their own, and come up with some answers that aren't spoon fed to them, but instead, dropped in subtle hints and clever writing. Characters, who also don't know what is going on, will sometimes try to lend their frantic opinions to throw the audience some shapes, as they say.From the standpoint of someone unfamiliar with the 'Alien' saga, you're not going to miss anything. The film functions as a standalone if you don't know enough about the fore-story (I saw this with some friends who hadn't seen any of the 'Alien' movies), and knowledge of the other films only helps to enrich the viewer's story comprehension, not leave everyone else behind.It explores a lot of good philosophical ideas, such as the possibilities of the origins of life, and the consequences of tampering with things beyond our comprehension (I found myself later considering the potential consequences of stem cell research and DNA tampering). There's also some religious implications. Although none of it overwhelms the overall work, and the viewer, should they pick up on these themes, is left to ponder them at their own will, instead of being forced to roll their eyes as if to say ""c'mon already, get to the good stuff"".As for the other non-script driven elements, the special effects were top notch and the acting awesome. There wasn't any over cheeseyness as there might be in other horror movies, and I personally love Michael Fassbender. I also appreciated the absence of a common absurdity suffered by many horror movies, namely: the tendency of characters to act as though everything is alright when it obviously isn't. Scott doesn't insult the audience's intelligence, and the characters will often do exactly what we would do: do what must be done in the interest of self preservation.

Excellent,"More then half of the petty complaints about this movie about unknowns, plot holes, character behavior etc are actually explained in the movie. It's one of those movies where multiple viewings are called for. I love that about this film. There is only one real flaw in it and that is some wacky editing during one scene where a mutated crewman returns and starts attacking the crew.I will say though that the film could have been cut down less and have had things explained a little better. Not for me but for the whiners. I think the film suffered a little bit by some people's negative reviews. I feel almost positive that the director's cut/deleted scenes will prove me right.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
For those who have not seen Alien...,"Last minute decision to go to the theatre and the there was a toss up between MIB3 and Prometheus, initially wanting to go for comedy as sci- fi has been increasingly disappointing over the past year,(yes I realist MIB3 is also sci-fi ;)I was slightly peeved when it wasn't showing and the only option was Prom.Emotions experienced: Laughter, crying, high levels of anxiety, fear and euphoria.The story-line had some questionable parts but if you're willing to close that part of your brain and actually experience the film you will be freaking overjoyed.LOVED it all, Noomi Rapace (Dr Shaw) and Michael Fassbender (David) were incredible.If I were to compare it to a film I would say I Am Legend, in terms of plot and character development.I believe it is the character development which was so right throughout the film, and made it all the more amazing.Cannot wait for the sequel. P.S. for those claiming to be crushed with disappointment at the film because it was so highly anticipated, I may check it out now since it must be 10000/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good. Does not fully capitalise on some of its own best ideas.,"The invective against this flawed but quite original sci-fi movie is so over the top Id rather review that than the film.Most of the 1 star reviews refer to 'plotholes' (when they mean mystery) without understanding the meaning of the term. They all complain that there are 'unanswered questions' and that the motivations of the characters seem to be 'random' or insufficiently unexplained.Lets examine Alien from that point of view.Who sent the distress signal? Why is there no explanation of the giant alien strapped to a huge chair/weapon? Why mess with a bunch of alien eggs - that ""appeaar to react to breaking the light"" Why would Dallas volunteer to go into a maze of tunnels alone against a vicious alien creature? Why would Kane not be kept in quarantine even after the facehugger died and came off? How could the alien possibly know about the self destruct - does it speak English? Why would Ripley bother about the cat ? Couldn't the crew have just locked the all the doors in the main living area and waited it out? Why would a space mining vessel costing billions by staffed by fools like Brett and Parker? IF Ash received ""crew expendable"" orders how come Weyland Yutani knew nothing about it in Aliens?The answer to all these questions is, it because it FITS the story. Todays google generation seems to want their movies to come prepackaged with all the answers. They hate mystery and mistakenly call it 'plotholes'. For instance ""why does the medpod only work on males""?. I can guess its because it is intended for Weyland, but that's a mystery, not a mistake. Why dos the captain appear to know more about Alien WMD than he is letting on? Because he's a former military man with a gut feeling for this sort of thing? He wouldn't even have to be since its clear as a a bell that when you fill a delivery mechanism with jars of death it's a ""weapon of mass destruction"" (I didn't like the concurrency of the phrase but that wont matter 30 years from now).When someone told me ""hurray, Scott is directing"" I was nonplussed. ""But Scott directed classics like Bladerunner and Gladiator"" - yeah well he directed White Squall and Black Rain too. Not to mention ""legend"". Besides Bladerunner is only well regarded because of Syd Mead's work, realising William Gibson's vision. And Gladiator is Scotts derivative go at swords and sandals after Mad Mel Gibson revived the genre with the ballsy ""Braveheart"" - a film twice as violent and yet twice as nuanced.Yet Scott has no peer when it comes to the language of Cinema. This film is his best work to date on that score. You may find it clunky, you may find it hollow - but you will find its images haunting your mind for some time to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"What It Lacks in Plot, It Compensates in Suspense and Philosophical Depth","It would be hard to compare this to Scott's introduction of the Alien species, but if I have to, I would say it lacks the kind of horror that Alien brought and its suspense falls flat, though not by much.What it manages to do more than the first installment is that it adds a layer of philosophical, constantly in pursuit of the origins of mankind, and ultimately mortality. The visuals no doubt outmatched the original, thanks to modern technology, but the effects seem to be behind similarly foreign planets settings like Avatar.The suspense is maintained since the arrival at the planet of our makers, and most would expect countless answers flooding in as the plot unfolds. That is not really the case. In fact, there are questions left unanswered. One thing is for sure, it is an enjoyment, though not the same kind when you are watching the original, and it seems to promise a sequel, which I will gladly watch should it come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Rough, Flawed, Beautiful and Ambituous.","Now like Mark Kemode has said numerous times before reviewing Prometheus, I recommend that you try to ignore any thoughts, feelings or opinions you or someone else has about the movie.This isn't the scary science fiction film that many expected and that many wanted, but it is still a very interesting film about belief, big questions and ENGINEERS! The film succeeds as a science-fiction event film, and like many successful science-fiction film (2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner and Solaris)it brings up big topics. Who isn't interested in the big questions...why are we here and how? The visual images that Ridley creates throughout the film, and how he expands his Alien universe is very interesting (buy the 3D Blu-ray for more). From the interior of the Prometheus vessel to the stunning visuals of the Engineers, this is Ridley's sandbox of visual delights. It's like opening a box of chocolates sent personally by Mr Scott at your door. However, it isn't just imagery that works, but also the amazing performance of Michael Fassbender as a robot with feelings? David is charming, funny and disturbing all at the same time, and credit goes to Fassbender for an amazing performance. Rapace, Theron and Elba also produce good performances.However, Ridley's box of chocolates does have a few bad tastes and rough edges. The dialogue between supporting cast Sean Harris and Rafe Spall is hard to sit through, without laughing at the stereo typed stupid space men. The creatures of the film are also all over the shop, with a variety of monsters but no substance or meaning to them. Many questions are left hanging also by the end of the film which also disappoints, but then again that leaves the door open for Ridley to explore even more into his own world.So what I would say about this film is that it isn't exactly a perfect scene-fiction classic of modern times, but it is a very interesting and visually astounding world that Ridley creates. It is very rough in places, but you find some of the best visual moments in Scott's film CV since Alien and Blade Runner. Anyway I ask you to judge the film for yourself, and don't go into it expecting a horror film or with a stomach full of hype, because you will burst out with a chest full of disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Less impacting Alien movie,"I did not set any expectations before going to the theater. After the movie, I came out thinking what the hell Scott wanted to convey. Is he simply saying that this is prequel to the Aliens or origins of humanity are some where hidden in the universe or what? I didn't understand why at the beginning, one of the Engineer is showing drinking the black liquid? Or why the liquid is not found on the planet lurking or hidden in the sand? The movie didn't have any impact on me which after watching the Alien movies had! Whats the role of Vicaires? The engineers must have created some escape route if they knew that the biological weapon is back firing on them but the movie didn't explore that idea. Why the Engineers would promote humans rather than their own race which appears to be superior than humans? I will just say that production value is really high but didn't understand the objective of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Are all prequels to franchise films fundamentally doomed?,"Prequels to films with fully-detailed ecosystems can play out like a grocery list of payoffs and 'tribute' scenes. Prometheus has that challenge. Sir Ridley Scott came from the world of commercials where the stereotypes must reveal/explain and play themselves out quickly. So we have all the Alien ""hooks"" in place and plenty of sci fi genre hooks (Star Trek, Star Wars, Indiana Jones) all blended into a script that sometimes -- because of these hooks -- distracts rather than enthralls.Yes, there has to be a corporate expedition, and a diverse crew and crew conflicts and an amoral robot and slimy creatures. Check, check and check. But where is the growing sense of dread that worked so well in Alien? Granted, this is -- by necessity -- derivative stuff. But I watched Prometheus from a distance. Never with the sense of intimate menace that Alien so brilliantly exploited.There is one situation that is so preposterous and distracting that it took me right out of the film -- and I was barely in it, anyway. The best science fiction puts you into the world you are observing and uses that to give you new perspectives. Prometheus was at times a bit like a thing wriggling in a test tube. Fascinating, but safely removed and not really threatening.Did I dislike the film? I did not. I rated it a 6/10. It sustained my interest. It simply didn't thrill me. By all means, see it. However, do not go in with high expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Big questions, daft answers.","The crew of the starship Prometheus are roused from cryo-sleep to ask the big questions. Who are we? Why are we here? Yes they're really asking those questions. None of them seem to know who anyone else is or why they came. Some don't like the mission and want to go home. Seriously, no one knows what they're doing, except Fassbender's android. By the end it's still not clear who some of the crew are – not even a pair who actually save the earth from alien apocalypse. Then again maybe that's fitting as we never really find out who these rebooted aliens they're saving us from are either.Far from explaining everything, there are more loose ends left in Prometheus' wake than the Alien saga began with, plot tendrils snaking about like a grasping face hugger that's drunk too much coffee. Spotlight on writer Damon Lindelof who penned the TV series Lost. Mystery is replaced by bafflement.A couple of times Prometheus stops ploughing a furrow through the dirt and actually gets off the ground. There is one classic, possibly genre forming scene of medical horror in this movie that goes places only the Japanese have gone before. And maybe thats where Prometheus went astray. This was all too sci-fi, while Alien knew much better what it was, and it was single minded, uberstylish horror.The franchise that inspired so many films that followed it now borrows back from nearly all of them. Even the Thing makes an appearance, complete with flamethrower demise. The greasy metal and CRT interiors of the original are apparently predated by overfamiliar floating holographic displays. Maybe an intervening GFC and resulting technological devolution will be described in the sequels, or interstitials, or whatever the sequel to a prequel is called. moviedumpblog.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
You must watch Alien first,"I remember when I watched Alien in 1979. My first terror movie with a sci-fi base. For my surprise the hero was a girl - by the time - called Ripley. Why did Ridley Scott choose a girl as a hero? He simply surprised us as he did in the whole movie. So I never thought Scott would make a pre-sequel. First of all to watch Prometheus you must watch Alien (1979) first. The most interesting is that this time he made a sci-fi movie with a terror base. He tries to show the events which happened before Alien. In fact he did that very well. After watch Prometheus we can understand what is that terrible beast we called alien. The actors did a great performance mainly Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace. The action and the special effects are awesome. The visual is fantastic. Now I comprehend that Ripley was an Ridley alter ego. He just changed the letter ""d"" for the letter ""p"". I can not wait to buy Prometheus in blu ray. Another amazing movie directed by Ridley Scott.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I am mostly disappointed,"I am a hardcore Alien fan, saw the movies more then dozens of times, read the books, fictional continuations, played games, ... you get the point.I went into the cinema with high expectations, because I said that if anybody can do a good prequel to this franchise, its Ridley Scott.After the movie I felt disappointed.There are a lot meaningless scenes: characters just doing the dumbest things (i can even recall saying a few times that ""I can't believe that they didn't put more thought into this scene""), you would expect that the ""Engineers"" would be a lot smarter, huge parts of the story aren't explained at all (what happened on the engineers ship prior to their arrival), unexplained conflicts between the characters that doesn't seem natural, lacking story, etc.The whole movie looks like its just setting up another.Unfortunately I cannot give more details without adding spoilers.If you are an Alien fan like me, you will be frustrated that the movie you waited for this long is treating the subject you love without paying attention to details.If you manage to lower your expectation and just go into the cinema saying ""I just want to see a sci-fi movie with nice effects"" than this is a movie for you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Pretty fun watch,"Okay. So this was no Alien. You should watch Prometheus with something of a wider expectancy than just some Sigourney Weaver kick ass action. They shot the Alien franchise to death, as far as I'm concerned, they were pretty average movies by the third anyway. This was a breath of fresh air, and a new concept in a perfectly good setting. I was pleased with this movie. Ignore the hate, as long as you watch this with a rather open expectancy then you'll more than likely come away pleased. It looks stunning and, although the script could be better, the characters - namely Michael Fassbender - do Scott's world real justice.

Aliens? Why?,"It was an amazing movie, but I was alone with this opinion against 3. Yes, my friends are right. You can find lot of things that doesn't fit. The biggest problem with this film is that they included the Alien line. They probably had to... Excellent idea, really good start, than came some alien and confused the story. They put some clichés from earlier alien movies without the ""alien"" feeling.I want to see a remake of this film without the Alien. What I can expect is a 2nd part later that may got rid of the Alien, the worse case that they just can't do it without it. Wondering if there would be any Predators also.But anyway it's fascinating. The best value of this film is that we were arguing about it for at least 1 hour. It doesn't happen so often.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Profound! Intelligent! Thought-provoking! Thank you Sir Ridley!,"Having only just seen this at IMAX Melbourne in 3D, my head is spinning! In a very good way :-) I wanted to put my thoughts down ASAP and I am happy to report (to a true cinephile), Prometheus doesn't disappoint. It delivers in spades and much more, BUT only if you walk in with a open mind, not expecting Alien, Aliens or a hybrid of both. Why would Sir Ridley try and do that when he made what is probably the best sci-fi/horror film of all time way back in 1979? No..it had to be this way. More profound and intelligent and forcing us to really closely follow the action on screen. The visuals are just ""died and gone to LV-223"" pretty! The scale of the scenes and the landscape is something only Sir Ridley would attempt and be able to pull of (without the CGI and aiding the storyline and action rather than taking over it). Sure there are some issues regarding character development, but I was willing to forgive, given we will never have another Ripleyesque type character.Mark my words. This is hands down the most intelligent sci-fi film in a long, long time and after the foul taste of Aliens3 (had the right mix, just didn't cook properly) and Alien: Resurrection (DOA), this glorious spectacle, in 3D nonetheless, is a fitting and proper tie-up of all the questions you ever had from the first Alien. Prometheus won't be liked by all, it won't achieve the fame of Alien/Aliens (not straight away anyway), but over time, as you ponder it's existence, watch it a few times and realize what it set out to achieve (and indeed, achieved), you will thank Sir Ridley like I did tonight. After 33 years, the master delivered a fitting conclusion to his original masterpiece",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Oh the holes...,"Although I own this film, have watched it several times and quite enjoy it overall...there are many glaring plot holes that make the film monumentally less than it could be. I understand sticking with a general theme, to satisfy fans, in the tradition of ""give them what they want! Yep, get that. But...did this reboot have to have the fumbling bumbling ""oh dam we got ourselves into one heck of a jam as intended and made it worse"" so obligatory, blatant, and just plain silly in it's portrayal? Are we the fans of the Alien series, this dumb? This willing to overlook so much? The producers seem to think so. I suppose I am that dumb, just to see another Alien series movie, I will put aside any notion of intelligence. So, this is to be a scientific mission of discovery, privately funded. Wondrous and glorious...let's go. I presume we are leaving any actual scientists at home then? I give the chosen ""experts"" this amount of sway. These scientists are allowed to be goofballs...they were hired guns (so to speak, even though guns were frowned upon in the investigation of an alien race that could be entirely hostile). So on we go...doo dee doo, just walk right into the alien base and take our helmets off, they are friendly, there are no contagions to worry about or possibly infect and kill our new friends either. That would be yucky. Wee! It's fun time! They are our dear old mummy and daddums! Sure. As it goes, two members of the team get lost in this friendly genetic reunion horseshoe shaped vessel. Seems like it would be rather easy to find the way out...But, I'm dumb, I'm not an expert, so...sure. Anyway, although the team on the ship can see odd blips of alien life, they can't see the lost humans in spacesuits that have clear radio coms, life support monitors (when convenient to the plot) on the incredibly detailed map created by the scanner ""pups"" sent throughout (a big point was made in showing the capabilities of these scanners, really neat stuff). All the special effects dedicated to their astounding remote scanning abilities, yet they are apparently utterly, totally, useless in locating two lost humans or helping them find their way out. Massive. Glaring. Hole. Now, we have the goofball xenobiologist, who sees what any person in the known universe would see as a very likely dangerous and threatening alien serpent...as a cuddly little bunny and ""she's beautiful!"" He wants to snuggle up with it at first sight! I won't spoil the result as if it won't be incredibly obvious on first view what will happen. Just totally inane, and to be frank totally condescending to push this on what will largely be a fairly evolved audience in this genre. There's more, but hey, like I said, I'm a fan. I'll live through bad acting, huge plot holes, all that. Just keeping making the dam movies...I'll still go. I'm dumb like that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very Good Sci-Fi for Adults,"Prometheus (2012)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Ridley Scott's sci-fi/drama centers on a group of explorers who head out on a mission to another planet to try and see if they can discover who or what created life. I'll admit that I haven't been the greatest supporter of Scott over the years and I'll admit that this genre isn't always my favorite but I think it's clear that the director and genre go perfectly well together and PROMETHEUS is quite an achievement. I guess you could say that this here was one of the most anticipated movies to come out in quite a while and I think for the most part that it met most of its demand, although I'm sure repeat viewings will help it. I think what made the film so special to me is the fact that it was a real throwback to when sci-fi movies didn't have to be all special effects and no story. It seems for the past couple decades the majority of films in this genre have had zero brains and instead they've been replaced with loud explosions and poor CGI effects. This film here is pretty much all story, although those other elements are certainly on hand. I think it's clear that Scott wanted to take his time letting the viewers get to know the characters as well as making sure he could build up the actual story of what could be the end of Earth. All of the characters are extremely well detailed and thankfully so is the main story. The movie really does ask a lot of questions about the past, present and future situation of humans and I think the film does a very good job at letting the viewer make up their own minds. The screenplay is extremely well-written and perfectly gets all of the themes across. The performances are also exceptionally good with Noomi Rapace doing an excellent job in the lead role. She can perfectly play that strong female lead but also give emotion to the character. Charlize Theron is also very good in her role of the ship's leader who might just be hiding a few secrets of her own. Guy Pearce is also in good form even though he doesn't appear for too long. I think the real stand out was Michael Fassbender who plays a robot. Often these type of movies use CGI or some sort of stunt to give an actor a more robotic features but that's not the case here. The entire role is 100% acting and Fassbender does a terrific job and I sure think that it will stand up to being one of the best of the year. It's quite original, authentic and incredible believable considering he's playing an emotionless robot. The visual style of the film is also very impressive and especially the opening bits that really set up the mood of the film. The stuff dealing with the planet was also beautiful to see and the futuristic computers and visuals were also extremely well done. The models used for the aliens were quite good as well. I would say that I wasn't overly impressed with the 3D in the movie so I think saving money on the regular version would be just fine. PROMETHEUS is a film that doesn't try to dumb itself down for more mainstream appeal and instead it delivers good, R-rated adult entertainment. It makes you think with its story and makes sure that the story remains it's main goal. While the film falls short of being perfect I think it's certainly something original and something we haven't seen in a long time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Gets better as you discuss it with people,"Definitely some interesting sci-fi concepts going on here, most of which I did not pick up on the first time round. Philosophically, this film has a lot to say on a range of topics. CGI is very good, the film looks very impressive. Where it is flawed is the story is a bit plodding and most of the characters are bland. Many superb actors seem underserved by their roles in this film. I don't think it is terrible, although I understand the film is not at all what many cinema-goers thought it would be in 2012, just it never really captivated me the way the concepts bouncing around in its ambiguous story should have. Maybe future Alien/Prometheus films will reveal this for the masterpiece it actually is, but that still won't make it a more exciting experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Prometheus - A bold, brave, and terrifying new direction for the Alien series.","Stop. Right now. Forget what you think know about the Alien franchise. Forget what you think you're about to see. You're all very, very wrong.Prometheus returns Ridley Scott to the franchise, and arguably the genre, that he created and delivers something very special and spellbinding. It marks a true return to science fiction that the series has desperately needed, and will leave you with more questions that are unanswered than you may like. But isn't the point of good science fiction?Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have been discovering cave paintings all over the world. These exist among multiple cultures that have existed over time with no contact with each other. What is puzzling is that in each of these cave paintings is a common element. Man is worshiping larger than average humanoids, referred to as the Engineers, that are pointing to a unique set of celestial objects. What the scientists have discovered is that this actually is a solar system well beyond the boundaries of our universe, and that within this solar system is a moon that closely resembles Earth. Who are these creatures? Did they create us? Do they negate the idea of God? The Weyland-Yutani Company has decided these are important enough questions to answer, so they sponsor a trillion dollar effort to explore these possibilities.In the truest essence of its science fiction roots, Prometheus provides us with some unique and complex characters. Shaw is a believer in God, but is still a scientist at heart and wants her own answers to our creation. Holloway however is a pure scientist: driven, and often reckless, in his pursuit to prove that science has truly won over religion. David, the android played by Michael Fassbender, is the care giver assigned with watching over the crew during their hyper sleep across the galaxy. He is fearlessly intrigued by the team's discovery, and may or may not have come along with his own hidden agenda. Fassbender really brings a calculated and nuanced disconnect with his human counterparts. He's programmed to protect them, but is just as much out for his own answers as anyone else. Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) is the company representative that is there to keep everyone in line and on mission. Rounding out the main cast is the ships captain Janek (Idris Elba). It could have been a really throw away kind of role. But Elba breathes life into him, especially as he starts to see the dangers add up and concludes what it could all mean for humanity.I would highly recommend ponying up the premium to see this in IMAX 3D if it's available in your area. It's easily the best 3D since Avatar, if not better, and really does add to the immersion. Scott films most of the film practically, only relying on CGI when absolutely necessary. The planets and locations are all stunningly presented and fully realized, especially the alien relics that the crew explores. The final product feels familiar and foreign at the same time. The same can be said with the creature effects. I won't go into detail so as to avoid spoiling the fun, but rest assured they are as nightmarish as ever.We walked out of the movie and spent the next two hours talking about it. The events in the finale and the nature of the Engineers are left purposefully enigmatic and open ended. Not in a lazy way by any means, which is the pitfall of many recent science fiction movies. The fundamental ideas and questions being posed are universal to humanity. The quest for the truth behind our existence is part of the human experience, and Prometheus is smart enough to slow down and ask these questions of the audience. It's also smart enough to not necessarily answer all of them for you.If Prometheus is any indication of where Scott and screenwriter Damon Lindelof (of Lost fame) plan to take the Alien franchise, then I'm all aboard. As familiar as I am with the series, I can see the possibilities of where things can go from here and it's pretty exciting. The horror elements blend seamlessly with the science fiction and the action. Throughout the two-hour run time none of the elements feel under or over balanced, and they manage to coalesce into a haunting and thought provoking experience. The perfect amount of respect is paid to the original that started it all, with a brave new path being laid out for future installments. This is exactly the movie that fans of the Alien series have been waiting for.Follow me on Twitter @Mrhuffsmyfather",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

If I didn't know any better one would have thought this movie snatched your toys from your cot and exposed to you the truth that Santa doesn't exist. That is the overall feeling I get from your scornful critics of this film. The fact that you had such high expectations of this film and that you decided to go and see it before anyone else leads me to believe something very large is missing in your life.Look sure there are holes in the script and the character development is a little on the weak side but this is 2012 people not 1979. The world is full of mildly ADHD, narcissistic up starts who find little time for believability and in-depth plots. You only have to look at the amount of quality TV shows being canned in favour of so called reality and tedious talent shows to prove my point. Over half the planets population still believe that a couple of geezers came down from the heavens at the request of there all powerful old man to tell us what we should already know but hell it's a lot easier to pick holes in a little bit of entertainment isn't it.I found this film to be visually stunning, stimulating and thought provoking. That is why I part with my hard earned cash to see a sci fi/action film. An honest rating for me would be closer to 7.5/10 but I have taken it upon myself to over inflate to counter act so many.Oh and Darwinism does not set out to explain the creation of life it merely explains genetic recombination and mutation (evolution), something which many of us sadly lack.

Expected more,"Just didn't live up to its hype. The movie is dull, with no straight line scenario. And this is by far the most important thing in this suspense/riddle kind of movie. Prometheus looks beautiful, making a step further in aspect of visual effects, but the cohesive force and atmosphere lacks. The movie is like a combination of 5 different scenarios and neither one made the goal.This movie ends with questions opened, but not in Inception way- where you can interpret end in a way that you like. In Prometheus you don't have enough information, since everything is explained briefly, and that is the biggest problem. All in all: not the worst ride, but definitively could have been groundbreaking. It is just mediocre, not more not less, with idea of being philosophical but falling too short.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Ridley Scott fulfills expectations, mostly","When I first heard of this movie some six months ago, I was really excited. I'm not a die-hard fan of the Alien series, but I figured anything inspired by its universe directed by Ridley Scott has the potential of a masterpiece.In Alien, there was a lot of attention to aesthetics, and Prometheus takes this trend to a whole new level: from the first frames, the viewer embarks on a journey of dazzling visuals. 3D is used very well throughout the movie and enhances the viewing experience beautifully. The aesthetics are a major contributor to the mood of the film, but the soul of it lies in Ridley's masterful storytelling. From beginning to end, the film will have you on the edge of your seat as you sink deeper and deeper into the depths of the nightmare, with a couple of negligible dents in an otherwise perfectly paced picture. The cast all deliver a great performance, most notably Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender.Discussing the plot is especially difficult for this film, so I will have to be a bit brief and very vague. The plot is epic in scope, but suffers from a few inconsistencies, or loose ends. Fortunately, these are minor elements that don't divert the core storyline and don't take much away from the viewing experience, but they do leave you with a slight feeling that the movie was a bit under polished. I feel like Scott bit off a bit more than he could chew (the ""all about everything"" quote comes to mind), trying to mix too many elements together, but I still think that he did a good job pulling them together and making it work somehow.All in all, a very satisfying movie, just shy of being a masterpiece, but definitely worth the attention it is getting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Mostly Enjoyable,"Not that long, compared to alien which is much longer. Visually brilliant and the characters weren't introduced in a way that annoyed me like many recent action movies. Eventually things focus on a particular person and I didn't like their acting then and the script was terrible after that wherever there was script, but luckily it wasn't like that for most of the movie so I think it was an enjoyable experience. It was a bit like it could have been the sort of awful cliché scripting that I absolutely hate, but they cut it all out and only left bits of it near the end; leaving the rest to be enjoyed.That said, don't expect too much. It's pretty much a re-enactment of several alien staples with the idea of giving us an in-the-beginning look at how the aliens from alien came to exist, in a pretty unnecessarily dramatic chain of events.(if you've seen this film and thought it was the worst thing ever, you might be almost right, but maybe you haven't seen Predators)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"This is not an alien film, those who fail to see this sure will be disappointed","One of the things I learned these few years from movie going experiences is that I should never have much expectation of what the plot could be or what the movie should be about. Prometheus is not a film about Aliens and it's only remotely related to the alien film that you saw with the big round ship and mother alien. Now if you enjoy sci-fi novels and TV-shows from the old time, you probably will enjoy this film greatly like I did. I was in awe with how many details Prometheus had to offer in the film. None of the other sci-fi movies in recent years had done so well in depicting space-shuttle, high tech and alien planet, making them very much so believable (and fascinating). Avatar was a good film but it felt more towards a fantasy film rather than sci-fi.And another thing is that a good sci-fi novel/film does not need to explain itself head to toe. Leaving things open and questions unanswered (for the reader/audience to fill and answer) is good strategy in my mind. Some of the negative reviews I read here pretty much all complained about the character behaviors and misclassified mythology. Some of the questions people asked actually are implicitly answered in the film. With a second viewing I am sure the questions might be answered. Rather than say to your face hey this is what's going on, the film makes you think and makes your own Hamlet.All in all, it's great sci-fi movie in my opinion, the best sci-fi film I have seen in last decade I must say. Give it a try and leave off the ideas of going to see another alien films (don't we have enough of them already?). The movie is called Prometheus and I assure you this will be a unique experiences and will be worth your time especially if you are die-hard sci-fi fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The brief science fiction resurrection,"Ridley Scott cut the anticipation on June 1st releasing the eagerly awaited Prometheus to cinematic screens everywhere.Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron lead a promising cast in this Sci-fi whirl-wind exploring once again, the genre that brought Ridley Scott's ego to light.Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Green) spend their days exploring caves and landscapes seeking clues, leading to conspiracies, leading to self-belief of the numerous possibilities and unanswered questions behind mankind's creation. Their obsessive will for exploration pays off when they discover what they believe is the key direction to the life-form that walked before us. The loved up pair can't help but accept a thousand year old carving to be an open invitation to join whatever it may be they seek.Prometheus is the holding vessel carrying a crew of numerous qualifications. The Journey through space is constructed by Shaw and Holloway, with both of them being the navigational system to the universe they are destined to arrive in. Idris Elba plays Janek, the captain of Prometheus. A strong character, ever so careful as to why he, as well as others should risk their life believing in Shaw's ambitions.Meredith (Theron) is on board for one reason only, to see the journey out safe while so obviously wanting nothing to do with the desires of both Holloway and Shaw. From what Meredith can see, this is a far-fetched idea and a pointless journey...how wrong she was about to be. Theron is once again the bitch in the movie. Sure why not? she plays it ever so sexy!.The journey through one universe to the other leads Prometheus into a battle that could change history. Upon an amazing discovery through the ambitious Shaw and Holloway, their mysterious yet expected find leads the ship and crew into a fight not only for their own lives, but the lives of others.Prometheus is a brilliant sci-fi movie as Michael Fassbender helps by leading the movie to the enjoyment it Deserves. Introducing his robotic character, David. He is constructed by Peter Weyland to have as much interaction and affiliation with a human, as one human would be to another. His hilarious, soulless body is well created to the point where the viewer believes in Fassbenders' desire to act. David is the back-Bone to the ship, as the crew appear unfastened to rest their lives in his hands. A darker side to Fassbenders' character is surprisingly exciting, giving Prometheus tense interactions both on and off the vessel.Prometheus is as mysterious as the trailer makes it out to be. Ridley Scott does fantastic in returning to the concept of Aliens, but not ""Alien"". Just like his previous movies, without naming the obvious, Ridleys' way of creating likable characters is still smartly written with his latest work appearing highly nostalgic. The audience will realize the ship descending into the unknown and where you will once again find yourself rooting for certain characters to make it home. There are always individuals on board who you know are either too arrogant or unqualified to be on such a mission. Prometheus does well in offering the audience a general mix of personalities.However, it does, like most movies with a great introduction reveals some loose ends with an explanation much needed if Ridley Scott was to return for a Prometheus sequel. The first 100 minutes or so are quite tense and does well in keeping the audience attention and anticipating a possible unforgettable climax. Prometheus will disappoint some fans on the basis of what I and most would believe to be a highly rushed ending to the movie. The production just seemed to run out of ideas in the last 20 minutes or so. Maybe that is the appropriate result and much deserved outcome for a film that got the wrong attention and anticipation and seemed to have manipulated fans awaiting its release ever since its first statement which claimed Prometheus to be a prequel to alien...There is so much to be said about Ridleys' return, but so much the audience must answer for themselves. Prometheus is an all-round bloody good sci-fi movie. A concept not too original but fans of the Alien saga will enjoy without having to connect any apparent dots.A prequel originally, but I believe Ridley Scott himself fails to agree. Prometheus is its own concept, with some convenient characters. A must see for all Sci-fi fans. A return to chilling torture in outer space that no other director would dare to challenge. Oh except for James Cameron. :)Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
9/10.  Explores more than the first two and still provides an entertaining thrill ride.,"To start off I would like to mention this in terms of the first two films in the Alien series. This film is a game changer, it still has horror elements of the first but explores so much more than the originals, with the first two basically exploring only the mother-child relationship. It discusses similar concepts to Blade Runner with the idea of what makes us human, beautifully played out in a scene between David(Micheal Fassbender) and Charlie(Logan Marshall-Green) over a pool table. It also sticks it's foot into the fear of death, the idea of meeting our creators and also looking at how faith can be defined.I think Michael Fassbender is an absolute genius. His performance as a robot with the ability to understand human emotions while not actually having them is superb. You can see that each scene is meticulously thought out, with his character being so very close to being a human but not quite. This is exactly where his character should be and in some parts you start to wonder if the makers of David-8 gave him too much curiosity and whether he has actually gained independent thought. This then raises questions in your mind as to whether we as humans really are that special and you're stuck in this perfect creation of thought made by the David 8 character. Even forgetting the one I have already mentioned there are so many scenes I could pick out, but i'll force myself to just have two. The first being where David discusses what he would do if he were set free when talking to Shaw (Noomi Rapace), and the second is not even in the film. The promo for the introduction of the David-8 model is the shortest film I have ever seen that is worthy of an Oscar nod. Fassbender crying and at the same time explaining how he can not feel emotion is amazing. If he doesn't win an Oscar for his acting in this film (whether it be lead or supporting is up to Ridley Scott), then we need to seriously give the Oscar voters a re-shuffle as they have to understand that sci-fi should be respected genre.Also on the subject of Oscars this should have one for Cinematography. I don't think I know anything that looked as good as this, I mean actually stunning shots that when you look at them you just marvel in there creativity and detail. From the surface of the planet, to the amazing sets below the surface and then there's the interior of the ship which looks immaculate and beautifully futuristic. In the original two the feel of the films were always tight, cagey making you feel trapped, the fact that this moves to a larger, more grand scale and still manages to create fear is impressive. The visuals used in creating different characters is also brilliant, with perfect design and some interesting ideas working together to make the best looking film I have ever seen.I would say there are two scenes that are memorable for this film in terms of reminding me of the shock of the original chestburster, not in the same way but new creative ideas. Obviously I can't mention them but there's one towards the end which is part-fight scene and the better one comes around 2/3 the way through and I would love to tell you how amazing it is and how it makes you feel so claustrophobic, but I know that would ruin it for you so i'll just imagine it in my head. The 3-D is pointless and I don't know why Ridley Scott wanted it that way but I suppose for once the 3-D doesn't actually ruin it which is the best 3-D will ever do for me.On the negative side there are two or three issues with side characters not really being developed. I felt that Meredith Vickers(Charlize Theron) character was not developed enough and I felt another 10 minutes worth of scenes would of helped to awaken her character more, though she still proved to be interesting. Also the rest of the supporting cast could of done with a bit more time on there characters but I must say that this does not mean any of them acted poorly, they just didn't have the options available. Guy Pearce's character had many scenes cut from the movie apparently, which I again would of liked to see more of not only to advance his character but the depth of meaning behind the film as well. Also I would like to say that while the film trys more it is not as good as the first two on the characters or feel. The fear created in the first and thrill created in the second is here but not quite to that standard. On a another small but bad note I would like to mention a ridiculous scene towards the end But I can't, you'll see it anyway you can't miss it, just think doughnut.To round this off i'm going to mention why I think a few people don't like the film and why I think it is personally the best film of the Alien franchise. The real problem I think people have, but don't mention, is to do with the ending of the film. It ends openly and while this may annoy people a lot, it is what absolutely necessary. The film cannot answer all the question's it poses because whatever answers it gives would not be grand or anywhere near true enough to give the question any credit. This film is made to make you think, not to answer the questions but to put those thought's in your mind. This is why I believe this film to be better than both Alien(8) and Aliens(8) as it actually explores something fundamental to us all, that quest for the answer to ""the"" question.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"In Space, No One Can Hear You Yawn","Prometheus stole fire from the gods to grant to humans, and for his crime he was sentenced to have his liver devoured over and over for all eternity.If you keep that in mind, you'll get a lot more out of Prometheus, Ridley Scott's much-anticipated return to the world he created in 1979's Alien.Originally billed (and still very much recognizable as) a prequel to that classic sci-fi horror film, Prometheus is a lavishly produced, beautifully filmed and well-acted movie. It has outstanding performances from Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba, Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, and (barely recognizable) Guy Pearce.Archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient pictograms all over the world showing alien figures pointing to a star pattern, a pattern recognizable in a distant area of space, possibly a map leading to the creators of the human race. With funding from the Weyland Corporation, they mount an expedition to that region, to seek out these beings, and maybe learn the origin of mankind itself. What could possibly go wrong?Ridley Scott is still very much the great filmmaker we remember, able to keep you glued to your seat and biting your nails as the plot unfolds. The first half of the movie really lives up to your expectation, building suspense and then reaching a point where you really feel like it's about to take off into serious horror.But that's exactly the moment where the movie spins off its axis, with disparate plot threads falling off into unexplored plot holes, and the thrill ride screeching to a halt so the movie can pontificate.The problem is that the film, as written by John Spaihts and Damon Lindelof, although a chronological prequel to Alien, doesn't feel like a sci-fi movie, rarely feels like a horror movie, and is dissimilar in tone to Alien in almost every way. Scott, Spaihts, and Lindelof have given us mythology where once we had menace, gods in place of our favorite monsters, and turned one of our favorite thrill rides into a somber meditation on mortality, sacrifice, and selfishness. The movie suffers from a slow pace and an anti-climactic finish, and lets its desire to retell Greek myth overwhelm its natural function to make a cool as hell movie. It's good, but it's not as good as you want it to be.But there's always hope. Hell, maybe James Cameron will direct Prometheus 2.Game over, man. Game over.

Ridley Scott have done it again = thanks!,"Well, at least for me and 4 of my good friends, after being thrown in to the cinema-darkness and mystical/scarry sci-fi-drama of Prometheus. We all more or less, basically came with a ""fresh mind"" to this movie, and was NOT expecting it to be, or look like the our old favorite from 1979. So from that point, we all were blown away with the fantastic movie scenery right from the start, and to the vary end – picking up to a Prometheus 2 (we all really hope it will come) PLEASE Ridley Scott! We had the choice of seeing it in 3D or 2D, but as we all feel that 3D is way to over-exaggerated, we went for the ""good-old"" 2D version (thank god for that!!!!) and though this little review is more ""generel"" i just wanna say that Prometheus got us all excited, thinking and wondering with new questions, trying to fit all the pieces from the old story to the ""new"" story, and we all definitely need to see this great movie again!

"In space, nobody can hear you yawn.","I really wanted to love this movie. I love most of what Ridley's done over the years. And I usually don't write reviews, so forgive me my sophomoric style. But I have something I am compelled to say about this particular movie.Prometheus has some fantastic elements, some very thoughtful, some funny, and some frightening. It has great CGI, beautiful ships, cool sets, Charlize-freaking-Theron.. all of which are potentially the soup of a great movie. And I can forgive holes in scripts, or ambiguous endings or threads of sub-story endings...But where this movie fails is in the glue that holds it all together. The main storyline fails at grabbing all these disparate pieces, fitting them into a seamless (or even spotty) whole, and lifting them (and us in the process) up to a new level at the climax of the film. So ultimately, any of the elements of Prometheus, including Charlize-Freaking-Theron (whom I adore, if you didn't notice), become dispensable. They seem detached, and unimportant.So what exactly is the storyline anyway?I think it's actually about hubris - Ridley Scott's hubris in thinking he could take all of these multi-million dollar elements, put them in a blender with Charlize-Freaking-Theron and Naomi Rapace, and leave it to the viewers to make Promethean apologetics that would form an actual main storyline in the process. It was hubris believing we would ultimately envisage an underlying genius, given enough time.I believe the old man in this film is symbolic of Ridley Scott. He has the money and the power to form this voyage, but really has no idea what is waiting at the end. Rather than sharing his wisdom and telling us what he does know, he will squander his chances by having his own creation attempt to interpret it for him of its own volition. Which will of course lead to mayhem and *** SPOILER ALERT*** ...more headless robots.I think giving it six out of ten stars is generous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Typically Ridley Scott, typically epic.","Prometheus: (vaguely spoiler free as always)Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea but if you're a fan of Sci-Fi thrillers like me, it was simply splendid! Thankfully it's not a horrible over-the-top Hollywood disaster, with more to offer than just the scenes in the painfully overplayed trailer.Reminiscent of other greats of the genre, it is at times slightly predictable but definitely a good trade-off as Id rather have a textbook-ish (but certainly not cliché) genre based film rather than an experimental mishap with lackluster effort (Rodriguez's ""Preadators"" easily fitting the bill there). It definitely pulls no punches and the odd plot-twists throughout the film only add to them film's consistent level of intensity. It was a film that started out being a prequel to the ""Alien"" series that went on a creative tangent only to end up being a standalone film with ""Weyland Corporation"" being the only tie to the Alien universe in the film. I repeat, its not an ""Alien"" movie and you shouldn't go in thinking that it is going to be one. With regard to the plot, it is wholesome enough to fill you in yet leaving enough for audience interpretation and questioning, a trait of any good Sci-Fi/thriller and something that modern day cinema tends to lack more and more nowadays in our dumbed down Bayformer films becoming increasingly rampant.The acting was definitely above par with the cast including great performances from Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender who successfully pulls of playing a humanizing robot, an odd gray area that was definitely felt by audiences.Ridley Scott does an amazing job with masterful directing and cinematography and shooting straight in 3D, avoiding any post processing bullshit.

Ridley Scott Returns to the Alien Franchise to Direct a Prequel,"Prometheus is about a group of people who travel to a planet where they believe the alien race that created mankind lives. What they find, though, is most definitely not the meaning of life.Now Prometheus is actually a prequel to the 1979 sci-fi classic Alien, also directed by Ridley Scott. Even though it is a prequel, it is at the same time a completely different movie. First of all, the creatures in this movie are way different than the Xenomorphs we met in the Alien franchise. Also, the cast of characters is totally different. The movie takes place 96 years before the events of Alien, so the setting and the story is very different. However it does include some references to those films, and also some well-placed fan-service that most Alien fans will appreciate.The movie isn't as good as Alien. The progression isn't as great, the creatures aren't as scary and the movie overall isn't the sci-fi masterpiece it wants to be. It's still a very good movie, just not as amazing as you would want.Overall, Prometheus is a very good prequel to a popular franchise and Alien/Ridley Scott/sci- fi fans will most likely be pleased.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Sci Fi Mash up of Bits and Pieces of Alien, 2001","Made with a lot of attention to visual style and gross-out jump scares, Prometheus can provide a decent popcorn summer movie. Unfortunately, the movie suffers from poorly developed characters and a plot filled with non-nonsensical motivations.Without going into any details of the plot, I will simply say that the more you think about how the story progresses, too many bold assertions are made by characters who are too stupid to make reasonable decisions. The plot jumps around from set piece to set piece, which are visual stunning but the movie does not take the time needed to have these set pieces fit into the story.The characters are pretty much clichés of other sci-fi movies, the cold ice queen, the reckless lone wolf, the jokey technicians, etc. There are also a lot of lines pulled from other movies and many of these set piece moments are just reinterpretations from other movies like Alien, 2001 etc.In fact, I just find the writing poor and this clearly ruins any chance of this movie reaching the epic, classic level that so many fans will be hoping the film to be. I only wish Ridley Scott had stuck to his promise to not make a sci-fi movie until he has a script worthy of the word he had so expertly crafted in Alien.I have to feel that this script, much like Lost, is just a stylized mess of a story with no real thread that ties it together although it seems to imply one. So, perhaps the real problem with Prometheus lies in the script from Lost's writer Damon Lindelof.So, while there are some rally cools scares late in the movie and the movie is visually stunning, thanks to Ridley Scott, it lacks the kind of magic that can happen when a great story and a great director get together.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not bad at all,"I like the movie and do not share the objections of those who know exactly what would proper scientists do in such situation. Orbiting, examining, protocols and so on. But they were no scientists, rather some pseudo scientific adventurers hired by some crazy rich entrepreneur. And that is what would entrepreneurs do. Use the science to get more, risk life for a profit, value themselves more than others. I think there is the point most of reviewers didn't get.

A sci-fi fan's science fiction movie.,"I'm stingy with my ratings. I seldom give out anything above an 8, even to the most impressive films.I'm giving Prometheus a 9.There is no weak link in this movie; there is nothing to point at as useless filler. Every inch of it is filled with meaningful things: Things which have a purpose to exist.In offering these things, we're treated to a master-work in the art of creating atmosphere on the big screen. The most apathetic and stoic of us will find it difficult to remain completely unaffected by the intensity of suspense encountered here. It moves in grand strides: The serene, human dominated world - one of technological sterility and human born power is created. The narrative introduces a twist ... nature. Nature reduces mans illusions to tatters. It's a powerful arc when done properly.To truly enjoy Prometheus (a film which I would most aptly describe as a mixture between Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey) you must have gone further: You must have totally absorbed the environment, characters,realities, weaknesses, the entire essence of this world - its archetypes, and their predecessors.And make no mistake, this is a profoundly symbolic film.On watching the movie once as of writing this, I clearly appreciated the fluidity and genuineness with which the director was able to summon the archetypes, plots, dynamics and human drama of cinematic past (or future, in the films case). I would imagine I could only appreciate the vast landscape of symbolism even more on repeated viewing.There are a plethora of lyrical, visual and sensual payoffs to keen observers. This is a movie which demands and rewards attention.Ridley Scott has crafted something difficult and done it with a perceived ability of ease and flawlessness which is inspiring. Various sci-fi masterpieces meld together in this epic; the genre being represented in almost every way shape and form.In the end, though, what we have is a philosophical film. It's up to every individual to take what they can/want/will from the symbolism and drama portrayed here: And there is a great deal of it. Death, life, mortality, the contrast between the sterility of technology and the vividness of organic life ...Herman Melville wrote about man's epic duel with nature ... one he is destined to lose. Prometheus continues this great philosophical legend with masterful visual effects, effective and unwasted dialogue, and an unwavering focus by the director on the core of its message.And as if this all wasn't enough, as an afterthought we're presented with the most convincing female lead since - well ... Alien.Man ... Materialism ... Vanity ... Nature ... Destruction ... it's all in this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Flirts with mediocrity too much,"As a true fan of the Alien franchise and Ridley Scott, I wanted to like this film very much. I didn't want to believe the bad reviews, yet they are right when they say this film is mediocre in a lot of ways. In certain aspects the viewer feels that if a little more thought went into them, they could have turned out much better... like the characters for instance. The smallest problem with them that they are very cliché, the bigger problem is, that they are really dumb. Not for scientists, but for average people. It seems like they lack common sense in several situations. Thanks to the bad writing, you never have the sense of reality which helped significantly the first Alien film to gain its cult status. In short, the whole film is watered down to the level of your average Hollywood popcorn flicks in terms of character interactions. Another huge let down is, that there are annoying plot holes all over. You get the feeling, that they had to cut out important scenes at the expense of making sense. And I'm a guy who usually willing to look over this kind of stuff, if its not downright insulting to intelligence. Now let me write a few thoughts about the design. Stuff that worked before, still works. The Prometheus, the suits and the gadgets are okay. But at some scenes I felt, they were made only to show, ""look guys how much stuff our computers can render""! Simple case of overdoing stuff, because they had the budget and resources. Prometheus isn't all bad, it has some really worthwhile scenes where I felt, that Mr. Scott still has it. Unfortunately these are greatly overshadowed by the flaws. Michael Fassbender is definitely the best among the acting crew, his performance alone worth seeing this film. Overall my opinion is, that Prometheus could have been much better if it didn't want to impress the widest audience possible so badly and just a little more thought went into the writing. Still enjoyable, but a lot of us expected more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Scott's formula proves to be among us along with some possibly-foreseen life forms,"It is a vast understatement to label Prometheus one of the most anticipated films of the year. This film was said to have so much and occupied a great deal hype that it was truly impossible that a film could live up to it all. It was rumored to be a prequel to Alien, and I guess now we're just labeling it ""strikingly similar."" Not seeing Alien in probably six or seven years, I can't totally state if the mythology is reminiscent to that film, but I could judge on what very few people are judging it as; its own film.The film's plot wasn't clearly revealed in any trailers and online speculations and leaks were very slim, so it's hard to decipher where the fine line of general information and spoilers are when describing the film. The jist is that it is the year 2089, and a gang of archaeologists discover a rare star map that is apparently linked to the forerunners of the human race. The main scientist funds the creation of the scientific vessel, dubbed ""Prometheus,"" so that a group of archaeologists can travel to the moon LV-223. Guided by an android named David (Fassbender), the gang sets off on what becomes a four year journey through the galaxy until they finally land on the distant moon.From there on out, it's exploration time, hopefully answering some much needed questions about the world we inhabit today, the life on this moon, and what lies ahead. The scientists we come to vaguely know are Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace), the man who funded the trip, Peter Weyland (Pearce), Captain Janek (Elba), Shaw's crush, Charlie (Marshall-Green), the monitor of the trip, Meredith (Theron), Milburn the botanist (Spall), and the geologist, Fifield (Harris).All the actors do a very good job at performing throughout the picture, particularly Michael Fassbender as the android. At this point, the man can do no wrong. He has proved himself to be a man of true versatility and charisma, transcending characters from a depraved sex addict to someone non-human. It is rare that in this day and age we get an actor so committed to cinema that he is willing to take roles seemingly for more than the pay. Other crew members, like Idris Elba and Charlize Theron, too do a great job in their respected roles.Not to mention, on an atmospheric note, the film looks remarkable. The visuals are remarkable, some sequences on the moon are very staged brilliantly, and a lot of the environment is put to great use.After we are greeted with these favorable elements, Prometheus starts to become a relatively conventional sci-fi story. Its look is great, but nothing wholly different from what we have seen in recent years, its story is not a deeply moving or one we haven't touched on, and the characters lack depth and sympathy from an audience perspective and that is a big problem. At times, the film seems to be overly concerned with asking questions it doesn't know the answers too (which quickly becomes a burden on the audience's part), and all building up towards the inevitable, forthcoming sequel that will be among us faster than this one can gross a record number.In the original Alien, not only was it fun to watch, but it was delightfully unexpected for its time. It was a surprise to see such technology put to great use, such developed characters functioning inside a different and organized plot, and everything felt fresh and inviting. Prometheus feels like a tune already sung before, just given to a different band.Ridley Scott is the kind of director who you could see getting a barrage of different ideas and making them into capable and memorable epics. The problem is he has a growing talent for choosing scripts that spend too much time on the landscapes and the intricate features rather than character development, tone, and progression. I could compare Prometheus a lot with Gladiator, in the respect that both films are long, sometimes difficult to sit through, not always interesting, plagued by repetition, and are lifted by one performance in the supporting role. They aren't particularly awful films, but painfully ordinary and traditional.It has been mentioned numerous times that the film occupies plot holes. Without thinking too hard about the story, I can think of one. We are greeted with some A-class technology here, some of the brightest, crispest, most involving use of computers I have yet to see in a film. Everything seems so lifelike, accurate, and impenetrable, that if this is rumored to take place a century before Alien or be a standard prequel, I have one question; how is the technology more accurate and everything so meticulously advanced?

Prometheus Review,"Prometheus was a great movie for what it is worth. It did the job in a beautiful way and for that I believe it deserves an eight out of ten or even higher.People will always point out the flaws in a movie and Prometheus is not exempt. The only major issue for people that cannot simply enjoy a movie without picking it apart is the risky behavior of the crew. For example, they took their helmets off on a foreign planet without much thought. I do agree that this behavior is not what a very professional scientific exploration party would do but this does not mean that the movie is unrealistic just that this specific crew might not have been too professional. Prometheus tells the story of an unsuccessful mission to a dangerous planet. Mistakes were made by the people and that is just another aspect of the story not a flaw in the plot line. Another error that I myself had an issue with is the surgery that a main character performs on herself. She basically performs a C-section on herself then gets up and walks away. This is not realistic by today's standards. The only possible reason for this speedy recovery would be advancement in medical technology. None of the flaws I saw within this movie greatly effected its quality in my opinion.Prometheus is a very good movie for various reasons. The effects are beautiful and the content provides for a good time. Prometheus is a work of art that we all can enjoy. The performances of several of the actors should be rewarded. Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace both gave great, memorable performances. If you have not seen Prometheus I would recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
In Space nobody cares about the whining of Alien fanboys who can't let go and enjoy a great romp..,"OK time for a little balance.. put down your xenomorph figurines and stop your whining!Prometheus is nowhere near the supposedly 'awful/woeful/appalling' insult to the apparently sensitive intellects who have posted so many negative reviews..In fact it's quite a fine, if imperfect, film which demonstrates that Ridley Scott still has a firm grip on crafting stunning looking (acknowledged by almost everyone who loathes it yet almost immediately & conveniently ignored) engaging movies.The leads, both Rapace and Fassbender do a fantastic job and in many ways they're the glue that holds together the weaker parts of Prometheus.There are a few standout scenes of humor, horror and action and though the pacing is somewhat erratic and some of the dialog a little undercooked - and please, NOWHERE near as insulting as many like to pretend - Scott still manages to touch on themes that have resonated through his previous efforts such as Blade Runner (what does it mean to be human?) and reference classics such as Star Trek and 2001. That's no mean feat. Sure, the basic narrative is the same..boy and girl meet planet and find ugly stuff going on! But since when did anyone hold that against so many other beloved films in the genre?Sometime last year i remember reading an IMDb review that lambasted the original Alien film as 'boring and not scary at all'.I only bring that up because I think Prometheus in many regards is born into a very different world than Alien and just like it, will find an audience who are not so obsessively tethered to the halo that fanboy tragics have created for the original Alien film which it is somewhat connected to.Personally I think it's a modern classic alongside District 9, Sunshine and Moon.

Philosophical and Unique,"Despite angered viewers and reviewers, ""Prometheus"" is unique to the ""Alien"" franchise, being the first movie to not actually show a Xenomorph until the final moments. Despite all of the negative feedback the film has received, it is easily one of the top movies of the franchise. ""Prometheus"", unlike the other films, is not about the survival against the alien, but about survival against age and time, as a weary old man withers, and searches for the creation of humans to plead with them to extend his life, or better still, gift him immortality.The prequel to ""Alien"" is filled with nods which will excite fans, but still seem relevant to the new viewer. The acting is good, but, as usual, the visual effects and make-up overshadow them all, with particularly exceptional make-up for ""The Engineer"" (a late antagonist), contrasted with a detailed set. The only issue with the film were some continuity errors (which may possibly be explained in later sequels). Unfortunately though, the dissatisfied fans and lack of horror elements means that this film won't be remembered for its underlying intricate philosophical teachings and story line.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Ridley Scott at his best, underrated film.","In this film, Ridley Scott mixes thought provoking science fiction with the classic gore body-horror sci-fi of his Alien film.IMHO he succeeds though he misfires somewhat. The cast is amazing and full of stars (Charlize Theron, etc), but the strong protagonist (Noomi Rapace) is the highlight, she is just perfect (and it's a huge shame she does not appear in the sequel to this film).The body-horror Alien moments are also top notch and horrifying.Where does this misfire? As with the Alien Covenant sequel, it feels like Ridley Scott is trying to ask deep questions but the end result ends up half baked and feeling dumb. To avoid spoiling too much: We start with an interesting premise (the origin of humanity) and we end up with body-ripping Aliens and people who take pretty dumb actions.But altogether, it's a nice effort that will be appreciated by all fans of the Alien franchise and of sci-fi horror in general.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The expedition is supervised by the Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), an official of Weyland Industries which funded the mission, and an android, David 8 (Michael Fassbender). The vessel is captained by the crusty Janek (Idris Elba). Prometheus lands and the scientists begin searching around.They stumble across a giant structure buried in the soil.

Just Let Go,"There are a few things i've learned from all the ""games"" around this movie. Michael Fassbender has made the film Gods furious (don't ask me why), Ridley Scott is also trying stuff, and viral videos or many extended trailers are bad for your mental health and judgment. So, blow away the fog of prejudice that's fallen over Hollywood, pay attention to the film and find out whether you like it or not, whether it's related to Alien or NOT.One of the first few premier screenings of Prometheus was in 3D. Still, i don't think that any other film can be as great in 3D as Avatar. Most of the times, during watching, i was taking off the glasses to rest my eyes. It was like watching a 2D movie with an unnecessary filter. My expectations were high, due to the visual effects that were introduced in the trailers, but it appeared that one can pleasantly watch it in 2D (so keep that money for an extra cup of your favorite beverage).The story is simple. A team of scientist funded by a big technological corporation (Weyland Industries) are setting a course to a distant planet in search of the origins of mankind, based on the ""writings"" of a cave wall and considering it as a message from the creators of humanity.The ""actual"" cast is rather limited. Michael Fassbender performs very accurate as the android who escorts the team to -originaly- help the scientists and plays an important role through-out the film. The other important character is Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw. I think the film makers wanted a new version of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, but no! The rest of the cast is mostly supportive, like Charlize Theron, Logan Marshall-Green and Idris Elba. They're all very good actors but this movie didn't seem like a chance for them to rise up a bit more. Everyone else seemed dispensable and their actions predictable enough to figure out for yourself on ""who stays till the end"".The visual effects are quite rewarding with some really great photography and a few of Ridley Scott's cinematic tricks and camera takes. There are some flaws, if you watch carefully. I see it as a game like Spot The Differences or What's Wrong With This Picture! That's interesting.Truth is, i was never interested in the Alien movies (even though i'm a huge sci-fi fan). I know their story but none of it got me to follow religiously and blindly Ridley Scott's work -there are other films for that-. Here's the good news: You don't have to have seen Alien to watch Prometheus. If you've ever heard of it, that's good but not essential.Overall, it's a great sci-fi film, worth watching, makes the difference between all those remakes and comic book based films that are laying around lately. Could be called original (could be) and definitely needs (will be) a sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"For God's Sake, Who sabotage this film's rating?","This is a very philosophical and profound cinematic movie after ""Matrix"", and a true ""Sci-fi"" movie that is not boring and very interesting.

"Horror sci fi done right, incredibly ambitious","Prometheus has been my most anticipated for a while. The reviews were disappointing, to say the least, but also incredibly intriguing. Was it actually a prequel to Alien? Well, it shares certain elements to Alien, and I won't say more.The problem stems from the way people wanted, or expected, this to be like Alien. It's not, at all. It doesn't have the slow pace Alien had, or the slow-building suspense and atmosphere. Instead, it does quite a few things. I would be lying if I said the film didn't seem overpacked with story lines and ideas. As it goes on, one is able to see just how much the filmmakers were trying to do here. Yet it all works. I have heard people criticize the script, the characters and dialogue especially. I was surprised that I didn't find any serious problems with those aspects. Many of the minor characters don't get much to do, but I found myself incredibly captivated by some of the more important ones, specifically Fassbender and Theron's. Both give two great performance here, and they make their scenes all the more exciting because there's so much intrigue and mystery surrounding their motivations.The main flaw I would point out would actually be the editing. Although fantastic at times, the middle section of the film feels overstuffed. Perhaps better editing would have made it feel seamless and would have paced those scenes better. And, I am happy to say, the film has it's fair share of incredible excitement. There's several amazing moments here, and I am happy to say although it isn't the type of horror film Alien was, it still has its good amount of freak-out horrifying moments. Not incredibly scary, but still extremely disturbing and definitely had me on the edge of my seat.For all of the reviews I have read, I am rather surprised by what the film actually was. Ever since seeing the trailer I wanted a suspenseful, extremely well-directed, slow-building sci-fi horror. What the film actually is is an incredibly intriguing, fast-paced, sci-fi/horror mystery. It's not as simple as Alien in its narrative and storyline, or as moody, but still a great film nonetheless that, while flawed, is a roller-coaster ride no doubt. I loved it, and for that I am glad.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Mixed Reactions,"Immediately after viewing Ridley Scott's triumphant return to science fiction I found myself a divided house. On the one hand we have stunning visuals, some fantastic alien creatures, and a story that delves into deep themes about the creation and destruction of life. On the other hand however we have one-dimensional characters whose motivations are often dubious or whose actions are often inconsistent with aspects of their characters seen moments ago. We have a plot that wants to pretend it's all about seeking our creators, whoever or whatever they may be, which much also pay lip-service to Alien by having obligatory suspense and terror.The film has been called related to Alien but not a prequel in and of itself, but this is just a clever marketing gimmick to skirt around the fact that the movie attempts to answer all the questions a fan of Alien might have about xenomorphs and what created them AND us, but then it falls short and answers none of them. The movie comes tantalizingly close to connecting the dots in a satisfactory way but then in the final act decides against bringing the story to an agreeable climax and instead opts to simply set up more sequels.Presumably these sequels will also connect the dots further leading in to Alien. So while I enjoyed the film and absolutely love seeing Ridley play around in the visual sandbox that is the Alien universe again, I also feel very much cheated by the movie. It teases you with pseudo-explanations and leaves you filling in many of the blanks yourself while the dots it does connect with Alien only leave you with further questions. Had this movie only been tangentially related to Alien, but been a stand-alone story, it could have worked, but the movie instead seems to want to be half-prequel and half-original all while setting up for a sequel to the prequel. Honestly after feeling hoodwinked by this film I'm not sure I want to pay to see another two hour plus series of half-answers, when really deep down the xenomorphs themselves are more interesting than pseudo-philosophical musings on how and why they were created.The movie is by no means bad, it has its flaws to be sure, but if the buzz so far is any indication I have a feeling it will be polarizing and leave many who had different expectations with a bad taste in their mouths. In the end it's hard to give it a rating on a scale of 1-10, parts of it are brilliant, stunning, and deep, other parts of it are shallow, pointless, and at times downright silly. Not bad, perhaps okay, but certainly not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott still has it,"...I have to admit that, when I heard about Prometheus, i was EXCITED, but cautiously so. Mr. Scott had made some exceptional films over the years, and that he was somehow revisiting the universe which really put him on the map, way back in 1979, i was quite intrigued.At the same time, Mr. Scott's more recent efforts (Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood, American Gangster, A Good Year) hadn't exactly been spectacular (I know many people tell me to watch the director's cut of Kingdom, but i was so thoroughly disappointed by the theatrical cut that i just can't bring myself to risk it.)My excitement got the better of me so I decided to go to an opening IMAX 3D screening of this one, and boy... Am I glad i did.Ridley absolutely still has some big time films in him. To take a film billing itself as a prequel to ALIEN, and turn it into a grandiose adventure to attempt to meet our g(G)od(s) was just incredibly unexpected and bold.But good gosh, what a beautifully shot, cinematic adventure!More science fiction then horror, there ARE a couple of segments that will turn the stomach of the unprepared, including one scene that i swear hearkens back to the intensity and stomach-churning horror of that classic scene in ALIEN...The best thing i can say about this film: When it was finished i wanted to get back in line and see it again.A must-see on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Prometheus,"As one of two most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2012 by most fervent cinema-goers, me included (the other is THE DARK KNIGHT RISE, doubtlessly), I watched it in the cinema, a plain 2D version, but in a nutshell, it is not satisfactory at all.The film has wrought some doze-prompted moments, there are just too many routine procedures have to be dealt with (tediously) to tell a tale (with cliché-ridden dialogues and stereotyped roles) before any flare or more precisely, casualty to take action. Then quite ironically, the ill-fated first casualties are the geographer and the biologist (no career-based prejudice, I may watch too much of THE BIG BANG THEORY), whose raisons d'être are never being expounded on, just like most of the remaining crew.What I could not expected is the mono-designed location, because one might take it for granted that with such a budget, at least, the crew of Prometheus could bring its audience to experience more polychromatic locales, but no (anyway, I cannot be too picky as the original ALIEN 1979 is also largely constricted), which cause some aesthetic fatigue since the same palette has occupying the screen for almost 120 minutes.The meat-and-potatoes virtue of the film nevertheless lies in its astronomically staggering SFXs, though trapped in a pretty dark hue background, the outer spaceship's emergence and the laconic crash has its magic spell to conquer any Sci-Fi fanboys' cravings.(Tiny spoilers below) The suicide attack is too reckless to feel cogent under its life-and-death circumstances and Ridley Scott has no intention to exude any mercy towards the cast, leaving no side branches makes the film desperately yearn for a new page and commence another chapter.The cast, the never-do-wrong Fassbender captures the spotlight again in his unexpected role (I will not spill the beans here) and a Ridley-remolded heroine Noomi Rapace picks up her gauntlet to emulate Sigourney Weaver's idolized torch-blazer, which comes out to be a shade pessimistic, but the surrealistic and unsettling self-operated Cesarean section is plain too shocking to believe one's own eyes, let alone the consequent recovery, this gal is not a woman, even not a human!Has another leading-lady-goes-supporting role in a mainstream summer production, Charlize Theron's faculty has not been fully dug (she could create and pull off more strain and mayhem if had given her role a bit more dimension, damn you screenwriters!), and so is Guy Pearce, whose presence is so unnecessary, if not just to pay extra stipends to the make-up team.Ostensibly to seek for human race's genesis, the film eventually left too many unexplained questions for it's supposed sequel (the box office is slightly under-performed so far), so if there will be one, Mr. Ridley please assures that it is the script which should be the paramount task to labor over!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
will be known as the forgotten prequel to alien,"I don't know if there is an annual award for best movie trailer, but if there is, I'd say this one would win for sure. Unfortunately, it was a major let down not only to me but to everyone else it seems as well. Which is bizarre when you take a look at the people involved in making this movie. How could you go wrong with Ridley Scott going back to his roots and taking on the epitome of arguably the greatest sci-fi horror genre Alien, that he began. How could you go wrong with Oscar winner Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender(to his credit, he was very good in this movie), Noomie Rapace, Idris Elba, and going back all the way to the beginning to find out who it was that was carrying the alien cargo, back in 1979? Everything fell flat in this movie, except for one scene that made me give this movie a 6 instead of a 4. It was an intense, gruesome, unflinching scene, that was awesome. It's a shame the movie didn't have more intensity like that scene did, and it's even more of a shame that it didn't equal up to the trailer that showed the potential that it had and could have been.

If it's to realistic no one believes it.,"This movie is about an eccentric billionaire on a suicidal mission. No sane person will follow this, supposedly, already dead person to his death and that's why the crew are all misfits, robots or very naive. As such they do not always act in a rational way. Many do for example think that Millburns behavior when he saw the snake where unbelievable but given his relationship to Fifield and his poor professionalism it is rather explainable; finally he saw he saw his chance to show that he had the situation under control and could escape criticism from Fifield. Stupid yes but limited people often are stupid when they try to impress and adapt socially. When we think about space travel we think of this extremely well trained and well prepared astronauts that are backed up by the whole world's science community but that are not the case here, in the future that this movie portrays space exploration is just as any other business. Given these facts I don't find their behavior is so unrealistic. What I find, though, was a very thoughtful story that got me thinking and ask questions. When it comes to the actors I think everyone did their work but I was a bit surprised that Noomi Rapace could play her role so well. She was not a hero, like Ripley, and that she showed in a very believable way. Besides from that Michael Fassbender did something out of the ordinary. I hope that the sequel will show that this was just a build up to a fantastic epic story. I hope that Ridley Scott stay white the plan and not try to adapt to the criticism.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Big Things... Have Small Beginnings.,"I admire this film. I really do. Ridley Scott presents some really interesting ideas about the origins of the terrifying being present in Alien (1979). However, it is something that will require a lot of re-watching and thinking to fully understand what the crew was actually going for.First off, the acting, there are a lot of ups and downs here. Michael Fassbender completely steals the show. He is leagues ahead of everyone else as David the Android. Guy Pearce is interesting in the role and he's having fun with it, and so do we because of that. Although his role had a twist which I saw coming from a mile away but nonetheless it was an interesting take to further progress the story. Charlize Theron and Idris Elba are so terribly wasted in their characters that it is baffling considering the talent they possess.The real problem here is the story. I'm sure the writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof along with director Ridley Scott knew what they were doing but still they had a tough time translating it onto the screen. After some fantastic buildup towards the 3rd act and some really gory sequences in the 2nd act, the film just loses track, the twists are still baffling and the end result is hopelessly convoluted. As an ambitious epic, it cranks up the style and scope of the Alien saga, to differing effects. In terms of positives, this is one of the best-looking fantasy worlds ever created, and is every bit as immersive as the previous films, if not more so. This makes for some ground-breaking visual effects and stunning production design, but as is the case with most technical marvels like Tron: Legacy and Transformers, less is invested in the story. The ending also doesn't make a lot of sense but it's like enjoyably audacious nonsense.I would like to say although Ridley Scott presented us with new ideas he had for the alien franchise which were differing from the original alien presence, they weren't translated on-screen as polished as they should've been. I do want to know more about the Engineers but I guess Scott decided not to pursue this new storyline completely and hence just made Alien-Covenant afterwards which was a great decision considering the continuation of the franchise but also saddening that we just get back to the old Alien thing and the possibility of having a new, beautiful creature was lost.

It's been a while since I've seen a movie that had so many extreme and engrossing scenes as Prometheus. The acting is superb, special effects have never been better, and the story is one that is consuming in a dark and unknown way. This is not a horror movie, this is not a space war movie, it's a movie about explorers looking for answers. Prometheus has some really crazy moments that won't necessarily make you jump scared out of your seat, but will leave you in disbelief as to what you are witnessing.

BEST PREQUEL EVER,"PROMETHEUS was the first of 3 connected prequels planned by Ridley Scott. It is a wondrous and philosophical film in itself as we follow David, a synthetic played by Michael Fassbender, and Weyland, his powerful and human creator, seek the potential creators of humankind, thought to be represented by the mummified space jockey's race in ALIEN. It is important to understand that there are two types of Alien fans. First there are the supporters of Ridley Scott and his originating film ALIEN devised and scripted first by Dan O'Bsnnon (who worked with John Carpenter on the student film DARK STAR, an early vehicle for his idea of an invading alien lifeform). And then there are the supporters of James Cameron's sequel ALIENS. These two groups have been at loggerheads ever since and the difference between the first two films is that Scott is asking questions about our place in the universe through a suspense film while Cameron has made an action film primarily. So when Scott returns to the Alien franchise with PROMETHEUS in 2012, there is much criticism from ALIENS fans that Scott has made a lumbering shallow movie from a multiplicity of scripts. Nothing could be further from the truth, and it must be noted that Scott does not make action films, and all films have many script changes in their making. Those action films like Marvel films are largely the shallow and boring movies. James Cameron is capable of making deeper films too - his ALIENS is still a good picture and continues to promote the Ripley character as heroic as well as the controversy surrounding profiteering by Weyland Industries over ethical behaviour but his AVATAR is one of the most boring films ever made - but Scott always has a deeper subtext going on in every film he does. However, with Scott there is a slower unfolding of the story because he wants the audience to think about the issues raised as they watch and he also wants to build the suspense like a symphony. It is not for nothing that Scott often has shower scenes in his films in a subconscious homage to Hitchcock's PSYCHO. Scott won't have an explosion every 10 minutes like Roger Corman's B movies. He wants to develop the characters and the ideas that form the subtextual meaning of his work. I point out the discrepancy in fan valuations of Scott and Cameron in order to say do not be put off by those that criticise Scott's work, because there is much that is thought-provoking in PROMETHEUS. And it is a film that is meant to set the stage for two following related prequels to ALIEN. The film itself is incredible to watch and though much has to be explained to set up the next films, it is once more a battle between Woman and Man, and Woman and Alien just like the original. But it is also much, much more than this. See it with an open mind, the way all movies should be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Alien 30 years later,"With Ridley Scott returning to the science fiction genre's space travel segment, and doing so with a lot of ambition, he cannot help but raise the stakes and create high expectations. And rightly so, because since making a name for himself in said genre with films like Alien and Blade Runner, Scott has continued to output large-scale productions of a high quality, although he has arguably never again made such iconic films as the two aforementioned. And as Prometheus opens, with its alluring combo of creative existentialism, Star Trek-ish robots and the genre-typical crew composition and presentation, it's difficult not to get sucked into the possibilities it opens and the promise of it all. The story and backdrop is so well thought out and aptly handled, and Scott keeps us aptly in the dark with a notion that there is more to the story than what meets the eye.As our spacecraft approaches its destination, and the narrative turns from voyage to operation, Scott still retains his thought-provoking, sly style of storytelling. The film grows increasingly eerie, and Scott starts introducing a few horror elements which moves Prometheus closer to Alien territory. Although there is no characterological connection between the films, there are more than subtle hints suggesting that the creature that Prometheus' crew is dealing with shares a good deal of DNA with Sigourney Weaver's old friend. And from the middle part of the film and on, our protagonists (notably Rapace and eventually Fassbender) must try to solve several recognizable space-travel mysteries: Who were there before them? What happened to them? Who can we trust onboard? And will we be able to get the ship back in the air?Prometheus does remain interesting throughout, but the originality which Scott looked to have promised us early on, mostly remains just that - promises. There is loads of unexplored territory and potential here, and we only get hints of the undeniable potency in Guy Pearce's character and the relationship between Rapace's and Fassbender's characters. Towards the end, we realise that this may well be because the filmmakers have their minds set on pre-planned sequels, and that this has lead to an intentional obscuring of information and storyline. I guess that's the way to make money in the business these days, but it's not the way to make great art. And Ridley Scott, if anybody, should know that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Prometheus is amazing!,"Just seen the first UK showing at midnight - I've come back really impressed!I tried to keep an open mind after a skimming through some average reviews, but I was sucked into the epic detail and scope with the first few minutes.The visual environment, atmosphere and technology is oozing with quality and the 3D is mostly top notch. This has to be one of the best looking films; certainly up there or above Avatar.A couple of slightly unnecessary characters aside, this is a perfect start to the world of the Alien, and gives a believably crafted story to all the questions that needed answering.It impressed me so much more than I expected and I would recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who has enjoyed the Alien films.I need more of this and not the drivel I mostly get to see at the cinema!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ridley's sweeping epic,"What can I say about Prometheus? As a science fiction stand alone film it is a definitely better than most films in its category but then that is a given with the huge budget and Ridley Scott behind the camera. As part of the Alien canon however it might be a bit more complex. Alien fanboys might get offended with where Scott has taken the story and the entire bit with the space engineers will elicit opinion on the extremes. Visually the film is stunning and some scenes are truly awe inspiring. The film has a feel and tone which is expansive. Scott, perhaps nearing old age wants to find the bigger questions to life and uses his film as a springboard to question it. There is no point comparing this film to Alien or even other films of the series simply because the approach is different. If you enjoy science fiction films you will certainly have an opinion on Prometheus.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Another disappointing attempt to squeeze more Alien blood,"This movie, like all other sequels to the 1979 movie ""Alien"" (in this case also called a ""prequel"", I guess), was a big disappointment to me, as I think it is to all serious science fiction lovers. I think I'm even more disappointed in Ridley Scott for directing it. Prometheus is another feeble attempt to squeeze more blood from the 1979 classic film. Prometheus did make a lot of money at the box office by appealing to the dumb and young movie audience masses, and will probably make more profit in other media. I guess one really can't fault film producers for wanting to get rich in their retirement. The plot of Prometheus convolves the original Alien story into a whacky futuristic thriller adventure in order to maximize use of CGI, and appeal to the 12 year old intelligence level, which is the largest demographic sector of the movie-going public.The original film, Alien, a great classic and favorite of mine since I first saw it as a young man with my girlfriend in a 1979 movie theater, has been the source of many poor efforts to capitalize on its greatness and fame. Granted, some of the original movie's special effects could have been better, but its story, film editing, visual effects, directing, camera work, screenplay, script, and acting were pure science fiction genius, brought together to make a beautiful classic suspense film that I am now convinced will never be improved upon, mainly because the film industry is driven by profit rather than art. Personally, I think it would be nice if film makers stopped getting a piece of the 1979 film action, and concentrate more on creating new original, serious science fiction motion picture art.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good visuals and a strong Fassbender performance make 'Prometheus' spasmodically enjoyable.,"'Prometheus', the anticipated prequel to the 'Alien' franchise, follows a team of archaeologists and scientists on an interstellar investigation into the origins of man. The film is graced by great visual effects, and the cast, in my opinion, is generally better than the ensemble of the later 'Alien' films. Idris Elba and Charlize Theron handled their roles well, but I think that the true star of 'Prometheus' was Michael Fassbender. His approach to the 'Lawrence of Arabia'-loving android, David, was fantastic. I'd also commend one particular scene, which I guess I'm not spoiling by labelling it ""the surgery scene"". It's my favourite scene from the 'Alien' franchise since the famous John Hurt one. Look out for this scene; it's very well-constructed. I think that the positives more or less end here, however. The ""all hell breaks loose"" moments in 'Prometheus' generally aren't as captivating or nearly as original as they were in the earlier films. Furthermore, generally good suspense is consistently followed by disappointing delivery. The desire to capitalise on the strong visuals seemed to compromise the story in places, for instance in the scene which had many viewers asking, ""why didn't they run sideways?"" I'm also quite critical of the character of Dr Charlie Holloway, as his portrayal really didn't convey intellect or expertise, as one would expect; he seems to fit in more with the convicts of 'Alien 3'. I was also particularly disappointed by the first ""big encounter""; its delivery, again, failed to mirror the earlier, far more atmospheric films. Overall, there were some enjoyable moments of 'Prometheus', but without Fassbender's performance it would have been interminable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"I loved everything about this movie, except the movie itself.","The problem with Prometheus is simple, its a badly scripted movie. Now as most people know, making a science fiction movie work is quite hard. For all those reviews complaining about theoretical things or physics or whatever need to be disregarded. Since faster than light travel is impossible at the moment that all but ensures we will never see another planet up close so why bother complaining about such things when its done in movies? Instead complain about the things that are controllable. Why a character does something? is the purpose of the movies main plot even explained properly? How do characters forget about obvious things that potentially could be harmful? how do smart men get lost so easily? Is there any human being on earth who looks at a snake and treats it like a cute puppy or kitten? Then why would a human treat an alien snake as such? Things like that is what ruins this movie. Because man is the environment, the acting, the costumes, the special effect, are they all top notch. I truly appreciate well done sci fi movies because of how hard it is to portray the future, an alien world, etc... so when there done well i enjoy that aspect. This movie did everything well, besides deliver a good movie. Watch it for the reasons i did, enjoy it for the reasons i did, and dislike the parts about it everyone dislikes, and you can still overall have a decent to good movie experience with Prometheus.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Good visuals, confusing plot, too many unanswered questions.","PrometheusIn anticipation of the new Alien movie in 2024, Romulus, I went back and rewatched Prometheus since it has been 12 years at the time of this review. Ridley Scott, director of the original 1979 classic, returns to set in motion the origin story of our lovable face hugging aliens.There are so many famous actors in this movie, I was surprised that I didn't remember that. However, like the audience, the characters didn't know what was going on throughout the entire movie. I'm not downplaying their acting, but seeing 17 people (the movie says so) act confused for 2 hours does not a good movie make.The movie is set in our current near future of 2089 where archaeologists find new cave paintings indicating alien life may have been the source of humanity on earth. Does this sound familiar? Stargate SG1 did this much better. 4 years later, a team is dispatched to a distant planet to figure out what happened.Of course, these things cost money, so a corporation is involved, because they always are. The scientists are searching for answers and the corporation's motives are never revealed, other than the owner wanting his age lowered? No indication of any of that is shown.I love that both of the living characters decided to run in a straight line when a narrow space is rolling toward you like a Ferris wheel. There is a YouTube channel that has made fun of this for years. I mean, come on.The actions taken by David, an android, also don't make sense. He must have programmed motives, but the devastation and tragedy on the planet are nearly all caused by his erratic behavior.Naming the ship Prometheus was a bit bold, in my opinion, because why would you want to be associated with Prometheus's fate? Do the aliens involved in earth get punished for humanity's creation, or do the humans get punished for awakening the long dead civilization.Lastly, I enjoyed the special effects and set design. For technology that is thousands of years old, and abandoned, it sure looked pretty nice. I just wish that there was a point to all this.When I wrote this, I hadn't seen Covenant so I'm hoping for some further development, but this movie alone leaves way too many questions left unanswered.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
seems fine to me,"I enjoy sci-fi, but I never saw this in the theaters and held off on buying it for years due to the negative reviews. I got it on sale for ten dollars today and gave it a look. How bad could it be for a $130m movie?As it turns out, it was actually quite entertaining. Must everything be perfect to even be considered worthy of a good rating? I see all these 1 and 2 ratings out of 10 for this. That's ridiculous. The acting was good. The dialog was fine. The story was far-fetched, but what do you expect from sci- fi?I enjoyed this as the sci-fi horror film it was designed to be (and I typically don't care for horror). If you watched an enjoyed the previous Aliens movies or sci-fi in general then you will likely enjoy this.

The Fan Edit is Better,"Alien is an all time favorite, not only for me, but for many around the world. And, so, for me, Prometheus had a lot to live up to. And it does, but I couldn't help noticing my lack of empathy for some of the characters.Recently I had the opportunity to view the online fan edit, which included the cut and extended scenes, as well as promotional material worked into the film. And all I can say is... Wow!I've given Prometheus a 7 out of 10 for the official release of the film, but would have scored it an 8 or possibly even a 9 had it of been left the way it was originally intended.What's that tell you?

Fire from the Gods,"Expectations for Ridley Scott's return to the universe he established in ""Alien"" have been high, to say the least. So bloody high that the film falls short for lots of people. While I suspect that most viewers went into this movie expecting a deep, mind-blowing cinematic masterpiece, I went in wanting nothing more than a solid piece of science fiction. I didn't want my mind blown, I didn't expect the film's quality to surpass ""Alien"" at all, and I didn't even expect the film to move all that fast.In spite of that, the film met my expectations. The film is gorgeous throughout, sporting impressive visual effects and camera-work. Its far better paced than I expected; I find ""Prometheus"" way more eventful than ""Alien"" (even though the two films were originally meant to be separate and distinct, it's too hard not to compare the two). There are some gnarly, disgusting, and agonizing scenes of creature horror. There's even a nice bit of action and peril towards the end. With a sense of mystery in the first half and a ton of crazy horror in the last act, the film is pretty darn thrilling. If there's any drag, it'd be in the middle, after the initial discoveries, and before all heck breaks lose.The story for this has some interesting ambition (although its achievement will be questionable by some). The nature of the story prompts frequent theological discussion, but it never really states anything conclusive. The plot for this mirrors ""Alien"" quite a bit, hitting up a lot of the same plot points. What makes ""Prometheus"" more engaging is that it's not just a straightforward man-vs-alien struggle; it's fueled by curiosity and the need to solve the universe's deepest mysteries. The film manages to bring up a lot of strange, interesting, and mysterious things as it goes on, and never fully answers everything. This will leave many to claim that the film is shallow, pretentious, or just plain stupid. Others may be confused and frustrated. Personally, I found myself wishing for more answers, but ultimately arrived to my own conclusions (I'm not even sure if a sequel is really warranted, but if it brings more answers, then I think we'd all welcome it). As far as ""Prometheus"" being an ""Alien"" prequel: the connections between the two films were very slight, up until the very last shot, which was likely tacked-on to please the fans and provide more sequel bait. And as far as characters go, they met my expectations. It's not like ""Alien"" had really grand depth in their characters, so ""Prometheus"" pretty much provides more of the same.The film is quite slick. I loved the photography and imagery. Acting is swell; I thought Michael Fassbender was perfect; I generally enjoyed Noomi Rapace's performance; Charlize Theron's character was not particularly likable, but was still interesting; everybody else fulfilled their roles just fine and dandy. Writing seems to be the culprit of the film's issues; the dialogue is not very sophisticated (even though it is lively and amusing enough), and the plot overall could have used some refinement. This production does have wonderful-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. It is especially interesting to see a lot more influences by HR Giger (including one of his rejected designs for ""Dune""). Music is pretty elegant at times.""Alien"" was released thirty-three years ago with mixed reviews, but is now regarded as a masterpiece. ""Blade Runner"" received a mixed reception on its release thirty years ago. Now ""Prometheus"" is outwith mixed reviews. Time will tell whether or not Ridley Scott's latest film will be revered in the same light as his older works. As it is now, I can only recommend it as a rental when the disc comes out.4.5/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 4/5, film: 4.5/5)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Visually stunning, narratively frustrating","There is a very good reason why everyone involved with this movie went out of their way to emphasize that this is not an ""Alien""-Prequel, and it's not because they wanted to trick and/or surprise us. Although ""Prometheus"" may share some of its DNA (to paraphrase Ridley Scott), and the events herein precedent those of the original ""Alien"" movie, tonally and conceptionally this is a very different (star) beast.Unfortunately, where ""Alien"" was a perfect organism, ""Prometheus"" is not without its flaws. Most of the ideas presented here are not particularly new, and while ""Prometheus"" raises some fascinating and intriguing questions, it mostly fails to provide answers. In ""Alien"", this wasn't a problem, because open questions like the Space Jockey were window-dressing that added some fascinating layers; but it wasn't what the movie was about. It served more as a foreboding of things to come, and added to the sense of danger and mystery; thus, leaving those questions open was not damning. Here, they are central to the movie, and delaying them for a possible sequel feels quite cynical, and makes ""Prometheus"" narratively unsatisfying and occasionally frustrating.The movie isn't helped by some plot contrivances that have some protagonists act in an illogical and/or uncharacteristic manner (especially given the fact that most of them are supposed to be scientists) as well as the very ill-conceived and unintentionally funny death of one particular character near the end, which only add to the frustration. Besides, I would have preferred it if the movie would have started with Prometheus already in flight, since the very first scene gave away too many answers to the questions that dominated ""Prometheus""' first half, and the second one was absolutely unnecessary, adding nothing to the movie.There's no denying though that ""Prometheus"" also has a lot of strengths. Arguably the biggest one are the impressive visuals. ""Prometheus"" looks absolutely stunning, and definitely should be seen on as big a screen as possible. The character of David is another essential strength of the movie. Michael Fassbender is incredible in the role, giving David an ambivalent and slightly ""off"" presence that make us question his motives right from the start. Since in ""Alien"", we didn't know that Ash was an Android, thus having no reason to feel uneasy in his presence, and the only reason we were skeptical towards Bishop were Ash's actions in the predecessor, this is the first time within the ""Alien""-universe that we can really understand the reserved feelings of the human crew towards their artificial companion. Most of the really intriguing questions raised by the movie are revolved around him.Further strengths are a couple of tense and gripping moments, some great individual scenes, the impressive art direction and set design, and Marc Streitenfeld's atmospheric score. Overall, ""Prometheus"" works better as a movie experience than a narratively satisfying movie in its own right. One thing's for sure, though: Whether you find it fascinating or frustrating (or both), ""Prometheus"" will stay with you long after you've left the cinema. That alone, plus the impressive visuals, make it a must-see for everyone who loves movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"This is my ""yeah, whatever"" review.","I decided to write this review in response to the one by charles-arthur-400-459316 that appeared on the front page for this movie and left me a bit baffled. Yes, obviously this movie is going to be compared with Alien. Alien was an outstanding movie in it's time, and it's now 33 years old, which makes it 2 years older than i am. I'm just going to assume that if you watched it in your teens when it came out, it quite simply blew your mind. Add to that 33 years of repeated viewings and nostalgia, and you have something that can't possibly be compared to anything new. So please, don't. I myself watched Alien for the first time 16 years ago, and i have very fond memories of it.With that in mind, i was pleasantly surprised when i saw Prometheus. Ridley Scott did the only thing he could possibly do, which was to blithely ignore the perceived responsibility to continue a saga, and make something new. And what it all boils down to is that this is a really fun movie. I truly enjoyed it. There are some crazy scenes in it. Michael Mann gives an outstanding performance, and the movie paints a bleak and hopeless view of the world that i found really fitting for the setting. Of course it has to cut corners. The question is if you can enjoy it for what it is, or if you're going to be so delusional as to expect a miracle of film making. I won't go into details on the movie itself, because obviously either you've already seen it or you have no intention to do so. Everyone knows that it exists, and everyone is going to have an idea of what to expect.I believe that the younger folks will view this movie for what it is, and enjoy it. If you believe you have to bring science into your evaluation of a fantasy movie, you're ignoring the film itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Engaging sci-fi that was over-hyped but still satisfying,"Advertising for me is something that I regularly still fall into the trap of; products that look amazing and promise the world but yet cannot ever really deliver the way they suggest. With summer blockbusters this has worn off a little bit for me and generally I do not get excited by the big trailers or the hope of fans that the new blockbuster will be the ""best film eva""; such things are generally followed by equally silly claims at the other extreme when of course the film cannot live up to the marketing hype. So it was with Prometheus, a film I was happy to catch one the crowds had been and gone. It was also a film that I didn't pay attention to the trailers, hype or reviews – nor was I in a frenzy simply because it was a part of the Alien franchise, a franchise that now has more misses in it than hits.The ideas with Prometheus did interest me though and of course it helped that they were presented within a multimillion pound film. The film explores a planet used by the original creature from the first Alien film which was overcome by some infection; a team of scientists discover more than they bargained for and it all goes to pot. As such it is familiar territory even if it must be said that the film doesn't ever really directly touch the Alien creature as we know it (or at least not till the final scene – a scene that feels inserted because the fans need to see the Alien and also come back with their money for the next film). The tone of the film does though and in essence it is a horror movie with good ideas as creatures of one sort or another pose a threat to the humans. I found it quite tense at times even if it is never a frightening or as consistently tense as I would have liked it to be. It does still deliver plenty of horror of a sort though and I enjoyed the bigger picture which it fits into – I can understand why some were not satisfied with this aspect of it, but for me it was fine.The special effects are impressive but it is a credit to the overall film that they are never the reason I was engaged; the effects mostly were just part of the story. The cast feature plenty to look at as well, with lots of names and heavyweight talent. Rapace isn't quite Ripley but she is a good lead. Fassbender is solid and manages to make good with the role despite walking a very familiar path. Theron is a good addition while Guy Pearce is a surprise and almost unrecognizable behind his makeup. Elba has a weak American accent (not sure why – he was brilliant with it in The Wire). Wong continues to make himself something of a cult when it comes to being involved in British sci-fi.Prometheus may not be the brilliant Alien prequel that it was marketed on, but it is still an interesting sci-fi horror that fits into the bigger picture and delivers a satisfying yarn with strong special effects.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Wasted Potential,"Hi guys, this is another review from Patrick James Green:THis film wasted it's amazing potential.

This film is all beauty, but no soul. Very disappointing. The other big question is how and if this film connects to the Alien franchise.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"PrometheusAliens love Halloween because it is the only time of the year when their favourite candy comes to their doorstep and rings the doorbell.And while this sci-fi movie isn't about mouthwatering minors, it is about dinner being home delivered.In the future, an expedition team (Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba) funded by a billionaire (Guy Pearce) and lead by archaeologists (Noomi Rapace, Logan Marshall-Green) embarks on a mission to locate a planet suspected of spawning human life.On the surface of the planet they discover ancient structures that they investigate in hopes of finding new life.Inside, however, along with strange cylinders filled with an ebony liquid, the team only finds certain death.A quasi-prequel to the Aliens franchise, Prometheus is visually stunning and also stomach turning.

shoots itself in the foot,"Well, in typical Hollywood fashion, someone throws a lot of money, talent, and brilliance into a movie and then shoots itself in the foot with a crippling bad choice of script--full of unbelievable characters and plot developments.I don't blame Ridley Scott for his directing, which is great, just for signing on to do the movie with the story the way it is. Similarly the actors all do fine and even in Michael Fassbender's case a great job its just that the majority of time they are stuck uttering lines and performing actions that are not congruent with common sense or common notions of how scientists act and a scientific expedition might unfold. Yeah, if you are 13 and you don't know how a geologist acts in the real world or how a scientific expedition really might operate I forgive you. But whoever wrote this movie is not 13 and damn them. I don't mind suspending belief at certain points but don't tell me the guy who acts like a grunt in the army is the captain of a 3 trillion dollar expedition, the scientist who heads the mission disobeys protocol (protocol being one of the MOST important things to scientists) and removes his helmet in an alien environment just because he feels like it, the geologist and supposed expert map maker is ironically the only one who gets lost and acts like the complete d-bag who hangs out at the local pub all day saying stupid sh*t that makes you think his IQ is that of a high school drop out, and the list goes on.I actually enjoyed this movie but am just upset that its such a gorgeous eye fest but not the whole package.

Could have been better,"I am disappointed on this one, although this is not a bad film.It is nice visually with an interesting plot to start with but the execution did not deliver. Perhaps the main problem of the film's director and producers was that they did not decide if they wanted a sci-fi film or a space-horror film. The movie tried to balance in between and simply it was not convincing in either front.As it stands 'Prometheus' lacks the depiction of humanity's progression into the future (with its implications) that e.g. 'Gattaca' delivers us and also lacks the raw terror present in every scene in 'Alien' and 'Aliens'.I only recommend this movie if you are a fan of Sci-fi and horror movies but do not set your expectations too high.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Prometheus (2012) Reviving the franchise,"After the second film in the Alien franchise, fans were ""presented"" with mediocre and bad films. Launching a prequel to this franchise didn't seem like such a good idea, but the result was positive. This film is not perfect nor is it great, but it has some fun moments and visually it is better than the previous ones. You don't need to watch any other film to understand this story, in fact the relationships with the original story are almost nil. The big problem is in the writing of the story and characters, which end up taking away some points from the film. The entire look is wonderful, it is beautiful to see the scenes on this planet, however, everything that is developed in the meantime ends up being boring and uninteresting. Some dialogues are forced to create a relationship between characters that are not interesting. It could be a much better film if more investment was made in the script, but it is still the third best in the franchise (Which doesn't mean much given the history of previous productions).",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful and thought provoking.,"So, after 2 years of waiting I saw the film today and I really enjoyed it. It asks more questions than it answers and definitely leaves you with food for thought and this, to me, was the right approach. I also think the film will improve with further viewings as you deconstruct some of the imagery and ideas. It's not your archetypal Hollywood science fiction action movie clearly Ridley Scott is not going to do that kind of movie, 3 science fiction films in a 30 year career needs to be understood. His methodology to this genre is a measured and thoughtful one. And that is a good thing and so is Prometheus. Is the film perfect, no.

Extreme potential sadly squandered,"This could have been the masterpiece that explains the birth of this whole saga which started by the release of the 1979-Alien movie. But it's extremely sad that this is just thrown away due to come holes in the writing, dodgy screenplay at times and mediocre acting. The premise of the movie is simple, humans or rather Wayland himself wanted to connect to the Gods or Prometheus, and they literally named the ship with its namesake mission. But things turn out worse for our actors. The lore that this started in trying to be a origin story is still debated 14 days later to this day. So that's an achievement by itself unlike the extremely forgettable previous Alien 3&4 movies in this franchise. Next the the cinematography is outstanding, the film greets you with a vast expanse of a scene where the ""ritual"" takes place, the colors look perfect, and the music falls into place. This movie succeeds in keeping you captivated and invested. An excellent movie were it not for it's shortcomings. Firstly the story paints a lot of pictures about the mysterious ""black goo"", it seems to behave differently in different situations, in one instance it creates, in another it disintegrated and yet it can also impregnate, mutate and of course makes one a super-monster. This can be frustrating and confusing for the end viewer to witness this being a vague plot tool to fill in gaps in writing. The actors have a very forgettable performance. Wayland seems to be a zealous idiot, the two scientists seem easily irritable and often times come across as annoying. Everyone seems to be doing their own separate thing in the movie, with their own side missions and agendas. Somehow this fails to work a lot of times. Overall the movie just leaves you wanting and not really in a good way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Like many, could see potential, but scope and execution a problem.","There is something distant with the movie, you can barely care about any of the characters, it was a disappointment on many levels.Character development, plot line development are either shallow in concept or long in development, with little pay off for either.Overall, the sum of its parts just seem a little disjointed to me. It was pretty clear to me, that they seem to be developing a multi- movie story arc of sorts, and left much to be desired to resolve this one.That being said, its not the worse conceptual sci fi film I've seen, and CGI integration with human actors and overall thematic scenes are very nicely done.Could have achieved more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Mind blowing!,"I am going to keep this review, being my first, short but informative about the film without giving anything important away. To start off, i really cannot understand the vast amount of hate for this film. I watched this film last night. There will be good reviews and there will be bad reviews but ultimately until you have seen the film yourself, you cannot know whether it is a good film or not. Anyway, onto the film. Having only recently watched the first two alien movies, i have not been a long time fan and was not too excited about this film. This film is absolutely visually stunning and the cgi is out of this world, a few scenes in this movie literally made my mouth drop wide open, i was glued to the screen throughout. There have been a lot of complaints about the storyline not being related enough to the original alien film(s). If you are a long time alien fan and are expecting a scary horror with plenty of gore and aliens, look elsewhere. This film is a very intriguing one with a very inventive storyline, whether it is a prequel, a sequel or a stand alone movie, it is an absolutely amazing and immersive experience! There are a few twists in the storyline which make it more interesting and the running time is 2 hours in which the story really progresses with not one dull moment. In my personal opinion, this exceeds the level of avatar and takes the place of my favourite science fiction film of all time. The roles are played brilliantly by the leads and are very convincing. The 3d does not do much for the film and there is only one scene where the 3d really gets you involved so if you can see it in 2d you may as well, to save a few quid. This is the most fun i've had at the cinema in years, when you get so immersed in a film you forget where you are, you know it's done it's job right! I'm now just looking forward to my second viewing this weekend!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
did one know scientists could...,"be so dumb. Well, they are in this movie, that was marketed as the prequel to Aliens, which is still one of my all time favorites. It seems some scientists see ancient drawings on cave walls and concluded the drawings were referring to the creators of humans. So with it being almost the year 3000, technology has advanced and a group is sent into deep space in search of the planet in the drawings. They reach the planet and go exploring. And this is when the scientists get dumb. First, they decide to take their space helmets off in a creepy cave. Mess with a dead alien body and steel the head and not pay attention to the moving black stuff. Plus 2 of the geniuses get lost and don't make it back. Instead one of them decides it would be a good idea to stick his hand in front of a snake like alien creature. Bad idea.So things keep getting weirder on the planet, but the lead female, Shaw, is still OK with going back out. They find an alien still living and is anyone surprised when he isn't too happy about it.And it's set up for the sequel and I did like the very last scene when it gives a clue to how Aliens began. What I didn't get was the very beginning when the albino guy falls down that waterfall, what was that about?FINAL VERDICT: A descent sci-fi film. It did make sense, and had its tense moments.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece that has many human touch!,"I have very high respect for the whole cast,the production team and of course, the director, what a masterpiece! When people easily give a 2, 3 or 4 star for a movie these days, please kindly ask yourself: what are you expecting from a 2 hour movie? Visual entertainment? A deep deep thought about human mankind or complex characters that teach us how to live a noble life? Or simply something you can related to when YOU FACE THAT CHOICE YOURSELF? Let's be realistic, and be human.As with all great science fiction, the story of Prometheus is an allegory for some of the real-life issues that humankind is facing now and future. Why do we search for answers for our origins? What can we do about death？what make us keep hopeful? What would you choose when you lose everything you care? Maybe many of the ""haters"" here claim that the script is a bit too simplistic. Yes, we essentially watched the same story unfold for many Sci-Fi and we tend to expect more, more and more. Undoubtedly, to me, Prometheus is one of the most visually thrilling and beautiful films ever made since Avatar. What's more, we should not neglect the stunning acting our leading roles offered in this movie, I am deeply moved for many scenes when you see those fires in Dr. Shaw's eyes: the passion, the anger, the pain, and the determination. GREAT GREAT Performance! That's something humans and I believe most of us will appreciate.Go and see it yourself, you would definitely feel something linger on for a long while.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Visually resplendent but messy,"This film was an interesting attempt at a prequel to the Alien series but it fell short of the mark. The themes were too heavy handed and tried too hard to sound profound. It dwelled heavily on the idea of creation but most of this was cribbed from laughable Ancient Astronauts hypotheses from the 1970s that are now seen as insensitive (""your ancestors were too stupid to make this by themselves, aliens must have helped them""). The identity of the Space Jockey was super disappointing - wow, it's a big bald white guy. What kind of alien is that? I can see those on Earth. It was better as a mystery or at least make it look elephantine like the original Alien (1979) implies. The story was super messy and so many things were unexplained or disconnected. I won't go into every example, but one of the worst offenders is when a character has a major reaction after an unexplained and unsubtitled conversation in the extinct Proto-Indo-European language. In the entire world, perhaps ten linguistics professors can understand this language, so how is the audience supposed to know what's going on? The team is incredibly stupid and unqualified to the point of disbelief, like breathing and touching everything. There is a fan edit (the ""Agent9 edit"") that restores a lot of the deleted scenes and it actually makes a lot of sense this way. This shows that the messy story is more the fault of the editor than the director or writers, and I would actually give that full version eight out of ten stars, but I am reviewing the real final theatrical release of this film here and not a hypothetical version, so I have to leave this as a side note. That said, the visual style and quality of this film were amazing. The design, cinematography and effects were all incredibly stunning. Michael Fassbender's performance is perfect and I definitely admired him more as an actor after watching this film. These make up for some of the flaws and bump up my rating a bit, but overall the film is still a mess.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An unnecessary expansion to the Alien universe,"After the colossal embarrassment know as Alien Resurrection, the chugging narrative of the Alien films has finally been demolished. It seems that Scott had recognized this, and decided to take the reigns of his franchise once again, but this time, he's taking us back to even before the events of his 1979 masterpiece. While the film is noticeably ambitious, through both it's complex narrative and visionary science-fiction setting, Prometheus only manages to be a filler chapter in a saga that repeatedly makes unnecessary additions to it's continuously expanding mythos, never really earning justification for it's own existence.Even if Prometheus is merely filler for the franchise, it's visually impressive filler. The obvious architectural borrowings from the original Alien film add a tasteful amount of nostalgia that will undoubtedly excite fans. The massive extraterrestrial catacombs engulf any signs of life as our human characters venture further into the bio-mechanical labyrinth. In the first couple of shots, Scott let's the audience know that he hasn't lost a touch of his technical prowess, however, the uninteresting narrative and characters does raise questions about his storytelling skills.The crew of the Prometheus are, for the most part, paper-thin. Despite their utter lack of development or depth, Scott seemingly expects us to care for them when they unsurprisingly meet their demise. Noomi Rapace does give a good performance as Elizabeth Shaw, along with Fassbender as the synthetic David, and their chemistry showcased in the final act of the film could be compelling if continued.The overall plot is rarely compelling as it is stupid. Prometheus features possibly the most inept scientists ever put to screen. Their bafflingly stupid decisions are laughable and broke the gloomy tone of the film on multiple occasions. It does feature some tense scenes as well as a satisfying final act, but too many questions are left unanswered to make the film satisfying as a whole. This film was created to explain who the engineers were and how they fit into the Alien universe, but sadly the film asks more questions than it answers, making for an ultimately frustrating final product.Prometheus is a gorgeous piece of sci-fi from one of the best directors of the genre, and while it is admittedly above average, it still falls flat when it comes to delivering compelling or cohesive backstory to Alien (1979). We have a few interesting characters, a slow building sense of tension and unexpected small bursts of violence, and while all of these aspects should result in an enticing sci-fi horror, even the best aspects of Prometheus don't look too great alongside an uninteresting and frustratingly illusive plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Flaws that good action and visuals cannot hide, and I'm not talking about Zac Synder","The first time I watched Prometheus was in middle school. I did not know a lot about movies then, but just from the first thirty minutes, I was bored a lot by the story and stopped caring. Rewatching it today, I indeed found something worth appreciation that was missed by my twelve-year-old self, but overall it is still a very dull story and has very weak theme. The greatest problem of the story is its storytelling. I cannot care less about almost the entire first two acts. It does not even have attractive futuristic things that many sci-fi films desperately (yet usually quite successfully) put in the first act. Character design is another problem. The main character is the only one I cared. I can see how her faith gradually loses and I get the symbolism, which is good. But all the other characters are either so archetypical (the grumpy) or characterless (the Asian). Hell the characters are so bad I can hardly remember any names. Its actions and special effects, along with the entire visual style, are beautiful. Character design, visually speaking, is quite impressive. In conclusion, I watched the film only after watch Alien. So if one has seen and been obsessed with the entire franchise, this might be a great movie. But for me, a lot of things need extra explanation, and the storytelling does not work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Love the robot and aliens, hate the humans.","In the intro we see some muscular pale humanoid drinking something and he literally falls to pieces into a waterfall. Flying above him is some giant UFO.In 2089 we meet a pair of scientists who have discovered the same type of ancient drawings all over the world- humans pointing at some collection of UFOs.Then we are aboard the Prometheus, a giant spaceship en route to a planet identified to be the home of man's ancestors. On board are our two scientists and a ragtag bunch of multicultural and foreign characters, one more annoying than the next. There's also a cold hot blonde who pretends to be in charge and very human-like robot- named David, what else. The whole project was funded by some dead billionaire.Once they reach the planet they find some straight road, which can't be a natural occurrence and a mountain with a head on top. Some of these clowns go investigate inside the mountain. David is already proficient in the alien language and starts operating doors and other devices. One of them shows a holographic movie of the giant aliens, called engineers, escaping from something. They find a pile of engineer corpses. Behind another door is a giant head, liquefying vases, black liquid and worms. We learn that David is up to something.He actually infects one of the scientists with the liquid from the room. The scientists have sex, the girl ends up pregnant with a fast growing worm. They bring a head from an engineer corpse to study. It turns out it's a helmet and inside is a humanoid alien head. Meanwhile all hell breaks lose inside and outside the Prometheus.Prometheus is an interesting sci-fi movie I must say. It offers more than just nondescript aliens eating or shooting at people for no good reason- that would be your average sci-fi movie. The sets, the he ""science"", the theories, all is pretty fascinating in this movie. At least it tries to tackle the issue of the origin of man and creates an interesting mythology. It offers more questions than answers, which is just as good. Perhaps the answers wouldn't be as satisfying as the possibilities the questions open. Not to mention that they have to leave something for sequels. But it does have some major weaknesses--namely most of the humans, which are annoying, unprofessional, and just plain stupid. It is a mystery how presumably intelligent people-all the writers in Hollywood-can write nothing but dumb and obnoxious characters. This crew might as well be a bunch of reality-TV star wanna-bes in space. Sci-fi is the one genre where writers could get nerdy and show off their smarts. But no. Prometheus does have some good ideas and it provides food for thought, if nothing else it makes you think of all the ways this movie could be better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"This Is Both Pointless & Pointmore! What Have You Done, Ridley?","Alien & Predator persuaded me to watch this and I tell I was disappointed. With indeed all the aspects - from visual effects to makeup to the plot to writing. The music stands out, though!Prometheus tells you the story of a manned mission to some Saturn lookalike planet and tells us why it is wrong/bad to interfere with the ethics of nature. I mean this is just predictable. There was only one nerve-racking scene which involves Naomi Rapace in a capsule. That was the only fin part. Indulging almost all the genres into a sci-fi is not gonna work out anymore at a time when we have Looper & Salmon Fishing In The Yemen!Prometheus is not an enjoyable movie as it lacks decency and doesn't answer audience's questions.

"Good, but not great.","This movie is set in the same universe as the ""Alien"" series but is really more of a different series than a prequel. The story starts out more like a mystery with a team of scientists trying to contact humanity's creators, then transcends into horror and action with the characters trying to do this and that and this freaky stuff happening. Because of this, I'd say the writing is good, but not great. It would have been better if it focused more on them solving the mystery of humanity's creation than the scenes with them trying to do this and that, which isn't as interesting. The best scenes are the ones intended to be frightening and if there were enough of them it could be a great horror movie. Some of the main characters are kind of dull and underdeveloped like Shaw and Holloway but others are pretty interesting, especially David. The minor characters aren't very interesting and if they are they aren't used much. I would recommend this movie but it's not quite as good as the alien series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Does an adequate job,"Definitely lacks the claustrophobia of Alien and the acting and scriptwriting are not as tight. However, it must be remembered that comparing anything to the original Alien is setting a very high bar indeed.There is a plot, well plots, well probably too many plots and not all are drawn to a satisfactory conclusion. Being charitable there is a narrative arc that could be continued in sequels, or it could just be a bit sloppy in this regard, and fail to manage to quite stand alone. There are a few, 'no sane person in this situation would do that', moments, and a couple of characters who, from early in the film, are clearly only there as gore fodder. There is also a sub textual study of the risks of genetic experimentation, but that part is quite predictable. Oh! And do be sure to check-in at the cinema door, any scientific training or critical faculty you may possess ('t were ever thus!).The acting is a little patchy: at the good end Fassbender is truly excellent and basically does much of the heavy lifting through the film; Theron is suitably captivating and seriously intimidating; Rapace, to me is a bit weak, I expected a more assertive character that developed as the film progressed, as Weaver did with Ripley in Alien, but those high notes were sadly, slightly missed. Idris Elba does a nice job of playing the capable, if world-weary captain. Guy Pearce has a very small part, and doesn't get chance to build up momentum for his character. Logan Marshall-Greene does an okay job but his similarity to Tom Hardy made me think the latter would have been much better suited to this role. Other performances are passable, though not outstanding. It was good to see Benedict Wong give another good, though sadly small, performance.The sets and CGI are very good. I saw the 3D version with all of the problems that brings with it (low light levels, and some distraction caused by the 'view-master' effect). I'm intending to get back to see the 2D version soon. The use of 3D was not as gratuitous as it might have been in hands with lesser skill than Sir Ridley's but I think this film will be much better in 2D.So, does that sound negative? Well possibly BUT, compared with the other Alien sequels and spin-offs, with the possible exception of Alien3, (which I **really** like) this film is much better. The script is much less cheesy that Aliens. The plot(s) are more involving and gore scenes much less gratuitous that Resurrection and as for the AVP sub-franchise, well we don't even need to go there.So, in summary, it's an above average movie in its own right. It extends an interesting and challenging universe in an engaging, unsettling way; and I feel it did manage, to reboot the franchise. I think if you are an Alien fan, you should see it, if you enjoy suspense / horror / gore / action you'll have an enjoyable 124 minutes and if you like Ridly Scott direction and awesome scenes you will also find things to enjoy. However, as it attempts to complement one of the greatest films ever made, but only manages to stand closely by in the shadow, I am giving it a mildly disappointed 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Genius Movie,"Finished watching this movie 2 hours ago, so here is a real fresh review: This movie does well to grasp you from reality with its superb plot line, the cinematics are clear and utterly jaw dropping, some of the best cinema to date, every scene and character invokes a sense of mystery and intrigue.Ridley Scott has pulled off a genius movie it has everything, action, mystery, horror, suspense and of course a unbelievable plot line that keeps the guessing game going and going.By the end of this movie i couldn't help thinking i had come across a puzzle, some of the characters actions were questionable, when you leave a cinema asking your friends why did he or she do this, you know there is more to come.I will give this movie a 9.5, when you watch this movie with an open mind lets just pretend for moment that its not just a movie, and mine and all your questions are answered !!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great Start To New Beginnings,"I love the way Scott let's tension and terror play out. In combination with a killer soundtrack and stunning visuals Prometheus explores a lost world ripe with danger. I've watched this over and over again and David is one of the best characters created in sci-fi. His constant disappointment of his creators continually pushes him towards the realisation that he is beyond their limits.

The best in the saga after Alien (1979),"If you're one of those people who feel Alien (1979) was the best in the saga, then you will most definitely love this film.It is a prequel to the first Alien movie and it would be the first in chronological order, without spoiling anything.Everything, from the atmosphere, the photography, the acting, to the plot, succeed in scaring you on the potential dangers of space and visiting unknown planets and how incredibly dangerous it can turn out to be. This is exactly what the first movie accomplished in its way, so masterfully, and now Prometheus did once again.The photography is phenomenal, the cast has some great chemistry and the plot won't give you a break once it gets to the tough pace.The FX and CGI are very believable to the point you WILL feel uncomfortable watching and many will cover their eyes in some of the more disturbing scenesRidley Scott nails it with this movie, it is an absolute joy to watch (even more than once) and leaves one asking for more",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The most expensive low budget Alien rip off ever made,"Prometheus is the most expensive low budget Alien rip-off ever made. It's nothing more than Galaxy of Terror or Forbidden World, only with 100 times their budget. I found this movie to be an entertaining piece of blood-drenched schlock disguised as a science fiction epic.While it has been promoted to some extent as a prequel to Alien, it never seems to be that, if only because the technology on display is far and away more advanced than what is available in the first four Alien movies. It seems just as likely to me that the movie is actually a sequel, taking place decades after the events of the original ""quadrilogy."" Regardless, my feeling is that Ridley Scott wanted to make another Alien-like movie and did not want to be accused of ripping himself off, therefore added a few ambiguous nods to the original movie to make this at the very least a companion piece to the Alien series.While there are plenty of the metaphysical ideas introduced in Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection floating around, and while the movie tackles some heavy philosophical themes regarding our origins (not a particularly original concept), it's obvious that Scott's intention is to create a gory freak show, with enough slime, blood, mayhem and creepy crawlies for a dozen horror movies.That may sound like a criticism, but it isn't. Prometheus is a rich, fast-paced and intriguing thriller and is as entertaining, intense and scary as any other horror movie I've seen in recent years. It just isn't as deep as it's makers would have you believe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
