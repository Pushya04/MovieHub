In a Nutshell - Don't Miss It!,"After Shaun of the Dead, this second pairing of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost was very high on my wanted list, and it didn't disappoint in the least.Hot Fuzz is crammed full of excellent characters, ranging from the eccentric to the diabolical, and every one gets at least one laugh during the course of the movie and most of them get many more. I don't mean to suggest that this film is wall to wall gags; in fact it is far from it, instead it is just very clever and often very subtle humour that runs continuously throughout the film.Another pleasant surprise was the wonderfully impressive murder scenes, which were pretty gruesome and definitely stood out from the general vibe of the film, which made them far more involving. As well as the comedy and the murders, there is also a genuine sense of mystery surrounding these events and it definitely makes for compulsive viewing.Just in case all that wasn't enough to satisfy you, there is a very action packed and explosive end sequence that is so out of place and ludicrous it works like a charm, and simply caps the film off in style superbly.For me this film was every bit as good as Shaun of the Dead, and its definitely one of the best comedies ever made.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
-:::::HOT FUZZ:::::- Don't Have High Expectations & Come Out Laughing!!!,"Hot Fuzz is a brilliant new Britsh comedy that really hits its mark!!! Hands down this fantastic film is the new benchmark in British comedies!Simon Pegg throws you into the extremely tongue in cheek narrative with its quick pace edits, booming sounds and terrific camera work that we have come to expect from Edgar Wright since Shaun of the Dead. Simon Pegg has really exceeded my expectations and credit must also go to Nick Frost who plays the classic sidekick which he accomplishes so well. The aforementioned crafty work by Edgar Wright proves that his style creates some of the best action sequences in the business. Whether it be the shoot'em ups, chase scenes or the jump out of your seat surprises, Wright can really make a film move and does this one ever!!!This is definitely one of those films you have to watch at least twice to come close to getting every single joke, because they come so hard and fast it is sometimes hard to stop laughing at the previous one in time to hear the next.Even though the film does take a lot of twists and turns there isn't really a moment where it lacks energy. Sure there are parts that slow it down, but it needs this to build momentum to one of the most climactic and hysterical pieces in film history.Speed is the key! It keeps this insanely funny narrative flowing while at the same time giving a huge insight into the extremely detailed characters. Each character brings something to the table. It is an inventive yet classic comedy that reaches most audiences with its tongue in cheek and witty humour.People who thought the cop-comedy genre was finished should definitely see this creative film which will pluck those heart strings and have you slapping that knee while feasting your eyes on the adrenaline fueled action!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
One of the Most Brilliant Comedies I've Ever Seen,"Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, ""S*** just got real."" Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways, the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English, and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a big-budget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint, atmospheric English village given the secrets-of-its-own flavor and a Agatha Christie-style expository structure.The film-making style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects, occasional strobe, and montages of grainy, bleached out, extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any super-cool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a dead-on impression of Hollywood film-making but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so well-developed as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive, a workaholic, a zealot, and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line, he's also funny in such a direct, adolescent way, an unlikely comic relief sidekick.The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his two-year stint as James Bond, but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written, beautifully directed, atmospheric, or intelligently ridiculous.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Most fun in a cinema since....forever,"Saw this last night at a special screening followed by a Q&A with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. I liked ""Shaun of the Dead"" but wasn't a huge fan but I liked what I'd heard about ""Hot Fuzz"". I still wasn't prepared to be quite as blown away by it as I was.This film works both as an out-and-out comedy but also as a high paced action film and also manages to showcase the directing talents of Edgar Wright and the acting of Simon Pegg (who can really *act*) The first half is a gentle build up but is generally and genuinely amusing, but once we put the pedal to the floor for the second half the pace is relentless.The plot is substantial enough but isn't really what we've all come to see - it's about the snappy dialogue and the gags. To describe it as a spoof is unfair - they just corrupt the genre a little and turn up the comedy.Great fun from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
How you Top Shaun of The Dead,"I was lucky enough to see a preview of this film for free after I attended a random screening of Scorcese's the Departed. Naturally hearing that the makers of Shaun of the Dead were behind this I had to go see it - if a group of people can make a romantic comedy with zombies, then a buddy cop film HAD to inventive and original.I can safely say that it was. I haven't laughed as hard in a film as I did with Hot Fuzz. The parts are all cast brilliantly - in particular Pegg and Frost as the two lead police officers.Pegg bringing the smart, intelligent, action hardened London cop to the sleep north England village works in a classic fish out of water scenario. It surprised me with it's direction and I will confess I couldn't have predicted how everything would pan out.When this is fully released I urge you to go and see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Yarrp!,"Hot Fuzz: The story tells us of an over-active 'policeman officer', Nicholas Angel (Played by the co-star of Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg) who is sent to work his duties out in the countryside, to avoid his use of excessive arrests. Suspicions arrive in the town however, as people start getting killed 'accidentally'. Coupled with his rather unprofessional partner Danny Butterman (Similiarily played by Shaun of the Dead star Nick Frost) they get themselves into suspicious circumstances Nicholas Angel fails to ignore.But what can I say? It's just hilarious! An incredibly funny, witty, intelligent British comedy that manages to bring you to tears with laughter and also offers extremely well directed and executed action scenes! If you liked the likes of Shaun of the Dead, you'll love this, simple as that. I was oddly surprised to find that it was incredibly violent, albeit, in a cartoony way, but it will definitely make you squint. Plenty of cameo's by the likes of the hilarious Bill Bailey and a great cast will make this a action/thriller/comedy hard to forget! Excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Funniest Fuzz Movie,"The incredibly talented team, Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who gave us gems like 'Spaced' and 'Shaun of the Dead' are back with one of the funniest action movies 'Hot Fuzz'. Not only does it brilliantly spoof the American action copper films, it also satirizes the English country-life. There are numerous references to films like 'Point Break', 'Die Hard', 'Lethal Weapon' and 'Bad Boys II' and the conversations where they're brought up are hilarious. 'Hot Fuzz' isn't entirely spoof. It's very much got its own sense of humour and the jokes had me rolling on the floor laughing.The execution is remarkable. It's shot like a slick action film with quick cuts, sharp editing, adrenaline loaded music, heavy sound effects and lots of energy. Not only does this give it the Hollywood action film touch but it effectively contrasts with the calm, peaceful nature of the countryside. The whodunnit suspense element is well built. Even though not much is happening in the first hour, it moves at a very steady pace and there's plenty of comedy to keep the viewer more than entertained.The unique comedic duo Pegg and Frost are fantastic as always. Pegg excellently mimics the typical action hero copper and Frost does an equally fine job of playing the comic sidekick who's the complete opposite of Pegg's Nicolas Angel. They are supported by an equally great cast that includes the always dependable Jim Broadbent, a pleasant surprise called Timothy Dalton and a comically mean Paddy Considine. Note cameos by Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan, Julia Deakin and Cate Blanchett who provide laugh out loud comic relief.'Hot Fuzz' is definitely among the smartest comedies. It induces hysterical laughter. It's got great action adrenaline. It's got chaos in a calm atmosphere. It's got blood. It's got murder. It's got explosions. It has adrenaline. It's got energy. It has weapons. It's got wit. It's got slapstick. It's sarcasm. It's got a swan on the loose. What's not to love?",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Hilarious,"This was funny and clever in how it pokes fun at all those action cliches and use of foreshadowing. The characters are funny and have good chemistry, it's well shot and of course well acted. It can get boring at times as the scenes do lag on at the end but otherwise, I highly recommend you check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Even better than Shaun of the dead,"""Hot Fuzz"" is brilliant! People who like British humor will love this one! It is really funny! It manages to make fun of ridiculous plots used in action movies and at the same time entertain you with their own ridiculous plot which is quite thrilling! Even when you don't get the subtle humor there are more than enough visual jokes to be enjoyed! I thought it was a stroke of genius to use some serious actors like Edward Woodward,Stuart Wilson and Timothy Dalton! (Timothy Dalton was accused of playing a much too serious James Bond! Well,in ""Hot Fuzz"" he shows that he can be dangerously funny!) As a parody on action movies this movie succeeds where others have failed! I think the credit has to go to the whole team who made this and ""Shaun of the dead"" including the actors! It shows that they actually like the movies they make fun of! That is essential for the the jokes to work! I thought ""Hot Fuzz"" is hilarious and very entertaining! It certainly is one of the funniest movies at the moment! Go check it out!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Another Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) hilarity,"Hot Fuzz (2007)Coming out of a growing group of British comedies centered on Simon Pegg and a familiar cast, this one takes on small town English sensibilities with typical zaniness. It's a blast.Nerdy London supercop Nicholas Angel is banished to a quaint little village because he's making the London cops look bad. But here he seems unwelcome because he's stirring up trouble—arresting underage drinkers, for example. As mysterious murders begin to accumulate, he sniffs a dastardly conspiracy. With sidekick Nick Frost, something will indeed be done about it.The whole movie is fast and faster, edited with a fury, and in the first ten minutes we get the overachieving nature of our hero and also meet a handful of great British comic forces, including Bill Nighy. But don't get your hopes up—they don't reappear. Still, Pegg and Frost and a host of strong, quirky, smart performers make up the wonderful townspeople, some of them with little comic flourishes that make you laugh out loud. Often.So, yeah, this is comic, for sure, and fast, which means you have to stay on your toes to catch some of the jokes (some plays on words in particular). About two thirds the way through it all, Angel shifts to Clint Eastwood mode (Dirty Harry, that is) and the vigilante cop in all of us (apparently) takes over. At first this is funny, but even a die hard action adventure fan will tire of the endless chasing and shooting and shooting and chasing—it seems to be half an hour. It's not without humor or variety, but in the overall plot, things have come to a halt. Oddly enough.And it ends with a bang. Of course.Enjoyable, yes, and really funny at its best. For any ""Shaun of the Dead"" fans (which is the lynchpin of this kind of British humor), this movie is a must.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"A Town Like Stepford, oops Sandford","This film did not get too much play in the USA and I count myself fortunate that I'm close enough to the Canadian border to get these occasional gems broadcast from the CBC. Lucky indeed that the CBC is part of my cable package.Simon Pegg is a too good to be true London police officer who is wracking up arrests and making his colleagues look shameful. It's decided that the place to go to cool that zeal off a bit is the quiet and peaceful rural town of Sandford. In the United Kingdom it's the most crime free zone in the whole country.In fact Pegg looks like he's going to die of sheer boredom. He makes four collars for minor offenses even before he officially is on the job there. It looks like he is not going to be a good fit for this quiet town. The only friend that Pegg has on the Sandford PD is Nick Frost, the somewhat oafish son of Broadbent whom Pegg is assigned as a partner. Frost who just loves American action flicks with guns and car chases would love for there to be something afoot.The story behind Hot Fuzz is really quite bizarre and you'd have to go to the American film The Stepford Wives for a comparison. There are no experiments going on to turn the Sandford women into docile feminine drones, it's a mindset that has taken control of the place. The most sinister character is that of Timothy Dalton who is very much like the Arthur Hill character in The Stepford Wives.This sleeper of a black comedy is really quite a gem. I hope that Hot Fuzz gets discovered on this side of the pond.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A Nutshell Review: Hot Fuzz,"I will say it out clear and upfront - I love this movie, and without a doubt, a definite contender for my movie of the year. By the filmmakers of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz has everything that makes great entertainment, laced with wry Brit wit, and while it contains plenty of references from their earlier movie, it never bores, and for cinephiles, you're in for one heck of a time identifying the countless of movie references within. If anything, I can't wait to get my hands on their earlier efforts in order not to shortchange myself in missing out on the gems by director Edgar Wright and collaborating writer Simon Pegg.Hot Fuzz follows a typical buddy-cop genre, except that these two are so much more diverse from each other than the conventional cop movies of late milking the obvious race and cultural differences, beaten to death by the Lethal Weapon and Rush Hour films. Here we have the city versus country policeman officers buddying up, each with work ethics belonging to opposite ends. Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is your no-nonsense, straight laced, focused, top supercop who aces everything in his field of work, apprehending felons who fail to follow the law. And with being the top police officer on the beat, the powers that be deem him to be a threat (in making them look inept), and got him posted from Metropolitan London to the countryside of Sandford.And Sandford is your typical small lazy town, where nothing much happens, and everyone knows everyone else. If a missing swan is a great deal, then you'll know there's pretty nothing much to sustain our supercop's interest, especially so when the station he's assigned to have officers which are extremely laid back, which makes him get off on the wrong footing with partner PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). Danny's the anti-thesis of Nicholas, and spends much of his days daydreaming what a top city cop would be like, and lives out his dreams through his collection of DVD movies like Bad Boys II and Point Break. But the idyllic life of the country gets interrupted with a series of murders (frequently brushed aside as accidents) just as our friends are about to get chummy, and here's where the fun kicks in at top gear.There are so many things to like about the movie. The violence is one, though I'm unsure if the commercial release here will keep scenes unscathed by the editing scissors. Featuring some of the most gruesome ways to die, it's a blood splattering fest worthy of any serial killer movie. The movie too rewards the attentive viewer, because while the filmmakers load the movie with plenty of easter eggs, minute details, red herrings and the likes, everything will count for something as they come together on the way to the finale, so keep your eyes wide open and your ears peeled. The dialogue is full of wit, with loads of movie references, direct and indirect, and its run up to the end is one of the most adrenaline pumping in recent times, you can't help but to cheer as you lap up the high octane action. Action fans will not be disappointed.Some may not like its editing style, which is quick, sudden, loud, and at times repetitive, but that's just a minor blip. There are enough positives here to satisfy almost everyone, and one that will definitely bring on a smile by the time the end credits roll. A definite must watch! Don't miss this when it screens commercially!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
funny,"London Police Constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a try-hard. He's too good at his job making everybody else look bad. He gets promoted and transferred out into the country. He starts his new job by arresting his new partner Danny (Nick Frost), the son of chief inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Sandford, Gloucestershire seems to be a sleepy little town until a series of murders occurs. Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) owns the local supermarket.Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg mine the plentiful material from cop dramas to bring a dryly funny satirical take on the genre. This has Edgar's quick edit style. Pegg and Frost continue their great chemistry with Edgar for almost a decade. It also serves as a fun whodunnit mystery. It's choked full of big British stars doing cameos. The last act does get overwhelmed with gun action and the guys struggle to maintain the comedy. They took the Bad Boys and Point Break motif too seriously. Overall, this may not be a comedy for everybody but it's a comedy for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Adventures of a Constable in a Mad Town,"One of the best Brit comedies I know besides Shaun of the Dead (out of competition: everything of the extraordinaire Monty Pythons).A super London top cop gets ""promoted"" to a rural village and there he gets in real trouble - without spoiling everything, this movie is not only funny with some horror elements but got also some fine ""twists"" - who murdered who and why!?Anyway, Simon Pegg plays again superb like he did in Shaun of the Dead. This one is good if you like action and comedy combined. Mr. Pegg should consider to do such a movie again. That would be nice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"""The Fuzz"" Keeps Black Comedies Alive!","""Shaun of the Dead"" was probably one of the funniest (if not the best) British black comedy that had been released in 2004. With gritty violence that made you squirm, innocent humour (Nick Frost) with blaspheming insults that just made you laugh out loud, and the quick wit of Simon Pegg with some great fun and horror mixed together, ""Hot Fuzz"" had a huge task of competing with the sheer greatness, of which was ""Shaun of the Dead"".After much keen excitement upon seeing the teaser trailers of Hot Fuzz last year, my stomach churned as if to say ""At god damn last, a film I can look forward to in the new year!"" I felt as though it was best however, to go in with an open-neutral-mind, as I didn't want to spoil the film with high expectations.I actually was starting to get worried into the first segments of the film, the humour wasn't as sharp as SOTD's first 20 minutes, and there were so many characters to remember, most of whom didn't make sense for a while. It wasn't till Nick Frost was introduced - that the film started picking up its pace and then decided to grab me by the throat. The film from then, was so funny, action packed, gruesome and dark! You just do not expect anything which was what made SOTD so great. The spontaneous actions and humour just kept the film's pace fantastically back on track.The great thing about Hot Fuzz was just how original it was, and the ending (no spoilers here) just gave itself the stamp of ""Most Exciting & Fun Ending In British Comedy"".The mystery and murder factor was well done as well, leaving me guessing ""who did it"" all the way through the film, but as with SOTD, the dark and grotesque violence kept its mature rating of 15, very enjoyable, yet very squirming to watch.I highly recommend this film for anyone who just wants a good laugh and likes simple great black comedies. If you loved Shaun of the Dead, you will love this film. Just go in with an open-mind and have fun. Definitely worth the £6.50 (and the £15 when it comes out on DVD)!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Alright....not as good as Shaun of the Dead,"I love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, i think they are really hilarious and really show typical British men.However i was quite disappointed with this film. Although there were some chuckly bits in it, there wasn't that many ""lol"" parts which really upset me because Shaun of the Dead was so funny.One thing that was great were the action sequences they were comedic and fast paced which really added to the films entertainment value.Also the storyline was pretty funny...not the best but still OK - of a typically nosy countryside village, everyone in England must know people who live in a village and knows everyone else business - i certainly do!!

"Not Quite as good as Shaunof the Dead, but passable and entertaining.","Hot Fuzz is probably one of the better action films to come out in the last 5 years, not too mention being a love letter to the action buddy cop genre, Hot Fuzz brings to cinema an entertaining flick that doesn't leave you feeling cheated like most of the big studio blockbuster as of late. My only real complaint about Hot Fuzz was the lengthy running time.Hot Fuzz could have definitely benefited from some editing, I would say a good 15 minutes. However, it could be easily forgivable as these are the guys whom brought us Shaun of the Dead, which I find to be the most entertaining horror comedy ever made.If you are a fan of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and tons of other actions films you should really enjoy this film, but at times it drags on a bit and can be tiresome.

Brilliant!!!,"While this movie is a poke at the big budget action flick, it doesn't fall into the naked gun style of spoof. It comes off as if it is being serious, which makes it all the more funny. The first thing that strikes you is the editing. The quick jump cuts used in action films to make them seem edgier, suggesting a frenetic, tension filled pace, are used through out this film, giving any serious action films editing a run for its money. At first, it seemed a little obvious and contrived, maybe, but as the humor started to offset the serious tone being set forth, the movie really started taking shape. In the end, the editing made this film even more brilliant. The acting was terrific. The Shaun of the Dead stars really proved that they were not just one hit wonders. I now think Simon Pegg is one of the more brilliant comedic writers and actors of our time. His stone faced, serious main character sets a tone that made this spoof. I will now be sure to see ANY movie these guys make. This is one of the few movies I'd like to play again after having just watched it. It was just that funny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Wonderfully witty film where Bad Boys meets Vicar of Dibley,"Nicholas Angel joined the police service and quickly made a name for himself, achieving an arrest rate 400% higher than anyone else and breaking many service records. Unfortunately this makes his colleagues look bad and he is ""promoted"" to Sergeant, not in London but in the leafy village of Sandford. Bitter but with no choice, Angel finds himself in the crime-free village and, although he tries to continue his work he finds the only criminals he can arrest are kids and a drunk-driver who turns out to be his new partner, Danny. However the accident rate in Sandford is surely far too high  a fact brought home to Angel when a series of grizzly ""accidents"" occur. But will anyone listen in a village where everyone knows no crimes ever occur.It is perhaps unfortunate that Hot Fuzz came out in the same week as gun crime was the main story in the UK and politicians were falling over themselves to ""take action"" (because although black people have been being shot for years, the fact that ""good"" black people are dieing now means that the Government will act  fantastic). However it is testament to how much fun the film is that no tabloid jumped on this film in the way perhaps they would have knee-jerked against others. The film does glorify the American Hollywood action movie though, which indeed is the joke and entire reason for the film.It does this very well by taking the conventions of the genre and putting them into rural England. The former is really well done and is never as lazy as some spoofs where such conventions are explained then spoofed  here they are part of the film and it works better for it. It is worth noting that they also do small village life to a tee as well. The obsession with keeping the image of the village and intolerance for outsiders is well used within the narrative and will strike a chord with those that know. The action is kept for the final third of the film but is better for it because, for the majority of the film it is witty, but the action is more silly humour  it works, but it is best that it is limited.It is not a perfect film though and those expected a fantastic action movie with loads of laughs will be disappointed. The humour is more about wit and references rather than being a laugh a minute affair. Personally I found it very funny but then some people hated Spaced so I imagine they will also hate this. The direction from Wright is really good. Some of the cuts were a bit frantic at times for my liking but mostly it all looked good and played very well. The cast is roundly good and blessed with stars. Pegg mostly plays it straight and it is an approach that works as the script feeds a lot of the sillier lines to Frost, who delivers them spot on. The two have a great sense of semi-homoerotic camaraderie between them that really fits the action film idea. At first I did worry that the parade of British stars would distract but, aside from the early appearance of Coogan, Nighy and Freeman, it didn't really. Dalton was huge fun, Broadbent fitted his character like old slippers and support is roundly strong from Considine, Woodward, Bailey, Colman, Spall and others.It won't be to everyone tastes then, and those expecting to be rolling in the aisles may be building it up too much. It a witty and English take on the staples of the Hollywood action movie. It is a bit long and gets silly at the end but mostly it is a lot of fun and the same audience that enjoyed Shaun will find this just as much fun.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"The greater decent, if not the greater good.","The reappraisal of Edgar Wright's work continues with a watching of ""Hot Fuzz"" - the second of the Cornetto trilogy and, looking back on the trilogy now, having seen them all again, perhaps my least favourite of them.Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a Met officer with a prodigious record. Though effective, he's unpopular and when a promotional opportunity arises his managers quickly ship him to Sandford, a sleepy town in southwest England. His professionalism soon brushes up against the relaxed atmosphere of his colleagues and when a number of people end up dead Angel refuses to accept his colleagues' conclusions, that they are just a series of accidents.I say it's my least favourite of the series, but that doesn't mean that I don't like it (or at least some of it). I'm not really that much of a fan of the sort of action films that ""Hot Fuzz"" is homaging, so I do find the shootout conclusion of the film a bit tiresome. The earlier aspects of the film are much more interesting though, with the conspiracy and the series of Murders and how that all works. We have all the trademarks of a Wright film here, with the camera being much more dynamic that it was in ""Shaun"" or the earlier work, the editing to effects and music choices are all there too. The foreshadowing script, that we retrospectively understand that all the trilogy has is present as well.It's also always good to see the chemistry between Pegg and Nick Frost, who plays Danny Butterman, a PC who becomes Angel's confidant and partner. It's nice that despite keeping the pairing across the three films, the dynamic between them is different every time. In S. O. T. D Ed is a lazy and unfocused tie to Shaun's past, keeping him from evolving. Here Danny is the opposite of Nick, and not the brightest of sparks, but one who shows Nick that life is not all about work.It's a fun and entertaining film, though as I say, for me it doesn't work as well as either of the other two films in the trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A daring and enjoyable comedy starring Simon Pegg,"I will admit to you, the film does start off slowly, and the finale is very over the top. Plus the murders are unashamedly brutal. But Hot Fuzz is a hugely enjoyable, original and daring comedy. It is fast-paced fun from start to finish. And all this is helped by a sharply observed screenplay, next to flawless comic timing and a wonderful performance from Simon Pegg playing it straight as the over zealous cop. The supporting actors do just as brilliantly with Nick Frost the standout and Jim Broadbent brilliant as always. Paddy Cosidine and Rafe Spall are hilarious as the two Andys, and Timothy Dalton is a pleasant surprise as Simon Skinner, and steals every scene he's in.The camera-work is very dark and brooding, and there are some clever homages to other movies of the genre. At a little over two hours, the film is perhaps a little too long, but the film constantly goes at a break neck pace so it doesn't matter. The plot is rather original and daring, about Nick Angel getting promoted and being relocated to the hamlet of Sandford. The direction from Edgar Wright is solid throughout and has this appropriately offbeat style. Overall, a very affectionate, daring and enjoyable film. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Simon Pegg delivers again,"Given the weighty standards set by Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz is a pretty solid sequel of sorts. The dry sardonic humour is on show again, albeit a little overdone at times, and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost give thoroughly enjoyable lead performances. There is something extremely pleasant about films set in the English countryside and it is a great backdrop for black comedy. I felt the film was let down by a needlessly excessive finale that dragged on way too long. However, despite some flaws, this is still a cut above the majority of one-dimensional mainstream comedies that clutter the market today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Brilliant! It's got everything ...,"And I really do literally mean EVERYTHING you could possibly crave to find in a relaxing and genuinely entertaining cinema experience! ""Hot Fuzz"" brilliantly combines the wittiness & fast dialogs of a buddy cop movie, the excitement & spectacular stunts of a Hollywood summer blockbuster, the absurdity & convoluted plot twists of an Italian Giallo, the excessive gore and sickness of splatter-horror, the atmosphere & setting of a British comedy sitcom and the cast of a thousand. If all this isn't enough yet, ""Hot Fuzz"" refers to multiple great classics of the big screen (""Jaws"", ""The Wicker Man"", ""Straw Dogs"") and even pays tribute to styles and sub genres of the almost forgotten but once golden days of cinema (Spaghetti Westerns, Gialli). For those who were still suspecting ""Shaun of the Dead"", the previous scripting collaboration between Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, to be a fluke, ""Hot Fuzz"" will take the doubt away once and for all. These two British lads are creative and multi-talented movie freaks and they know exactly how the please a wide & versatile range of audiences. The less you know about the film's plot (particularly the main twist) the better, because it's even more amusing when it comes as a totally unexpected and deliciously grotesque surprise. Simon Pegg stars as London's super cop Nicholas Angel, but he's actually too good in comparison with the rest of the corps, and so his superiors shamelessly transfer him to the countryside community with the lowest crime-rate in the whole of England; Sandford. Nick's new colleagues aren't used to solving crimes at all and fill their days with hanging around the pubs, smoking cigarettes and making fun of his obsession with law enforcement. Even when several prominent Sandford inhabitants die in grisly ""accidents"", Nick can't seem to convince them to investigate the possibility of murder. The eventual truth behind the crimes is as demented as it is brilliant, and the last half hour of ""Hot Fuzz"" is a simply non-stop adrenalin-rushing, over-the-top comical, blood-spattered and wildly cheerful spitfire of action highlights. Technically speaking, ""Hot Fuzz"" is a masterpiece as well. The editing is genius, the cinematography is very imaginative and the film makes absolute brilliant use of the rural settings and all its typical characteristics and clichés. Of course, the film owes a large part of its massive impact to Simon Pegg's masterful performance. He's simply awesome and hugely charismatic, especially when depicting the obstinate and firm officer who knows every tiniest detail of the law enforcement book. Pegg's facial expressions (or lack of, for that matter) add even more comical genius to the already hysterical script. The supportive cast (pretty much an assembly of England's finest players) is amazing as well, and each and every one delivers flawless performances. I think Timothy Dalton hasn't had this much fun starring in a film since he completed his first scene wearing the James Bond outfit. ""Hot Fuzz"" is a unique experience all together. It features all the known genre clichés & stereotypes and narrates a seemingly derivative story, and yet, the elaboration is (or at least feels like) something entirely fresh and original. Comedy and violence can melt together in a movie perfectly, it simply requires a gifted team of cast and crew members. Highly recommended! Seriously, if you haven't watched ""Hot Fuzz"" yet, do it as fast as you can!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Mmm, it was alright","Let me start by saying i love Spaced and Shaun of the Dead, both of which i've seen many many times on DVD (even got Spaced signed by the cast and Edgar) so you can understand my excitement on watching Hot Fuzz.Now i'm home after watching at the cinema both my wife and i thought it was alright. Nothing more. Don't get me wrong, i can think of worse ways of spending 2 hours but it just didn't feel as _sharp_ as shaun.The best thing about Shaun is it's multi-layered. You can watch it again and again and spot things you missed the first time around. It credits you with a brain and lets you work things out for yourself. Hot Fuzz feels the need to help you along by using constant ghost voice overs reminding you of specific dialogue at salient points.I think i was just expecting more from it, i was waiting to see slow-mo shoot outs in the village hall, fast cutting one-on-one shoot outs. Walking away from explosions with shotguns over their shoulder. There seemed to be none of that.Although there were laughs, they weren't belly laughs. Anyone who watched Shaun will remember them bashing a zombie with pool cues in time to 'Don't Stop Me Know' will smile to themselves. It was more humorous with a couple of in jokes to older Wright-Pegg material. I don't think i actually laughed loudly once during the whole movie.It also seemed to be for a larger audience. Shaun was cult through and through. It paid homage to so many zombie movies it was hard to keep count and some of them were so subtle it was hard to spot without multiple viewings (Foree Electronics anyone?). Hot Fuzz seemed more generic and tried to be a movie in itself rather than paying homage to anything specific, although i did spot the Lethal Weapon reference quite clearly.So there we have it, it was amusing, but not funny. There was action, but you have to wait a while for it. And some of the characters seemed to be there just for the sake of getting someone famous in. I've never seen Bill Bailey so underused in anything in my life.It was alright",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Fantastic satire... Obviously.,"I didn't love Hot Fuzz after my first watch.

Cate Blanchett has a funny cameo, Olivia Coleman is hilarious and Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall are funny too.To state the obvious, the satire is spot on, the set-ups and pay-offs are clever and hilarious, the transitions are awesome and tension is built really effectively.Also ""make Sandford great again"" is funny.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"good, but i'll have to be a sad t*sser and take ear guards to the cinema in future","i really did enjoy this movie a lot, right up until the part where the shoot out spills over into the bar. at which point the volume of this film just got totally ridiculous. why on earth do we need that kind of bass? in the small theatre i was in, it was like sitting in a bass bin. utterly ludicrous and really really distracting. how can you enjoy a film with one finger stuck in your ear hole?the earlier parts of the film are excellent. there are some brilliant lines here, especially when offcr angel is settling into his new station. people (/officers) in law enforcement with a sense of humour will really love this one as well, and would have to admit that it's a pretty accurate depiction in a lot of respects especially with some of the characters and terminologythere are some real laugh out loud moments and some great accents pronouncing 'Lond-en' etc. it just got a bit too ott and repetitive for me especially at the end. if it had about 20 minutes or so, timothy dalton and some noise lopped off i would rate it higher. but unfortunately the person who mixed this in particular was either negligent or gratuitous.protectors in future for me, because my ear holes are not taking a pounding like that again!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A little bit of everything,"I didn't see Shaun of the Dead prior to the release of this movie. I didn't even know about Hot Fuzz when it came to theaters. I watched this movie when it came to Comcast On Demand and it looked like it was gonna be a pretty funny movie. I got so, so much more than that.Hot Fuzz is a parody of action movies, and a good action movie by itself. It is really a 3 in 1 movie. It is a slasher, comedy, and an action movie at the same time. The action does take to get going for a good 30/40 minutes, but during that time we are exposed to some really great British humor (which not all Americans like) and witty fast paced scenes.The plot isn't a bad one either. An overachieving cop is sent to a small rural town where a murder hasn't occurred in many years because he was making his fellow police officers ""look bad"". The cop (played by Simon Pegg) is having boring days at the town until some strange deaths occur. The town thinks they're accidents, but Simon thinks there is a murderous lunatic on the loose. That is the plot synopsis, and while it may seem a little bland it is executed masterfully with a lot of humor and movie references along the way.Hot Fuzz was a very pleasant surprise for me. It is now among my favorite movies and I can truly say it is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Good but definitely one to watch in the right frame of mind,"Don't believe the hype.Also don't believe the knockers(missus.) I like Simon Pegg as a performer,he comes across well in the UK comedies and the films involved with. I started off liking this film a lot.Witty and pleasing.Then somewhere amongst the second half of the film it started to get on my nerves a bit. Its on a par with Shaun of the dead and fans of that will like it.There was some effective gore,but the film seemed a bit schizophrenic,unless that was the intention. Schitzophrenic in a way that From Dusk Till Dawn starts off as one thing and ends up another. Didn't find the over the top second half that great. I give it a 6/10 probably a 7 if someone is in the mood for it. Its a case of liking the actors better than the material they do.As no-one is going to read this after the high praise first few hundred comments my partial damning of the film don't matter does it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Not so hot,"This film begins beautifully, and for the first half it is amusing and admirable. But then it falls apart halfway through because the filmmakers decided, in a fit of madness, that it would be fun if lots of people began shooting guns all over the place, in a prolonged series of mock-violent incidents which are meant to make the viewer scream with laughter. But it is not funny at all, it is boring, tedious, and wholly ludicrous. So the film was ruined. I was really looking forward to seeing this, because I know Wells, Somerset, so well, and that is where it was made on location. I forced myself to sit through the horrible second half just to see the town in the background. (It is called 'Sandford, Gloucestershire' in the film, and the Bishop's Palace is turned into 'the castle'. In fact, in the film the Palace and the cathedral are never glimpsed, but the Palace Gate and moat and walls are seen, and there is a mildly amusing running joke about an escaped swan from the moat.) Some of the actors do a very fine job of their Somerset accents, and they manage some of the marvellous rural gnomic humour for which countless British film classics in years gone by have been famous, such as Sandy Mackendrick's WHISKEY GALORE! (1949) and Robert Stevenson's OWD BOB (1938, see my review). If only the film had remained in this vein, it could have been something to be proud of. But instead, it is such an abysmal failure that it is not worth a thought.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
You just gotta love smart British humor!,"You're sitting at the computer minding your own business. There's a random movie starting at your TV. You throw your eye a few times on the beginning. You throw your eyes more and more on it. Finally you take a seat on your couch and decide to watch the rest of the film. How often does this happen to you? To just get absorbed by the amusement/drama/subject/etc of a movie you weren't intending to see, just by a few glances in the starting minutes? I, for one, know that it's something that happens barely seldom to me. Yet, this movie just caught me right from the beginning.So we have Nicholas Angel (just loved the name choice), a workaholic, very serious, very effective police officer from London who gets transfered to rural Sandford, Gloucestershire. From here he starts interacting with the locals, bringing his fancy, londonistic ways of being a cop to the lighthearted villagers. Not the most likable person, Nicholas forms a bond (more of a hero-fanboy relation) with Danny, son of the Chief Inspector. New, unexpected events take place and the action really starts. Storyline isn't so important in my opinion, as I'm sure the screenplay would've been as funny as with any other epic development.This film is abundant of British humor, which I love, while Simon Pegg's character can become actually adorable. No fancy stuff for this movie, just smart gags, a perfectly balanced dose of action and many referrals to Point Break and Bad Boys 2 :)All in all, the main idea is that you should (at the border of turning into a must) watch it. Probably if you saw Shaun of the Dead you are looking forward into this one, if not then you'll be looking forward into SotD after viewing Hot Fuzz (like I am :) ).Disclaimer - English is not my native language, so be gentle :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"Dry, over-the-top, in your face parody.","I watched this on DVD last night. Immediately after the movie, I watched the DVD extras, which are normally boring but in this case, you get a lot of extras. And they are great. You get to go along with the director and 2 main characters on a media junket through the U.S. Don't miss this trip. It's great, in some ways better than the movie.After that, I got on IMDb to give the movie an 8. But I realized that an 8 would be based on the combined movie and DVD extras. Many will only see the movie so I settled on a 7.The movie starts a bit slow, working at the humor. It's actually more of a drama at this point. But once Nick (Simon Pegg) gets to his new assignment, things get better and funnier.I'm not going to do a review of specifics, others have given you plenty. I will only say that the movie is fun. The writing is excellent, and was hard thought. This movie was not thrown together in a few weeks. The acting is, well, what can you say... it's a comedy and all the players add their parts well.But know this... this is a dark comedy. It's not all gross-out, potty humor. It is in your face, but as a parody of big budget action films. There is a lot of subtlety going on here. What ""Shaun of the Dead"" did for zombie movies, this one does for cop buddy pictures.I read many of the ""hated it"" comments here and in almost ALL cases, the complainers admitted to falling asleep or turning it off. Well, no wonder they didn't like it. This is a movie that has to be watched from beginning to end, and you should be paying attention. There's a lot to see and absorb. I watched it with sub-titles on (as I do for many British films) as it helps decipher some of the humor and language quirks. It's also a movie that can be watched more than once. There is real style and effort in this 2 hours and much will be missed the first time through.So, if you liked ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""The Full Monty"" you should enjoy this send up. And if you like it once, you'll love it more 6 months from now. There is genius in the work. If you're not fond of British humor or dark, edgy comedy, you'll likely not laugh. I actually only remember laughing once or twice, but I had a smile on my face all the way through.This is an over the top (and under your normal view), in your face (and work your mind) comedy. There's a lot to appreciate. But please pay attention. Otherwise, you will miss the fun and give it a horrible score like those who slept through it. I don't feel anyone should be qualified to vote if they never really saw the movie, do you?And don't miss the extras on the DVD. Pure fun!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Exceedingly entertaining... only if action cop films are your thing,"Hot fuzz is a movie I would recommend to others but not to myself. It is by all means a funny satire on cop films of the past. This is its main selling point- that it recalls so many action films and turns them all up to eleven. This is also its main flaw for me- I have always appreciated suspense over action, for I find mindless action involving large explosions and messy car chases to be quite dull after a while. Hence seeing something which I already didn't appreciate being turned up to eleven is not hugely enjoyable. Personally, I also did not enjoy the tone of the film. The film is undoubtedly a comedy but it has such a Bizarrely serious tone, especially in the second half with its absurd plot, which is clearly a satire of action movies with absurd plots and serious tones. But that just felt odd to me. It felt unsatisfactorily unresolved, and I would've liked to see an overtly comedic tone more reminiscent of conventional comedies. The ending also runs a bit too long where the film feels as if it cannot stop itself. Despite this there is still much to like of course. Simon Pegg, who have already established d himself as a leading comedic actor in British television, is fantastic in this movie. The first half also has very funny moments, and Timothy Daltons performance is also great. Hot fuzz is a movie which would delight action enthusiasts or those who enjoy more fantastically, over the top comedic films- I dare say these two groups cover a majority of the film going public, and since I belong to neither group, it is a film I can recommend to others but not to myself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Homage or parody, Hot Fuzz is the best of modern British comedy.","Police Constable Nicholas Angel is the pride of the London Service, trouble is is that he is making everybody else look bad, so much so his superiors promote him to Sergeant in the sleepy village of Sandford, Gloucestershire. Yet all is not right with Sandford as the locals start meeting grizzly deaths, thus thrusting Angel into his biggest case so far.The biggest question on most film goers lips was could the pairing of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg triumphantly follow the monster cult success of Shaun Of The Dead? Well the plot premise for Hot Fuzz hardly leaps out as something to grab the attention span of many, but they have crafted a tremendously funny film that winks at the action genre with genuine love and admiration.Simon Pegg and his trusty sidekick, Nick Frost, clearly have an earthbound appeal that many {even outside of Britain} can warm too, not pretty or over svelt, these guys are fans of movies making movies purely for the fans, and it shows. Neither Pegg or Frost try to steal scenes from each other, both men after over a decade of working together are clearly comfortable with their coupling and thus manage to fine tune their working chemistry.Once Angel {Pegg} lands at Sandford Village we are introduced to a ream of British Village stereotypes {archetypes actually}, all characters ripe for hilarious scenarios that our fish out water {big city cop} Sergeant struggles to comprehend. We observe as he is dumb struck at the ineptitude of the Village Police Force {erm service actually} and is then forced to work alongside dough eyed Constable Butterman {a film stealing Frost}. Angel's exasperation at where he finds himself is mirthful joy to us the viewers. The dialogue is priceless, one liners and hat tipping nods to the action genre come thick and fast, in fact you can watch Hot Fuzz repeatedly and play spot the homage each time. I mean come on people, we got both James Bond {a delicious turn from Timothy Dalton} and Belloq in here strutting their stuff. The action set pieces are not found wanting either, director Wright having the time of his life with the crash bang wallop that flows in the final third.The test of a great comedy is how it stands up to repeat viewings, to me Hot Fuzz delivers no matter how many times it is viewed. For even when you know what is coming up next, the smile on your face is already there before the event, wonderful, wonderful film made by guys who love movies as much as ourselves. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Overlong,Patchily Funny Brit-com","A patchy comedy from the makers of SPACED and SHAUN OF THE DEAD,the first half of HOT FUZZ is certainly the funniest part of the film,with plenty of good gags,witty lines and amusing incident,contrasting Simon Pegg's previous experiences with inner-city policing and the relatively dull and uneventful life in rural West-Country England.The second half of the film,though,has some wildly unexpected plot twists,deliberately overdone bloody violence,which despite Edgar Wright's best intentions come across as mostly unpleasant rather than funny,and parallel attempts at a satire on vigilantism and a parody on noisy,over-the-top Hollywood action adventure thrillers.This actually comes off quite well,and technically is as good if not better than the genre it is intending to send up and emulate.But the problem here is that the action scenes,well done as they are,are filmed and edited perhaps too literally to provoke genuine mirth,and an over-emphatic soundtrack is also a considerable mitigation against possible laughter.That said,quality is evident throughout,with fine performances from Pegg,Nick Frost,a remarkably distinguished supporting cast of veteran British actors(Jim Broadbent,Billie Whitelaw,Timothy Dalton,Edward Woodward,Kenneth Cranham among others), amusing cameos(Steve Coogan,Bill Nighy,Cate Blanchett),and scores of in-jokes and references to other films(THE WICKER MAN,STRAW DOGS,BAD BOYS II) which are fairly well observed.The talented comedian Bill Bailey is wasted in a too-brief part(or parts)playing desk sergeant twins,but he still manages to raise laughs despite his regrettable lack of screen time.The accumulation of action climaxes,however,becomes too much and are somewhat obviously contrived,and the film itself has around 20 minutes too much footage.Still,HOT FUZZ is enjoyable enough,especially it's first half.The second half is less so,though still pretty good if you can take it,but the faint-hearted may not be so tolerant.RATING:6 and a half out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
2nd best of the Cornetto trilogy,"It's a testament to Edgar Wright , Simon Pegg and Nick Frost collaborations that the only criticism I can can come up with is that it's criminal that they haven't made more films together .Hot Fuzz , the second in the ""Cornetto"" Trilogy and coincidentally the second best behind Shaun Of The Dead . It's a very clever comedy rammed packed full of famous British actors and I think it's the Britishness that gives its appeal , not just here in the UK but across the pond .It's one of those films that you have to see more than once to spot the multitude of references to other bits of popular culture . Simon Pegg is great at the over zealous London cop who is sent to the country because he's showing everyone up with his arrest rate but when he gets there he discovers behind the sleepy country facade , there is something deeply sinister going on .Apart from Pegg , there are other brilliant performances but for me , the stand out has to be Timothy Dalton , who plays the creepy supermarket owner. You couldn't get more opposite to James Bond !This is delightfully violent , yet you never feel it's gratuitous and village folk always seem to bounce back from whatever punishment Nicholas Angel inflicts on them .When I first saw this over twenty years ago , I never appreciated how good it was but on second viewing I can see why many people feel it's the best of the three but not for me .

Question: Is this movie great?  Answer: Yarp!,"Hilarious action-packed black comedy about overachieving London police officer Pegg forced to transfer into the country by jealous superiors who ""Simply makes us look bad."" When he arrives in Sandford, he notices petty laws continuously being broken and commonly hears the phrase, ""The greater good."" This all starts to add up when citizens of Sandford begin dying in tragic accidents. Frost is terrific as Pegg's dim-witted partner, and Bill Nighy is perfect in the bit role of the chief inspector. Plenty of laughs, plenty of blood, but perhaps a little too much action during the conclusion (probably a little overlong too).

A comedic masterpiece!,"This film is about an elite London policeman transferred to a seemingly peaceful village due to jealous colleagues.Oh wow. ""Hot Fuzz"" is so good! It is so amazingly funny. Every scene is set up to have a hilarious atmosphere. Every character is funny and likable in some way. Nicholas Angel is a righteous policeman, he is very good at what he does. He is a great contrast with the other village policemen, who are so lazy and mischievous. I enjoy watching the power struggle between Nicolas and Inspector Frank Butterman. The battles between them are clear, yet they do not come across as being malicious.The plot is excellent. It manages to pack in so much fun, action and horror in just two hours. The plot twists are very unpredictable, and every twist leads to yet another adventure. Who would have thought a comedy would have full scale shootouts in a supermarkets and high speed car chases? ""Hot Fuzz"" also contains gore for the horror fans. These scenes are graphic, but appear almost comical.

Hot Fuzz,"It is a great cop movie featuring Sergeant Nicholas Angel, he is ""transferred"" to Sandford, a sleepy town.

"uproarious British spoof; a send-up that delivers the high-octane action, tons of puns and tasteless gags","Edgar Wright has somehow outdone himself from his previous first feature comedy/zombie movie, Shaun of the Dead, with his Hot Fuzz, a send-up of all those cop/law-enforcement movies where the style goes berserk and beyond post-modernism into some kind of frantic 'show-em-what-we-got' method of big-bang action and cheesy catch phrases amid an absurd plot. This time, Wright and co-writer/star Simon Pegg know very well how much the absurdism already goes on in those movies, particularly those by Michael Bay, and the send-up is all the more brilliant because there's nothing extremely hateful towards the movies (one might think, for sort of guilty pleasure sake, Wright and Pegg sit around watching these movies as much as the Danny character does in the film), and the level of zaniness imposed knows no boundaries.Actually, the boundaries are sort of set by genre, however this even dips into movies such as The Wicker Man (which is actually very indebted to the main storyline), Scream, and even Godzilla in one scene. And unlike Shaun of the Dead, the gags, however subtle or post Monty Python they get, practically never stop. This time, tone doesn't drastically change; it's consistently with a tongue placed firmly in its Great British cheek. And speaking of Monty Python, as I walked out of the theater a late Python member popped in my mind in relation to Simon Pegg's Nick Angel in Hot Fuzz: Graham Chapman. Here, Pegg shows completely, like Chapman, that he's perfectly capable of playing the straight man in comedic situations, even more here than in 'Shaun', and that his level of being the ""normal"" in an otherwise zany comic setting makes it seemingly even.Then, suddenly, in the third act, we see Pegg's character have to take a turn by way of how the story makes its dark twist in revealing the situation of the ""accidents"" that have been going on in the seemingly peaceful small town he's sergeant in, and finally, Pegg brings out the level of crazy comedic timing that's been under the surface the whole time. This climax, of course, is one of the funniest things about the film, but it's all been preempted by Wright and Pegg setting up the film with clichés and archetypes, turns that are pretty obvious each step of the way, and even in the moments that start to get less funny as mores-so amusing, and all the more ironic in that it's set among characters that bring out this level of comic hysteria.At first, some of the humor is in little vicious stabs that strike out because of how blatant they are on the part of the filmmakers: the swan, the unintelligible small-town English folk (some with many, many, many firearms, which is sort of a spoiler by the way), a golden statue man, and a man in a costume of Death, as mere visual gags. Others, for me anyway, were almost in-jokes, like the laugh-out-loud bit with Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy (in the same frame no less). But it's not simply visual comedy, however that is a big factor in it all as Wright is almost TOO good at mimicking the hyper-kinetic Bay style of editing and jump-cuts. It's also that there's a great ensemble too, with Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Paul Freeman, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall, even Timothy Hutton joins in relishing the underlying poke in the ribs in practically every scene.Yet through all of the parodies and splashes, pun intended, of appropriately graphic violence (it comes close to Grindhouse, which Wright provided the ""Don't"" trailer, in wisely imploring gore and massive shoot-outs for comedy sake), there's a sharp level of wit in the dialog, a clever repore in making us actually care about some of the characters (Pegg and Frost anyway, especially after a bout with Point Break), and keeps you laughing when the whole shebang ends.

Spaced bad boys at point break.,"Most of the buddy movies from the eighties, from ""Tango and Cash"" to ""Lethal Weapon"" are nowadays already funny to watch, for the narrative and aesthetically codes they use are usually very old-fashion and cliché. ""Hot Fuzz"", witch is sold as a parody of those kind of cop movie, reinvents those codes in a totally out of the blues environment, and give an even more absurd tone to those absurd codes : a little and calm village of England, where nothing ever happens.Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a kind of ""Robocop"" bobby of London is indeed transfered in Sandford, a village where his amazing skills won't eclipse the ones of his colleges. But for Angel, even when everything's calm, there's always something's happening, especially when the all inhabitants of the town seems so suspects, as if they're trying to hide something, for the ""greater good"".Just like ""Shawn of the Dead"" mixed the living dead movies with a very spaced humor, ""Hot Fuzz"" transfers ""Miami Vice"" in a very British (an therefor absurd) environment and humor. The all thing is rather pleasant, full of great guests (including Steve Coogan and Timothy Dalton in what may be his best role) : those who saw the previous Edgar Wright's movies won't be surprised by the tone of the movie, and those who expect another Ben Sttiller's ""Starsky and Hutch"" will be rather surprised.Nothing to say except that if the first part of the movie is really funny and clever, in a very British style, the last act, witch looks more like a gun-fight parody, is way more classic and less enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Shaun of the Dead has met its match!,"Hot Fuzz is simply awesome! I know I have said that about a lot of movies that admittedly weren't awesome in the past, but Hot Fuzz really, really, really is awesome! And believe it or not that is still an understatement for how much of a success story this movie really is. We've got superb characters, more gore galore, intense action, great murder sequences, a witty and inventive script, more cameos from British comedians, subtle references to great action movies and Shaun of the Dead, a great double act from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, a brilliantly fun turn from Timothy Dalton proving finally he's more than just that Bond who did two movies. In fact this movie is practically perfect in my eyes, some people might think the action takes over too much in the final act, some people might think that the movie isn't funny. But in my eyes this movie is everything I wanted and a lot more added on top, a superb follow up to Shaun of the Dead, and easily going to be one of the best, and actually could be the best movie of 2007!The idea behind Hot Fuzz is admittedly not as original or as funny as the idea for Shaun of the Dead was. The idea of Shaun of the Dead was interesting and amusing before I had even seen the film, the idea here has its moments but it seems actually quite rudimentary. However, what Hot Fuzz makes up with is a hilarious script, great performances and just more of a sense of gun and coolness than Shaun of the Dead had. Now it hurts me to say this as I adored every last inkling of Shaun of the Dead, but I still found Hot Fuzz to be a better movie despite the idea being not as creative.Now then the performances of Hot Fuzz. Well once again Simon Pegg and Nick Frost prove that they really are one of the best double acts ever! They were great as the two best friends in Shaun of the Dead, here they're even better. Admiteddly Simon Pegg's character, Nicholas isn't as fun as Shaun was, but he's a bit cooler and he has a lot of great stuff towards the end. But Danny easily rivals Ed from Shaun. Danny possesses a child like innocence that makes you laugh like mad. His great eyeball sequence had me in stitches because it actually seems real, you can imagine someone doing that to get a laugh. And I suppose in a movie that's got a lot of fantasy action madness surrounding it, there is still the human aspect at the core that makes the movie all the more enjoyable. Its believable while still having the cool slow-mo action shootouts. Timothy Dalton relishes his screen time in this movie, he hasn't done a lot since he hung up his tuxedo as Bond all those years ago, but finally he finds a performance that really shows his talent. The fact that he is clearly having a whale of a time as well made me enjoy his performance all the more. He has some great lines and just seems so well, traditionally evil its great!The other big thing I want to mention about Hot Fuzz before I give my hefty review a rest is of course the action. Hot Fuzz is parodying cop movies, so its obvious you'll get some action as well. And boy the action is cool. The action I suppose doesn't truly kick off until the final third, and when it does the movie seems to explode with, well there's no other word for it, awesomeness! We have a superbly staged gun fight, no scrap that we have roughly three superbly staged gun fights, a punch up, a car chase and oh we have a lot more as well. The action is surprisingly intense and realistic for a parody. And its this fact that makes the movie so much better. Shaun of the Dead got some genuine frights in the movie as well, well here Hot Fuzz delivers in terms of action and in terms of being a thriller as well. In fact some of the murder sections are surprisingly grisly and tense. I knew the movie would be violent, but I had no idea it'd rival Shaun in terms of gore. The thriller sections of the movie have their own moments of comedy, but they can be surprisingly tense as you sit and wait for the next person to fall foul of the murderer. The movies gory, but its also fun gory, so for those of you panicking that Hot Fuzz features nasty gore like it does in a movie such as Saw then don't panic. The gore here is clearly played for laughs despite some of it being quite nasty in places.If you liked Shaun of the Dead, if you like action movies, hell if you like movies you must see this film! Its a triumph in British cinema, Pegg and Wright have done it again, now lets hope that lightning strikes three times when their inevitable third project arrives on our cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Hot Fuzz Review,"There is a problem in my mind for someone like me when it comes to movies. I read into them a lot before I see them, especially reviews. Having that in mind, I have been all over this site as well as aintitcoolnews.com and rottentomatoes reading several reviews of this film before seeing it and realizing most to all of them were glowing.In my opinion, I believe Shaun of the Dead to be one of the top ten funniest movies I have ever seen. It hit all the right notes with me, even when it turned into a real zombie movie toward the end. It was flawless in my eyes. So obviously it would be tough to have a follow up be that good. Kind of what happened with broken lizard. I saw super troopers first along with most people and thought it was hilarious, but what followed from those guys wasn't quite up to par with it, although I am one of the few that enjoyed club dread and really enjoyed beerfest, they just weren't super troopers.So apparently going into this movie, I had high hopes. I wasn't completely disappointed, but I was a little. I felt the film drug on in spots and never was outright hilarious. There was a lot of fun to be had here, I just don't feel that it was taken full advantage of.That's pretty much all the bad I have for it.As for the good, there was plenty. These guys obviously have seen the movies they satire quite a few times. They are spot on with action clichés, anywhere from the bad boys circle cam to riding in on a horse, the gunfights and way over the top deaths. The pointing out one character who HAS to be the villain, It is all very clever. These two fellas work well together and obviously have a great sense of humor. I love the enthusiasm that they bring to the table, this one just did not work as well for me as Shaun of the Dead. Not saying it's bad, just saying if I loved Shaun of the Dead, I really enjoyed Hot Fuzz.I do hope Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg pick out some more categories to poke fun at and I hope it stays fresh and fun. I do recommend this movie to anyone who thinks the trailer looks funny or enjoyed Shaun of the Dead. It definitely has it's moments, but I don't feel the jokes work quite as well as before. But go see it, cause there is fun to be had.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Absolutely brilliant,"Wright/Pegg/Frost are absolutely brilliant together. Watching either of their two feature films, I find myself pacing the room, raving about the genius behind a certain set of quick cuts, or the framing of a shot, or the delivery of a line -- even if I'm the only person in the room. It's hard to put my finger on why these guys' satires are so much funnier and more intelligent than Hollywood attempts at parody; all I know is that they never seem to stop and wink at the audience, if you know what I mean. Adding to the mix is Wright's directorial abilities, which are absolutely spot on. Well, there I go raving again.

However, i would argue that this is not a brilliant film, and it is at the end of the day, forgettable.I think this movie has scored so highly because it is so refreshing to see a British comedy that works on the big screen. Ultimately though, you can take your pick from dozens of Hollywood comedies that are simply better than this.....starting with the 40 year old virgin.I would score this film between 6 and 7.....but i've gone for 6, because 8.2 out of 10 is over the top.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"Not quite as satisfying as ""Shaun of the Dead""","For those who don't know, this film reunites the key personnel behind ""Shaun of the Dead"" and attempts to do for 'buddy' cop movies what ""Shaun"" did for horror flicks.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are teamed up again and they demonstrate the same comedic chemistry that was at the core of ""Shaun of the Dead"". The support's a little bit better this time around, too, with Jim Broadbent and Timothy Dalton particularly memorable in their respective roles.The writing is witty and shows a keen observational eye for the genre that's being parodied. Lazier screenwriters would have simply stuck to parodying recognizable movie scenes but this film mostly just accentuates it's own story with stock genre clichés. Unfortunately, I feel that they do this a little too well in the last half hour or so of the film, which is just as insufferable as a typical prolonged action extravaganza from any number of bloated action films.The direction by Edgar Wright effectively captures the feel of the type of movie that this film parodies. Again, it's not so much about recognizable visuals but more of a case of new material that retains a distinct 'feel'. There are some nifty music choices as well.All in all, this is a pretty good film but to me it starts to drag towards the end. At that point the action seems just as vapid as any other cookie cutter action flick. If your tastes gravitate to that sort of movie then you will probably not share my complaint.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Good Comedy - but with a stressful ending for your eyes ;),I really liked the style of the filmmaking and also the homur. Very enjoyable.

Not even close to Shawn of the Dead.,"It moved a bit slow for me, as so many British comedies do.But there are great action comedies like Lock stock and 2 smoking barrels or snatch.But I was expecting so much more from this...more than it could deliver apparently. For some reason scenes like Simon Peg finding Nick Frost and takes him in for drunken disorderly and picks up a bunch of others along the way, is not extremely hilariousonly mildly funny. I know the story does not make real sense, it is not supposed to it's a comedybut the comedy was so mediocre to me it had me trying to hunt for a logical ending.Not even close to Shawn of the Dead.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Unmissable,"~Plot/Writing/Direction~ Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is the most outstanding officer in the Metropolitan Police Service. His arrest record is 400% higher than any of his colleagues. In fact, he's so good that his superiors (Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan and Martin Freeman) re-assign him. They send him off to Sandford, a little village in the South-West of England where nothing remotely exciting ever happens. But it isn't long before Angel has to contend with gruesome murders and strange townsfolk.This film is mocking the typical American action film by being set in a small village in the English countryside. It is a clear cross between The Wicker Man, and all of those buddy-cop films (with a pinch of horror, too). There are numerous films which Hot Fuzz parodies, or makes (in)direct references to, including; The Munsters, Dirty Harry, Chinatown, The Omen, An American Werewolf in London, Masters of the Universe, Die Hard, Bad Boys, Point Break, Lethal Weapon, Crocodile Dundee, Jurassic Park, Judge Judy, and even the team's earlier film, Shaun of the Dead. So, as a send up of all of these big budget American thrillers, it's fantastic viewing. The comedy and dialogue between the two central characters is brilliant, and the one-liners are purposefully (but wonderfully) cheesy. The story eventually builds to one of the most unbelievable climaxes in an action film for years, and it's simply unmissable.~Cast~ Flawless. What's great about this film, as well as everything else, is that it's full of familiar faces. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are excellent yet again, providing a good contrast to one another. Their back-up is superb in the form of screen veterans Jim Broadbent, Edward Woodward, Timothy Dalton (who must be the highlight of the film for me), Billie Whitelaw, Paul Freeman, and numerous others. And they're all put to tremendously good use in the explosive final-third of the picture.~Music~ Most of the film is full to the brim with songs from the likes of Adam Ant, the Kinks, Supergrass, Arthur Brown, the Fratellis, Dire Straits, T. Rex and the Troggs. But in-between is a good effort from Bond-composer David Arnold. He succeeds particularly in the action sequences towards the end of the film, and notably works in themes which are reminiscent of classic Westerns and cop films while maintaining a modern, techno-sound.~Summary~ I think this film has a very wide appeal, but it is people who can spot the references and appreciate the casting of the supporting characters who will enjoy it the most. It's laugh-out-loud funny, but is far more than your run-of-the-mill action-comedy. It's witty, clever, and the final third of the film left me speechless. If you didn't/don't catch it at the cinema, it's a shame. But if you don't catch it on DVD either, you don't know what you're missing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Probably the greatest film ever made. No joke.,"This is not just one of the greatest comedies of all time, I genuinely believe this is one of the greatest films of all time.There is so much to praise, but not enough space to do it justice.It puts most ""comedies"" to shame. It even gives the crime thrillers & horrors we see today a run for their money. Wright and Pegg's ultra-tight script displays the most remarkable attention to detail.It is jam packed with gags, including some truly iconic visuals, and EVERYTHING the script sets up has a fantastic and satisfying pay-off.Hot Fuzz achieves via parody what films of its target genre can't even achieve!And crucially, it proves that unapologetically entertaining films like Hot Fuzz can be ""artistic"". With this film, Pegg and Wright are in masterful control of their craft.Hot Fuzz is everything a film should be.This is their magnum opus. A true masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"If this isn't the funniest movie of the year, that means we'll have to look forward to another movie as laugh-out-loud hysterical as this one.","Comedy has always been my favorite genre. My sense of humor covers a wide variety of films, and I'll laugh at almost anything, regardless of how stupid, or silly it is. But once in a while a truly great comedy comes along, and leaves an amazing lasting effect with the laughs. While some comedies have you leave the theater saying ""that was funny,"" and then forgetting about it the next day, Hot Fuzz always hits it's comedic mark, and when you leave the theater, you'll want to quote it endlessly, and bring your friends to see it again. It will have you laughing for days.The plot revolves around Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), who's police work goes unrivaled in London. As a result, he is transferred to a small village in the country, Sanford, which is statistically the safest village in England. Not much for a hard-boiled cop to do there. The police station is full of cops so lazy and inept, that when people start getting killed in a variety of gruesome ways, they conclude that they were unfortunate accidents. Only Angel's clueless, action-starved partner, Danny (Nick Frost), believes that Angel may be on to something. And as in all murder mysteries, things aren't exactly what they seem...Hot Fuzz is a flawlessly written comedy, with non-stop jokes, gags, and one-liners, delivered at such a rapid pace, there is literally no way to catch every one on the first viewing. I've seen the film four times now, and each time, I've caught some hysterical subtle gag that I missed the previous time. While many comedies don't stand up well to repeated viewings, Hot Fuzz keeps getting better each time I view it. There seems to be an unlimited amount of priceless comedy and detail in this film, and that you could watch it a hundred times and notice something you missed each time.Now, as good as it works as a comedy, Hot Fuzz strangely works as an engaging action/mystery in it's own right. While the action and mystery is entirely satirical and played for laughs, the story actually manages to keep you guessing and wondering what's going to happen next. There is a plot twist that actually managed to effectively surprise me. I don't know what surprised me more. The twist, or the fact that the twist was actually thrilling. The third act action sequences are also quite adrenaline-pumping, and feature some of the coolest (and loudest) gunfights in a long time. It's good to have some legitimate suspense and coolness with your laughs, and this film perfectly combines them. Though the first two acts focus on the murder mystery with almost no action, the last act completely makes up for it. You'll leave the theater laughing your ass off and feeling like you've just had a perfect fix of action.The performances are also great, and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have excellent chemistry. It is clear that these guys are the best of friends in real life. And the British accents are surprisingly clear and easy to understand. And Timothy Dalton stole the show for me as Simon Skinner, a sinister business owner who has ""criminal"" written all over him. Every time he showed up on screen, I bust up laughing more than anyone else in the theater.Hot Fuzz is without a doubt going to end up being the funniest movie of the year. It is comedic writing at it's finest, and is a great movie in it's own right. I couldn't recommend it more, and give it 10/10.Hot Fuzz is rated R for violent content including some graphic images and for language.

One of the greatest comedies.,"Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, ""S*** just got real."" Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways, the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English, and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a big-budget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint, atmospheric English village given the secrets- of-its-own flavor and a Agatha Christie-style expository structure.The film-making style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects, occasional strobe, and montages of grainy, bleached out, extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any super-cool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a dead-on impression of Hollywood film-making but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so well-developed as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive, a workaholic, a zealot, and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line, he's also funny in such a direct, adolescent way, an unlikely comic relief sidekick.The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his two-year stint as James Bond, but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written, beautifully directed, atmospheric, or intelligently ridiculous.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Solid, ridiculous, clever","My first watch, I didn't appreciate it much. But the second time through, years later, this movie finally ""clicked"" for me. The writing is efficient, the humor subtle for the most part; it seems to flatter rather than insult the viewer's intelligence.There's more to it than that, though - it's a dive into the quirkiness of a little English village, in contrast to London whence Simon Pegg's character hails. On the urban-vs-rural divide the movie is split, sometimes taking the side of the big city, other times taking the side of the village, so to speak.I'd fault the movie mainly for a one-dimensional villain. But the late reveal and general camp of things make it go down easy. That and some violence beyond my comfort level.A fun time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Peerless Burlesque Of Supercop Movies,"Simon Pegg is an outstanding member of the London Police Force. He is so good that he makes everyone else look bad, so they promote him to sergeant and exile him to a village in Gloucestershire, where the major problem is swans keep escaping. He is paired with beery, indolent Nick Frost, whose father, Jim Broadbent, is head of the station. Frost keeps asking him about the life of a supercop, derived from the movies, which annoys Pegg, no end. Pegg insists that his most important tools are his pencil and log book, can get through the endless paperwork in three cuts of the film editor's scissors, and gradually comes to believe that jovial supermarket owner Timothy Dalton has been killing off locals for reasons that are unclear.With a script by Pegg and director Edgar Wright, this seems to be the least regarded of their ""Cornetto"" movies. I think it's hilarious, as it mercilessly takes apart every cop movie cliche in a small village, with the high-speed editing by Chris Dickens letting you know that events are linked. There are plenty of blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameos, and you need to pay attention to every moment. Wright doesn't stop for a good gag or meaningless shot.

Simon and Nick are the funniest comedy duo today!,"I wanted to see Hot Fuzz so badly in the theater, because Shaun of the Dead is one of my favorite movies and this looked just as funny. Unfortunately, most of my friends don't share the same sense of humor as I do with comedies. So I rented it yesterday, watched it last night, and I have to say that this movie delivered great laughs and had a great story. It was so funny to see action movies for what they really are, Simon and Nick were such a great duo, I love these guys, they have such a natural chemistry despite being total opposite characters. Hot Fuzz is such a great parody of every action movie you have ever seen.Nicholas Angel is a good policeman in London, his arrest record is through the roof, he has been injured on the job, and everyone likes him, well, almost everyone. The London police are a bit upset with how well he does and transfers him as a Sargent over to a small town, Sanford. He meets, Danny, another cop who is just completely clueless to anything around him. In fact the whole police squad is convinced that Sanford is the perfect town and nothing will never happen. Until murders start appearing, but they always look like an accident, but Nicholas is on the move with Danny to find out if Sanford is up to something bad.Hot Fuzz is a great comedy, I think I still like Shaun of the Dead a little better, but I don't know, I'm having a hard time deciding because this was a great movie too. I loved the Romeo and Juliet scene, how they were doing a homage to the remade version and their cheery version of ""#1 Crush"" by Garbage was just so out of the blue and idiotic, but so hilarious! I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to anyone if you need a good laugh, Hot Fuzz will guarantee you that.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"You will enjoy yourself so much, you just might explode.","From the creators of ""Shaun of the Dead"" comes ""Hot Fuzz"", a hilarious film that somewhat parodies buddy cop movies, and is filled with references to films like ""Bad Boys II"" and ""Point Break"". Just as in ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"" starts of slow, and builds it's way up to a hilarious and amazing second half. It stars Simon Pegg as Nicholas Angel, a sergeant in the London police force who is reassigned for being too good, and making the other officers ""look bad"". But the small, innocent town of Sandford where Angel is reassigned to, turns out to be anything but that. After a series of grisly ""accidents"", Angel starts to believe there's something much bigger than than a few mishaps afoot. What you see in the trailer for ""Hot Fuzz"" is quite misleading actually, because most of it occurs in the first half of the movie. But after that, the movie takes a large turn into a completely different direction. That direction, which I'm not going to elaborate on, ends in a completely mind blowing conclusion, that you will not see coming. With that said, I would like to note that if you don't like British humor, you might want to stay clear of this one. I, myself, love British humor, and found the comedy aspect of this movie to be genius. In the middle, there are some scenes that drag a little, but it all builds up to the incredibly climactic ending. There's also quite a bit of graphic violence, though it is over-the-top. So if ""Shaun of the Dead"" was too violent, you may want to skip this one. And if you haven't seen ""Shaun of the Dead"", you should really check it out before going to see ""Hot Fuzz"". You will appreciate it much more. ""Hot Fuzz"" is an incredibly entertaining film. You will enjoy yourself so much, you just might explode.****1/2",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

does for action films what Shaun did for the zombie sub-genre,"Sergeant Angel (Simon Pegg) is good at his job, TOO good.

Just as having a good knowledge of the zombie horror genre, increased how much one appreciated the great ""Shaun of the Dead"", as is true with a good knowledge of action movies to ""Hot Fuzz"".

Beware the living statue!,"When I first watched this film I remember enjoying it a lot, but it seems to have lost something as I watched it for the second time, perhaps it's because the first time was at the cinema?Interestingly, Nick Frost gives the best performance for me, whereas he usually annoys me, he came across better than Simon Pegg, who only started to appeal when his character finally started to relax, which I suppose was the point.I did love the duo of Andy's played by Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall, especially with their sexy 70's porn star tache's.There are some very clever moments including the music choices when Timothy Dalton is on screen and Rory McCanns character ""Yarp!""
However I can always do without Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan.It's still an enjoyable film and my preference over 'Shaun Of The Dead'. I haven't seen 'The World's End', because it just looked so awful, so I cannot comment on that, but I'd say it's likely that 'Hot Fuzz' is the best of the Cornetto Trilogy.The ending is actually pretty epic, you can tell that Edgar Wright, Pegg & Frost are huge film fans and what they produce is only ever an homage to what has gone before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
I don't use this word lightly- this is a masterpiece,"Hot Fuzz is directed by Edgar Wright, who also directed Shaun of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim, Baby Driver, and others. Like all of his movies, Hot Fuzz is fast-paced, quick-witted, and excellently edited. The cinematography and editing are fantastic, pulling you into the movie and making you want to watch more and more.This is the best cop movie I have ever seen. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost kill it as the two leads, but all of the actors are fantastic. You can tell how much thought went into the casting, as there are even easter eggs throughout the movie relating to why certain people were cast. These subtle details are a perfect example of why this movie is so great. Everything was planned perfectly, down to the most minute detail.The best part about this movie is the writing. Unlike many movies, there is not a single line of dialogue in this movie that goes to waste. Every single line in this movie from every character either foreshadows something in the future or calls back to something previous in the movie. It's pure genius, and it makes this movie infinitely re-watchable. There are so many details, secrets, and easter eggs to keep an eye out for that you will pick up something new every time you watch the movie.This movie is not just a hilarious buddy cop movie. Every detail of this movie was intricately planned for maximum effect, so even if you took out all the comedy from this movie, it would still be fantastic. The comedy just adds to the enjoyment even more, and the movie is all the better for it. Without a doubt, this movie is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Very Funny!,"I love Hot Fuzz! It was a great story about be committed to your job, but don't get so committed to the point you neglect your friends. The story was also about how murder is really unjust and way too cruel, and because of sin like murder that is why there needs to be the law, and police officers to enforce it because police officers bring justice, and peace. There was a lot of really funny scenes. The action was cool, but could've been a little cooler since you mostly heard the cool sounding gunshots, but didn't see the cool muzzle fire. The other corrections I'd make is there was way too much appalling foul language, and really disgusting gore. But overall, I still absolutely loved the movie; Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are two great actors who did great that their roles in this film, and the suspense, and the mystery of the story definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. Therefore, Hot Fuzz is an awesome film! Have a great day, and gooo Hot Fuzz!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Tedious nonsense..........,"First, at 121 minutes ""Hot Fuzz"" seems endless. Second, it plays like two separate movies. The first part is set up quite nicely with a big city cop being transferred to a sleepy little countryside village, because he is so good at his job that he makes the rest of the department look inefficient. After arriving in the small village, all of his fears about such a little hamlet having no meaningful police work seem well founded. Soon however, a series of what initially appear to be accidents, begin to arouse the new sergeant's suspicion that a murderer or murderers may be on the loose. Though there are moments of dark comedy within the story, the second part (final hour) is nothing more than ""cartoon-like"" violence, which becomes tedious and drags the entire film down to the level of total nonsense. Not recommended. - MERK",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"droll, funny, but also very satiric film","This movie, from the creators of Shawn of the Dead, plows some of the same territory, but adds some acerbic social commentary to the mix. It is a clear homage to the buddy cop movies which have proliferated over the past 20 years, but it is also a comment on the sometimes corrosive, excessive, civic pride, almost incestuous in its intense devotion to all things local, in England specifically in this case, but it could be translated to other communities anywhere. It is very very funny and pointed, but this satire was not at all hinted at in the movie's marketing. The tribute to the banal buddy buddy cop movies of the last while is sometimes so broad and obvious that it is sometimes almost a re-make, but that said, it is nice that someone (director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg, who co-wrote the movie with Wright) recognize the pervasiveness of the genre. The story is that London police officer Nicholas Angel (a rather playful and unlikely name played by writer Simon Pegg) is exiled to the countryside because of his overly industrious ways and the fact that his industriousness revealed the laziness of the police. Once out in the countryside, he disrupts the routine of small town life by cracking down on small-time crime. He also, however, investigates a series of gruesome murders which the locals attempt to downplay but which he believes (correctly) are related. In so doing, he treads on the toes of many of the locals who have lived there for a long time and who feel they have some claim on the life of the community, to a much more literal extent than he might have anticipated. The acting is fine. No great performances are required. The satiric script drives the film and it is a very intriguing and clever plot. It is an interesting and amusing film with more layers to it than is suggested by the marketing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"Not as good as Shaun of the Dead, but still fun","Kind of a disappointment after Shaun of the Dead, but still worthwhile. It certainly is entertaining, after all. Wright's and Pegg's previous film took on zombie films, this one takes on cop movies. The creators follow much the same formula as they did with Shaun of the Dead: they hit upon all the clichés, but add extra layers to the characters and the situation that allow an audience to appreciate it as more than just a comedy. I just don't think this one is as successful. The friendship (again between Pegg and co-star Nick Frost) is fairly poignant, but the rest of the plot is so silly that the emotions don't register nearly as well. Plus, these characters, unlike Shaun's characters, didn't strike me as real people trapped in an absurd movie plot. They're silly characters, albeit with a little more character than the normal comedy (or cop movie), stuck in a silly movie. Don't get me wrong, though, the film has some hilarious comic moments. The over-the-top climax, which plays like a Sergio Leone film, is a lot of fun, and the solution to the mystery that is presented is especially clever. Once again, Pegg and Frost give wonderful comic performances. A lot of the supporting performances are good, too (unlike Shaun, which has a couple of useless characters and a couple of just plain annoying characters), including Timothy Dalton as a creepy grocery store manager.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"One of the best action, comedy, parody films I've ever watched","I've always been loved the British cinema. This film is just the verification.I don't know where to start from. From Simon Pegg (which I really love)? From the great plot? From the tons of laughs that gave me?First of all, I really like Simon Pegg's work. I met him in ""Mission Impossible"" franchise and from that time I knew that I wanted to see more of him and his filmography. I like his Britishness! In this film I like how he portrays the strict person, so strict that is fully comedic.As I've said, the plot was really great. First because it was actually a parody of all the American action films, that we over-watched in the past and this conspiracy thing was also great.It's also a very funny film. It does contain gore, quiet splattery, but the blood looks really fake, so I don't think that someone would disgust. Besides, all the violence is represented in a comic form.I also like that a professional policeman goes to a peaceful village, where mysterious murders are committed, so he tries to solve that mystery that the naïve residents don't think that are actual murders, but accidents!Authentic plot. Great acting. Really funny. Successful parody.I really can't find any flaws. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Funnier again than Shaun of the Dead,"If you liked Shaun of the dead then you will love this. The movie was filled throughout with outrageous events and both subtle and slapstick humour. Whilst everyone watching had a few good belly laughs they don't run continuously into one another. Also, there is no great character build up for the two main cops, Angel & Butterman other than Angel is obsessed with being a cop and Butterman likes to watch videos. Your left then to enjoy the acerbic sense of humour and the violent demise(shown in graphic detail) of the many victims of the killer. This was however more than enough for me to thoroughly enjoy the film. I'll certainly look out for the next Edgar Wright comedy to see if he improves again on the formulae.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Yarrp?  Narrp!!,"In the IMDb top 250? I don't think so. This is a film that starts out bloody hilarious but ten suffers from serious genre identity crisis. It veers between serious and comic and goes on for way too long, like 45 minutes too long, while it is still deciding what it wants to be. Simon Pegg was hilarious and absolutely deadpan through out. The supporting cast around him was great too. There were some moments of comic genius - By the Power of Greyskull! Yarrp, Narrp? The police force of Sandford had me in stitches but the cloak and dagger mystery was just too much Arsenic and Old Lace style.A shorter, snappier, less serious version would be a masterpiece but this one became tedious and took itself too seriously in the end. All in all I would say that this was a film would test the patience of your behind unless you were lying in bed while watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Seriously overrated despite impressive technical details,"First of all, how this movie has found its way in the top250 on this site is beyond me. But let's not bring out the axe yet, there are some positive things to mention about this flick.The camera work, editing and originality are top notch and really impressed me. It speeds up like a MTV music video in the right spots to not let seconds and minutes go to waste in parts of the story that are not essential, though you still catch all that is going on. Very impressive work and I applaud that.The story in the movie is a standard one - hardened and tough city cop gets - against his will I might add - transfered to the rural area of his country, a small village full of ""standard"" rural movie characters; the majority are simply uneducated, ignorant and stupid people, especially the local police force.Now to the bad stuff: the manuscript, the twists and the movie as a whole. There are two movies in the history that I have never, ever finished watching because it got so bad, it felt like a true waste of time finishing watching. Casshern was the first, Hot Fuzz sadly placed as my second.Seriously. When you watch a movie and you acceleratingly just sigh, shake your head and say to yourself ""Now what in the lord were they thinking when they decided to do it like this?"", it's bad. I won't go into details, but story-wise I was not entertained (except for a few moments) when I tried watching, it was more the frustrating way because the characters were so non-believable and the story got more and more aggravating the longer it grew.The movie was simply surreal (in a bad way) and cheap. Not in its budget, but in its performance. You can't make a good movie with a crappy manuscript where everything is built on silly prejudices and where the twists and explanations are just pitiful. The movie simply fell apart to pieces.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

It would be probably be best to watch this before watching any of those movies, just so that you can recognize the absurdity in those movies. We get to see the quirkiness of the small town as well as the stuffiness of the London cop. But most importantly, the movie poses the question of how any seemingly perfect place came to be perfect.

An Absolute Delight From Edgar Wright & Simon Pegg,"A high-spirited buddy-cop actioner that embraces & lampoons its genre in equal measure, the second instalment in Edgar Wright's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy finds him & Simon Pegg trying their hands at a different genre after revitalising the zombie apocalypse horror comedy in their previous venture. And just like before, the result is a rewarding one, for Hot Fuzz is hilarious, gripping, enjoyable & entertaining from the get-go.Co-written & directed by Wright, the story concerns an overachieving cop who's reassigned to a small, peaceful village that harbours a dark secret. Exhibiting all the cliches & tropes of the genres it dives into, the film begins on a riotous note, gets more riveting as it progresses and then ups the ante to the max in the finale to offer a stylishly directed, frenetically paced, feverishly edited, intelligently witted, gleefully violent & wildly rambunctious ride.Effortlessly balancing the elements of comedy, action, thriller & mystery from start to finish without ever losing its sense of fun, the film manages to immerse us into its absurd premise with ease and as before, it's the characters & performances that leave the best impression. Simon Pegg is terrific as a city cop in a rural setting, his chemistry & rapport with Nick Frost churning out the goods once again. The final act is where things go full tilt but it won't work for everyone.Overall, Hot Fuzz is a fascinating mix of kinetic direction, smart writing & top performances that presents both Wright & Pegg in splendid form and is by all means a winning effort from the talented duo. There is a refreshing quality to it despite the familiar beats and there isn't one lethargic moment in the whole picture. A confidently crafted buddy-cop action comedy that's unabashed in its approach & execution and is also consistent in its delivery of laughs, Hot Fuzz is an absolute delight.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Murder improves a town???,"Does murder improve a town? Well if you've seen this movie,then you know the answer. This is another funny British film filled with blood and violence starring Simon Pegg. He plays a no nonsense cop, Angel, whom gets transferred to a small town. One of the first people he arrests is his partner. The town he goes to is known for having the lowest crime rates, but lots of accidents. Soon towns people beginning turning up dead in some very gruesome ways. Angel suspects murder, but some insists on calling them accidents. When the reporter has that steeple fall on his head, that was so gross, and funny in a very weird/wrong kind of way. They even played a little of the Omen music before hand.There's a lot of jokes throughout.

"A bit of a disappointment, unfortunately","After the hype around this movie, all the critical acclaim, the movie's position among IMDb's Top 250 (something one always should take with a grain of salt) and the fact that everything Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright had done since ""Spaced"" was brilliant, I expected a lot from this film. Unfortunately, ""Hot Fuzz"" couldn't really match my expectations. Wright and Pegg have become masters at writing comedy. From the beginning there are many funny lines of dialog as well as clever visual jokes. The problem is that from the get go all these jokes are also combined with over the top-editing and hectic sound effects. I am aware of the fact that this is supposed to be a parody of all the ""classic"" Bruckheimer action movies that are edited just like that, but it still was annoying and took away a lot from the comedy.About halfway through the movie murders start to happen and Pegg's and Wright's soft spot for the horror genre shines through once again with some nifty splatter scenes. Of course, those scenes seem a bit out of place in a parody of buddy movies, but oh well, they were entertaining enough. The final act, however, is where this movie starts to fall apart. This is where even in ""Shaun Of The Dead"" things got a bit too serious. The problem in ""Hot Fuzz"" is that Pegg and Wright decide to just go along with a completely ridiculous explanation for the murders and have a big shoot-out. More annoying editing and sound effects are added and then, in true Peter Jackson-fashion, the movie ends about three times too often. Again, I am fully aware that the ridiculousness of the plot, the over the top finale and the multiple endings are all trademarks of the movies that are being parodied here, but one wished that the ending would have been executed a bit more thoughtfully, because it's not hilarious-silly, it's just silly.There's an episode of ""Spaced"" where Tim and Daisy have a pretended shoot out with some street gang. This time Wright and Pegg could afford to shoot the same thing with real looking weapons and blood. The thing is, it was a lot funnier when it was only make believe.""Hot Fuzz"" isn't awful by any means. In fact it's a highly entertaining movie with a lot of original ideas and a great cast. I do hope, however, that Wright and Pegg structure the third act of their movies more carefully in the future and tame down the brute silliness in some places without losing their edge.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Excels as a parody and what it parodies,"With Shaun of the Dead, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg showed us the talent they possessed. Three years later, they came back with Hot Fuzz as the second installment of their unofficial Cornetto trilogy which is just as good or even better.Hot Fuzz follows Nicholas Angel, a skilled police officer who gets transferred to Sandford and slowly uncovers a dark secret behind the village.As Shaun of the Dead was a parody of zombie films, Hot Fuzz is a parody of cop action films and manages to be better than many of them. It's able to combine serious and comedic tones so perfectly. The film is bursting with witty humour that's not just limited to its dialogue and performances. Edgar Wright uses many aspects of filmmaking for the build up and pay off of jokes whether that be the sleek editing or clever use of the visuals. I love the amount of detail he puts into his films and it enhances the experience every rewatch as I discover a new detail, joke or reference to a classic action film in the film. Aside from the great comedy, Hot Fuzz works extremely well in terms of its action as well. The signature editing style we've all come to love in Wright's films adds a great amount of suspense, tension and entertainment to the film. It moves at a quick pace like an action film making the 2 hour runtime feel much shorter. The characters are very memorable and well realised by the end. The violence is over the top and gory but at the same time it works for a film that's so self-aware like this.Simon Pegg is simply marvellous here. From playing a slacker in Shaun of the Dead to being a serious, no-nonsense police officer here, Pegg shows his range as an actor and conveys the character traits of Nicholas Angel to the best of his ability. Alongside him we have Nick Frost who is really fun to watch. He's lovable, has excellent comic timing and plays a great contrast to Pegg's role. The person who really surprised me here was Timothy Dalton. Wright and Pegg do many interesting things with his character and it's evident how much Dalton relishes this role. His expressions and way of delivering dialogues is amazing. He's easily one of the best parts of the film.Hot Fuzz is another triumph for Edgar Wright. Even though, out of the three, I've seen this film the least amount of times, there's so many aspects in terms of the technicals, writing and performances to appreciate. Every single part of this film is meticulously crafted down to the smallest of details making Edgar Wright one of the best directors working today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

The best movie in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy.,"Funny, charming and entertaining - Hot Fuzz is one of the best buddy cop and action movies ever made. It succeeds in every aspects and certainly not everything would even work if it wasn't for Edgar Wright's direction. The story, characters, dialogue, cinematography, editing, sound, directing and huge percent of the music is done so well, but like every movie in existence: it's not perfect at all. If i have to list the negatives, they are very small, but i still have to mention them. To be clear, those negatives are not all that huge to break or hurt the movie, because they can be easily forgiven and will not distract everyone from the experience:The negatives:The music is good and huge percent of it fits so perfectly in many scenes, but to be honest, even thought i liked the music, i wouldn't buy it digitally or on CD, because it's one of those soundtracks that is not great when you listen it on it's own and it does have some tracks that are ok and not memorable.Towards the end there is a car chase, which is combined with a shoot-out. The way it was edited was way too much, even thought the whole movie has fast editing, because of the amazing style of Edgar Wright, but it did cut from shot to shot so many times at that moment and it was the only time, that i didn't like it all that much.Even with those flaws, i still recommend it to everyone, including fans of action movies to watch it.

May be the best comedy of 2007,"Despite a glut of critical accolades, ""Shaun of the Dead"" struck me as an uneven parody/homage of George Romero's zombie films--the premise was well-executed, the carnage grisly, and the laughs sort of infrequent. I don't know, perhaps it was my own bias toward a bunch of Brits sending up Romero's VERY American films (and the subsequent humor being skewed in the vein of the former) that kept the film from being all it could have been. The good news with ""Hot Fuzz"" is that it's not only a fine rebound from ""Shaun,"" but possibly the best comedy of 2007. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), London's finest boy in blue, is reassigned to the small idyllic town of Standford after his superior officer claims he's making the rest of the force ""look bad""; Standford comes across as a squeaky-clean village where a missing swan commands police priority, but when a string of gruesome ""accidents"" claim the lives of several citizens, Angel gets suspicious. Whereas ""Shaun""'s setting seemed to work against it, co-writers Pegg and Edgar Wright (who also directed) strike up a balanced script that takes aim at the Michael Bay/Kathryn Bigelow school of Hollywood cop flicks (""Bad Boys II"" and ""Point Break"" figure wonderfully into the plot), all the while acknowledging the absurdity of rapid-fire shootouts taking place in the English countryside (the last half hour is a jaw-dropping, hilarious tribute to quick-cutting and over-the-top action). The chemistry between Pegg and Nick Frost (who plays Angel's naive partner) is excellent, a comedic collaboration that grows richer with each film; and the supporting cast of British veterans is well-chosen, from Billie Whitelaw to Edward Woodward, Jim Broadbent and even former James Bond Timothy Dalton (as a shady supermarket manager, of all things). My only complaint would be an overlong run time that hurts the otherwise strong momentum, but even so, ""Hot Fuzz"" is a winner.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"A strange mixture of comedy, action and horror, that works for the most part.","Edgar Wright's last film ""Shaun of the Dead"" was a horror movie, and a comedy, but more than anything it was a comedy. There were tense scenes, but the more often than not, the comedy prevailed. Here, it's hard to tell what the heck this is. It's good, but it's a weird kind of good caught in genre limbo, never really knowing what the heck it is. It's a black comedy at times, and sometimes is as tense an action flick as you could find. Then there's the horror. The shady villain ready to decapitate his or her enemies, but the violent images cause laughter. Where most movies have a consistent mood, like an action-comedy, which is full of shooting, but with a wink to the camera, this jumps around. For 30 minutes straight it will be pure nail biting action with very little comedy, before switching to downright jokey scenes. It's good...just weird.Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a hotshot cop who does his job well and by the book. He's making all his fellow officers look bad, so they force him to be reassigned to ""winner of best village of the year"", Sandford. Nick hates how little his fellow officers in Sandford seem to care about anything. He's paired with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), son of Police Chief Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Things are pretty boring, and are limited to speeding tickets and underage drinking until a series of violent murders occurs. Secrets are revealed, leading to an odd, yet original ending.Edgar Wright has a fast paced style of direction that looks good but can grow tiring. Some scenes needed to be played out to build suspense, but instead drop the suspense and let the action happen right away. Constant cut to's and flashy quick shots are reminiscent of Joel Schumaker's ""masterpiece"" ""Batman & Robin"". This movie really shouldn't be compared to a movie like that though. Even with the flashy direction, this was a fine British flick.The acting is good. The chemistry is great between Pegg and Frost, who are written quite different from their characters in ""Shaun of the Dead"". Timothy Olymphant is excellent in the supporting cast, and manages to be constantly both funny and menacing. The cast mostly consists of many English actors that cause people to say, ""I've seen their face, don't know where, don't know their name."" Several unnamed British actors play backup roles, and they give everyman (or woman) performances that fit in nicely.Overall, this movie has no genre. It jumps around which doesn't always work. But what does work is the acting and the story. Even if this may cause a slight headache due to quick cuts, it's still a funny and action filled comedy triumph for Edgar Wright.My rating: *** out of ****. 120 mins.

"Funny, smart, and thrilling, Hot Fuzz is a masterful send-up/salute to the American cop movie","In 2004, Simon Pegg and Edger Wright unleashed Shaun of the Dead, a gory, over the top parody of the zombie genre which delighted critics and audiences alike. Now, with Hot Fuzz, they've done the same for the buddy-cop genre. And they've made a film even better than their first. They've packed in more action, more laughs, and somehow, even more gore.Hot Fuzz stars co-writer Simon Pegg as Sergeant Nick Angel, London's best cop. So good in fact, he makes everyone else look bad by comparison. Thus he receives a less than welcome to be transferred to England's most crime free town and is partnered to the most inept officer in all the United Kingdom. (Nick Frost.) Before long though, a series of grizzly deaths sweeps the village. The local cops shrug them off as accidents, but Nick is convinced that the deaths and connected, and that he knows who's at the bottom of it. But the conspiracy may run much deeper, and be far more ridiculous than he could ever imagine.Like Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz works largely by collecting every cliché of the genre, and then dialing it up to eleven. And I do mean every cliché, including but not limited to: the woefully mismatched partners who eventually become the best of friends; the by the book big city officer who alienates his small town counterparts with his insistence that everything be done properly; the endless shoot-outs in which hundreds of rounds are fired but only the guys can hit anything; the high speed chases filled with jumps, 1800 turns, and near misses; the cop with a theory no-one believes in; and lots of massive, gratuitous explosions. And just in case you thought of any I didn't mention, don't worry, they're lampooned as well.And are they ever lampooned! For instance, at one point Angel and his partner engage in an adrenaline pumping foot chase down alleys, through backyards, and over fences, encountering every manner of obstacle- to catch a shoplifter. It's ridiculous, and yet they manage to play it totally straight, with as much action and heart pounding music as if they were after a killer. And that shoot out I mentioned involves nearly every single person in the entire town, right down to the doctor and the priest. And throughout, the level of gore and melodrama are ratcheted up well into the realm of absurdity. The reporter's death in particular is on par with Reservoir Dogs' infamous ear scene. This movie proves beyond a doubt that over the top action can be funny on purpose- take that Michal Bay! But Hot Fuzz isn't just a satire of cop movies; Pegg and Wright have managed to pay homage to some of their favorites while spoofing them at the same time. Nor is all of the film's comedic potential derived from deliberate overstatement. It also effectively utilizes a good deal of screw ball, fish out of water, and old fashioned slapstick, as well as a fair amount of humor relating to some of the village's more odd residents, such as the totally incomprehensible old farmer. Add in some clever (and sometimes dirty) wordplay and gut busting plot twists, and you have a very well rounded comedy.Of course Hot Fuzz is also an action movie, and a very good one at that. The gunfights, especially the final one, are beautifully staged, the pyrotechnics are first rate, and the fight scenes are both brutal and hysterical. The supermarket showdown is a real treat, as is the brawl in the miniature town. The chases, both vehicular and on foot are top notch as well, delivering both action and laughs. Note should also be taken of the acting. Pegg and Frost's chemistry from their previous films is fully intact, and Timothy Dalton puts in a wonderfully suave yet creepy performance as the town grocer.Quite simply, Hot Fuzz is one of the funniest, smartest, most action packed, most original, and all around brilliant comedies that Britain (or any other country) has produced in years. If you liked Shaun of the Dead, you'll love this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Shaun of the Bad Boys,"A good spoof movie takes the movies it spoofs literally. They show love for the movies they caricature! And this is the case here, too! Coming hot from the Shaun of the Dead success (I personally haven't seen their popular Spaced series), the boys here again aim and hit their targets!This time the action movie genre is the mark. And as with Shaun (which had the object of the zombie/horror movies), this one does not hold back. So while this is a comedy, it is indeed not something for the kids or faint of heart! Explicit violence is shown (in a blackly funny way of course, but that's not everyone's taste/liking)!Apart from the funny cast, the story/script is very well drawn out! I recommend this to anyone who likes their comedies, to be black and great! ;o)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Oh wow....,"I had seen Shaun of the Dead and I loved it. When I hear that the same guys were coming out with a new movie I just couldn't wait. And the result is great. A fast pace, British comedy at it's very best. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost show yet again great teamwork as they have done before in Spaced and Shaun of the Dead. This movie is a bit slow going in the beginning but when the action begins it really goes nuts. I haven't laughed so hard in the theater since I saw Borat last year. So if you loved Shaun of the Dead or just want to see some great comedy this is the stuff for you, although its not good for the squeamish one. 10 out of 10, with out a doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Great Movie. Much better than I thought it would be...,"This movie was surprisingly good and very funny.I liked the style of the movie and thought it was actually well directed too.Well worth seeing - Much better and funnier than Shaun of the Dead in my opinion...The ending was a bit lame though, but I guess that was always going to be the case...I think the movie was also a bit too long...Definitely go and see the movie - if you love British comedy you really won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Not a lot of fuzz about nothing...,"Take London's top cop, whose arrest rate is embarrassing his bosses, and send him to a soporific, apparently crime free, Gloucestershire village where he can embarrass no more. Okay, it's maybe not the most inspiring, or indeed plausible basis for a film but it should be remembered whose hands Hot Fuzz is in. Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright and Nick Frost are fast becoming something akin to the Holy trinity of contemporary British comedy. With two series of the Channel Four sitcom Spaced and the rib-splinteringly funny Shaun of the Dead under their collective belt they appear to have their chosen vocation pretty much nailed.Hot Fuzz is to the police movie what Shaun of the Dead was to horror - an unrelenting parody, littered with references to the best and worst of crime-fighting on screen. It brings together the cream of Britain's current comedy pantheon. There are outings for Oscar-winning Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan, Bill Bailey and the actor Kevin Eldon. There are also welcome appearances from Edward Woodward and the joyfully over-acting former 007, Timothy Dalton. For his part, Pegg plays the exiled London bobby Sergeant Nicholas Angel, ordered to what seems to be the sleepiest of sleepy backwaters. There he's partnered with Nick Frost's asinine PC Danny Butterman. As he battles for acceptance from his newly acquired (and somewhat less than welcoming) peers, including the brutishly brilliant Paddy Considine, we learn that all is not as it seems in this provincial idyll. A series of gruesome ""accidents"" point to something altogether quite, quite sinister. All of Nick Angel's skills are surely going to be put to the test. Oh the irony...What develops is one of the most farcical, preposterous films around. But for all its utter ridiculousness, it's very, very entertaining and very, very amusing. Rapid-fire, superbly written humour and some very rapid editing ensure there's little opportunity to let the mind dwell on any potential flaws. It's perhaps not as consistently funny, and so maybe not quite as consistently good as Shaun of the Dead but it remains incredibly enjoyable. There are moments which will surely be laughed at over and over again. And that's perhaps what Hot Fuzz calls for most - to be watched more than once. It's well worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time,"It goes without saying that parody movies can be pretty hit and miss. While some of them can be genuinely funny, many of the more recent ones tend to fail mostly because they are nothing more than strings of jokes that seem to imply that the filmmakers have a near complete disdain for whatever is being parodied. These filmmakers can learn a lot from Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright and their latest film, ""Hot Fuzz."" While it is a great parody of action movies in general and buddy cop movies in particular, the fact that it's a parody isn't what makes it one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. That is all due to a sharp and witty script, a coherent yet absurd murder mystery plot that takes itself seriously enough to draw the viewer in yet not enough to forget how ridiculous it really is, and an obvious love for the movies it parodies instead of a disdain for them.The plot centers around Nicholas Angel, a tough London police officer who is apparently so good that he makes the rest of his force look bad by comparison. Basically, he's the kind of unstoppable supercop that cheesy action movies are all about. Unfortunately for him, his peers get tired of him making all of them look bad, so they transfer him to the picturesque and practically crime-free town of Sanford to get rid of him. Needless to say, Angel is not happy with this change, especially when he meets the lazy, dimwitted slackers that make up Sanford's police department. They seem to be far more interested in going to the pub than investigating crime scenes, so they naturally take offense to the uptight Angel and his desire to crack down on all manner of crime (which he does the night he arrives in town even before he officially joins the police force). His only real friend on the force seems to be Danny Butterman, his overweight, clumsy partner who has watched way too many action films. Danny thinks being a big-city cop is all car chases and shootouts just like in the movies he loves, so naturally he's in awe of the tough Angel, even though he is told that being a police officer in the city isn't what he thinks it is. When it becomes clear that people seem to die all the time in grisly and bizarre ""accidents,"" Angel immediately suspects foul play, even though the rest of the police department is too stupid and/or lazy to follow up with an investigation.The main murder mystery plot is (mostly) played straight even when it's at its most absurd. The humor, much like in Edgar Wright's previous film ""Shaun of the Dead,"" lies with the characters and their reactions to what is happening around them. Simon Pegg does a great job portraying Nicholas Angel as a nearly humorless, uptight, by-the-book police officer who grows increasingly frustrated by the incompetence of his peers. He clearly isn't happy unless he's solving a crime and arresting someone, and it's a lot of fun to watch him scowl and slow-burn at the apparent ignorance that plagues the Stepford-like citizens of Sanford. It's also impossible not to like Nick Frost as Danny Butterman. He has a childlike enthusiasm for the kind of two-fisted heroics that he believes he will be a part of as Angel's new partner. His friendship with Angel also makes for a sweet subplot as we see the uptight Angel slowly start to warm to Danny. The rest of the cast is spot-on as well, with the standout being Timothy Dalton as a sinister supermarket owner who chews the scenery at every opportunity. He's clearly having a lot of fun playing what can best be described as a classic mustache-twirling villain.If I can find any fault with this movie, it's that it sometimes moves rather slowly. Much of the humor is in the portrayal of the characters and in the clever dialog, so much of it might not appeal to viewers who like lots of explosions and car chases. It must also be said that if you are one of those people, rest assured that the third act of the film more than makes up for it. Without giving too much away, I can say that the movie goes from a comedy/murder mystery into a series of completely insane and gleefully over-the-top action scenes that spoof practically every action movie cliché ever put on screen. In fact, I would recommend seeing this movie for the last thirty minutes alone.I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I heard that the writers and director of ""Shaun of the Dead"" were making it. ""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of my favorite movies, and I didn't think this could top it. Therefore, it means a lot when I say that ""Hot Fuzz"" beats ""Shaun"" hands down.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Phomenal fun,"Not landmark cinema, not a cultural milestone, but as a ""cut above the rest"" film, Hot Fuzz is great.The film's basically a buddy cop movie with the very British twist of a seemingly pleasant village in the English countryside. The humour, as with Shaun of the dead, just keeps on coming. The dialogue, whilst not quite as snappy as in Shaun of the Dead, was excellent.There's a superb balance between subtle/in-your-face comedy, and between seriousness/silliness. On the serious note, there are a couple of mildly scary scenes, and a couple of extremely gory moments, especially one hysterically violent moment involving a church wall that had me in stitches. The action sequences, too, are superb, and this kind of multi-tasking from the creators was very refreshing. The final shoot-out is great fun.Performance-wise, Simon Pegg once again proves that he is a hugely capable actor. The whole cast was perfect.So, Hot Fuzz. It's the kind of film Snakes on a Plane should've been. Whilst both films are hugely enjoyable, Hot Fuzz is just more polished on every level, and definitely one I'll be seeing again. Not Godard, but far, far above all the sub-standard bull that's clogging up cinemas today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Will it ever end??,"Yes, it ended, right after 1 hour and 20 minutes when I pressed the eject button. The horse was beaten, it was dead before they started. And it was already completely drained of fluids after an hour or so.There are some jokes but never really hilarious ones. The pacing and loudness requires you to be a pro-movie watcher to sustain it. My ears are still ringing.I Didn't see Shaun of the dead and I don't think I will if it bares any resemblance to this marathon of rehashed oneliners.Not completely unfunny but somehow misses the mark completely and in any case about 70 minutes too long.Don't be fooled by the high rating, it may be a film for you but its ranking shouldn't be higher than the sequel to the first Naked Gun.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
American filmmakers take note - This is a hysterical parody done right,"When I first heard about Shaun of the Dead in 2004, I was a bit skeptical. It sounded intriguing, but so many parodies had come and gone and very little of them were actually good. So when I randomly went and saw the flick, I was more than just impressed. I was ecstatic. It was a breath of fresh air, and a very funny movie. And when I picked up the DVD, it only got better.So when I first heard they were going to do a parody of the buddy cop/action genre, I got a little excited. And after seeing it, I can say that the excitement was well warranted.Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a by-the-books veteran police officer in London. He lives for stopping crime, and works non-stop. But the devoted officer is not so well liked by his peers, who, for lack of better terminology, are looking particularly terrible in comparison to him. So the higher-ups (which include a very amusing Bill Nighy) decide that something must be done, and send him to a small village with a non-existent crime rate. Here, his skills are seemingly wasted, and his action-movie obsessed partner, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) is a bit too eager to hear about his high speed, shoot-'em up days in London. But when a bizarre string of accidents begin to occur, Angel becomes a little suspicious of the quaint village, and begins to attempt an investigation.Yes, it sounds a bit more complicated than Shaun, but is it as much fun?Just about.Pegg and his co-writer/director Edgar Wright have composed what is probably the funniest and most honest parody of American action films  and it was not even made in America. Everything from the awkward partnership, the homoerotic tension, the friendly supporting characters who do not appear to be all that they seem, a ridiculous villain, overbearing Neanderthal-esquire henchmen, and more, are all on display and are each given at least one moment to shine during the film. Think of every cliché and every element that makes action movies action movies, and you will have a pretty accurate description of what you will find in Hot Fuzz.The writing is sharp and quick-witted. Just as fast paced as the editing, you may find it hard to catch everything these characters are throwing at each other. You will either be laughing far too hard from the line before, or it will just come and go so fast that you will sit and think ""What did he say?"" Every line comes off excellently, and the nods and homages to other films' dialogue is just so subtle that it may go completely unnoticed. They just work it in that well. Much like Shaun, the pair use the elements given from the films they are parodying, but they use these elements lovingly, and sparingly. They make the material their own, and use it in a very fresh way (unlike the classless American parody films like Date Movie and Hostel where they basically rip scenes directly out of other films, without making any changes, and call them parodies).As said previously, the editing is very fast paced. Scenes just come and go briskly. Wright has a very observant eye, and ensures that just about every detail is packed into his scenes. Unfortunately, the fast paced editing does not stay consistent. There is a very large dry spell in the middle of the film that just slows the film right down, and to a point, over analyzes a bit too much. Even more unfortunate is the fact that most of these scenes only have a few snickers or giggles that come out (from people who either think the line is really funny, or understand which film is being parodied), and nothing much else. I felt the same way when I first saw Shaun back in 2004 (although the former film also felt more consistent during these types of scenes), but felt it improved on further viewings. I can only hope that I will feel the same way when I see this film again.Pegg is absolutely hysterical. Although he is nowhere near as much of a buffoon as he was with his Shaun character, he still has the same lovable tendencies, and the same crazy attitude. He brings a certain enigmatic flair to his scenes, and his on screen presence is simply unmatched by just about anyone. Yes, his humour is dry, but it is a lot less British and much more on the brink between British and American. He plays his character along this brink for the entirety of the movie, and even when he is at his most serious, you cannot do anything but laugh.Much the same can be said for Frost, who gives another rousing performance as the even more lovable sidekick. His lines are even funnier than Pegg's, and his goofy work here helps offset the dead-pan seriousness of Pegg. While Pegg was just as good as he was in Shaun, I think Frost was a lot more downplayed and not as strong as he could have been. Despite that, his work here is still very good, and still very ahead of anyone in American parodies.The all-star supporting cast including Nighy, Martin Freeman, Timothy Dalton, Jim Broadbent, and Paddy Considine, are all very well acted, and are side-splittingly funny. Many of them do not get nearly as much screen time as they deserve, but their material is felt throughout.While it is not as good as Shaun, Hot Fuzz is still a very funny movie. I was a little surprised with how very violent the film is, but it only adds to how accurately portrayed the action genre is in the film. If you want to see parody done right, or if you just want a great time at the movies, than this is a definite must-see.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
I loved this movie!!,"Whether you love or hate the movies they are spoofing you'll love ""Hot Fuzz!!"" There has been a glut of ""spoof"" movies like ""Scary Movie"" or ""Date Movie"". The difference here is this one rides its own merits of story, character and plot while reminiscing about those great to mediocre action movies of the past without simply twisting a scene directly form those movies.Or simply: these guys are original.

Sherlock Holmes and Dudley Do-Right meet the Stepford Wives and High Plains Drifter,"Rotten Tomatoes users rates Hot Fuzz at 95% with the critics only slightly behind at 88%. IMDb is in the same ballpark at 82%, and many of the comments in both systems compliment the movie on its clever writing. These numbers are extremely high... and decidedly young: the average age of the full house we attended in East Lansing, MI: ~25.The movie starts with a montage of Nicholas Angel's (Simon Pegg) exemplary career as a London policeman. He's the James Bond of the department, with a genuine arrest record 400% above average. In fact, he's so proficient in all manner of police work the citizens love him and begin to wonder why they need so many of the others.Feeling they're being shown up, the department as a whole votes him ""off the island,"" to a burg in a remote, bucolic region. Sgt. Angel, thoroughly idealistic and committed as he is toward toe-to-toe cleanup of the city, is dismayed to be no longer wanted.But he takes it in stride and arrives in Sandford, where at first glance the harshest crime is mime statue-standing.The first pub scene is revealing: Angel introduces himself to the middle-aged couple who own the bar and orders a glass of cranberry juice. The place is packed. As Angel surveys the environment, he notices several patrons are underage. He ejects them, the bar empties, and the camera fades with him at the bar with his cranberry juice and two deflated owners.One of the patrons leaving is plastered. He tries to drive, backs up and crashes, so Angel hauls him to the town jail. Next morning, reporting to work, Angel discovers the man is no longer in jail and is, in fact, the son (Danny Butterman played by Nick Frost) of the police chief.Danny, one of the town cops, idolizes Sgt. Angel the big city crimefighter whom Danny fantasizes in such American cult-cop classics as Bad Boys and Point Break. Young Danny's weird, childlike hero-worship combined with frustrations and people conflicts on the job, exasperates Angel even further.Then people start dying mysteriously.Angel's crime detection instincts and reasoning are remarkable (Sherlock Holmes-like) and he projects another refreshing quality: complete confidence and competence in doing his job. Last time I witnessed this quality in a movie cop was in In the Heat of the Night (1967).But I saw a lot of it as a kid, and it's nice to see it again. But Hot Fuzz is too fashionable a movie to look backward: Angel develops a liking for his new #2 (""I wonder if Danny is supposed to be Sancho Panza."") and together they work to resolve the murder spree that the town leaders insist is only a string of accidents.As the truth slowly dawns, Sgt. Angel looks like the next candidate for ""a fatal collision."" Now comes the ending, which I'm not going to say anything about, except that while thoroughly entertaining it's probably too long by two.

Over-the-top entertaining crime caper,"Saw this on the 13th of this month, even though I originally planned to see another film that wasn't out yet unfortunately.I heard the hype, so I decided why not? This opens with Pegg's character, Sergeant Nicholas Angel as an over-the-top with some fast-moving camera shots policeman, who's obsessed about being as good as he possibly can at his job - such that he can never really 'switch off' and relax.He then gets transferred to the small idyllic-looking Sandford, and is partnered with an over-enthusiastic Danny Butterman, who's an action film lover and longs for the kind of high-speed car chases his favourite film characters get up to. These are later spoofed, such as Point Break and Bad Boys 2.But as the plot thickens, and the village isn't what it seems, with some very gruesome murders happening to some of the village residents, Angel investigates and is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding the deaths. There's a twist in these deaths, as you might have guessed.I have to admit, this overlong for a comedy, and a couple a few seats down from me did actually walk out about half-an-hour to the end, so those with short attention spans should probably stay clear:D It's also not hilarious as what I thought and heard it would be, but just mildly amusing in places. Think Surburban Shootout meets Heartbeat. I enjoyed it, but near the end it does get very loud with the gunfights so I thought I almost lost my hearing.I see this as a kind of parody of these action films in a way with a British twist if you like.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"First a Rom-Zom-Com, now an action-comedy?","I saw this film last night at a preview screening at the vue cinema in Romford.I must admit I was a little worried about the movie, during the first 10 minutes. There are surprisingly few laughs at the start of the film which may put some people off or cause people to expect the worst. Thankfully it does pick up soon enough though.Being a fan of Simon's, Nicks and Edgars previous work, it is impossible to not compare this to Shaun or Spaced. And although Fuzz only really shines in the second half, and I don't feel this film had as many quotable one-lines as SOTD, it does have very funny parts. Nick Frost is great as usual, and plays a very different & unique character then Ed or Mike. I did feel Pegg's character was maybe a bit too serious though, as most of the comedy was left to the village supporting characters (played by a lot of Britain's comedy stars).I think the biggest surprise was how good the action element was in the last section of the film. It really was as good as any other action film around these days, and left me wondering if Hot Fuzz was intended to primarily be an action or comedy film.One word of warning for anyone young planning on seeing the movie: some of the murder scenes are a bit gruesome. But nothing worse then in shaun.Overall a very good British comedy film,, and nice follow up to Shaun of the dead. I would gladly go again Now I just wish the guys would get on with spaced series 3!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Buddy Cop Movie Done Right,"Most people enjoy buddy cop films but a buddy cop film with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright at the helm; we get the best buddy cop film ever made. Sargent Nicholas Angel is forced to move out to the country where he has been promoted to Sargent of a village. He is not too thrilled but he soon finds himself engulfed in a murder case that the town is doing their best to ignore. The deep story is backed up by many laughs and moments this trio puts on the big screen so well.This movie plays the stereotypical buddy cop movie down to the last detail. Angel is the tough cop who is incredible at his job who is forced to pair up with an almost useless Nick Frost. These two bring their chemistry from Shaun of the Dead and bring it into this movie. Nick Frost is not as funny as he was in his previous role but he does a much better job. He is a much improved actor and shows great range in this role. Pegg on the other hand is funnier than ever. At first I hated Angel as a character, as I think I was supposed to, but he grew on me and Pegg nails it.Hot Fuzz ties absolutely everything together even better than Shaun of the Dead did. Things people say one time come back and play into the mystery. The first time you watch it you want to know who the killer is and solve the mystery. Great, but the second and third time you go back and pay attention to all the details. The details are revealed to the audience at the climax but going back and watching it again it is very satisfying.The writing is better than ever in Hot Fuzz. This movie had the laughs but the strongest aspect was the story. For a while the story wasn't really going anywhere but introducing all the characters and getting to know the village. That all changes with the shot of the guy in the black robe, face hidden, and holding an axe. I remember the first time I saw that, my jaw dropped. That was the moment the movie got real and it wasn't like Shaun of the Dead at all. The twists and turns this story take is awesome. The reveal of the murders is so satisfying. I won't spoil but Angel comes up with this whole conspiracy as to why the people got murdered but he was wrong. When the real reason is revealed it was a ""Wait, really? That's so dumb but awesome"" moment. Its brilliant but at the same time it's a little lame. For the type of movie it is I love it but I can see people being annoyed by it.The gore behind the murders is terrific. The axe and the staged car accident was creative. The explosion was awesome, the shears was disturbing, but nothing was better than the church scene. Hands down, the coolest death I have ever seen. There could have been one at the end involving the model of the church, but he didn't die, which made it ten times better. Let's just say the scene is suspenseful and it got a bit messy. I went back and watched how he died in slow motion and I don't regret it a bit.There are some jokes in this movie that are hit or miss. Aaron A. Aaronson is a subtle laugh. When Andrew has the foam mustache on his real one brings out a smile every time. The laughs were not as consistent but it wasn't needed. The backbone of the movie is the story, not the comedy. In my Shaun of the Dead review I said that Shaun if the Dead was straight up better. I still stand by that statement but Hot Fuzz had the better stories, better characters, and it got close to better gore. Shaun of the Dead had a special impact on me that left a better taste in my mouth than Hot Fuzz did, but it really isn't right to compare movies it's just a popular topic.If I had to choose some flaws I will have to call shenanigans on a lot in this movie. This is a segment I will call Reality Check. First of all, I'm pretty sure Angel could have denied the promotion if he really wanted to. I understand it is England and it may be different but the guy should have rights and be able to turn down a promotion if he wanted to. Secondly, after Angel discovers the truth behind the town I was thinking to myself that it wasn't possible. I can't say why without spoiling the entire movie but I can say that somebody would have to notice if people randomly disappeared. Before the murders Angel and Danny walk right by the guy in the black robe. The first time he is in an alley so I figured it was possible. The second time he was standing in front of a white garage door, under a light. Come on, I know Angel and Danny were drunk but they walked right by them. At the church there was no possible way for the murderer to escape due to the fact that he didn't have enough time. Finally, I think the lady would have noticed a guy in black trying to kill her. She takes it like a champ before he bleeds out. It's frustrating.Overall, Hot Fuzz is a good time. I can watch this movie anytime anywhere and it has everything I loved from Shaun of the Dead. The cinematography was very much the same along with the humor. The ending was an action packed shootout I always wanted. Hot Fuzz is awesome and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval even with the parts I don't find possible.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"With a collage of wit, action, comedy and horror, Hot Fuzz is a funtastic spoof of a genre known for its over-the-top behavior","The average American knows what an American action film is. It usually consists of throwaway plots, buddy/partner relationships, pointless sex scenes, amazing amounts of profanity, explosions, and more explosions. Of course, it gets dabbed from time to time with humor and some random romance story that has little correlation with the main plot. Of course, not ALL action films fall into this, but most do. It is a genre that has really good films (The Rock, Con Air, Die Hard, Speed, The Rundown), really bad films (Bad Boys II, Lethal Weapon 4, 2 Fast 2 Furious) and then some that are just downright ugly (Beverly Hills Cop 3, Double Team, Biker Boyz, Simon Sez). Now, we have the British creative staff behind the cult classic Shawn of the Dead providing us with their take on the genre that has garnished a lot of money but has established itself with a reputation of being mere mindless popcorn entertainment. What winds up happening is exactly like what happened with Shawn of the Dead: the spoof/satire/homage to the genre its portraying winds up becoming one of the best of its kind, better than most released recently.Hot Fuzz excels as an action film because of its funny build-up, its quite intriguing story, its ability to stay on track, excellent chemistry amongst the actors, and of course, plenty of gruesome action to sink your teeth into. Carrying the formula that propelled Shawn of the Dead, Hot Fuzz entertains you, throws you off with its plot twists, and then has you on the edge of your seat when the action picks up. It does not contain any romance or pointless sex scenes, but that's instead replaced by a dosage of horror and mystery. The pacing is fast and furious, and refuses to slow down. The references come flying (some obvious, some vague) from all directions, and then it even ends like an action filmso plug in the ears if you don't like a lot of noise.In this over-the-top spoof, we follow Nicholas Angel, (Simon Pegg) a top-notch police officer that is re-assigned because he is making everyone else look bad. That was pretty much established right from the beginning of the film. Next thing you know, he is in a rather secluded, clean, and seemingly happy town by the name of Sandford. Right from the get go Nicholas seems to be a bit paranoid and creeped-out about the mannerisms of the town, as he tries to teach the dim-witted but reliable partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). Angel's suspicious rises as a series of accidents hamper the town. Nonetheless, despite the overwhelming evidence and logic he uses, the rest of the police department isn't convinced.Following the same choppy-edited quick cuts from Shawn of the Dead, Edgar Wright does a fantastic job keeping the speed of the film fast, while leaving plenty of details, Easter eggs, and hints as to what is going to happen next. Adding to his fantastic direction are the funny visuals that can be seen in the background as the subjects in front of the camera engage in conversation. But even with the hints intact, you still don't know where the story is going, and that is thanks to the writing staff (Pegg, again, and Wrightagain). Hot Fuzz is actually a lot less predictable than Shawn of the Deadits also not as funny, but much more action-oriented.We have quite a talented staff in Hot Fuzz that extends from the creative staff to the actors. Besides the hilarious and likable Pegg and Frost, we also have Bill Nighy, Timothy Dalton, Paul Freeman, Stuart Wilson, and the Oscar-winner Jim Broadbent. While you may not know these names as well as the major Hollywood actors of today, just know that you won't get the typical stomach-churning acting present in the average action film. Hot Fuzz spends most of the movie building up using comical scenes, moments of suspense and terror; and then blows the doors down in the final moments. With a long, funny, yet satisfying shootout, a grand car chase, a tense final fight, and explosions left and right, the third act more than makes for its lack of gunfire and pyrotechnics in the first two parts of the movie.Bottom Line: While referencing and giving nods to Die Hard, Point Break, Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon, and other superb action flicks, Hot Fuzz becomes among the better action flicks in recent memory. With a plot that actually works, characters are actually dimensional, and with content that is actually smart, this film is over-the-top, gory, but maintains the quality whether blood is spewing onto the screen or not. It may require multiple viewings to actually catch all the references, but with a film this good, you won't mind. It is funny, gory, and out-of-control. The British team behind Shawn of the Dead does it again; only this time hopefully more Americans will take notice of an emerging quality force across the Atlantic Ocean. Here comes the Fuzz.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Luke-Warm Fuzz.,"Hot Fuzz is one of those films that creates a love/hate relationship with most people. Those that don't 'get it' will no doubt hate it but those that like films like this and pretty much use films like this as a cut off point for their further filmic viewing will love it. I have to admit that I am veering more towards the 'hate it' category as I've seen rather a large amount of films and can honestly say close to brainless, all action and comedic films like this are only fun every once in a while.I do, however, think it's fantastic to see Britain produce films like this and Shaun of the Dead given the state of affairs Hollywood is in what with all the sequels and remakes that are being made and what better way to make it big in the States by spoofing those action films Americans have become all too associated with. Hot Fuzz is really just a stab; it's a stab at many things. These can include minor stabs at small town police forces or full blown stabs at films that rely on ridiculous, over the top action scenes; two of which are mentioned in this film anyway (Point Break and Bad Boys 2) and two of which are referenced very cleverly to boot.Also, if you've never been a member of the police force or have never been in a small town/village police station, who knows what goes on inside? The fact the station has its own 'swear jar' and a riot gear storage cupboard that is covered in cobwebs through disuse is absolutely hilarious, as is the relaxed approach all the officers have. I especially liked the head of the CCTV thinking he had a very important job to do when really, nothing criminal happens so there's no need for him to even be there. Another clever convention that the writers included and at well spaced times was the emphasis on seemingly meaningless jobs. So many times do we see focus on Nicholas Angel (Pegg) having to deal with insignificant tasks such as recovering a lost swan or having to deal with a church fete yet they are still moulded into the plot somehow in a clever and entertaining way.If Shaun of the Dead was a parody of zombie films then like I said earlier, Hot Fuzz is a parody of Hollywood action films. The scene when Danny Butterman (Frost) shoots uncontrollably into the air from a lying position and when the chopper flies overhead in slow motion as Danny and Angel emerge from the wreckage are two scenes straight out of Point Break (1991) and Bad Boys II (2003), respectively; both of which, when they eventually occur are fantastic to watch in an oddly surreal way.On top of this, towards the end the film seems to cleverly flick between reality and fantasy. The scene in question is when after spoofing so many films in an ultra unrealistic way, the film has the audacity to turn down the chance to use a one liner and this is mentioned by Danny to Angel who replies back something like ""No, that's only in the movies."" Very funny yet playful with the testing of realism at the same time.What Hot Fuzz lacks for in brains, it makes up for in style as it cleverly switches from opening like a dramatic, cop thriller before turning to an episode of 'Inspector Morse', before morphing again into Bad Boys II and then completing its transformation when it finishes like The Wicker Man (1973). Some jokes however don't work, especially the character of Simon Skinner (Dalton). His constant references to decapitation get very tiresome very quickly and might just as well walk around with a placard saying: 'Here, I'm the bad guy' but this is cleverly played with later on as we assume the writers take us all for mugs. On the whole, if you can look past the things that make Hot Fuzz look more like an hour and a half long spoof show, you'll find a funny and at times engaging film that despite its flaws will pass the time very easily.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
It's not the comedy.,"Hot Fuzz is too long for the comedy with only few jokes (for me).I don't like the length of this movie, 2 hours for the comedy is absolutely crazy.I'm like the British style of humor like in Yes Minister or Mr. Been, but this film is boring. Too many conversation for the comedy, and action i don't know what to say. I don't like it.I saw the first 30 minutes of the film (to the murder), and it bored me so much, that i skipping slowly to the end. When i see the time indicator, that the length of movie is 2 hours i thanks myself to watch only first 30 minutes, because i will not survive other 100 minutes of this film.Conclusion is, that this is not action film for me, and what is more important its not the comedy, and if this is not the comedy, what is this?",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
It Didn't Disappoint!,"Ever since I saw the advert for Hot Fuzz in October 06, I was absolutely thrilled and could not wait until it came into cinemas. Shaun of the Dead is probably my favourite film and I couldn't wait to see more of those comic geniuses Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.It starts off a little slowly... all the jokes in the first half an hour or so I had already seen in the advert. But then it gets going.And it could not be more brilliant.The complete and utter Britishness of the film is so lovable. The same sort of goriness appears as in Shaun of the Dead, but in a similar way it's not scary... just really outrageous! Fans of Shaun of the Dead will notice the subtle references to Shaun of the Dead, which makes it easier to connect to.There are laugh out loud jokes the whole way through. Political correctness is forgotten. And there are also some ""jump out of your seat"" moments. There's a bit of everything... it's done with such care and perfection. The ending is completely unpredictable, and pretty sentimental too! All in all, Hot Fuzz is a film well worth watching, and after the brilliance of Shaun of the Dead, will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Incredibly funny,"I've watched this movie 5-6 times a year for 15 years and I still belly-laugh every time. Has withstood the test of time very well, jokes are clever, everything is paced at the same speed your brain goes so there's never any slow moments.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a fantastic team as always, similar but different chemistry to Shaun of the Dead with the same fast-paced jokes and classic British humour that we all love.It's also great to watch it again now and recognize all the newly risen faces - Olivia Colman most notably, as well as Paddy Considine.A cleverly write script with lots of throw-backs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
probably one of the funniest comedies of our time,"Simon Pegg and crew really upped their game with this brill parody of cop movies. So much so, that it doesn't mock them, but actually pays homage to the greats. Edgar Wright is at his slapstick physical comedy best here too. And in the end, it's a heart warming buddy comedy on top of it all. Every single joke in this film lands, with aplomb. A must watch for any Brit comedy fans!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
One of my all time favourites,"Hot Fuzz is the second film in Edgar Wright's 'Cornetto Trilogy' and in my opinion is the finest of all three. With some seriously well written dialogue featuring excellent subtle foreshadowing it's no wonder why this movie is so beloved. Time and time again when I return to see it once more I pick up on more and new details that I missed the previous time watching. It's certainly a movie meant to be viewed more than once.Despite being a parody of the action genre it succeeds flawlessly in its action scenes and keeps the audience gripped throughout. Furthermore, despite being 2 hours long the pacing keeps the film from being boring - especially during the final act in which the audience is treated to an episode of relentless action and a thrilling conclusion. Many people will overlook or simply miss the ingenious writing and storytelling, so if you watch this more than once pay close attention to what's going on and you'll pick up things you never knew were there. That's good writing for you!The element where Hot Fuzz shines the brightest however is the comedy. Edgar Wright is a master of visual comedy and this movie is no exception. From clever sight gags to comedic actions from the characters, the movie never disappoints. I'd argue even the sheer amount of brutal violence adds to the comedy! Personally, I feel that sight gags is a technique that many films today miss out on. Additionally, ceaseless quips and humorous lines fill the movie from the very first scene right until the end. Usually this would worry me since I prefer quality over quantity, but this film manages to achieve both. Without getting into spoilers here, even the plot itself is comedic which is an achievement by itself. The actors (which may I add were cast flawlessly) did a brilliant job making sure the writing really came alive through their performances. Everyone delivered the fun and witty dialogue excellently, and as a result me and my friends have found ourselves laughing throughout this masterpiece more times than I care to admit!One thing I think is overlooked about this movie - and also films in general - is the style and overall feel of it. This is a very distinctive movie from the editing side of things and it makes for a very entertaining watch. Unique, interesting montage sequences and dashing, stylish transitions give the film a real distinct feel to it and is something I think needs to be recognised and appreciated more often. I'm aware that other Edgar Wright movies are also cut this way, I am simply stating that his directorial style and synergy with the editing department work wonders in Hot Fuzz.I adore this movie and would highly recommend watching it if you haven't already. An absolute must-watch classic and a perfect rating from me. Do yourself a favour and bring some friends round whilst you're at it! 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Silly, dumb, stupid, daftand quite a lot of fun.","Over-hyped. Yes! Over-rated. Probably.But, for those with a quirky sense of humour (and an appreciation of small town mentality), Hot Fuzz is still loads of fun.Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, the creators of the hugely successful zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead, reunite for this rather silly, but still enjoyable tale which sees a top Met police officer, Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Pegg), transferred (thanks to his jealous colleagues) to the sleepy country town of Sandford.At first Angel is bored by the lack of action, but he is soon back in his element after several of the town-folk are killed in mysterious circumstances. Aided by PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), he sets out to discover who is responsible for the gruesome slayings.Utilising the offbeat, quick-fire comic style of Wright and Pegg's TV series Spaced, blended with the flashy editing techniques prevalent in much of today's Hollywood action movie output (which gets mercilessly mocked), Hot Fuzz is always amusing, occasionally hilarious, and eventually extremely daft.Referencing an endless array of other movies (movie geeks will have a field day spotting these) and featuring some enjoyable scenes of OTT gore and the occasional hi-octane gunfight, Wright and Co. are obviously having a great time lampooning a genre they love. Only occasionally does the humour miss the target; most of the time it hits dead centre.Perhaps the film takes a little too long to get going, but it eventually slips into gear and becomes much more enjoyable. Then, just as you think it has come to a satisfactory ending (at a point which is reminiscent of The Wicker Man), it becomes an all out OTT action flick, completely dispensing with reality and delivering one of the most ridiculous shoot-outs ever committed to film. How you process this part of the film depends entirely on your particular sense of humour (and, perhaps on your nationalityI think it helps to be English), but fans of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead are the most likely to 'get it'.Initially, I am going to rate Hot Fuzz 7/10, which I imagine many might say is not high enough. Perhaps after another viewing, with my expectations not quite so ridiculously high (thanks to the hype), my rating might go up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
British invasion of action comedies starts here! (hopefully),"Hot fuzz is a pretty darn good comedy about a super city cop transferred against his will to a small village where nothing big ever seems to happen. The super cop in question, played by Simon Pegg, is extremely competent and by the book. I was impressed at how soberly and seriously he was played without a hint of camp in sight. He could have been in any serious cop drama or action flick. The writers could have easily made him a pompous jerk but he didn't come off that way. It's the third time I see Simon Pegg in a movie and to me he's like a chameleon, I can barely recognize him each time so kudos to him. In contrast, you have all the other characters who are a bit off-kilter or eccentric. I liked most of them, particularly Timothy Dalton as a grocery store manager, but I wish the other cops had just a little more character without going into Police Academy territory. I admit having had trouble understanding some of the accents (not counting the old cop that's a joke in itself) but I'm not holding it against the film since most of the writing, with its share of profanity, was so much fun and witty. The cop played by Nick Frost eventually became likable as a slacker trying to emulate and befriend the uptight Simon Pegg. Their chemistry was wonderful and convincing as I suppose it should be since in real life they've been best friends for a long time. So you seem to have the hallmarks of a buddy cop film with a few quirks and wrenches added for spice.The directing was certainly above-par and creative. I was constantly amused by how seemingly innocuous mundane actions were made so very exciting through the cutting and sound effects. Let's mention the few surprising bloody moments that certainly reminded me of Shaun of the Dead. Not everyone will like them but I did. I found most of the jokes quite funny, although not laugh-out-loud material until the hilarious last act. That last act was just so unexpected yet logical, with such a dramatic yet comedic escalation (yes both together), that it makes you feel jubilation as it goes on. It's just very satisfying and I appreciated very much how the super cop tried to handle everything while staying true to his beliefs. A typical American buddy cop film would have made him much less ""subtle"", therefore evacuating the comedy, and would have tacked on an unnecessary love interest. Hot Fuzz seems almost like a double-headed beast since it embraces its fair lot of action film clichés while subverting them and since it's both a spoof and a homage. In final analysis though, it's just a great mix of action and comedy.Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A movie with lots of ups and downs,First off this movie looked well produced and like a classical Comedy and it started to bore me at one point because it seemed too forced.But then the movie starts becoming more and more interesting and develops into a cult movie almost and I was so glad I kept on watching after being afraid to be disappointed by a standard Comedy which it isn't. Unfortunately it falls off again in the end by too many random things happening.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

But, after an hour when i was falling asleep, the action started and the stupid scenes were explained...in a way i never expected. The laughs came and the end worth the bad start of the movie.Talking about technical aspects, the use of minimalistic editing is pretty neat and give a nimble development to the story.

Great Movie,"More great work from the writer and actors from Shaun of the Dead. Those who enjoy off the wall and often very subtle black humor will enjoy this film - those expecting a spoof movie may not as this movie is not an out an out spoof by any means - indeed it is certainly a cut above your average spoofs given such as the lame Scary Movie franchises as a result of i) better acting ii) better scripting iii) thoughtful and clever jokes. The jokes come thick and fast and you will need to watch this one at least twice to see every one. Looking forward to more work from this team.The only misgiving about this movie would be the slightly slow first half hour (slow in the sense of very little action and few laugh out loud jokes - though still some very good subtle jokes), when Simon Pegg's character is first re-located to the village of Sandford. However, in the context of the plot of the movie, this start was probably necessary in order to build up the atmosphere of the village as being sleepy and rural.All in all a class act.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Good Cop Fat Cop! Hilarious Comedy !,"Hot Fuzz, is from the maker's of 'Shaun of The Dead' basically spoof's over the top Hollywood action film's such as Point Break, Bad Boy's 2, and even manages to reference Dirty Harry, It also manages to lampoon the Clint Eastwood Western's.The film has a surprisingly large amount of gore and splatter too much in fact! this of course will satisfy all the gore-hounds out there.The cast list is impressive it's a revelation to find two time James Bond Timothy Dalton, who is cast as a shady supermarket manager, 'The Wicker Man' Star Edward Woodward in a supporting role,'Raider's of the lost ark' villain(Belloq) Paul freeman, plays the reverend, usual British acting legends Billie Whitelaw, and Jim Broadbent and Bill Nighy, also feature.

The best movie in years!,"It must be stated before all else that I am not a fan of British entertainment. I never have been. It's nothing against the British, I guess I among those who just don't get it. The distinction between this particular piece of British entertainment, a satirical action picture brilliantly titled Hot Fuzz, is although the production may be British, the target of parody is something uniquely American: the big-budget, loud, and often times not very good action picture.Like most guys in the 18-29 demographic, I find almost nothing as fun as watching a bloody, explosion-filled, and for some, headache-inducing testosterone-driven ninety minutes of excitement in a dark movie theater (although with DVD these days, it's almost just as much fun at home). Unfortunately, there's often more brains being blown up on screen than brains being put to use behind the camera. Hot Fuzz is perhaps the first action extravaganza in years to have thought, story, and characters to go along with the mayhem. Those not familiar with the staples of the genre will most likely be lost, but for those who have grown up on a steady diet of Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and the other action franchises of the last twenty years will probably be left breathless. Even my mother, who is not a fan of violent action, found it to be brilliant satire. A big part of what is be satirized is the unintentional romanticized buddy conventions of action epics, so Hot Fuzz like Edgar Wright's previous masterpiece Shaun of the Dead, often plays out like a romantic comedy. Use that logic with your girlfriend and you may have a date to the best movie in years. 10/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Too much of a good thing...,"""Hot Fuzz"" comes from the same British filmmakers who released the zombie-romantic-comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"" upon the earth in 2004. It appears that something innate within British sensibility or British wit would allow for such an amalgam to work so well.With ""Hot Fuzz"" fewer muscles seemed to be stretched, generically speaking. This film follows a by-the-book London police officer from the big city to a dismal post in a small village where no crime ever occurs. Or so it would seem.Thus setting the stage for a comedy-mystery-actioner that is frequently charming in a ""Waking Ned Devine"" sort of way and occasionally falling into ""Beverly Hills Cop"" knock-off territory. Granted there's a running joke about our main character whose never once seen a police action film or likewise shot his gun outside a moving car (et al), but much like the American films it seems to be setting in a quaint English village this flick putters along into the dreaded action length of 130 minutes (possibly thanks to former James Bond Timothy Dalton's presence). Although ""Hot Fuzz"" is great fun with dry wit and all of that Brit stuff, it overstays its welcome just like the Americans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A British Bellyful of Laughs,"British comedies remain an ilk of their own - smart, sassy, full of quips rendered so quickly that many are lost in the ether that propels the plot, and characters who often are such finely-honed parodies that they make us laugh at ourselves. HOT FUZZ is a fine example and it is a film brimming with a cast of some of England's finest talent who seem to be having as much fun as the viewing audience.Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is one of London's finest new policemen, expecting a smart career in the big city, but instead is transferred by jealous superiors (including Bill Nighy) to a little village where his rigorous training seems wasted on the sleepy town. After a first night's arrest of youthful pubsters and an inebriate driver, he reports to duty to discover the that his first 'arrest' is to be his partner PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) who just happens to be the slow son of the chief, Inspector Butterman (Jim Broadbent). The staff at the police station resembles a vaudeville team played by such fine actors as Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, Timothy Dalton etc, not exactly what Angel had in mind as a career advancing opportunity. But soon enough the threads of evil that are beneath the silly facade of the village begin to unravel and what follows is a hilarious, almost Keystone Cop attack on the loonies in this take off of an Agatha Christie plot that curdled.And that only touches the surface of this witty little farce: the innuendoes pop up out of every situation, giving the astute viewer quiet chuckles throughout the film. Hidden from obvious view are little vignettes by such luminaries as Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan, and Peter Jackson! Director Edgar Wright, who wrote the script with Simon Pegg, knows his way around the genre and the result is an hysterically funny evening's entertainment.

A Movie That Loves Movies,"This movie is an absolute blast. Edgar Wright flawlessly executes a self-aware love letter to the Action Genre.

Perfect British Satire,"I was afraid that Hot Fuzz would be a letdown - the trailers looked kind of lame, and I wasn't quite used to Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright yet. But I had read good reviews, and I absolutely loved Shaun of the Dead, so I thought I'd give Hot Fuzz a try. The trailers suck and don't even begin to do it justice - Hot Fuzz is the funniest and wittiest comedy I have seen in a long time, possibly even exceeding its predecessor.Simon Pegg is Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a spectacular cop who is so spectacular he is making his colleagues look bad. As a solution, his superior officers have him transferred to the very small town of Sandford, where he must contend with the dangerous threat of underage drinkers, loiterers, and drunk drivers. For the most part, Sandford is apparently a small town with small problems.Angel teams up with the inspector's son, Danny Butterman, a cop who is obsessed with cop movies, played by Nick Frost, who worked alongside Pegg in Shaun of the Dead. The two once again share perfect chemistry here as classic cop buddies. Eventually some murders begin to happen around time, murders that most everybody dismisses as accidents but which Angel suspects to be something more. An investigation ensues into the classic serial killer that you've seen in dozens of cop movies, parodied lovingly and perfectly here.Everything about Hot Fuzz works. This is no simple parody that is content to just laugh at its source material. There are so many little things in Hot Fuzz, stuff that you'll need to look for if you want to catch it. Dozens of homages to cop movies are sprinkled all over the place, and the wonderful thing is is that they're subtle, discreet, under-the-counter, woven into the storyline and characters in such a way that they do not jump out and scream at you like in Austin Powers or Scary Movie. This isn't just a parody of cop movies. It's a cop movie. It's a true cop movie in every sense of the word, but its genius rests in the fact that it manages to be a complete cop movie while also making unashamed fun of the genre. As I walked out of this movie I kept on shaking my head at what genius this was - there was such a perfect pitch and feel to this movie I felt it almost literally has no equal in terms of spoofs.A lot of it is due to the excellent cast and the perfect chemistry they share. Simon Pegg is absolutely brilliant and will eventually take his place among British comedic legends alongside the likes of Rowan Atkinson and Martin Freeman. (In my view he's already there.) The cameos from Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, and Steve Coogan at the beginning were absolutely perfect. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg share a virtually and subtly homo-erotic friendship in the film and it is perfectly and subtly funny, never over the top, but just enough there to catch and laugh at. The people in Sandford also perfectly fulfill their role, especially Jim Broadbent as the inspector. Timothy Dalton as the maybe-villain throughout the film is wonderful and you can tell he's having plenty of fun.Another great thing that sells this movie is that it doesn't sell itself short on action. A lot of movies would have probably skimped on the action well known to cop movies and focused too much on the parody , but the final thirty minutes of Hot Fuzz are a hilariously climactic showdown. And it's not just cheesy action. There is some fun cheese and camp within the action, but overall, it's actually GOOD - this is action that wouldn't be out of place in a, for lack of a better word, normal action pic. It's a perfect homage to cop movies while also being a wonderfully thrilling scene in its own right. Shaun of the Dead was lacking a little in what truly constituted zombie action, and the final scene at the bar I found to be kind of disappointing and dragged out. Hot Fuzz's final scene is perfect and expertly executed. The rest of the movie contains plenty of creative gore, and thought sometimes I found it to be a little odd that they were putting so much gore into the film, I eventually accepted it as an homage to the many R-rated cop movies that exist out there - and it's not boring gore - most, if not all of it, had the entire audience cringing with how intense and creative it was.The only thing that Hot Fuzz lacks from Shaun of the Dead is the smart social commentary. Shaun of the Dead was deep and it had some important and interesting things to say, but Hot Fuzz is meant to be just simple and great fun. It's also a better parody of cop movies than Shaun of the Dead was of zombie movies - on the whole it executes its goal with perfect grace and requires smarts and wits to watch. It's not some dumb mindless comedy - so many things in this movie are about watching closely and fully appreciating the love that these creators had for the original material. Many times directors will skimp on thought and originality when directing a spoof - sacrificing character development, plot, and action and just riding the wave of the original's success. Hot Fuzz doesn't even come close to doing this. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright could easily have gone the lazy route, but they absolutely refused, and I respect and admire them for that. This movie is such a film that it is likely people will end up parodying it. A pitch-perfect parody and comedy, Hot Fuzz is entertaining and hilarious and masterfully accomplished in every single way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
What a disappointment,"I absolutely loved Shaun of the Dead and when I saw this movie was coming out I was just crazy to see it. Finally the DVD arrives in the mail and I sat with eager anticipation for another nearly 2 hours or dry wit and humor from the boys.The premise itself is a little far fetched and does lend itself for an over the top comedy just like Shaun did. The problem is that Shaun was perfectly set up with the zombie portion to require gore and over the top blood splatter. In this movie, there are so many scenes of people getting things blown up, smashed to a pulp or cracked open that the blood becomes a second supporting actor. While that makes sense with zombies, it sure doesn't fit with a small town group of old cronies.Now the ending is fantastic with massive amounts of bullets being fired, but it does drag on a bit long and the gags are a little too obvious to score as big surprises. Simon Pegg was good, but he was so serious it was hard to squeeze humor out of his character. If you want Shaun of the Dead humor, please, just pop Shaun of the Dead into the DVD player and forget this one. It'll disappoint for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Move over Bad Boys Angel is in town!,Hot Fuzz was a fun movie to watch. An action comedy that aims to please without taking itself so seriously. It starts off quickly by catching the audience up to where and how Angel the lead character got to where he is. The first half is more about clever joke set ups and letting us learn about Sanford and its townspeople. The second half is where the action kicks in and doesn't stop to the end. Along the way you get treated to some terrific detracting and the actors get you to believe their stories. Overall I thought it was a great movie with plenty of laughter and action to please almost anyone. If only all movies could be made this well!,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Midsomer murders on steroids,"If you are familiar with the writings of Dave Barry then you will be very comfortable with this movie. Dave Barry has the ability to take something that seems so common and straightforward, then slightly exaggerate and embellish and expound until you find yourself in fantasy and wonder how you got there.Constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) finds himself to be too perfect; he is rejected by his girlfriend and banished to the small village of Sandford by his police force community. Here he must adjust to rural life. But is rural life all it seems?Nikolas is becoming suspicious of a series of accidents and his mind is starting to say murder. Can his newfound friend/coworker, PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) squelch this tendency of Nicholas' to see murder and everything? Or will we be caught up in necklaces fantasy?I have only seen the Blu-Ray version of this film so I cannot compare contrast to other versions. You guessed it this presentation has all the standard extra goodies voice over's and additions and whatnots. Naturally, they all enhance your viewing pleasure and do not distract from the original presentation. However, it is the movie we came to see extra goodies are just icing on the cake so when you make your choice don't forget the cake.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Did you notice in the DVD bargain bin?,"there was a copy of Shaun of the dead lying with all the other action cop films, nice little touch i though :) Shaun was way better by the way, thats all to be said on the matter. there is no way hot fuzz will ever surpass SOTD. Its just not as consistently funny as their previous work and i don't like Pegg as a straight actor. but i love Pegg. but... you understandso to recap ...hot fuzz - o.k but its nowhere near SOTDi did love the bit when one of the officers had Dolmio sauce all over his face screaming NOOOOOOOOO",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
hot stuff,"Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, director/writers/actor respectively, struck gold with their previous film Shaun of the Dead, for what is a cult hit. Wright and Pegg, tapping the same source of Shaun, are far from bleeding their well dry. Spinning conventions of the zombie genre around with the rom-com, Wright and Pegg give action it's due in the small village of Sandford, where death is more prone from an over indulgence of tea and cake at the local NWA.Sandford starts to become lively on the arrival of hot shot and all round saint of the law, Officer Nicholas Angel, transfered from London after being extremely to good at the job and making everyone pathetic in the shadows of his commendations. Teamed with lout Danny Butterman, Angel unable to shed his rock solid adherence to the law, loses mental stability in the sleepy village where the law is transparent. After a series of seemingly unfortunate accidents, Angel smells foul play, though convincing the locals their village has a murderer is harder than apprehending the killer.The chemistry of Hot Fuzz lies upon Pegg and Frost. Perfectly complimenting each other, whether Pegg is stiff and robotic and Frost runs with the shenanigans, or both in action mode, there is a natural play off one another, never fighting for the punchline or spotlight. Writers Wright and Pegg, don't really reach the creative level of Shaun of the Dead, in retrospect the revelation of who's behind it all is rather esoteric, but that and plot holes are quickly filled with a 'who cares' mentality. The comedy is non stop, along with a constantly spiked energy level, with Wright showing of his flare as a talented director in one bombastic yet creative shoot out. Pegg and Wright have laced moments, heavily on Point Break and Bad Boys 2, with myriad of references to virtually every buddy cop film, cop show and other films and shows to spark the childhood memories.Together Pegg and Frost make strong leading actors, though they are surrounded by countless solid supporting actors and cameos. Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan as the London officers is Angels transfer. Bill Bailey, Olivia Colman, Kevin Eldon, Karl Johnson as the woeful Sandford officers, a solid performance from Jim Broadbent as Inspector Frank Butterman. Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as ignorant detectives Wainwright and Cartwright. Stand out performance by Timothy Dalton, as the sly greasy shop owner Simon Skinner, and all the members of the NWA.Whether a Shaun of the Dead fan or not, Hot Fuzz has all the goods for anyone wanting an intelligent comedy/action film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
I enjoyed this just as much as I enjoyed Shaun Of The Dead.,The boys are back with a new comedy that this time spoofs the action genre. So what are we given? Pretty much the same amount of laughs that Shaun Of The Dead gave us along with some pretty nifty action and gore scenes in the mix. Although I felt that maybe 10-15 minutes could have been shaved off there wasn't too much to complain about. The style felt like it was mocking the modern day Tony Scott. The references to other action movies were hilarious. If you look away from what this movie is trying to do than you might get a little off track. You'll pretty much enjoy this movie it's really just a matter of how much you'll enjoy it. All in all Hot Fuzz brings good laughs.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Change the bloody record, Pegg","Yes, Spaced was sublime, but I've seen it already. Sure, Sean of the Dead expanded on those themes a little, but I've watched that to death. I expected something new here, not just Pegg and Wright rehashing the same played-out characters using the same tired cabal of actors spouting the same old jokes yet again.I just can't find anything here that they haven't already done, many times before. Even the 'unexpected' disjoints are by now mandatory rather than surprising. From knowing the premise and the writers, the entire plot can be fairly accurately predicted, right down to the fat one coming a cropper. Don't eat the paintballs, Mike.Cinematically, Wright is going backwards. The trademark jump cuts reach a distracting and aggravating frenzy in the third act; either this is accidental and sloppy, or it's deliberate and obtuse. The budget just isn't there to do the action scenes properly, and the cack-handed attempt to disguise this is painfully obvious. It's neither clever, nor charming.But worst of all, Hot Fuzz is lukewarm at best. It's dull. It drags. It's a parody of Midsomer Murders, not Bad Boys, and not a particularly sharp one at that.Pegg and Wright are out of ideas. I'll be skipping their next effort until the rabid fanbois stop raving over it, and some serious and balanced reviews come in.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Die Hard Meets Airplane! in Great Britain,"Hot Fuzz is a balderdash buddy cop flick with the machine gun fire of both action and British wit. The only comparison to the film's originality would be Airplane! and the previous debauchery of the comedic Pegg and Frost duo, Shaun of the Dead.The moment one gag ends, the next one doesn't have time to develop, so it smacks you in the face with a quaintness only the British know best. If you can understand the accents, the Fuzz will have you laughing over a pint and some fish and chips.Nick Angel (Simon Pegg) is the top London police officer with an arrest record 400% higher than the rest on the force. He's so good that his higher uppers send him to peaceful Sandford in order to receive less professional embarrassment on their part. In Sandford, Nick meets Danny (Nick Frost), an overweight, lazy officer and proprietor of American action films like Point Blank and Bad Boys 2 (not the original, mind you, but part 2). In the meantime, odd ""accidental"" deaths unfold in the small town, and Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), the town magnate, is a possible suspect.Cop meets cop, expert meets sloth. The two unlikely cop-buddies will form another cinematic duo against corruption in a city that last complained of a runaway goose. What is pro-cop Angel to do with his spare time? It is an understatement when I say the gags smack you in the face. The moment you laugh at the first one-liner, bloody action – both literal and metaphorical – hits the screen as if you're watching a sneak peak of the new Die Hard film. To add to the fun, current British marvels, Steve Coogan, Jim Broadbent, and Bill Nighy, do what they know best – make fools of themselves.If you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, and you're up for some slapstick, you will surely enjoy the Fuzz. It may push in 34 minutes more than Airplane!, but I encourage you to wait until the last 10. You'll be laughing over your next order of fish and chips!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Parody done right,"Nicholas Angel is the best London Policeman (sorry, Police Officer) ever. Amazing arrest record. Top notch display of skills in investigation, armed response, hot pursuit and discipline. Unforetunately that makes him a little too good for London and he is sent to quiet Sandford. An ideal little town that Angel discovers is far from quiet and ideal.In light of all the spoofs lately - Date Movie, Epic Movie, Scary Movie 4, etc... - whose titles are already bad jokes, not to mention the actual movies, Hott Fuzz provides what you were looking for. Not just a loosely connected skits that parody other movies, but a whole parodial tone as Hot Fuzz doesn't spoof specific movies as much as it pokes fun at the whole sensationalist action genre. From rapid fire edits to epic music everything a huge action movie ever had is here. From shootouts to car chases, from gory serial murder to one liners, everything every big city cop has ever faced is here... in the quiet town of Sandford. --- 9/10Rated R for violence",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Great movie, action and comedy wise","This movie was awesome, a barrel of comedy and action and stereotypes being destroyed/made fun of all in one. The action, I have to say was surprisingly good, i expected it to be just comedy but it was good. The comedy was the best, if you love Shaun of the Dead and 'spoof' movies that make fun of certain genres then this is absolutely the right movie. It makes fun of the whole romance with the main character theme, makes fun of the whole 'part of the larger picture' theme. Its great. Only thing that could have done better is maybe include more action though its a great movie as it is without having anything else done to it. If you get an opportunity watch it as the top of your list if you are an action-comedy buff",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
hot fun,"After reading the reviews posted here I'm not sure why I should bother to add my two cents. This was positively one of the very funniest movies I've ever seen, and the people who say you have to view it more than once to catch all the references are absolutely right. I watched it with one friend then showed it to another and then to my husband and each time I caught more than before. Every time my husband and I sit down to watch a movie I ask him what he's in the mood for and he always says: something funny, with car chases and shooting and explosions. Finally I found one movie that actually fits his bill to a T. Simon Pegg is without a doubt one of the funniest up and comers and everyone seems to agree, but don't discount Nick Frost. His show Hyperdrive was a lot funnier than I had hoped or expected. They each bring something to the table and fit together like a glove humor-wise. See Hot Fuzz no matter what you thought of Spaced or Shaun of the Dead. You won't be sorry. One thing to bear in mind, I noticed that people who didn't like it probably didn't get it because they aren't British. I appreciate those who mention Midsomer Murders. Not a comedy, but shows the importance of fetes and best village contests. Brits (at least TV ones take this stuff seriously, real seriously, like they'd murder for it seriously). And the rest who didn't like it just need to loosen up and let themselves be entertained. One person mentioned recognizing a joke as a joke but couldn't laugh. This makes no sense whatsoever. If it's a joke release the laughter and this movie is definitely to be laughed at and with. This movie is for fun, hot fun. So enjoy your popcorn and enjoy the movie and please, most of all, feel free to laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Perfectly Enjoyable...,"Hot Fuzz does exactly what it says on the tin. In interviews it was described as a high-octane, buddy cop action movie that's also a comedy and that's exactly what it is. It's got plenty of action that keeps going and doesn't disappoint and plenty of funny moments that are generally down to earth which is typical to the style of filmmakers' comedy.That said there are a few small flaws to this film. Overall it is a great film and fans of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead will not be disappointed, however the movie moves too quickly. Edgar Wright gives a much more extreme version of his quick, fast cutting method as the film is intended to be much less laid back as his previous work. Though it fits the genre it becomes a bit irritating as it is almost constant throughout and the film doesn't quite sink in as a result of this.The film's plot is of an excellent policeman, Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), who is moved to a calmer part of England, in the country. With a new partner, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), he must adjust to his surroundings. Though there is an engaging plot, and an obvious subplot about his settling into his new home and the relationship with his new partner, this doesn't quite fit with the high-octane style. Pegg and Frost's chemistry is excellent as usual however the script has to give a lot of the information that they are getting along.Though there a some very small pieces missing to this movie, don't let that turn you away from seeing it. No one I know who has seen this film were significantly bothered by these problems and it is still well worth seeing. If you are a fan of Spaced or Shaun of the Dead you should definitely see it as it is another great piece of work from its makers. If you haven't seen these previous works you should still watch this as it is a refreshing action comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"""Hot Fuzz""  Sizzling Entertainment","It has been awhile since I've seen ""Shaun of Dead"" but I definitely enjoyed it and was really looking forward to this installment. The best part of the British spoofs is they offer a far more intelligent sense of humor than their American counterparts. Unfortunately most of the mainstream audience here hasn't quite fully seemed to have grasped that concept, but there are those that can appreciate it. Luckily it appears to be catching on. I readily admit that sometimes I'm in the mood for the quick and easy laugh but more often than not I'd like to work for it.""Hot Fuzz"" wasn't as funny as ""Shaun of the Dead"", although I thought the story was a lot better. Another thing that I like about these British spoofs is that the film was good enough to stand on its own, even if the viewer didn't catch on to any of the references shown. Granted it won't be as humorous but still enjoyable enough. Whereas the American spoof movies usually rely on them alone, which is why they become quickly dated. The tough part is classic movies were paid tribute to here as well so if you aren't a huge film buff then you'll be left in the dark for at least a few instances. That should be enough incentive for you to brush up on some much needed cinema knowledge!Some critics have stated that some of the parodies are way too over the top and completely unbelievable. Well that's the point as it was poking fun at how many of the action movies are the same way. Others asked, ""could the people in a small town really be that blind and not see or want to believe what was actually going on?"" Yes they could, it happens all the time in rural areas, as sometimes their people aren't fully equipped mentally to realize that there's more than meets the eye from time to time.The acting was great and no one dipped below the charts on this one. This is certainly one talented comedic troupe. Even though they're all mainly classified as comedians, they are excellent dramatic actors, which is what adds to all the warped fun since they all basically play it straight. I really hope that this bunch continues to make another film in this fashion and that it won't take another three years to do so. ""Hot Fuzz"" was fiendishly clever and got the whole audience involved in its crazy antics mixed with a serious backdrop. These are definitely some short arms of the law you won't want reaching for you anytime soon!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Differant,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I decided to view this film, I thought it would be a really stupid comedy, but was finding myself surprised at every corner.There is, humor in the film but it's an unusual humor, filled with in your face, obvious comedy, that creates a lighter atmosphere in the movie. Instead of having the normal boring cop movies, this one brought a different approach to the table as you followed Simon Pegg. He is a cop that does his job too good for anyone to like or want him to be apart of their team. About half way through the movie it seems to add in a horror streak to the film, mixed in with mystery and action, while still keeping the show light. Making you wonder, what genre does this movie fit into?The relationship between Nicholas Angel and PC Danny Butterman was written quite well. It was far from the usual cop partner relationship that is showed in most films, instead of having Butterman as a stupid cop who can never do anything right, he's just a normal guy trying to honestly do better. Even though there's very little back story to the characters and no normal romance thrown in there, it made the movie enjoyable because it was out of the ""Ordinary"" expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Luke warm fuzz,"Let me start by saying that I did enjoy this film, but, it's certainly not worth the high scores its been given by many UK voters here. I suspect that an international audience will confirm this. Regional pride always seems to get in the way of objectivity in the UK. Get a grip people. The fact is that the script is fairly weak for large parts of the movie and it seems to me that they really didn't have enough quality to fill the 2 hour running time. Having said that I found the last 40 minutes of the film very entertaining as it's the action sequences that really shine. Giving the nod to many of the action blockbusters of recent years the movie finishes on a high. Unfortunately it's too little too late to save it from being classed as anything more than a worth a watch but nothing to get really excited about.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Best comedy of 2007,"Edgar Wright, whose previous efforts include the beloved Shaun of the Dead, and the amazing Grindhouse trailer called Don't, manages to impress yet again in his latest film, Hot Fuzz. Also returning from Shaun of the Dead are Simon Pegg as co-writer and star and Nick Frost as the co-star in a loving, British homage to American action and buddy cop films. Nick Angel (Pegg) is the best police officer in London. Yet he's so great, that he makes everyone else (including his higher authorities) look inferior in comparison. He is then ""promoted"" to work in the small town of Sandford, where the crime rate is miniscule but the ""accident"" rate is soaring. As he realizes that the town is much more dangerous than it seems (intentional action cliché), he ends up befriending the Chief's son, Danny (Nick Frost), an inept police officer who wishes his life was more like the cops in Bad Boys II.For the most part, after British directors have a hit, they head straight off to Hollywood to make their next movie. However, after the cult success that was Shaun of the Dead, Wright stayed in England, and Hot Fuzz is as British a film as they come. The humor is truly more universal than anything like Monty Python or Alan Partridge, which some may love and others simply do not get.What makes Hot Fuzz so enjoyable is how much fun the filmmakers and actors are having on screen. Countless name drops and references to other movies are present, be it in the dialogue, the lighting or just a particular memorable shot. Action films that the main characters are shown viewing are intentionally spoofed later on in the film. In addition , there are dozens of references to movies that are presumably favorites of the writers. Young audiences might not catch such references to films like Chinatown, The Shining, and Lethal Weapon, and many more, yet the filmmakers implemented these allusions so that if these devices are unnoticed, the plot will not be affected.The amusing bit parts and cameos range from Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan, to Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson and Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett. Yet the man who reigns supreme over all of them is ex-James Bond Timothy Dalton, in more of a decently sized supporting role than a bit part. Dalton is the mustached Simon Skinner, an absurdly over the top villain who seems to be at the scene of every crime Pegg's character inspects.Hot Fuzz is a great film compared to recent ""parody films"" like Epic Movie and to a lesser extent Scary Movie, because Hot Fuzz openly embraces the films it imitates, and the characters in the film play it completely straight, rather than acting as if they're in a comedy. Also, Wright actually has a strong visual and directorial style that accentuates the humor and over the top action. The opening of Hot Fuzz is a bit slow for some, but every single plot point covered from beginning of the film comes together in the erratic, explosive, ridiculously entertaining end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
The Best Time I Have ever had the movies in my life...,"I saw ""Hot Fuzz"" at the AFI Dallas Premier on Thursday with a Q&A with Edgar Wright, Nick Frost, and Simon Pegg afterwards.

The actors all really seem to enjoy their work and it shows in every scene. My wife and I both walked out of the theater thoroughly satisfied with the entire experience with nothing we could really think of that could have been done better.

Brilliant and funny flick,"Get ready ladies and gentlemen for Nick Frost and Simon Pegg's second film. This film, the clever remake of another film, will keep you on your toes from the first, hilarious moments, till the middle twist and then all the way to the end.

You think you are dealing with a comedy until the plot is revealed (I was trapped as I thought what the plot was until it caught me by surprise, I had not watched their source, which I will not tell here), which is great because at the beginning you are just laughing at the misfortunes of this big town policeman in a small peaceful village.

"When the heat is on, you gotta call the fuzz","A cop movie that is an action mystery comedy that is directed by Edgar Wright and stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost just like their last movie together Shaun of the Dead (2004), there is a lot from this that can bring a great fun movie like last time; this movie was a fun and entertaining as Shaun of the Dead (2004), and for the people who have not seen it, you should watch it. Hot Fuzz (2007) was fun, entertaining, very funny, directed very well by Edgar Wright, and had an interesting mystery; what makes the movie great is the lead stars who are once again great together, and both are very funny for a movie like this. Also, the movie has talks about big action cliches that happen in movies, and the mystery element in the movie was well done, and I thought it worked well with the action-comedy vibe of the movie, with it also being funny on how it plays out.The main character Nicholas Angel played by Simon Pegg was cool as this character; I liked how he is a pro police officer that gets moved to a small town because he is too good on the force, leading him to solving a murder with no help from the easy-going police force in the small town, and he also had funny moments involving how he does certain crazy things when he takes his job seriously. Nicholas Angel's partner PC Danny Butterman played by Nick Frost was also great in the movie; he is someone who knows about certain things that happen in action movies and compares them to real life, and him and Nicholas Angel worked very well together with good interactions between the two of them, along with him being funny with him trying to be like Nicholas Angel doing these crazy things that he cannot do until near the end of the film in the third act climax.The comedy in the movie is very funny, and the actors do an excellent job during a lot of funny moments that happen in the movie, along with them doing certain stunts and quick action scenes that were not bad, some of the action scenes have a lot of quick cuts where they could have hold on to certain action shots without cutting a lot, but it did not bother me that much. The cinematography was great with wide shots, stylized quick cuts and transitions during scenes, and effective uses of certain songs in the film, along with some emotional moments that were also good; the movie itself has a good mystery with a funny reveal, and the movie deaths in the movie with people getting killed off in brutal bloody ways that are a bit over the top, but they still fit what the movie is trying to do.Hot Fuzz (2007) was a great action comedy that is very funny and entertaining with great actors doing excellent jobs; there are a lot of people who have seen this movie, but if you have not, I would recommend checking it out. Edgar Wright did an excellent job directing and writing this movie, giving it that stylized feel like most of his movies, and it makes the movie fun to watch and makes it worth a rewatch. Plus, I thought Hot Fuzz (2007) was as good as the last film they did, the horror comedy Shaun of the Dead (2004), a movie I also recommend watching if you have not already.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"Too silly for its own good, but still quite an amusing and entertaining follow-up to Shaun of the Dead","Trading a zombie invasion with a small town killing spree, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are still the ones to save the day in the Brit comedians' follow-up to Shaun of the Dead. But though maintaining a steady rate of laughs, Hot Fuzz doesn't continue all of its predecessor's filmmaking virtues and is not all too much more than an average comedy.It's most obvious over all of the film's exorbitant two hours of running time that its cast and crew were having a whale of a time shooting the ridiculous action and dialogue scenes, between which the buddy cop spoof alternates, and that fun is transmitted to the audience in most films. However, Hot Fuzz feels silly and over the top in right about every frame and, no matter how unserious Pegg, Frost, and co. were when on set, the picture shown on screen doesn't seem like a parody at all, but like a comedy using all the idiotic elements of bad action or crime films for their own project and one, that doesn't sarcastically comment the moronic events happening but acceptingly lets them go by. In a picture of regular length, the imbalance between actual jokes and unwitty physical humour wouldn't have carried that much weight, only Hot Fuzz isn't a picture of regular length and, without any exaggeration, spends its complete final half of an hour on the latter sort of comedic entertainment, of which I am the least bit fond of.When it comes to the real gags though, the second part of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy highly pays off and likely (I didn't keep a list) induces more snorts of laughter than both of the other two. Each and every one of the innumerable cameos of famous British thespians is superb to see and the film's running gags and grotesquely gruesome homicides are easily one of the best of their sorts of all comedies out there, and thus fully making up for the storytelling flaws and enabling a perfectly entertaining and intelligently funny movie night – just not a very perfect or intelligent movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A total piece of crap!,"Everyone compares this total piece of crap to Shawn of the Dead. Who cares? A movie should stand on it's own. I didn't see Shawn, and won't. Fuzz is boring, long, stupid, not funny. There is no character development. Just an excuse for car chases, explosions and shoot outs. The fast editing and sound effects were distracting and more for the ego of the director than the viewing pleasure of the audience. How bad was it? A recurring theme is the main character's house plant! The film is full of stupid, gratuitous violence. I agree with people who say that the rating is fixed. Are the British so desperate for foreign exchange that they all got together to praise and highly rate this film, so the rest of the suckers around the world would buy or rent it?",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Midsomer Mayhem!,"I absolutely LOVED ""Hot Fuzz"", it's reminiscent of the quaint afternoon dramas that OAPs watch (such as ""Heartbeat"", ""Midsomer Murders"" and ""Inspector Morse"") but with insane action, comically over-the-top violence and curse words a-plenty thrown into the mix. The film is chock-full of fantastic British actors who all give hysterically funny performances, the script is surprisingly intelligent for a film that's this hilarious and the action sequences are both bonkers and thrilling. ""Hot Fuzz"" is more than a silly buddy comedy, it's one of my all-time favourite films!""Hot Fuzz"" is the first film directed by Edgar Wright that I saw and I still believe that it's his best one. Wright's direction here is excellent, the movie moves at a break-neck pace, meaning that there is never a dull or unentertaining moment. It explodes off the screen with an energetic personality that perfectly blends the setting of a relaxing evening drama with uproariously gory action set-pieces.Calling the cast in ""Hot Fuzz"" star-studded is a massive understatement. Simon Pegg (who's one of my favourite actors) is as phenomenal as ever in the role of determined police officer, Nicolas Angle, I'm sorry ANGEL. Nick Frost is equally likeable as Angel's partner on the Sandford police service, Danny Butterman, who provides many of the movie's best references and one-liners.It's staggering how many great actors are in the supporting cast in ""Hot Fuzz"", I would like to praise them all individually, but if I did, this review would be 7,000 words long, so I'll just list some of them. Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, Timothy Dalton, Olivia Colman, Steve Coogan, Paul Freeman, Stephen Merchant and David Bradley all appear in this film (wow, the casting director deserves a round of applause!) But that's not all, Cate Blanchett and Peter Jackson even make cameo appearances here!From deadpan deliveries to riotous mockeries of action movie tropes, ""Hot Fuzz"" excels in every area of comedy. Not a single joke fell flat and even if you find one gag annoying, the movie barrels along so quickly that you'll probably being laughing at the next joke almost immediately. ""Hot Fuzz"" is probably the smartest comedy I've ever seen, almost every line of dialogue has an amusing and satisfying pay-off later on in the film (meaning that I'll need to re-watch it quite a lot to pick up on all of the clever gags.)Some action-comedies pride themselves on their comedic moments but lack noteworthy action sequences, thankfully ""Hot Fuzz"" isn't one of those films. Despite some intentional shaky-cam, the action in ""Hot Fuzz"" is a joy to behold, it's stylised, captivating and very, very bloody! What makes the action here even more incredible is that most of the first two-thirds of this movie is very light on traditional action, but then the film goes completely bonkers in the third act and becomes a non-stop adrenaline ride in which the two leads are thrown into an all-out battle with the villains. I don't want to spoil who the antagonists are, but let me just say, the hilarity increases exponentially when they appear on screen!In conclusion, ""Hot Fuzz"" is simply amazing! It's an ingenious lampoon of blow-out action spectaculars and murder mysteries told in a side-splitting and immensely enjoyable way. I loved every single second of it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
What every other Comedy/Action movie wishes it can be!,"When I first sat down to watch Hot Fuzz, I didn't really think much of it, I just thought of it as another Buddy cop movie made by the same dude who directed Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and went 'This is gonna be interesting'.. Hot Fuzz is now one of my favorite movies of all time!Where to even start with this movie, There's just so much to like about it, Firstly the characters are so great, When we first get introduced to the main character, The tough intelligent and cool Nicolas Angel and his less intelligent friend Danny Butterman I was like 'oh no, Not another tough cop, stupid cop movie', but surprisingly, they play great off of each other, The character interactions are so great and funny, The other police officers were great too, Even tho they were kind of annoying at the beginning, but they grew on me.And the writing.. OH MY GOD THE WRITING, This movie doesn't have the right to be this well-written but it does, I don't even wanna say anything about the plot because this is one if these movies that it's better to go in blind and not know anything about the story and the plot, and what I really love about this movie is how every little detail, Every joke, Every set piece, Every throwaway line that you didn't really think much about, Somehow gets back later in an even funnier conclusion, It gets better everytime you watch it and fell so satisfied and rewarded for keeping an eye out for these type of stuff!Like.. I don't even have about any complaints right now, This movie is just that good, Not to repeat myself too much but yeah, The story and characters are great, The pacing is phenomenal, The references doesn't feel forced and contrived and actually benefit the comedy and storytelling, and the direction is so great, Edgar Wright is seriously one of most talented directors out there, His movies are really great and this one is no exception, Easily my favorite out of The Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

If I could wipe my memory to re watch any movie, it would be this movie. What I would give to watch this again without knowing how it ends. Seriously, the camera work and editing is so artistic and original. I don't know how anyone could not like this movie.

The movie looks into how this high ace police officer is getting used to rural life and nothing happening... but as the viewer will find out; all is not good and well in the town of Sandford.The movie combines action, comedy and drama in a superb way and I recommend it to everyone who has enjoyed the movies I mentioned earlier.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
tongue in cheek action,"Funny, tongue in cheek action. Twice the budget of Sean of the Dead.

The film is mostly a parody of other police action movies. You can tell the budget is a lot bigger than Shaun of the Dead in this one. I enjoyed the film a lot, you can really have a great time with it. Despite all the action it remains also a very British film, both in it's setting and characters. If I had any complaints then it's probably that all the fighting at the end goes on a bit too long, perhaps the over the topness of it all is all part of the point, I don't know.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"The ""Fuzz"" is ""Hot!""","Here we are again, reviewing yet another movie about cops & robbers. But ""Hot Fuzz"" isn't the usual cops & robbers stuff that we're used to seeing here in the United States. Instead, ""Hot Fuzz"" comes fresh off the boat from good old Great Britain, and satirizes American action movies with joyful glee.Perhaps the reason the project is so successful is because it comes to us from the same happy-go-lucky British comedians who brought us the delightful ""Shaun of the Dead"" back in 2004 during what as an apparent peak in a craze for zombie movies at the cinemas. Yet, ""Hot Fuzz"" is being released in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, so some might say the filmmakers are being insensitive when it's all really just bad timing. Now we shouldn't let the actions of one individual allow us to put judgment upon one little action movie, should we?""Hot Fuzz"" was directed by ""Shaun of the Dead"" Edgar Wright, and features Sergeant Nicholas Angel (co-screenwriter ""Shaun"" Simon Pegg), a dedicated London police officer who is suddenly reassigned to a quiet little village called Sandford because he's making his fellow policemen look bad with his ridiculously high arrest record. Once there, he is slightly miffed by the lack of criminal activity that was apparent back in his native London (his biggest arrest happens to be on a bunch of underage drinkers), but later events threaten to change that.A series of suspicious and grisly accidents has been rocking the Sandford area for some time now, and Angel and his bumbling new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) are hot on the case. Butterman's an adrenalin junkie, a young live-wire eager for some action reminiscent of his favorite American action movies like ""Point Break"" (1991), ""Bad Boys II"" (2003), and the ""Lethal Weapon"" films. Angel's deeper investigation into Sandford's public records shows a low crime rate, but an incredibly high accident rate. He suspects that these ""accidents"" are homicides made to conceal something greater.""Hot Fuzz"" isn't necessarily better than ""Shaun of the Dead"" but is smarter than it. ""Hot Fuzz"" is too self-conscious to be an out-right parody of American action movies but works best as a satire. The movie takes a look at America's obsession with gun culture and satirizes the hell out of it in several adrenalin-pumping action scenes. Though of course, not much happens during the course of the first hour as Angel and Butterman go through the usual buddy-cop movie motions and endure tedious non-action-related police-work, but things begin to pick up in the second hour once Angel and Butterman embark on their investigation to uncover the truth behind the strange events plaguing Sandford.The film is hilarious in a lot of ways, and extremely deadpan in others. The humor is of the satirical variety apparent in ""Shaun of the Dead,"" but ""Hot Fuzz,"" at least on a technical level, is somewhat edgier and better-written and better-acted (could a sadistic movie villain played by Timothy Dalton possibly be any more over-the-top?). The action scenes are extremely violent and bloody, but is hardly ever really shocking in any way. Action movie fans will have a ball picking out the prods at American action films, which shows to us that the filmmakers certainly know their material quite well.In the wake of the endlessly maddening cycle of violence plaguing the world at the present, ""Hot Fuzz"" could easily be accused of being insensitive to current events. But we're forgetting that it's just a movie released at an inconvenient time.It's just a movie, folks.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"""I'm a slasher and I must be stopped.""","With this film, being British is required, pretty much. Otherwise, it's barely going to be remotely funny, let alone hilarious. Based on how the majority of people seemed to have loved this film/think it was unfathomably funny, the powers that be, the powers of deduction, can be brought forth, concluding that most of the majority are British people. Then again, some people aren't: who still loved this film and think it's hilarious. As much as the difference of opinion is the apparent perpetrator here, I still don't get it.I also don't get how I thought this film was super funny in the past when I watched it for the first time, whenever that was: I don't have it logged anywhere, so I'm clueless. Or so I seem to think I did. Maybe my present idea of how much I liked it is a bit more than it was back then, but I'm pretty sure the overall result was the same, in that I liked it and thought it was funny. That's mind-boggling to the 'me now.'Unless I'm off the mark, most people found the comedy to be to the point where almost every instance got them laughing their asses off, and I'm left here baffled. Understanding that different opinions and tastes exist can only go so far, surely. Not to sound too crass, but I'm almost disgusted that I was somewhat looking forward to watching this because I seemed to recall having liked it before.Aside from my more than personal feelings, the biggest thing that stood out to me regarding this film was the camerawork/editing. It was undoubtedly extremely efficient and well-done. That's Edgar Wright's film's for you. Of course, the actual editor(s) deserve some significant credit, too. In this film's case: Chris Dickens. Props to him.But all of that grew repetitive quickly with the action sequences. It wasn't poorly done or anything like that. I think it was the complete opposite. You were able to tell what was happening and all that. Just like in The Bourne Identity. It's just that it can get annoying to watch.The most entertaining aspect for me was by far Simon Skinner. Timothy Dalton's performance was stellar, and I took too long to remember where I know him from, and that's Doom Patrol. All of his lines were great and delivered great. At least this film had that going for it.And as far as doing its job is concerned, this film only made me laugh once. I laughed when Danny groaned due to brain freeze. In the whole film, that's the only time I laughed. But everyone else seemed to have laughed at everything, pretty much. Weird. And I couldn't care less.Overall, this film had some entertainment to it. But I don't think that was enough for me. And, of course, based on everything I've written thus far, most of the comedy was more miss than hit. So, yeah. I know most people will greatly disagree with that. But the majority-held opinion of a film doesn't mean I'll have that same opinion.Other thoughts, or rather, 'thought':David Threlfall's performance, down to the way he delivered some of his lines; how he sounded, at times, was a lot like Roger Rees in Robin Hood: Men in Tights.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Second viewing required,"When I realised that this film came from the same team that brought us Shaun of the Dead, I knew I had to see this.. and it didn't disappoint me.I thought Pegg played his role really well, and he and Frost bounced off each other perfectly. The film had some great actors in it, and I also was impressed with the cameos from Nighy among others.The film made me laugh a lot, although perhaps there were not so many laugh out loud gags as other Brit comedies I've seen. And dare I say it.... I didn't think it was as good as Shaun of the Dead. I do however think it is well worth watching, and I have a sneaking suspicion that this film needs a second viewing to catch all the missed gags from the first time round (there were that many - you hadn't finished laughing at the last one to catch the next properly!)

Both of those twenty-seven year old films have more depth and character development than a single minute of ""Hot Fuzz."" Don't believe any of the good reviews for this movie - it's a waste of precious time and energy just putting it into your DVD player. And here's the best thing I can say about it - after an hour of watching, I finally got up and left, and the movie didn't stop me. I walked away from this abysmal mess of a film, this slick fecal-matter bruiser of a bomb, feeling a bit like film makers have finally gone and done it this time: they've given up on real movie-making altogether and sold their greedy souls to special effects, and when they're not animating things, mimicking Saturday morning cartoons with cheesy computer generated effects, they're scribbling scripts in pencil on sugar paper and rehearsing for two minutes before committing their laziness to celluloid. All the big-name cameos in the world couldn't save this steaming turd of a movie, so why should I say anything about it, other than that it sucks. England should be ashamed to be making movies like this, and we should be ashamed to give these kinds of amateur-hour British imports the time of day.If you're reading this and astounded by the ferocity of my review, and curious about this movie, then let me assure you - after an hour of it, you'll get up and leave, too.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Better than ""Point Break""!?!","For those of us who know that ""Point Break"" (1991) isn't the greatest movie of all time, we have ""Hot Fuzz"". And we get to side with Simon Pegg who should become one of the greatest comedic actors, in North America, if he isn't that already in the UK.Pegg is a hardened police officer from London who is transferred to the sleepy village of Sanford. Most of the other officers don't believe crime occurs here, or if it does, won't report on it. The one crime that does get reported is when a swan escapes from a lake. But Pegg playing against-type is action-ready and quickly becomes attuned to everything going on in the town.It's no accident that ""Hot Fuzz"" has a high average IMDb rating of 8.0. It's inventively funny with a humorous and active plot. It's not as explosive and violent as the poster suggests, definitely comedy first.

The screenplay is better than the first film and the action scenes are nice, however, it is a bit too long. It could have been half an hour shorter.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Perfect in every way.,I love this movie. Its funny. Its shot well. The action is amazing. The acting is great. The plot is unique and fantastic. Every element of this movie is extremely well done. I highly recommend it. Go watch it if you haven't already.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Funny Despite the Unnecessary Gore,"THE PLOT: A very proficient police officer finds himself being relocated to a small English village that he has no interest going to. Here he finds the citizens to be endearingly quirky and the police force incompetently run. He also runs into a rash of grizzly murders committed by a strange hooded figure that looks almost like the grim reaper.THE POSITIVE: The first hour of the film is fun and filled with a lot of dry British wit. The townspeople are amusing with all of their quirks and idiosyncrasies. It is also fun to see the main character (Pegg) who is so very rigid with his philosophy and approach to police work relate to these townspeople who have no problem bending the rules a little when it is convenient. His friendship with his police partner, who is the complete opposite of him, is nice as is there banter. You can tell there is a genuine bonding between the two actors. The massive shootout at the end, which involves just about the whole town, is outrageously hilarious. It is great to see old British pros given some nice juicy character bits including Whitelaw, Woodward, and most of all Dalton who does indeed still 'have it'.THE NEGATIVE: The murders are extremely gory and seem more on par with an 80's slasher film. The production seems still locked into the formula of their earlier project SHAWN OF THE DEAD were gore and violence seemingly have to be infused into the story to make it funny even though it really isn't necessary. The second half takes a wildly over the top twist that blows everything out of proportion and loses much of its charm. The pace moves too quickly and doesn't allow the viewer any time to even catch their breath. The film also features one of those modern day 'double' endings that is both needless and pointless.THE LOWDOWN: The humor has a nice mix to it so all ages should find it funny. Some of the action is crazy enough and over the top enough to stay with you afterwards.THE RATING: 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Hot film making,"This film, directed by Edgar Wright, is like an episode of ""Midsomer Murders"" or some Agatha Christie story directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is, of course, a take-off of police procedurals and action movies in general with enough references to other films to keep the buffs up all night. The cutting is truly amazing and the pace never flags. It's pretty gory but somehow good-humoured.Sergeant Nick Angel (a wonderfully straight-faced Simon Pegg) is found to be so good at his job in the Metropolitan Police that he is an embarrassment, so his chief inspector (Bill Nighy) sends him to the country to cool his heels. He arrives in Sandford, Somerset (or thereabouts) and settles in well enough, but after a couple of suspicious deaths begins to realise that all is not well despite the surface calm. He teams up with one of the dimmer local cops and they investigate. Naturally the body count increases and it seems there is real evil about. The final shoot-out is something Clint Eastwood would be proud of.One thing ""Midsomer Murders"", Poirot and the like share with this film is a great troupe of accomplished English character actors playing supporting roles. There's (rather surprisingly) Timothy Dalton, once a James Bond, playing a suspect supermarket owner, Anne Reid, Billie Whitelaw, Edward Woodward, and Stuart Wilson as other locals, Jim Broadbent as the avuncular Sandford police inspector and Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Bailey (a double act) as various police persons. Even Peter Jackson the director is in there somewhere though I didn't spot him. But Simon Pegg, by staying so straight-laced throughout, makes the whole thing work. Nick Frost as his sidekick blends in well, though it is not such a demanding part.Obviously the movie was made by a bunch of young people having fun (their previous effort was ""Shaun of the Dead""). It might be bloody but there's not a dull moment, and the editing is worthy of a prize.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

So all in all, I can see that its trying to do, but the whole octane action in a mundane setting joke is a little overdone at some point.6/10: sure, but nah.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Now This Is What I'm Talking About! ♦ 91%,"This seriously reminded of ""Requiem For A Dream"" of the close-up, fast paced shots and the best things about that movie were the cinematography, direction, music and screenplay. Hands down, Hot Fuzz has the best of best of these for a film in comedy genre.And filmmakers should learn from Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg and their helpers on how to make a a funny film simply drawing from scratch. The plot is ridiculously strange and yet so fun-filled: it has action, mystery, comedy, slapstick & most of all, brilliant performers and characters. Since the beginning, the serious character of Simon Pegg continues to charm and induce humor with his dialogs and conversations. And he stays in character till the very end.There's not a single dull moment except for when the climax hits the card and things stumble out. But this does not pose a reason for not getting pleased from the rest of the movie. With hybrid amounts of CGI, special effects of explosions & brilliant camera-work, Hit Fuzz is definitely a big thing and pure British comedy. ""Four Lions"" is another hilarious venture!BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended for its aesthetic value. 9.1 out of 10.

Action has never been so much fun,"'Hot Fuzz' is one of those - rarest of - films which not only spans numerous genres, but is also enjoyable to many different demographics. It's easy to say that 'action' films are a 'male dominated' niche and 'Hot Fuzz' certainly has plenty of action contained within. In fact... it may ever have more shoot-outs and set-pieces than your average straight-to-DVD B-movie with an once well-known muscled leading man at the helm. However, why 'Hot Fuzz' succeeds on so many levels is because you don't have to be a fan of action movies to appreciate it, largely because of its humour. Yes, it's also a comedy. And a 'buddy-cop' film. And has large moments of character development and, dare I say drama as well.Because of this, I can see it almost appealing to any adult of any age. I won't say 'fun for all the family' as, because of its 'adult language' it probably wouldn't be suitable for youngsters. However, if you don't mind the odd swear word, then join London's best police officer (Simon Pegg) who is, in fact, so good at his job that his superiors decide to transfer him to a sleepy little country town because he's making all the other officers look bad by catching too many criminals.Naturally, the move makes him a little uncomfortable, being used to dealing with drug dealers and murderers and now forced to - effectively - rescue cats from tall trees. However, the local 'bobby' (Nick Frost) is on hand to 'acclimatise' him to his new life. But, as fate would have it, this idyllic little town soon shows it's hiding some dark secrets which need the pair to investigate.I'm not going to go into the plot any further as it's a film that you really do need to see to enjoy. The village is also home to plenty of colourful characters, all of which add to the story and bring their best performances to the table. You may have also seen the Pegg/Frost collaborations 'Shaun of the Dead, The World's End' and 'Paul,' so you'll probably know the type of film you're going to get here - a genuinely funny film which lovingly pokes fun at a genre the film-makers clearly hold in high regard",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Action spoils comedy,"A promising start to the film eventually develops into long winded slap-stick action sequences.There is some good comedy in the first half of the film and another Shaun of the dead type triumph seems to be on the cards with the dark British humour and interesting scenario.However action sequences of this ""action-comedy"" become tiresome with any tension in the chases or gun fights shattered by the cartoon style jokes. By the end of the film any comedy element is virtually non existent and not helped by the drawn out scenes.The UK advertising campaign for Hot Fuzz claimed ""best action-comedy of 2007"". I watched this film in mid February and as far as I know it was the only action-comedy of the year so far.A missed opportunity to build on the good work done with Shaun of the dead although it somehow seems inevitable that Hot Fuzz will be more successful.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

It tricks you into thinking it's going to be some quirky, fish-out-of-water, buddy cop comedy, which would've made it an okay movie.

'Hot Fuzz' wasn't stupid funny like most comedies are, it was random and had it's silly moments that you couldn't help but laugh at.

Too good to be true,"It's February 2007 and Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright are back from the undead and bringing in the new year with Hot Fuzz, a crime caper, a rural whodunnit and a Charles Bronson revenge flick all in one neat two hour package.Sounds too good to be true? It almost is. After the huge success of Shaun of the Dead, the filmgoing community have been hanging on tenterhooks, with little information to go on. And it seems that anyone who doesn't want to watch Hot Fuzz simply wants to appear in it - the film includes some of the UK's most seasoned comedians and RSC actors.Once again, the movie is expertly made, stretching out what one can only assume was a comparatively small budget. There are funny lines and an involving and amusing relationship between the two leads, Angel and Danny. However, the extra glamour tacked on to the film, in the shape of Hong Kong-style gunfights and heavyweight actors like Timothy Dalton and Jim Broadbent adds very little to the film. The most enjoyable part of all of Pegg and Wright's work has been the interaction between the characters. The complex 'whodunnit' plot is as perfunctory as anything penned by the writers of Midsomer Murders, and merely a distraction from the comedy. And when the final set-piece arrives, it is too late in the film, and possibly too daft to be wholly compelling.The principal problem with the film however, other than its generous length, is that Pegg and pals have created a product equally disposable as the films they have lampooned. Did they mean to achieve this? Who can say?",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Not funny, too long","Yes, I DO get the intention is to send up the shoot-out cop movies, and I DO get the references within the script.But a take-off of a genre has to add something to be successful: merely making the bangs bigger, the blood gorier and the juxtaposition of English Heritage and Downtown LA isn't enough.I saw Hot Fuzz in the cinema soon after it was released and remember thinking it overlong and not particularly funny. I have just reviewed ""Paul"" - also a Pegg and Frost movie - and thought I'd better watch HF again to make sure that I haven't missed anything. So I sat through the whole thing on DVD - and no, I don't think that I *have* missed anything. Including the intended point.When I say ""sat through"" I mean just that. I have to say that I didn't even smile once.I suppose - especially seeing the vast majority of the reviews are positive - that I am being over critical. After all, the casting is excellent. The acting is first class. The blood looks realistic, not too Kensington Gore-y. It somehow doesn't gel though: the exaggeration of the Hollywood stereotype in the English village isn't enough to make a take-off movie work.The camera-work doesn't help, either: a miscalculation by the director.If I had to sum Hot Fuzz up, I would say that it almost mocks itself without putting an extra edge into the mix, an edge that might have saved a good idea from being an overlong, extended sketch.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Nice movie but too long,"This might be not a nice comment and a bit short, but I felt a bit drained after watching Hot Fuzz.If you expect your audience to 'get' the really funny jokes, you should also expect them to 'get' the storyline.

The story taking forever to unfold was a bit frustrating and made me lose interest for the often hilarious jokes.You might say that story lines in movies like these are not too important, but I really enjoyed the way it all started.

"""Make Sandford Great Again""","No, I'm not saying that to parody Trump or trigger people, this line was spoken in the movie nine years before Trump ran for office and made the slogan a loved and hated mantra.This is the third movie I've seen with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and this is my favorite.

Angel's first encounter with Butterman was arresting him for attempting to drive while intoxicated.Angel being an overactive officer in the small town of Sandford was misery for him and hilarious for us. He was disliked right away, and he only isolated himself even more when he contributed a host of strange deaths to murder and not accidents as they'd seemed. Four people died under mysterious circumstances and only Angel believed the victims were murdered. As Stewie Griffin would say, ""There was treachery afoot,"" and Angel was determined to get to the bottom of it.It was fun times in this buddy cop comedy. Angel and Butterman got to act out some of Butterman's favorite scenes from his two favorite cop movies: ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys 2,"" and we got to laugh.Free with Amazon Prime.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
The Greater Good,"Greetings again from the darkness. Brilliant comedy/spoof/homage co-written by rising star director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg ... yes, the team from ""Shaun of the Dead"". There are so many well written and deftly delivered punchlines here, one can hardly keep up.Supercop Pegg (named Nick Angel ... same as the film's music director) is ""promoted"" off the London police squad and into a quaint little country village with no history of murder, but the world's highest ""accident"" rate. Pegg partners up with stereotypical pudgy cop played perfectly by Nick Frost, who also happens to be the police chief's (Jim Broadbent) son. While every town death is casually explained away by the latest ""accident"" report, Pegg continues to pursue the notion that evil retailer Timothy Dalton is behind it all. Not to give anything away, but Pegg's theories lead to some hilarious dialogue between all parties.Suffice to say, the film combines ""The Stepford Wives"" with ""The Wicker Man"" and then proceeds to throw in numerous references to Mr. Wright's favorite U.S. cop film ""Bad Boys II"". Working equally well as an homage or a spoof, the film does a terrific job of jabbing U.S. buddy films and action films. The shoot-outs are a hoot and it is so amazing to see so few wounded with so many rounds fired at close range.Other support work is provided by Paddy Considine, Bill Nighy and numerous other Wright favs. Don't miss a quick shot of LOTR director Peter Jackson as the slashing Santa or a masked Cate Blanchett as Pigg's ex.Two other notes of interest: look for a quick scene involving a lost goose with Stephen Marchant (one of the masterminds behind ""The Office""); and Mr. Wright also directed the best of the fake trailers, ""Don't"", in the recent Tarantino/Rodriguez release ""Grindhouse"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Good, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing","Let me start off by saying that British comedy is not my thing. On the whole, I don't care for Monty Python, and I didn't care for ""A Fish Called Wanda"" (though I loved ""Death at a Funeral""). And that's what ""Hot Fuzz"" is: a British comedy.Nicholas Angel takes being a policeman very seriously (meaning he's obsessed with it). But he's so good that his superiors transfer him to a little village in the middle of nowhere. Of course, he's a fish out of water there, as no one there gives a damn. But when he starts shaking things up, some startling ""accidents"" arise...Even if you're not a fan of British comedy, there's plenty of material worth a couple of grins, though not enough to warrant a viewing. One of the strange things about ""Hot Fuzz"" is that even though it's clearly a satire, Simon Pegg makes Nicholas Angel into a fully three-dimensional character. Satires exist for the sole purpose of poking fun at character types, which the film does, but Angel is someone who displays a full range of emotion. That makes him more interesting, and dare I say it, sympathetic.Other name actors are on hand to add to the fun. Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, and in a one scene cameo, an unrecognizable Cate Blanchett (she's hidden in a biomedical suit). Nick Frost is Angel's dimwitted sidekick, who shows him the ropes, and again, he's a character we begin to care about as well.As I'm not a fan of this type of humor, I can't really judge how well it succeeds. But director Edgar Wright knows what he's doing, except when it comes to the action sequences. The constantly moving camera isn't successful, and gets pretty annoying.Still, I guess it warrants a viewing if you're into this sort of thing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A comedy that actually makes you LOL,"Constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a hard-core cop in London, whose job is pretty much his life, but he founds that he has been ""promoted-demoted"" to serve in the small village of Sandford, populated by sweet and too-relaxed people. His partner Danny Butterman, a local, is the contrary, an obese cop who dreams of the action he sees in American movies. The job is killer-boring until a series of apparently accidental deaths start to happen.Think ""Midsummer Murders"" mixed with ""Die Hard"", add lots of spoof-like moments, parody acting, crazy twists and turns (although the mystery is not as predictable as you might think), and, more importantly, lots of English wittiness.It is the settings, the dialogs, the script (by director Wright and actor-writer Pegg), the humor, how well (un)matched the characters are, and the great performances of the all-star English cast: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Steve Coogan, and Martin Freeman among others.One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. Unpretentious. Fresh. Entertaining - A comedy that actually makes you laugh. Bingo!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Color me disappointed.,"I was looking forward to Hot Fuzz - but Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright let me down for the first time.This is a very, very weird movie. It's a hybrid comedy-action-horror piece, and the different elements don't sit well together. Somehow, Pegg and Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" successfully crossed genres, but the same experiment doesn't work here. The action scenes seem tacked on, the horror comes out of nowhere, and the comedy simply isn't strong enough - the good laughs are scarce.Part of the problem is that the film is simply too intense. It's too loud, the cutting's too rapid, the scenes are too short. Oftentimes, Wright introduces tension and unease in a scene for no particular reason. This technique worked fine on half-hour episodes of his sitcom ""Spaced,"" but it gets wearisome in a feature-length film; beside, it undercuts the real (deserved) tension that develops later.Another problem is that this movie is distinctly lacking a feminine touch. There are no major female characters - in fact, there are hardly any minor ones. It's very much an overdose of testosterone. (Perhaps ""Spaced"" is so good because comedienne Jessica Stevenson contributed to the scripts and prevented them from descending into this kind of boy's-own stupidity?)I don't mean to suggest that ""Hot Fuzz"" is terrible. The opening scenes have got something, and Nick Frost is always at least cute. But the jarring shifts in tone, relative lack of laughs, violence, and darkness all work together to produce an unsatisfactory result. I'm looking forward to seeing more work from this comedy team, but they'll have to beat this effort to keep me interested.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
My Favourite Comedy of All-Time,"I just love this film so much. It somehow managed to get even better on second viewing. Edgar Wright really is a master of visual comedy, and every single joke hits the mark. It never lets up from beginning to end. The characters are iconic and all play their parts really, really well, the action is brilliantly fun to watch, all of the actors are just great - but it's the editing where this film shines the most. It has such a unique editing style that leads to so much humour and creativity. Even though this is side-splittingly hilarious, it would also be a genuinely great film without any comedy - that's just how strong the story is. It works even better on second viewing as you can pick up on some of the hints that lead up to the big twist. All of this culminates in quite possibly the best finale of any film. It's the perfect payoff to what came before, and it makes this probably my all-time favourite comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Hands down Wright's best,"""Hot Fuzz"" is not exactly a parody; I see it more like a full-fledged buddy cop action film with all its cliches set in an unusual context (the countryside village with mediocre lazy cops). The jokes and puns tend to be hit and miss, the running time could be one-third shorter, but overall it's (again) a great achievement for action comedies. If only the writing of the dialogues could match the level of the sophisticated editing and creative visual direction. So much of the humor came by images and sound here. Wright always knows how to grab your attention and goes full throttle with his trademark techniques in this film (crash zooms, whip pans, jump cuts, sound and action syncs, etc.). The perfect pitch of the editing just shows how everything on camera had been carefully choreographed and rehearsed in detail to achieve a specific effect.By the way, I loved how Simon Pegg always gets a ""shortcut"" in each film of the trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"Brilliant start , Boring plot progression but Interesting   ending","the movie can be divided into three partsthe first 20 minutes are absolutely hilarious i would rate it 10/10.The Monologue , the protagonist's scenes with superior officers , ex girlfriend, his arrival in Stanford are all extremely well-done.It has got all the elements of an intelligent comedy. In fact thats what raises our expectations from rest of the movie so high and may be thats the reason why quite a few people dint like this moviebecause then the plot gets quite boring ,It deals with him encountering series of accidents/collisions ,his attempts of solving them,linking them with each other simultaneously dealing with entire police staff who are against him.it still has some comic relief ,funny characters , mystery and action but its nothing compared to the beginning and its too long almost 80 minutes .Thats why i would rate it 5/10then we come to the part of revelation of the mystery and its aftermath this last 40 minutes are full of hard core action oriented humor and false endings {the ones where u think the movie will end but it doesn't}in short its still an above average mystery>comedy>action film.but its quite ""overarated"" too.IMDb rating 8.3 is quite misleading.May be it has something ""in "" exclusively for British viewer which others just don't get it. {pardon my writing/language skills}",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"A Decent British Comedy, But Nothing Timeless","After doing a good job and making other officers look bad, a detective is transferred to a sleepy village where everything is done for the greater good. Soon, he begins to clean up... but there's a killer on the loose! So this vacation gets a bit more exciting because this silt just got real.As I write this, this film is ranked the 148th greatest film of all time. I'm sorry, it's not that good. ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a better film, I can name a dozen better comedies. This was good, but not that good. More often than not it just drags on and offers nothing original to the long list of movies it follows. I mean, it's primary gags rely on ripping off ""Bad Boys II"" and ""Point Break"" (see my review of this elsewhere). How is that clever? The beginning is funny, but stops after maybe ten minutes. One character is interesting -- the supposed killer (played by Timothy Dalton) who ""slashes prices"" and has deals that are ""criminal"". I think without him and his theme music the entire movie would have been a failure.The basic plot is not unlike ""The Wicker Man"". The creators clearly acknowledge this by having the original actor from ""Wicker Man"" appear (I believe his name is Edward Woodward). And I'll tell you, I enjoyed the original film much better (though I think ""Hot Fuzz"" is better than the Nicolas Cage remake). This just doesn't have the timeless quality and weird musical undertones.If you liked ""Shaun of the Dead"", you'll like this. Maybe you'll even like it better. Maybe you're like everyone else and think this is one of the greatest films ever. I don't get it, but if someone could clue me in I'd be happy to give the film a second chance. It runs too long, goes too slow and just doesn't hold my attention. At least it has some good murder scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Possibly Better Than The Previous Pegg Effort,"PC Nicolas Angel finds himself transferred to the sleepy English town of Sandford . This coincides with a series of mysterious deaths and PC Angel becomes convinced that these deaths are not accidents but a murder campaignThis is the follow up hit to SHAUN OF THE DEAD , a horror comedy that became a big international hit but a film I personally found uninvolving . HOT FUZZ is a much more satisfying amalgam of urban cop moved to a rural setting along with blackly comical events happening to the inhabitants that eventually mutates in to full blown horror comedy . Perhaps the fact that you're expecting a far more conventional cop thriller / whodunnit mixed in with the humour works in its favour ? Certainly the final third seems at odds with what's gone before and this shouldn't be taken as a criticismThe major disappointment is with the cast which on paper is very impressive featuring well regarded character actors as Considine , Dalton , Woodward , Whitelaw and Cranham . In truth they're superfluous and unknowns could have easily been cast since they aren't given a lot to work with . Not surprisingly either because this is a comedy star vehicle for Simon PeggAs a footnote the fictional town of Sandford also received a name check in the opening pre-title sequence of 28 WEEKS LATER that was released at the same time and one wonders if this merely coincidence or if British film makers are required to use a mythical name of Sandford in order to receive filming permission for rural towns",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"Pegg, Wright and Frost at their Finest,","Hot Fuzz is a phenomenal movie with an extremely well developed plot and a stellar comedic cast that also shine in more tense moments. It is a wild ride from start to finish, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright really put their heart and soul in to this script, continuing to do so when creating the film. The layers to the plot, the characters and the world they created is unbelievable, they clearly put in as much thought as possible and it shows in every frame.It starts off seeming like a straight up comedy, and it is absolutely hilarious, maintaining the humour we have come to expect from these guys with Shaun of the Dead. However, as the plot continues, it gets very intense, and the finale had me at the edge of my seat in suspense. It manages to be funny, thrilling and somewhat frightening all at once.The cast is all around terrific, the layers to every character is exquisite thanks to a clear back and forth with the director. It is always a pleasure to see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost on screen together, their chemistry is undeniable. Pegg plays a character far beyond what we have come to expect from him as an actor, portraying a stern police officer and showcasing his versatility. They are also joined by Jim Broadbent and Timothy Dalton, who fit in to this world perfectly, delivering some of their best work, as well as several great minor roles from British actors and comedians throughout.Edge of your seat hilarity. Funny, ridiculously well structured and suspenseful, there really is nothing else out there like Hot Fuzz, and is a film that reminds me why I love watching movies in the first place, would recommend to all moviegoers.A police officer is put in to a small country town outside of London.

England Delivers !,"Genre parody is running rampant currently, probably because Hollywood is so out of ideas at this point that they've gone down to the level of making fun of their own crap with even more crap that basically every year we get another slew of pop culture regurgitation in the form of Genre Movie and kids films like Shrek, Happily N'Ever After, and Hoodwinked to make sure nothing worth seeing doesn't have its hilarious counterpart. That is why we need people like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.The thing about Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz is that both of them manage to make fun of, respect, AND transcend their own genres. Shaun of the Dead isn't just a funny reworking of zombie horror flicks, its a damn good zombie horror flick in its own right, and also breaks new ground with the genre. The exact same thing is true with Hot Fuzz. Where any sarcastic Hollywood genre satire would try to show how dumb a cliché is by making it even more outrageous, Edgar Wright simply has the characters say, ""But that would create a lot of paperwork."" Where a lesser parody would make an obvious twist as a nod to obvious twists, Simon Pegg finds out that the motivations for the recent crimes is really much simpler.But beyond that, these films are good films, removed from genre, in their own right. Hot Fuzz uses a style of quick-cut editing to match the ridiculous quick-cut editing that's become popular in such ridiculous nonsensical films as Domino and Walking Tall, but they don't over extend it to show how ridiculous it can get... rather, they learn something about the form and most importantly make the editing extremely, extremely good. Hot Fuzz has quick saturated action film editing, but it does it in a way that leads the eye gracefully through the action, thus one upping every other bad action flick being ground out by Hollywood.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
better then Shaun.... i don't think so.,"It wasn't bad, just disappointing. The basic story was good and it had some nice funny bits, but overall the characters and story didn't work for me the way they did in Shaun of the Dead.Shaun was very funny AND serious. The bit where he shoots his mum and the end with Ed were actually moving. Also, the pacing, framing and choice of music were bloody perfection. No matter how funny it got, i believed the characters, their actions and what was happening in the story. I was involved! Hot Fuzz never really made me believe in that world and the story taking place. It was mainly just silly. It had holes the size of my socks and i didn't think all the characters worked. I thought it was a bit of a mess. A fun mess, but i was hoping for a movie that got to me more than just a few laughs.And it reminded me WHY i hate movies from directors like Michael Bay. The action scenes were not done with a great deal of thought or cinematic feel. Just - get a lot of camera's running + shake them about a bit + cut it together in a pace were no shot can be seen longer then a second + add to that a loud soundtrack = and you have yourself an action scene.

Surprisingly overrated,"By no means a dud, Hot Fuzz tries a little too hard but does not necessarily capture all the magic that came with skewing zombie flicks. This time around the Wright/Pegg alliance dish out an overly long police parody and while there are still quite a lot of hits, the misses are there as well. Many of the jokes are not so much funny as they are intelligent, as has always been the plight of those damn smart Brits and their attempts at tickling our funny-bones.So, while you may find yourself with a consistently warped smirk across your face, indulging in all the tiny witticisms, mediocre (disguised as brilliant) comedic timing, and half-baked pop references, seldom do the rip-roaring laughs come fast and furious. All the excessive hyper-edits might have given this rural English laugher a fresh sheen but really did nothing to compliment the little hilarity present, and instead became a tad repetitious and distracting, as if the technical competency seemed over-excessive to disguise a lack of gut-busting material found in the script.Fans of the cult fave Shaun of the Dead will not question any of these inconsistencies for a second, gleefully eating it up with a knife and fork (as the thunderous chorus of hallowed praise for this film has indicated) but for those going in completely unbiased, exercise caution.

Does for action films what Cabin in the Woods did for horror films,"What happens when London's most dedicated cop is sent to a crime-free town, and is partnered up with the chief's witless son? Well... you get ""Hot Fuzz"". Now I want to point out that this is my first review, so please go easy on me, 'cause I'm not a professional film reviewer. Nicholas Angel is London's top police officer, but his jealous colleagues decide he's too good, so they conspire to transfer him to the quiet village of Sandford, where he is then partnered up with the chief's son, Danny Butterman. Angel is unable to switch off, while Butterman has seen one too many cop movies. When two members of the Sandford Dramatic Society are found decapitated on the outskirts of Sandford, everyone thinks that it was an accident, but Angel suspects that it was murder as more people end up dead.Now, I must confess that I'm not a huge fan of comedies, mainly because I just don't have a very good sense of humour, the only comedies I really love are ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"", which was from the same director (Edgar Wright), but when I saw this movie I knew I was in for a good time, and although I don't remember laughing that much when I first saw it, I did laugh quite a bit after watching it multiple times, as some of the scenes were very funny.But ""Hot Fuzz"" is also an action film, and does it succeed as an action- comedy? Yes, it does, as this movie pokes fun at every action cliché there ever was, I'm not going to list them off because that would take frigging forever, all I'm going to say is while Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg were writing the script, they read a book by film critic Roger Ebert (R.I.P.) that included every action movie clichés so they could use all of them, which leads me to think if that's what the screenwriters of ""Cabin in the Woods"" did, because as the title suggests, this movie does for action films what that did for horror, despite the fact that this and ""Cabin in the Woods"" were filmed three years apart.Simon Pegg I thought was fantastic in his role, he really developed as time went on, he really got used to his partner, he was just awesome, Nick Frost was also very funny in the movie, and you could tell that he's seen one too many action movies (as I said earlier), and some of his lines were some of the funniest in the film. Among the very funny cast is Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, as well as cameos by Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan and Cate Blanchett in an excellent uncredited cameo as Angel's ex. Overall, everyone's performances were all excellent.Now among the films that this film references and spoofs are 'Point Break', 'Bad Boys II', 'Chinatown', 'A Fistful of Dollars', 'The Shining', 'Trainspotting', as well as some movies you'd know would reference/spoof and others you'd never expect.Overall, Hot Fuzz is one of my favourite, if not my absolute favourite, comedies, I'm going to give it a 10/10 on my Miner-Meter. Thank you guys so much for reading and I hope this entices you to see the movie, expect more reviews in the future",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
One of the best British comedy/action films ever,"I entered the cinema with a bit of trepidation. I was hoping Hot Fuzz would be as good as Shaun of the Dead but didn't expect it to be. But after two hours of non-stop entertainment I was completely blown away.Once again Pegg and Frost show their comic qualities as a double act in this laugh out loud gem. Timothy Dalton is perfectly cast as the villainous Simon Skinner.Think of Bad Boys 2 with a better script, set in the countryside and a hundred times better then most Hollywood blockbusters and then you go some way of defining Hot Fuzz. It's hot stuff. Don't miss it; it would be criminal.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Good but not great,"I love any kind of comedy and this movie was definitely funny...but it wasn't that funny. This is just one of those movies that has a cult following and people love it more for that reason. If it was a multi million dollar movie and highly advertised not as many people would find it as funny. It has a lot of little moments that are worth a laugh, but I did not find myself hysterically laughing much. The camera work is pretty cool and the cuts are pretty neat. Even if the movie was not a comedy it would still look very good. It is also British which makes it much more funny to listen to foreign actors swear and so forth. The movie is definitely worth a watch, but is is overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Brilliant,"I only just watched this movie, but I can already tell you that I will be rewatching this over and over for years. I'm usually not a fan of visual gags, but this movie is full of brilliant and artistic imagery that create a comedic atmosphere for the whole movie. It's brilliant the way Hot Fuzz uses camera work, editing, and in some cases, acting to make visual gags that are as funny as they are striking. To me, this is a near perfect movie that will maybe in the future, become one of my favorite movies. It may not be for everyone, but I can recommend Hot Fuzz to a variety of people I know.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Simon Peggs for James Bond.....,"There are no laugh-out loud, pee yourself moments in Hot Fuzz. -Well, maybe one comes close;, that's not what HF is about. This is a Simon Pegg film so, in a sense, in doesn't matter what its about -what you get, is that Nice Simon Pegg doing what he does so well -Being Nice. Simon Pegg represents the kind of person wed all like to know (or to be) no one does Nice like him -Cast him in any part and our sympathies are with his character. If he'd been in The Shining wed have handed him the fire axe, patted him on the head, and shoo him upstairs to polish of that nasty wife and little kid. Simon Pegg as Darth Vader; wed sympathise with that nasty sore throat. Nice is what he does, and to wheel out a cliché -nobody does it better. HF is in many ways a very reactionary piece of work: harking back to the golden era of Dads Army and Lively Lads or further back to the Ealing comedies. The jokes are mostly telegraphed a reel or two ahead so you can get back from making the tea in time for a chortle, and there's none of that smutty new-wave comedy to disturbed the middle-England tranquillity of the (apparently) sleepy village of Sandford. I smiled a lot in this movie -the homo-erotic undertone of the relationship between hopelessly uptight Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Pegg) and big hearted PC Danny Butterman is beautifully played. There's also a bewildering array of British comedy luminaries to gawk at. As to the plot, well its a load of nonsense about dark goings-on in rural paradise. But then, you're not watching this for the plot, or for that matter the laughs. Its Pegg's film, literally as well as figuratively -you're watching to be reassured that somewhere out there, there really are nice, decent people doing nice, decent things, and, in this area HF delivers in spades. Watch it, enjoy it & don't feel guilty about it. Now that's got me thinking..how about Simon Peggs as the next James Bond -don't laugh -think about it for a minute.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Well, It isn't  (hot  fuzz)","It's OK movie but no way it deserves such high score and ran in best 250 movies.First of all is not quite comedy.

Hot Fuzz - Sorry I didn't get the black humor!,"Hot Fuzz Sometimes it happens that you don't get it; and this was the movie for me. I didn't get it. There are bad Hollywood movies, there are bad Bollywood movies and this was a bad British movie! The story is about a brilliant London cop Nicholos Angel (Simon Pegg)  who is so good that the whole police force wants him to be transferred to a small town called Sandford, where the action, crime, comedy, emotions, and all the senseless stuff begins. There are series of murders in the town and Simon Pegg with the help of fellow cop played by Martin Freeman exposes Timothy Dalton (James Bond fame) and others.The movie is so stupid and idiotic that it blew over my sense of humor too. I didn't get it.A few credible things about the movie was that in the name of comedy it was taking a joke on the movie and its star, the background score was jelling well with the tone of the movie and the editing was slick.But the team of young Director Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg has not succeeded for the second time; their first attempt was also another horrid movie - Shaun of the Dead.The whole theatre was outrageously laughing and I felt that I was on a different planet. Such things have happened too often to me viewing crude Indian comedies. Sorry I do not get this humor! (Stars 1.5 out of 10)",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"A Truly Great Mix of Comedy, Mystery, and Action","Hot Fuzz is a rare gem that is surprisingly better than its critical acclaim. It is a film that can easily be enjoyed as long as you don't mind its gratuitous violence at parts, but it is not the type of film that would garnish nominations for awards since it is more about entertainment than dramatic intent. It's sad that this is the case because it proves to be a solid movie through and through, breaking various conventions to make it stand out as well as implementing humor that is well beyond the likes of many comedies which come out in this day and age.From the start, the film has a recognizable distinct style involving high intensity editing and excellent cinematography. The opening sequence features a monologue by Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) highlighting his amazing credentials as a police officer in London over a montage of his work in the field which supports those credentials. The visual style that is established in this sequence engages the viewer and proves to never be a bore as it is used throughout the film.Once again, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are at the core of the movie, and their relationship in this film is much more interesting than their relationship in the predecessor of this film in the Cornetto trilogy: Shaun of the Dead. Whereas in Shaun of the Dead the two were great friends and the core problem was that Frost's character somewhat held Pegg back, in this film Pegg and Frost develop an unlikely friendship after Pegg mentors Frost throughout the film on how to improve as a police officer. On the other hand, Pegg learns from Frost that there is excitement in being a police officer (as seen through action movies which Frost's character is captivated by) and that Pegg should not take the job (and life for that matter) too seriously.The solution to the ""mystery"" in the film seems too obvious as it is heavily implied in the first half of the film, but the truth and motivation is so unexpected it actually produces laughs with its shock factor. After this reveal, Hot Fuzz takes a turn to be more dramatic and features an action-packed third act which proves to be great fun.Smart, well-made, and hilarious, Hot Fuzz is the type of film that would simply be a shame to miss out on.4.0/4.0",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Get the Oven Mitts!,"I have to say I was skeptical about watching this movie, everyone I knew that had seen it actually told me that it was a cheap rip-off of Reno nine-one-one.

So here it is years later and it comes up on Netflix and I finally decide to watch it because I absolutely love Simon Pegg I've watched all of his other movies and I think he's just phenomenal!

"""This is something I've to do myself!""","HOT FUZZ is a nice cop movie that we can easily insert in the action/comedy genre. It has very intelligent humor with nice and sharpened jokes, but also silly scenes with brainless funny moments.Simon Pegg does the main role and one more time he does a good job; a bit different from what I was used to see from him, but good. The rest of the acting is also fine.I'm not quite sure if it was a tribute or a spoof but that clear reference to BAD BOYS II near the end was kind of strange and explicit I must say! However, I guess we can split this film into two parts: one before that reference, and another after that. In the first half, it's a bit slow paced and centers in the investigation on the murders NICHOLAS ANGEL (Simon Pegg) did. The second half (about the last 30 minutes) begins when NICHOLAS says ""This is something I've to do myself"" after see the BAD BOYS II DVD cover on a gas stationThis part is all about the action in a very fast pace! Nice action scenes were done here I must say.I did enjoy this movie, especially for the action and the jokes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"Interesting in the beginning ,disappointing till the end!!!!!!","A top London cop who is so good at his job that he makes his fellow officers look like slackers by comparison is ""promoted"" to serve in the sleepy village of Sandford in this contemporary action comedy from the creators of Shaun of the Dead. Police constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) always gets his man, but these days his impeccable record seems to be more indicative of his fellow officers' shortcomings than his own formidable skills as a keeper of the peace. Loathe to stand idly by as their once respectable track record is steadily soiled by the hyper-competent actions of one lone overachiever, Sergeant Angel's superiors at the Met soon determine to remedy their problem by relocating the decorated constable to the West Country village of Sanford -- where tranquil garden parties and neighborhood watch meetings stand in stark contrast to the violent crime and heated gunplay of the city. As Sergeant Angel does his best to adjust to the relative calm of his new environment, his oafish new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) strives to gain the respect of his fellow constables while sustaining himself on fantasies of his favorite action films and police shows. Later, just as it begins to appear as if Sergeant Angel has been relegated to an uneventful existence in the relative calm of the countryside, a series of horrific ""accidents"" lead him to suspect that the tranquil hamlet of Sanford has fallen prey to a sinister plot which reeks of foul play. Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Steve Coogan, and Martin Freeman co-star in the Edgar Wright film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Genre revisionism at its most brazen,"The difficultly to define Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz is one of the things that makes Hot Fuzz such a fun and original film. It very much finds itself at a crossroads of genres rather than operating in one specific realm of cinematic classification. If you simply bill the film as a comedy, despite it largely being one, you're neglecting to mention the excessive amounts of violence that often isn't played for laughs, the immense amount of action spectacle, and even the mystery and crime element essential to the plot. If you simply call it a crime film (being that ""action"" isn't one of the six main genres), you dismiss the ubiquitous elements of parody and satire that bleed through nearly every scene of the film.The film focuses on the incredibly serious police officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), who is working with his bumbling partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) in order to investigate exactly why and how the town of Stanford has went more than two decades without a murder, yet the town always seems to be caught up in little accidents that find its citizens killed. The two embark on a journey that involves corruption, secret groups, and unfathomable bloodshed all while trying to uphold the integrity Stanford still has in itself and its name.The way I see it, Hot Fuzz is an amalgamation of comedy and crime, and maybe with a sprinkle of horror. The comedy is largely classifiable as screwball, as it's largely bent on dialog and the idea that everybody but Simon Pegg's Officer Nicholas Angel character is the only serious soul in a sea of bumbling and blissfully ignorant buffoons. The crime element largely stems from the inherent mystery as to why the town of Stanford has remained murder/crime-free for an upwards of two decades, and that core mystery is what kicks the plot into motion. The aforementioned horror elements are very sporadic, but largely stem from the execution of the murders, which largely disrupt the flow of the film, regardless of what genre it was working towards in the momentary. The murder scenes are often abrupt and occupied by vicious bloodshed that turns the film from a goofy comedy into a vicious and violent picture.Speaking in a descriptive sense - one that has the film operating in a very subversive sense - Hot Fuzz largely occupies a fictitious world, where characters occasionally act as if they're too dumb to function like normal human beings. Consider the over-dramatized reactions of much of the townspeople of Stanford, specifically the officials who are keeping the murders a secret. They are broadly drawn caricatures where, in a more conventional crime film, they'd be slicker, more believable, and more passable as key players in a conspiracy movement. With that, the writing team of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright (and occasionally Nick Frost with the other two installments of the Cornetto Trilogy), there is an emphasis on merging genres that allow for broad, satirical comedy in addition to gruesome bloodshed. The excessive, unrelenting violence in ""Hot Fuzz"" is noteworthy being that it often comes after some witty dialog or situational humor. This creates a very evident narrative dichotomy that emphasizes revisionist principles in terms of merging genres rather than sticking to one particular genre.Speaking in a prescriptive sense - one that has the film adhering to conventions and preconceived genre formulas - Hot Fuzz abides by comedic conventions by way of dialog, a common approach in satire. Consider the scene when Nicholas speaks to the older woman and she randomly shouts ""Fascist!"" towards Nicholas, stopping him in his tracks before realizing she is filling in a box on her crossword puzzle. The same trope is used when Nicholas says ""hag,"" referring to another answer on the woman's crossword puzzle, despite the fact that Nicholas utters it like he's referring to her. This is a fairly recognizable attempt at comedy – the classic misunderstanding to us, the audience, between the characters in the film. Comedic convention also arises from the fact that characters are put in a situation they'd rather not be in, or one that's precarious to their safety, well-being, or specific morals. Nicholas Angel being paired up with Nick Frost's Danny Butterman, a goofy but well-meaning police officer, adheres to comedic convention because the two are polar opposites; Angel is stern and self-sufficient whereas Butterman is the more roly-poly type of cop who often seems in it for the fun.For the crime aspect, despite Hot Fuzz, in a way, rebelling against the conventions of buddy-cop comedies by having the two mismatched leads discover and infiltrate a conspiracy, the film does indeed play by the genre's tropes. In the end, the bad guys are violently defeated, the two leads learn to embrace what makes one another unique and their own person, and two men we've followed since the beginning of the film come out on top. This is a very classical element in a film that, in many ways, is largely revisionist. However, in order to incorporate the new, you need to have some of the old, which is why the descriptive aspect of the film is just as important as its more descriptive aspects.Above all, it's the ridiculousness and the sheer outlandish premise that draws us to Hot Fuzz; there's a magnetic sense of urgency that attaches us to the characters and their personalities from the start. Seeing one character, who is stern and serious, alongside a goofier archetype both get into sticky situations no matter how hard they try, is one that, when taken here, feels fun and fresh thanks to Pegg and Wright's variety of situational humor. Hot Fuzz is very much genre revisionism, and in a prescriptive sense, it's a film that emphasizes its differences from the comedy, crime, and action genre rather than the conventions of the aforementioned genres that it abides by throughout the course of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"VERY, very funny","HOT FUZZ is a very funny movie, but it works by (mostly) playing it straight. In fact, for the first half of the movie, Simon Pegg makes a fairly credible action hero.I don't know that I'd call HOT FUZZ a send-up, or a parody, because it does play so straight. I'd call it more of a highly-skewed homage. The plot is negligible, though I've seen worse in mainstream action flicks. The lines are delivered with the same kind of earnest weight you'd see in any number of cop-buddy movies.The story bogs down for a while in the middle, but that's because it's setting up for the climax.

Bright Satire,"Most of the artists attached to Shaun of the Dead, that dead on spoof of zombie films, are responsible for the action, buddy-cop satire, Hot Fuzz. The wit in both is similar, straddling between irreverent takes of the genre while still providing a fast-paced, somewhat suspenseful story. Hot Fuzz isn't the classic Shaun has turned out to be, but it is an enjoyably humorous skewering of the US's Die Hard and Lethal Weapon franchises and UK police dramas, sharp enough to make Richard Donner, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Michael Bay uncomfortable.London Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is reassigned to quiet hamlet Sanford because he's just too good a cop (400 percent better than anyone else). They need him to go so they don't look so bad by comparison. Angel is type A, left-brained obsessive compulsive on whom no clue or righteous arrest is lost. Pursuing a rogue swan is clearly beneath him in this quiet town, but soon he intrepidly investigates suspicious deaths related to the town's interest in the best- town-in-England prize.His buddy cop, PC Danny Butterman ( Nick Frost) provides the dufus- with-a-heart laughs, allowing for plenty of yin/yang contrasts between the uptight sergeant and the loose patrolman. Underneath the sometimes absurd but amusing interchanges lies a dialogue about the need to make judgments about who should be jailed and who is no danger to society (such as teenage drinkers better off in jail than on the streets and street performers posing minimal threat to society).Witticisms abound such as the names fitting the characters (cop as Angel, reporter as Messenger) and numerous borrowings from setups and dialogue in other films (Point Break, Dirty Harry, and Straw Dogs, etc.). The homoerotic subtext in many of these references is gently hinted at.But all in all, it is a bright satire that somehow ends up being a minor sermon on the dangers of perfection and the joys of experiencing life in wholly different ways.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

The difference here is this one rides its own merits of story, character and plot while reminiscing about those great to mediocre action movies of the past without simply twisting a scene directly form those movies.Like their last outing, ""Shaun of the Dead"", they made a movie here with just the right amounts of jokes and didn't rely too much on gags.A definite must see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

He gets called to the station one day, and is offered a promotion to sergeant, the downside being that he has to leave London, to take his sergeant post in the crime-free, idyllic country town of Sandford, Gloucestershire. When he declines the offer, stating that he enjoys his current job, it turns out that it is no offer after all. The reasoning behind this is that he is so good at what he does, that he is making the rest of the police look bad. He is left with no choice but to take the post and leave London.In Sandford he is partnered with fellow police officer Danny Butterman, played by Nick frost, a childish and naive man, with whom Pegg's character gradually builds a friendship with. Danny and Nicholas are polar opposites. Nicholas is a perfectionist and a workaholic, while Danny is a slacker who longs for a more cinematic, action filled life. Against all odds, their personality turns out to be a perfect fit, as Nicholas mentors Danny to become a better officer, while Danny teaches Nicholas to ""switch off"".As the days go by, strange deaths starts to occur, and while Nicholas suspects murder, the rest of the force brushes it off as accidents. Maybe this town is not so crime-free after all.This all leads up to a very satisfying climax, one that I do not wish to spoil. All that I can say is that it is action packed, hilarious and exquisitely put together.Edgar Wright's comedies rely heavily on timing, and this film is no exception. The movie moves fast, and the jokes move along even faster. You can watch it over and over, and always find something new to laugh at. It is filled to the brim with jokes, each joke funnier than the last one. He has a very distinct style of cutting, with fast scenes used as transitions or visual gags. These scenes are usually very clear and straight to the point, such as the scene when he travels to Sandford, a very fast sequence of clips, primarily highlighting the facts that not much is happening.After writing, starring and directing ""Shaun of the dead"" Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg turn their sights to the action/comedy genre, transposing the usual American fare and bringing it to a rustic English setting. Simon Pegg has once again proved that he is not only good with zombies but also has a Cop, oh sorry!- Super Cop. This movie is not just a master piece but also a treat of comedy, action and a real sense of humor. Simon Pegg decides in this film to take more of a straight man role and leaves most of the comedy to his friend Nick Frost, who does not let him down giving what could just have been the stooge role of Danny Butterman a great deal of charm and pathos. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are both great in their roles, delivering their dialogue perfectly. They are a perfect duo. The rest of the supporting cast do their jobs supremely well, from the Oscar-winning Jim Broadbent, through to Olivia Coleman, Kevin Eldon, Anne Reid, Adam Buxton, Bill Bailey and the supremely brilliant Timothy Dalton who excels as the seemingly obvious villain of the piece. The script and the direction are superb and the film switches effortlessly between comedy and action and occasionally horror. The other mistake that the film so deftly avoids is the desire to slap some kind of love interest in there. There is nothing you can expect in an entertainment more than this. I'm a huge fan of the duo. The chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is simply admirable.Hot Fuzz"" is at it's best with the many laugh out loud moments: the runaway goose, translating the local dialect, the human statue ""threat"", the bodyguard who just says ""Naarp!"", and wordplay twists throughout. These smart bits of humor make the film a keeper just be prepared for high action and some gore with your laughs. I give it a whooping 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Hot Fuzz,"I propose that if Quentin Tarentino made comedies, his name would be Edgar Wright: Both filmmakers share a cult sensibility, a smartly allusionary approach, and a load of talent. All of these elements are at play in Hot Fuzz, stylistically notable for its sequences of intense montage--its best moments invoke artful synthesis and Michael Bay chaos in equal measure-- and for Wrights's keen sense of visual irony, particularly when drawing on the hilariously stoic Simon Pegg. Wright makes great films, his distinctly filmic sense of humor is a much-needed departure from Hollywood jokiness, Hot Fuzz is awesome and you really should have seen Scott Pilgrim.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Get your Cornettos ready!,"It's truly an incredible movie that does a good job of making fun of every action movie tropes.Being familiar of Wright's work, it's one of those films that require a second viewing in order to fully appreciate it.It's one of the best action-comedies out there!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Here Comes the FUZZ!,"Yes yes a thousand times yes. Everything about this is incredible. It's hilarious, a great action movie, stunning editing and somehow manages to be a perfect parody of action films while also being one of the greatest action films. I love everything about this. Easily my favorite of the Cornetto Trilogy and a hard recommend for everyone. This is my JAM and Wright is a genius!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Funny tongue-in-cheek spoof of American action movies...,"1st watched 10/30/2011 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Edgar Wright): Funny tongue-in-cheek spoof of American action movies with Simon Pegg playing a cop that's too good for the big city of London – so he's promoted(aka. Demoted) to be a sheriff of a small village because he's making everyone look bad. The same team that made ""Shaun of the Dead"" was involved in this British farce that sometimes goes a little overboard late in the movie, but for the most part is laugh-out-loud funny. They kind of do an-overdone last half hour action scene but add gags in the middle of everything to help you realize that even the drawn-out action is part of the farce. The perfect police officer finds people to arrest in the new village the night of his arrival, even before he's officially on the job. A few deaths then start to occur and he starts suspecting something fishy is going on. Of course, the locals, say the deaths are just accidents because the village is going for ""village of the year"" and couldn't have the ""m"" word(murder) happen in their little bungalow. His partner, played by Nick Frost, is about the only one who believes him and plays a great sidekick to the straight-laced Pegg. The rest of the cast does their part, but the writing and Pegg's straight-lace portrayal is what makes the movie work. The movie really isn't about one-liners but instead just the idea that the ones making the movie are laughing in their heads and keep straight faces so we can do the laughing. This is definitely not a perfect movie but as a comedy it is one of the better ones I've seen lately.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Force yourself!,"Go on, give it a go and you might raise a chuckle! But, whatever you do, don't expect much from Hot Fuzz. I've never walked out a cinema no matter how bad the film was, but this really tested me.Slow paced. Badly acted. Disjointed action. And the most dreadful crime of an un-funny comedy.It's not easy making a comedy film; you've got to appeal to a wide variety of tastes. US comedies tend to amuse rather than have you laughing out loud. Except for the slap stick! Hot Fuzz being a British production you expect a more intelligent script, wittier and sharper writing. But it just ""plods"" along at a pace which would make a snail look like Usain Bolt.Cinema audience chuckled at most, certainly never laughed out loud. And that's all I can remember as my mind has blocked out this terrible experience! What's the best I can say about this? There hasn't been a Hot Fuzz 2.....My girlfriend never laughed once throughout the whole film. But she's also my ex-girlfriend as nothing would please her!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
One of the best crime comedies ever!,"Hot Fuzz is now 10 years old ,so it is a good opportunity to review the gem of action, crime and comedy .For starters ,it is the second film in the Cornetto trilogy which is the brain-child of Simon Peg with his friends Edgar Wright and Nick Frost and in the film they more or less satirize and pay homage to the trademarks of buddy-cop films, while at the same time been their own thing.So the story is as follows: The ultra officer Nicholas Angel is transferred in to a tranquil village ,where things seems to be calm and the crime rate zero, not a good place for a man of action like him. But as it is obvious not all are as they look like and he tries to uncover what is happening. In general is a crime we have all seen but the way is done and the quotes are what makes this film awesome, what did we expect anything written by Simon Peg is hilarious and amazing and here he didn't disappoint.Another part of the awesomeness is the casting, they are all perfect and Timothy Dalton is the epitome of fun and sinister .And now that I mention the casting both the Hound and Walter Frey are in this one, goodness everywhere I look it seems that all the English actors and actresses are in Game of Thrones, awesome!In general the film rocks and it is the best crime comedy of the new Millennium since Snatch. It goes without saying that it is a must watch to every one who like action and comedy and cops film of course.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A phenomenal action/comedy!,"This movie is absolutely fantastic and just as good as it's predecessor! Just like Shaun of the dead this movie blends it's two genres together so well, the comedy is once again so so good and might be even funnier than the previous. I just love the style of this movie and the cinematography once again is just amazing. Once again Pegg and Frosts connection really make this movie feel real and authentic. The action is also really good and some of the scenes are really well done and with Edgar Wrights style along with it it really makes for some great cinema. I love the mystery behind the killer aswell and the big twist/reveal near the end is so good and really satisfying. I just love this movie and once again just like Shaun of the dead, this is another one of my favourite films ever made! I absolutely love it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Decidedly mixed,"If you're going to see this film, then doubtless you'll have already seen Shaun of the Dead, and probably Spaced, the three having more similarities than differences. So you have a reasonable idea of what it's going to be like, and if it'll be your thing.I think this film is a bit of a mess. Structurally, it's gapingly flawed. The opening third turns into more like the opening two thirds, hence the entire film has to take place in the last thirty minutes or so. It can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a cop action thriller, a horror movie, or a late night Sunday TV drama.Basing a film around police in England is difficult, because everybody hates them, especially after the de Menezes shooting. These ones they try to make appealing by having them mostly goof off all day and eat ice-cream. This merely makes us hate them more.Others have commented on the lack of laughs in the movie. It's completely true. They seem to have just forgotten to put the jokes in there. I can only assume they went for a 'funny in a difficult to describe way' feel, and ended up with a film as limp and dead as a mattress that's just been pulled from the bottom of the ocean. What we're seeing is more of an animated storyboard with full script to come.Oh, and Timothy Dalton is very miscast as the lead villain. You end up feeling sorry for him. His every look and gesture seem to say ""Remember me? I played James Bond once. I was unnverving and disturbing. I was critically acclaimed for it. Now here I am running a rural supermarket. I'm worth more than this."" Overall, my argument here is with the director, Edgar Wright. Shaun of the Dead worked well, so it's surprising to see another film of his bungled so incompetently. Having a hit and being Brit cinema's next big hope always seems to be the kiss of death, condemning your next five projects to be overblown, Yank-pandering confusothons. Just ask Guy Ritchie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Unique, Creative, First Of Its Kind Ending","This movie well deserves the eight I gave It. I have seen many movies, and this one was slightly better than most. It was an English film. I have not seen many English films, and there are not many played here in America. The movie has not come out here yet, it has only come out in I think Ireland.Anyway, I will make sure not to spoil it for you. The story is fascinating. No movie that I have ever seen has had a story line similar to this one, as with many new movies, how many movies are very similar to others. Movies stories that prove to be good story lines tend to produce copy cats, I have seen this a couple times. With this one, I may be seeing or hearing about others with a similar story. But, the greats are the ones that are the first of its kind, or the only one of its kind, or the best of its kind.As you probably know, this is action movie, but don't expect to see much action. The majority of the action is in the last ten minutes of this film. It is not a spoiler to tell you that there is a killer in this movie. It would spoil it if I told you who the killer was. The answer to who the killer is and the reason for the killing is the first of its kind, a very unique one.So, check it out for yourself, and I doubt that you will not like it.P.S. I do not usually write reviews, this film was an exception since the twist at the end was so unique and creative.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"In 5 Lines or Less - ""Hot Fuzz"" (Movie Review)","Having missed ""Shaun of the Dead"" I wasn't sure what to expect from Pegg and the gang.Suffice to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Everyone in this movie looks like they're having a great time and that sense of fun just oozes out of the movie in a way that's incredibly infectious.Pegg is brilliant at playing the straight man and setting up Nick Frost for all the best lines in the movie. Of course, as a British comedy, the film is awash with unexpected gems from all the characters.The ultimate compliment is that this will probably end up in me renting ""Shaun of the Dead"" just to have another dose of this crew's hi-jinx.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
The funniest film of 2007,"I didn't think any English comedy could be as good as Shaun of the Dead, and so far I'm right... But this little number comes achingly close. It tells the story of a cop who is moved to a small country town, with hilarious results. Its the same kind of thing as Shaun of the dead, if you've seen it. It sends up police films and TV shows in this case. It makes fun of everything from bad boys to point break as you'll find out. It is extremely violent, perhaps even more so than 'Shaun'. It gives a joke a second, it is absolutely filled with jokes. There were few times where I didn't find myself laughing or at least laughing from a joke I heard a second ago. Unfortunately, it isn't quite as good as Shaun of the Dead, it could be because I'm not such a big fan of cop films, but i think its because, despite my previous raving review, the jokes aren't as good or as memorable. I saw the film just before i wrote this and I've already forgotten most of the things that made me laugh. Unlike 'Shaun', where i was rehearsing entire scenes and repeating some of the great one liners to everyone i knew. I still am telling everyone about this film... but first i will make sure to say, ""have you seen the other film by these guys? Shaun of the dead."" All in all this is a great film funniest one this year even, and you should see it. Maybe don't bring the kids though, not only will they not get it, but they'll probably have nightmares from some of ghastly gory scenes in this one. Anyway its one of my favourites: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Nothing like a bit of girl on girl!,"This is, without any doubt whatever, the funniest movie this year and one of the funniest I have ever seen. Simon Pegg is simply brilliant; both as an actor and a writer.To see him together again with Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead, Kinky Boots) was pure pleasure. In addition, there were several favorites from other films - Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, and Timothy Dalton.Edgar Wright was simply brilliant as the director. The action kept building and building until it reached a fever pitch. Just when you thought it was over, it came again, and then it came again. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, laughing my ass off.I want more from Pegg and Wright!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"By The Power Of Greyskull, This Is A Funny Movie!!!","Nick Angel is the top cop in London, with arrests that are 400% higher then anyone else in his department. This doesn't look so good for everyone else, so the decision to ship him off to a small village is made. Angel arrives and finds it difficult to cope with the lack of real crime and the lack of policing in the village. Not until bodies begin to pile high does Nick suspect something sinister is up and about and he goes an and action rampage trying to solve this mystery.If the names Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright sound vaguely familiar to you, then you've probably seen the overly funny ""Shaun of the Dead"". After the release of that film, it became an instant cult classic that ran a thin line between comedy, romance and horror. Now these guys are at it again, this time in the buddy cop action genre. It's safe to say they've knocked it out of the park, yet again. It's refreshing seeing talent delve into more then one specific genre, which can only mean bigger and greater things in the future.Hot Fuzz does for action films what Shaun of the Dead did for horror. Bring a unique comedic style and touch to a genre that has been done to death and somehow manage to pull off a great film. Just like Shaun, Fuzz has the same actors making an appearance, where some are in cameo roles like Bill Nighy as the Chief Inspector, right down to the two main stars themselves; Pegg and Frost, who are a perfect comedic pair together. Much to my surprise there were two more cameos, I don't want to give them away, but look closely at the Santa Clause who stabs Nick and his masked girlfriend.From the beginning of the film you can tell that Wright is behind the camera. The quick action cuts of every little thing (from taking your jacket off to putting your keys in the door) is done in such a fast paced way and so often, that it has somehow become his 'trademark', much like Tarantino with his trunk shot or Scorsese using Gimme Shelter. In Shaun this was used a couple of times, but here it's in almost every scene, yet it somehow compliments the film. When you're homaging and parodying action films, everything should be exaggerated, tightly shot and quickly edited. Even the small things like grabbing the telephone is done in an 'action film' style.For film buffs, it's neat to pick out the references to other films, that are literally scattered throughout Fuzz. If it's not blatant and in your face like Point Break or Straw Dogs, it's subtle and only spoken. ""Forget it Nick, It's Sandford"". Obvious reference to Chinatown. The reference range from genre to genre. Horror and action films are the main targets, and it's hard not to crack a smile when the final fight scene reminds you of Lethal Weapon.The townsfolk all play their parts well, with James Bond himself, Dalton, standing out as the devilish supermarket boss. Seeing these townsfolk being so ordinary and timid make for the climax of this film even more enjoyable. The climax itself is the entire third act of the film, which is where most of the laughs are, which is unfortunate. Unlike Shaun, that kept the laughs consistent, Fuzz goes on and off. In the scenes where the laughter is off it tends to drag on a little. This hurts the film cause these scenes could have been cut, making the film shorter and having more of an impact on the viewer. After a slow start, and a off and on funny scenes for the body of the film, it takes something special in the final act to bring the movie into greatness. Hot Fuzz has this and more in it's gun blazing, car chasing, blood splattering, third act.It's quite right to say that Wright and co. brought their horror specialties to Fuzz, as so many scenes seem like they could have been brought right out of a horror film. All of the deaths are bloody and jaw dropping; as in I did not expect it to be so graphic in this style of film. Fuzz has a hint of Shaun at every corner and of course every other buddy cop movie as well. It's horror aspect played well throughout the film, paying off in the end and of course making another reference to a well known horror film that has it's own cult following.Pegg takes a drastic turn in this film, from playing a loser that's afraid of everything to a bad ass with impressive sharp shooting schools. With Frost playing the same type of buddy sidekick with a thick skull. This time though, Frost manages to pull off some kind of pity feeling for the character. You feel sorry for him, but you don't know why. Maybe because he looks up to Angel so many times and acts like a big gorilla.In the end, Hot Fuzz indeed delivers the laughs and the action, which is all saved for the third act. It doesn't reach the greatness of Shaun, but it manages to separate itself from it and for that I can recommend it. It will drag on for some, but others will have a fun time picking out all the references to other films. Enjoy the film for what it is, a funny look on the action genre. With more then enough people and car flying in the air in slow motion from 4 or 5 different angles to please Bay fans. Fuzz is definitely worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
True Lies meets Monty Python,"Hot Fuzz is quite simply one of the funniest films to come out in years. After seeing it at the cinemas with a few friends we conclusively agreed that we have never laughed so hard in the space of two hours. Yes it's true, Hot Fuzz is absolutely great.In HF we are introduced a hardened city cop (Simon Pegg) who is assigned to a sleepy country town because his exceptional performance is reflecting poorly on his peers. Upon his arrival it is apparent the town is not only steeped in stupidity but also a close-knit series of conventions shared only amongst the townsfolk. Pegg is an outsider who must try to find acceptance as well as decipher the meaning behind a series of suspicious accidents in the shire.HF combines clever British-Comedy writing with a completely ridiculous physical violence. The later is very much in the tradition of Die Hard or Predator with extreme gun fights and brutal gore the name of the game. The former is in the vein of the British Comedy Faulty Towers. Some of the situations are predictable but Simon Pegg's displaced city cop is hilarious as he tries to contend with the idiocy on display within his new precinct. Moreover, every scene seems to have a restrained absurdity to it. Not obvious enough to make an audience openly reject the reality on screen, but subtle enough to keep you giggling the entire time. HF shines due to its tight writing and direction and lack of silly, bland sex jokes that seem to litter films these days.The fighting on display is also hilarious. HF alludes to many classic cop films in its choreography and displaces them into a sleepy English town. The result encompasses obese traffic officers diving for cover and lovable English nanny's touting machine guns in their handbags. It's amazing how the film makes these scenes accessible. The stupidity of the situation is incredibly funny partly due to the deliberately slow pacing of the first two acts of the film. This in turn complements this extreme comedic violence.Hot Fuzz is a genuine comedy classic. True Lies meets Monty Python is this film in a nutshell. I sincerely hope it attains the cult following it so thoroughly deserves.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"Funny British comedy, with the eccentricities that the Brits seem to do well","Hot Fuzz is a comedy that surprises. Seems to have a simple story, but has some quirky but interesting little twists. A laugh out loud comedy at various points, it parodies various action movies from the past which is part of its attraction.It essentially is about a hot shot cop being forcibly sent to a small village where dastardly crimes begin to happen, and he has to convince everyone that they are not accidents. Supported by a slob of a partner, and surrounded by some eccentric police colleagues, the job is never easy. Add in many typecast village folk, with a wonderful performance by Timothy Dalton as a dastardly supermarket owner, and you have a colourful catalogue of characters.Well worth a night out to watch, and will appeal to people of many ages, with great parodying, slick lines and all.

10 reasons to absolutely LOVE this film.......,"1. Originality/cleverness (Not many movies are similar to this. The movie is full of unique and one-of-a-kind humor.) 2. Jam packed with great laughs (Really, if you don't laugh throughout this movie, you were either in a bad mood to begin with, or maybe you're just not an exciting person.) 3. Plot: A super talented police-man officer (lol, get it?) gets thrown from the front line of action in the city to the country, to serve in a peaceful and perfect town, where crimes are unheard of. As he befriends others, he starts to learn that this town holds more than meets the eye.... (Well thought up, perfectly executed. Also one-of-a-kind, you can't argue with that. Character development starts with a bang in the beginning and does well the rest of the film) 4. Action/amazing special effects 5. Different each time you watch it (I've seen it 7 times now, each time I notice something different that makes the movie even better. Most of them are little, like phrases used in the beginning, then used again later on in different context.) 6. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are amazing (if you liked Shaun of the Dead, you should thoroughly love this!) 7. Old people with guns (One thing people look for in a movie, is the unexpected.) 8. Fast paced, moves along very well. (From the beginning, you're thrown into the great story and will have you watching intently the rest of the film.) 9. Unpredictable (Sure you might be psychic and predict a few things, but you'll never predict the whole movie unless your friends ruin it for you. It's got surprising twists and turns throughout with clever dialogue and such) 10. Will have you cheering! (I saw this film twice in two different locations, and both times the whole audience was vocal, in the non-annoying way. We laughed, we were trans-fixed, and we cheered more than once.) Basically, If you love comedy and kick arse action, there is no reason for you not to see and enjoy this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
The lesser entry in the trilogy,"This is not a proper review but an observation as to why I enjoyed this one less than the much better ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""The World's End"":Those two movies had realistic characters and motivations and the solid comedy was built around this. This one feels like a road-runner cartoon. This may seem weird seeing as those two movies had zombies and aliens, but I am talking about the human characters in all three movies.Almost everyone here is ridiculous, from the police in the beginning blatantly saying what normal people would hide, to the over-the-top incompetent and mocking police in the country, to the very very silly motivation behind the murders, to the way-over-the-top gun-fights between old people, and so on.That doesn't mean the film isn't funny, and the first half hour is especially strong in its hilarity, but after that, all this ridiculousness wears thin for me and the comedy is gradually replaced by a violent cartoon which is moderately entertaining at best. This is obviously personal taste and most others enjoy this film, especially thanks to its very tight writing, but there you have it. It's something to keep in mind when you first watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Waste of money. For the first 5 minutes the sound balance prevented any discernible words or story telling in favour of manic cuts and pumping music. Boring casting was a turn off as the same old same old faces popped up. If I see Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan pretend to be movie stars one more time I'll personally invoice them for my popcorn.

Anyway, Simon Pegg, the supercop, did a great job in this. You think he's got nothing to do but catch swans and underage drinkers, and then things just get nuttier and nuttier. I like how his character loosened up a little bit (with the help of his big dumb partner).

This is what you want from a comedy,"I'm 12 years late, watching it in 2019 but it aged so well, even today I can immediately consider it a favorite right after seeing it.First thing that striked me is how great the editing was, perfect little details are crammed into each scene, and scenes are fused with fast-paced, creative edits in the first half of the movie.The second half is mostly action, which was really rewarding to watch if not a bit too prolonged. But dang... This was overall amazing.The two main characters were really funny and different in a great way, imagine the buddy-buddy cop cliche except good and fun. Most of the practical humor was flawless, but the specifically british humor, as usual, didn't exactly make me laugh. But I was still smiling trough most of the movie which I can't say for any other movie ever.This is definitely a watch I can recommend to anyone, if you don't mind some excessive and out-of-place violence in a generally non-violent (but sweary) comedy, and a bit of not-very-funny-actually-kinda-depressing british humor, everything else in Hot Fuzz is flawlessly done.Absurd, funny, fresh and feel-good.Definitely watch this, it aged well and is so refreshingly actually funny and rewarding...",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

7/10 but surprised by the praise.,"7/10 for this one. Staggered though to find it in the top 150 of all time.Not so much because I didn't rate it that high - more it just doesn't strike me as the sort of film so many others would, especially on a worldwide basis.I cannot see the logic in putting the success down to British fans / humour though - given the average rating for U.S voters is 8.4 but non U.S is only 8.1.Unlike others, I actually preferred the early segments of Hot Fuzz. I'd agree little happened of any note, just setting up the latter plot but it always remained an interesting scope on country life.I found it as much a take on Midsomer Murders as American cop shows.On the plusses, the supporting cast were all terrific, some very good characters and a great take on English country life and Frost played the role brilliantly and convincingly.The other coppers were a mixed mag, the uniformed ones were all super, the female cop arguably the best character in the film, brilliantly scripted and played out.But the two detectives for me, never even bordered on likable or amusing and their character change near the end was far too much of a bolt out of the blue.Not so much negatives but minor criticisms - on reflection I didn't actually find many if any laugh out loud gags. It never stopped being pleasant, enjoyable or mildly humorous, but to hear some talking of side-splitting laughter, don't be fooled into thinking this is Airplane, Four Weddings or Monty Python & the Holy Grail. I actually preferred Shaun of the Dead by maybe one mark to this with the similar-ish gags funnier first time time round.The shoot-out scene at the end seemed to get a little lost. For the main part it had a touch of the A-Team with shootings, violence from distances where you couldn't miss but nobody actually getting killed which didn't fit with the film as a whole where there was plenty of gory deaths.But all in all, well worth a look. You won't find too many films better written or as unique & enjoyable as Hot Fuzz.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Now that's a comedy,"Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a tough cop who is transferred to a small town to join the police force over there. However, he is paired with a goofy cop, by the name of Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) and both of them and the police force start discovering some very bizarre murders and events in the small town which could all be related.HOT FUZZ is a lot like SHAUN OF THE DEAD. No...wait, let me just correct myself. It's A LOT better than SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It's got more laughs, it's more action packed and it's fantastic popcorn fun. I promise you, HOT FUZZ should definitely be considered as one of the most entertaining and funniest films of all-time. Also, it should be considered as the best cop movie ever.You'll have an absolute ball when watching this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost bring more British humour to our big-screens,"I first saw Simon Pegg in Shaun of The Dead (2004) and I have to admit that even though I enjoyed that movie, Simon's face did not become etched into my memory. I will definitely remember his face after seeing Hot Fuzz, however, and he is one superb actor, that is one thing for sure.Hot Fuzz brings British humour to the big screen, a kind of humour which I find really enjoyable. Simon Pegg plays a fine police officer who cleanses London from perpetrators in the most satisfactory way, which turns out to be too satisfactory as Simon becomes promoted and then transferred to a small city situated in the English countryside. Although this peculiar city seems to be peaceful and has numerous times won a sort of annual ""greatest village"" competition, the city seems to be stacked with a great number of original characters of who all of them seem to be law-benders to some extent. Simon Pegg's law-abiding character thus faces a great challenge as regards enforcing the law in this peculiar city.This film is well-executed comedy mixed with mystery, and if I was not a fan of Simon Pegg in the past, I am certainly one now. Fans of Shaun of The Dead will most likely enjoy this one and perhaps some fans will be attracted to Hot Fuzz simply because Simon's friend and side-kick Nick Frost is featured in this film, too.I think I must see Hot Fuzz a second time. At any rate, this film is well-worth a 7/10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Superbly crafted dark action comedy,"Usually, when I see a 'comedy' film trailer at the cinema it's for some hideous, unfunny film. So when I saw the trailer for Hot Fuzz and laughed all the way through, and had the same reaction when I saw the trailer again I knew it had to be seen.Hot Fuzz didn't disappoint in any way - it's an adrenaline thumping ride, it has a wry and beautifully observed script, a dark, creepy and unsettling element to most of the village scenes (that feeling that 'something's going on here'), the superb quick-fire repartee between Sgt Angel and PC Butterman just left me with a constant grin. I adore films that combine fast paced humour with wit and cleverness and this one does it with style. Some of the lines are delivered in such a 'matter of fact' way and still manage to be hilarious - Angel correcting other members of the police station for using the phrase 'Police Force' because it creates a wrong image, they should be using 'Police Service' instead is not in itself funny, but with Simon Pegg's determined delivery and the hapless giggling of the other police staff it takes on a whole new angle.There's a superb array of supporting characters in both the police station and the village itself that really create a wonderful stage for the proceedings - lost swans, village fêtes and of course, murder. Or is it an accident? Sublime.I've never seen Shaun of the Dead, but after this I can see that I'll have to sort that out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Romping, laugh-a-minute ode to all the Stallones, Segals and Norris' of this world.","Attempting to parody the work of such uber-cheesy former actionites as Steven Segal and Chuck Norris is, on paper, such a redundant task, since most of those so-bad-they're-actually-quite-good action shoot-em-ups of the late 80s and early 90s were already teetering on the brink of self-ridicule. So how then, does Hott Fuzz, the new film from the makers of Shaun Of The Dead (2004), overcome a potential damp squib?The story goes like this: Dedicated London cop Nicholas Angell (Pegg), with a near perfect arrest record, is transferred to a small countryside village, where the crime rate is so excruciatingly low, that our hapless hero is reduced to being assigned to arresting the human statue in the town centre for loitering. All appears well, that is, until a series of grisly deaths appear to pile up around town, all of which are strangely linked to business entrepreneur Simon Skinner (Dalton). Although Angell continuously suspects the worst, that the town is being stalked by a vicious murderer, the rest of the rather apathetic police force choose to view the incidents as merely coincidences, taking both a blind eye and a lackadaisical approach to police detective work. Shaun Of The Dead managed to work, not so much by parodying the works of such horror auteurs as George A. Romero, but rather paying high tribute to the man, and his creations. The patented Pegg & Wright style of humour was there simply as an added bonus to hoards of zombies who roamed the rather mundane looking streets of suburban London. Hot Fuzz takes that cue, and pots in the very same way. But my affections for this film greatly outweighed their previous project for three simple reasons. Firstly, having a bottle-smashing, trolley-romping, gun-blazing shootout in the middle of a Somerfield supermarket is funny just passively thinking about it. Secondly, Simon Pegg fly-kicking the hell out of a shotgun-touting OAP is about the funniest thing you are likely to see all year. But the main reason is much more broad: Hot Fuzz is in love with the Chuck Norris' of this world. The fact that it shows this much passion and unapologetic enthusiasm for the over-muscled, hyper-realised cheese-infested beefcakes of latter 20th century Hollywood, is what provides this film with the icing on the cake. At the same time  Pegg and Wright do not let the laughs let up for one second. This is very much a case of if you missed that last gag, don't worry there will another one along shortly.Timothy Dalton plays the villainous antagonist with so much evil suavity you kind of wait for him to start cackling and stroking his beard, but seeing him in this just made me realised how long it had been before he did anything actually worth noticing. And there are various cameos from a pick-em selection of Britain's finest comedy acts, ranging from Bill Bailey and Steve Coogan, to serious thesps like Edward Woodward, Jim Broadbent and Paddy Considine.The final 25 minutes of Hot Fuzz is kind of what Midsummer Murders might look like if John Woo had directed an episode of it. And the grand old daddy of action cinema would be proud. This is top quality British comedy, and in my opinion, even surpasses the laughter ratio on Shaun Of The Dead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A waste of time,"Good heavens! Why was this parade of silliness rated so highly by viewers? If you like camp, this is for you. If you like witty comedy, this is most definitely NOT for you. If you liked Porky's or one of it's jejune zombie clones, you'll love this. But if you are looking for anything above Dumb And Dumber (British version), you will be as disappointed as I was.It does have some clever puns and word twists, which I consider the best part of this whole disaster – rather like saying, 'Yes, the Titanic sunk, but the stars in the sky were crystal clear.' Compared to His Girl Friday...well, it can't be compared. Though an old movie, it was both witty and well-acted, which Hot Fuzz is not. The ending was predictable; the main character's decision mere sentimentality – and also predictable. I do disagree with one reviewer who called it a ""bomb"". No, it's a dud.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
It's just too perfect on the first try,"This film reminds you of the previous film that Simon Pegg, the new king of comedy since Mel Brooks and the ZAZ (Zucker Abrahams Zucker, the guys who made Airplane! and Hot Shots!) team, made, which was Shaun of the Dead. It also reminds you of films like Final Destination and Child's Play because it was so flippin' gory! However, what I can say about this film was that it was a perfect slapstick to watch. I loved every minute of it, especially the subtle black humor that happened at the time when both the mansion exploded and when Nick and Danny were watching action films and drinking alcohol. I loved the way they parodied everything by actually sticking to their guns and the real genres, rather than try to make a joke from every cliché that the world had seen in films like Meet the Spartans and Strange Wilderness. It, however, has some gory deaths, a lot of profanity, and some underage alcohol drinking, as in comedy. It is R for all of those, but I caught the film on Cinemax. Boy, it was funny and it succeeded at that goal.I just don't know why people don't understand the British way of making spoofs. It's about as funny as an American spoof, like Blazing Saddles of Airplane!, but I guess it tries to be serious and it succeeds. I dare you to see this film if you get the chance, but if you are that fan of Meet the Spartans and absolutely hate any smart humor, this film is not for you. You have to understand. Some jokes do miss the target, but you'll get it the second go around.Oh, and thank God this film made more than Meet the Spartans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

enormous fun,"What is particularly clever about this excellent movie is that it brings two genres together with such skill that if you are unread in one, you can still enjoy the other. The genres are 1) the tough city cop (Dirty Harry, etc), and 2) the Agatha Christie death-in-a-quiet-English-village. I know almost nothing about the former, but I've seen loads of the latter, and still loved Hot Fuzz - so people who know the tough-cop movies will have got all the jokes I missed, adding to their enjoyment.Superb script, full of laughs but also endearing observation. The central performances by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are terrific, particularly Pegg's, who shows a really wide range here: if it weren't couched in a parodic comedy, his performance might well be recognised as award-worthy.For an UK audience there is much delight in watching some wonderful character actors at work, led by Jim Broadbent, Billie Whitelaw and Anne Reid, their ranks joined by former dashing leading men Edward Woodward and Timothy Dalton, who are both excellent, especially Dalton, parodying his most famous role, which makes it all the funnier. There is also terrific double-act support from Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall.Enormous fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Even better than Shaun of the Dead, this movie delivers the laughs and surprisingly the action.","The best comedy I have seen this year or probably the last couple of years this movie had me laughing and cheering on our heroes. In this movie we have a super cop who has gotten numerous awards for his excellent service, top of his class, and smart too. Unfortunately, he is to good in that he makes the other officers in London look bad so he is promoted to Sergent in a very small and quaint little town. Once there he quickly makes his presence known and we get to see him adjust to his new life and even a new partner. Well not really a new partner as he is more of a guy who really looks up to the officer for all he has done. However, all is not as it seems in this nice little town as something sinister seems to be at play. This movie is just great. Funny, and it has loads of action and blood too. It is sort of nice to see a rated R action cop movie again. Throw in a plot that actually surprised me a bit and it a nice change of pace from the the computer terrorist plots so many movies are employing and you have one of the great films of the year. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are great here as they were in Shaun of the Dead, they are also likable as it is like joining a couple of friends at a day on the job. Also in the cast is a former James Bond, Timothy Dalton so that was interesting as well. Still even with the cool action scenes what I was looking for here was laughs and I got plenty, from the opening scenes to the final ones the jokes flew fast and furious with a few sentimental touches as well, however, they added to the movie and worked quite nicely too.

Shoot 'em Up and Laugh it Out - Expect the Best of Both,"Too many comedies these days make me groan instead of laugh, and I have started thinking perhaps it is only that I am older. I know after seeing this film that is not the case. We have all seen many recycled ideas just go on and on. These guys give us time-tested ideas with a fresh perspective. Shaun of the Dead marked a new standard for comedy and Hot Fuzz continues the trend. Pegg and Frost (and Edgar Wright) are fans of their genres and make a point of pointing it out without winking at us all the way through, and many fan-filmmakers ought to take heed. I feel appropriately nudged along, not shoved into a ""here we go again,"" because we do not go again. Sharp, witty dialogue and carefully placed plot devices sparkle, edged with spit-fire editing that assures the rapid pace we crave. There are also some very different twists that may not be too surprising, but the punches are definitely spot on whether you see them coming or not. It is not a satire per se, rather, there is plenty of satirical material sprinkled to accentuate the inherent absurdity of most action films. But there is some pleasure that can be derived from such absurdities, and the filmmakers give us this at face value. They love the ""craft"" of police bang 'em ups, and they honorably emulate them in a way I have never seen in the genre itself. In other words, I relate more with Police Sergeant Nicholas Angel and cannot ""turn it off,"" but as he learns to, so do I. I am taken along so fluidly without even caring that nothing needs to make too much sense because I know there are times when it's better if it doesn't. I am not a fan of routine action movies, but if I enjoyed this film as much as I did, I can only imagine what this film will do for true ""die-hards"" like the filmmakers themselves. Some may feel a bit off for laughing at some of the terrors, but it's all part of the fun. Get outside your element, or revel in it, whichever it happens to be for you. There's something in the seemingly quiet burg of Sanford for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Shaun of the Cops,"Posted to an idyllic small town whose denizens believe that their low crime rate is due to being lax when enforcing the law, a workaholic city cop discovers something sinister afoot in this police spoof from the makers of 'Shaun of the Dead'. The film has received some flack from those insistent on comparing the two films, and 'Hot Fuzz' does pale in comparison without the urgency or sense of real danger that made the earlier film so dynamite - but it is still a solid comedy with great flashy editing. The film derives a surprising amount of humour from Nick Frost copying things that lead actor Simon Pegg has earlier said but mixing up the words, and zany touches that initially just seem odd (the swan) lead to some big laughs later on. The film also gives Timothy Dalton his best role since leaving the James Bond franchise as a condescending local business owner with something up his sleeve. What really sets 'Hot Fuzz' apart though from the myriad of other spoofs out there is the darkly comical turn it takes in its final third with a grisly solution to a series of local murders Pegg that starts investigating (hilariously, the villagers keep insisting that they are accidents even when foul play is obvious). Adding a little extra depth, the filmmakers also throw the workaholic nature of Pegg's character on the table, questioning what he may be missing out on by dedicating his life to his job. The film never plucks too deeply into the character, but there is ample characterisation for one to be able to appreciate the film as a study of man examining his job dedication in addition to a laugh-fest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Superb,"My wife and I chose to watch this movie because we wanted to laugh out loud at a film....and laugh out loud we did.The chemistry between the two leads is fantastic the gags are seamless, they appear like two guys who have been together for years (which of course they are) and all this leads to one of the funniest films I have watched in a long long time.Yes a lot of the jokes are crude and child like but occasionally that is what is required!! Any one expecting to see a movie with clever sub plots and intricate jokes will probably be disappointed but if you want a two hour escape to action, bloodshed and a lot of laughs this really is a must see.Timothy Dalton is fantastic as the loathsome retail magnate and the rest of the cast reads like a who's who of British comedy... anyone remotely funny at the moment is in this movie.A must see!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

I Agree with reviewers- this is awesome.,"I like make laugh when action movie so stupid it make me laugh.You see the thing with most action movies is they are already funny inherently. I mean Rambo? That's a funny franchise.No, Bad Boys one and two are not funny even though two supposedly funny men are the stars. And, yes Point Break is funny even though its two stars are far from funny, (though Ted Theodore Logan is pretty darn funny). But none of this has anything to do with how funny ""Hot Fuzz!!"" is except that the filmmakers love those types of action movies so much they are willing to spoof them in a completely over the top way.From a ridiculous plot and collection of characters to even more ridiculous directorial techniques from hyper active editing of mundane things to overly wrought sound design the movie makers tapped directly into the hot vein of American action genre films. And it is hilarious.Whether you love or hate the movies they are spoofing you'll love ""Hot Fuzz!!"" It's smart in all the right places and completely ludicrous in all the right places which makes for a jolly fun time at the cinemaplex.There has been a glut of ""spoof"" movies from the ""Scary Movie"" cycle to the horrible ""Date Movie"". The difference here is this one rides its own merits of story, character and plot while reminiscing about those great to mediocre action movies of the past without simply twisting a scene directly form those movies.Or simply: these guys are original.

"An Efficient Parody of Police Blockbusters, Lighter Than Shaun of the Dead","Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright get together to continue the work they started with 2004's Shaun of the Dead, this time dropping a parody of cheesy police action flicks. Like its predecessor, it works on a satirical level, but also as a standalone - albeit one with far less heart than we saw in Shaun. Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a straight-laced London constable who's so fanatical about his job, the top brass worry they'll look bad by comparison and ship him off to the minor leagues. There he partners with Frost, a slobbish underachiever, and swiftly uncovers a vast criminal conspiracy. Fuzz relies heavily on one-liners and sight gags, which are generally pretty effective, but lacks a real emotional hook. That makes for an entertaining two hours, if not for endless re-screenings. The best work comes from the supporting cast, with Timothy Dalton leading the pack as the town's squinting, scheming, mustachioed mastermind grocer. And, of course, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall are downright show-stealing as the two Andys, resident detectives more concerned with needling newbies than cracking cases. I could've done with a lot more of those guys. A good film, with some big laughs, but no more than that. It's tough to avoid constant comparisons to the team's preceding effort, which isn't a fair match.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Hothothot!,"From the creators of Shaun of the Dead, this homage to the police-action genre (from the TV shows like Miami Vice to the Lethal Weapon movie series of the nineties to the Bad Boys of the more recent years) makes the director Edgar Wright and co-writer/star Simon Pegg household names after proving themselves to be a force to be reckoned with in the blooming field of intelligent British comedy. Maybe this generation has finally found its Monty Python team.Hot Fuzz describes how Nicholas Angel, a young and brilliant cop with an arrest record of 400% higher than any other officer in the force, is forced by his London superiors and peers to be assigned in a remote, peaceful and pleasant small English town because he is a major threat to everyone's promotions.Upon a few hours after his arrival, he has already arrested a few blokes from a bar, and is practically known by everyone in less than 24 hours. The reactions from his fellow officers are quite mixed--Danny Butterman, the son of the chief, looks up to Sergeant Angel as an ultimate embodiment of an action hero in the movies that he has seen; while a few of the officers seem also threatened and skeptical about the excellence of their new member.As Sergeant Angel gets familiar with the rest of the town, he discovers that some individuals he meets tend to die a few hours after he meets them. The locals tell him that all of the deaths were mere accidental, but Angel believes that there's a conspiracy behind these brutal killings. This leads him to distrust certain people, until he comes face-to-face the real nature of the people behind him--the entire village ganging up on him and feeling threatened by Angel's real heroic, action-packed demeanor. But for Sergeant Nicholas Angel, no one should be above the law. In a memorable segment, he rides on a horse, ala Lito Lapid, with ridiculous amount of guns and ammunitions, and he shows 'em all what he's got.It's more engaging and hilarious than Shaun of the Dead, and the twist of the movie is just right on the spot.Witty, hilarious script.

"Funny; a but overrated and much, much too long","I have to say that I enjoyed this movie; however, there were way too many explosions for my taste. I guess that's part of the point, since this is a spoof of many other ""buddy"" films. I have never seen Shaun of the Dead (nor will I), so I guess a lot of the humor is lost on me. However, I AM a major Anglophile, and many of my favorite Brits are in this movie, so it was enjoyable if just for that. I chose to go to this movie due to slim pickings at the local multiplex (there just isn't much out there that appeals to me; most of the romantic comedies out there are receiving poor, poor reviews)...and the 89% recommendation on rotten tomatoes.com...I have to say that I don't think this deserves THAT much high praise. I did have a lot of laughs, but also, this went just a tad too long, and had me glancing at my watch every few minutes during the middle of it. The ending, I thought, was a little too drawn out. minor spoiler.... After about 5 solid minutes of carnage, I'd had enough, but it went on and on and on after that.

Flawed movie - thumbs down,"I really tried to enjoy this film, but upon reflection should have walked out of the theatre to save myself from the disconjointed and disturbing finish. The only reason I did not leave was that I was watching the film with other people and did not want to disturb them. This film was sold as an action-comedy, however I found myself barely laughing at the sparse and semi-funny jokes. A 5 year old could have written this script and I am not kidding! By the end we were squirming in our seats just waiting for it to end, while watching the rather painful action scenes. Frankly they were just not put together well. The lack of any harmony or cleverness in the plot or in the directing just left me exhausted. Well thought out action sequences are usually artistic in some way, but not this film. OK, so it was supposed to be raw and gritty, but sorry, it just did not work. I understand what they were trying to do, but it just did not come together well.

A modern comedy classic,"Another outstanding effort by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, the gents who made Shaun of the Dead and again starring Pegg and Nick Frost, with a cavalcade of great character actors.This time Pegg is a straight laced cop named Nicholas Angel who has such an outstanding record in London that he makes all other cops look bad, so he is sent to what is probably the most quiet village in England so as not to embarrass the rest of the force. (His first ""case"" is to catch a swan that has escaped its enclosure.) Upon settling into the village of Stanford he meets the decidedly less focused local police force and the members of the community who have a deep desire to maintain the status of Stanford as the epitome of excellence in rural England. These seemingly upstanding citizens appear and reappear through the movie, especially the crappiest Bond, Timothy Dalton as the local supermarket owner who seems to be everywhere just before or after an incident occurs. (Side note - Although Dalton apparently sucked it up as 007 I can't help by think Pierce Brosnan dropped a notch with the new Loreal commercials, ""campaigning to save the environment"" ughhhh.) As the ""accidents"" become more frequent Angel becomes increasingly involved in proceedings and also increasingly disillusioned with his fellow members of the force. There are several moments of stylised violence that would be pretty shocking if they weren't so funny, and once ""shit just got real"" Angel snaps and the movie escalates into a 20 odd minute smorgasbord of shotgun-wielding, rootin' tootin' over the top action, which matches most of the movies that the first 3/4 of the film parodies.What separates this from so many other flicks is the obvious care that the creators have taken at every step of the game, from the script to the casting to the seemingly accidental touches that frequent the film, (for those that saw SOTD you know nothing is an accident).The supporting cast are all excellent, with many being recognisable from numerous British comedy shows and movies. It seems obvious that both Pegg and Wright watch a looootttt of movies and set out to make something that they would like to watch which both spoofs and honours the buddy cop genre simultaneously.In Summary: Hot Fuzz is equal parts comedy and action flick, with a fair crossover of both styles throughout. Aside from the stars there are numerous worthwhile cameos that actually add to the film and Pegg and Frost share an effortless chemistry.I don't like to compare films but put simply if you liked Shaun of the Dead you'll love this.Final Rating - 9 / 10.

Quirky and Entertaining But Grisly Action-Comedy,"It's hard to pigeonhole this one as a comedy, an action film, or a thriller, but it's fair to say it has elements of all three genres. If you are accustomed to Hollywood films that neatly fit into one of these genres, you will no doubt size this one up as a cop/buddy film (i.e., Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys, etc.) but you will be in for a shock as the film progresses, if only for the occasional but graphic violence that lies ahead. I say ""graphic,"" but it all seems a little cartoon-like when you see how the characters react to it. If you think of the Monty Python skit of the knight slowly being dismembered but continuing to fight off his foe sans arms and legs, you're on the right track. I didn't see Shaun of the Dead so it was my first encounter with either of the leads, who are both very good. All in all, this is not a classic but it is a nice diversion from the fare that Hollywood usually serves.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"If you liked ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Spaced,"" you will love this","I flat-out loved this movie. I was laughing, people around me were laughing--it was an overall great time. Terrific action sequences, which are staged to be over the top, but which end up being more realistic and gut-wrenching than your average Jerry Bruckheimer or Michael Bay film.The ""Shaun of the Dead"" team is at it again, and while this film is clearly related to that great zombie flick (mostly in that the characters seem to be progressing--even with awareness sometimes--through a giant video game), it is funny and exciting even if you are not familiar with Wright, Pegg, Frost, and the others. There is a little of everything in here--gore, humor, ass-kicking--they jettisoned the fluff, and kept the FUZZ!

"Cop Buddy Movie genre mashup with humor, drama and action!","A hilarious blend of comedy, action and drama taking aim and squarely blasting the cop buddy movie genre. Too serious to be a ""spoof"", but filled with humor both obvious and subtle, this is the type of movie that begs repeat viewings. It's a cross-genre mashup that might be hard to define, but sure is fun to watch.In ""Hot Fuzz"" we get the traditional mismatched cop buddies, but it's taken to the extreme, and actually works very well. Even the dichotomy of a rural setting for a crazy murder mystery plot adds to the surreal as well as the humor.My biggest gripe with the film is that I'm not a fan of overt gore. True it is done in a comedic manner for effect (ow, ow , ow), but it caught me off guard and is unnecessary. Severed heads, impalement's, blood-spurting wounds... the explicitness should be left to horror films.Another minor gripe was that some of the action stuff was cut way too fast and makes you dizzy. I appreciate the idea of adding multiple cuts to add energy, but this was over-the-top. Perhaps the decision was purposeful, lampooning even the style of action movies... but for me it was a little distracting.""Hot Fuzz"" is at it's best with the many laugh out loud moments: the runaway goose, translating the local dialect, the human statue ""threat"", the bodyguard who just says ""Naarp!"", and wordplay twists throughout. These smart bits of humor make the film a keeper... just be prepared for high action and some gore with your laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"No spoilers, just my reaction","Walking into the theater for this premiere I knew I was in for a treat. It began with me having to sit through a screening of 'Electra Glide in Blue' which felt like forever to watch. But when the house lights went on, I felt that twang of 'geek' hit me like a rush of marshmallow fluff being poured all over my body. It was one of the loudest movies I've ever seen. 'Hot Fuzz' hits you right from the beginning and never stops punching your gonads until the credits. Lots of guns, tongue in cheek jokes, and action movie references were thrown in on top of some damn fine acting. I laughed out loud more times in this film than I have in a while, and that's saying quite a bit. If you didn't like 'Shaun of the Dead' (although who didn't?), you still might not be disappointed with their latest offering.

Funny,"This is a funny movie. I don't like it nearly as much as I Loved Loved Loved Shaun of the Dead (awesome movie see it if you haven't already!) but it was still worth seeing and very funny in places. The ending seems to drag on a bit but the funny parts are funny enough to make it worth the cost of seeing the movie, most people like it and the word of mouth is there for a reason. I got the DVD of this movie as a gift and watched it again and the only other knock I'd have against it is that it didn't seem nearly as funny the second time where Shaun of the Dead I can still watch and laugh at. The main characters were great but the supporting actors and actresses sometimes weren't as good.

Wright has done it again,"After making the highly successful Shaun of the Dead. Edgar Wright made a movie called Hot Fuzz and wow! what a great comedy. This movie will make you laugh from start to finish it's two hours that you will thoroughly enjoy. This is a spoof a cop movies like Bad Boys 2, Point Break etc.Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) has been asked to become Sergent in a country stupid partner, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost.) While they're om the beat they come across some suspicious deaths which Nicholas thinks they're murders (but the others think they are accidents.) All the deaths link up to one thing.Overall, I think that this is a very well made comedy. This is probably going to be one of the best films of 2007, considering the others being bad e.g. Epic Movie and Norbit.5/5. Very well made and very well done. Two thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Actually outdoes Shaun of the Dead,"If you thought Wright's directorial debut(this may even outdo it for how much set up and payoff) was just a fluke, you gotta watch this. A pastiche of the action-flick and buddy comedy sub-genres(and this works as that type of picture, also), this is a perfect send-up of those Hollywood dime-a-dozen flashy movies that we've all seen more of than we're willing to admit. This is how you do parody. The humor is excellent, next to no gags or jokes fall flat, and so many different kinds... black, British, verbal, cleverness, satire, silliness, and some gross-out material. I would be lying if I claimed that, at any point in this, an extended period of time passed without me cracking up. The plot is marvelous, and the twists are incredible. While I did catch at least one thing coming, this still majorly surprised me. The direction is impeccable. Writing is brilliant, the script is packed with gold. The dialog is astounding, and the delivery is flawless. Every acting performance is spot-on, and the comic timing is beyond reproach. I've heard complaints that Simon's character is excessively ""supercop"", and that the audience can't relate to him. Honestly, I respectfully disagree. He has plenty of personality, and we can recognize the drive he has, and being a workaholic. The chemistry between him and Nick again adds a lot. I can't say enough positive things about the cast. This is packed and dense, and warrants(not to mention deserves) multiple viewings. Almost every single cliché is spoofed on. The pacing is extremely fast throughout. In fact, that is really the only negative thing I can think of to say. It's literally almost too stimulating. Maybe 120 minutes of this team is an overly generous dose. I started this review right when the credits began rolling, it's been an hour, and I'm still recuperating. However, I cannot in good conscience complain about that, and hey, maybe others possess a greater amount of... uhm... dopamine, I suppose. Or better capability of producing it... whatever. If you need to, take a break from it, rest afterward, split it into parts, but in the name of all that is holy, do not miss this for the world, unless you do not believe that you will enjoy this. There is infrequent strong language in this, as well as disturbing content, and brutal, bloody violence and gore. The DVD comes with a commentary track with Wright and Pegg(outspoken, so some may be offended) well worth the time, 22 deleted scenes with the option of hearing the thoughts behind them during, trailers, 'Hot Funk'(the censored version, with cussy scenes cut together, altered with the goofy dubbed over lines), storyboards, The Man Who Would Be Fuzz(the two leads doing impersonations of Michael Caine and Sean Connery), trailers and hilarious outtakes. I recommend this warmly to anyone who can imagine liking it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A good English spoof,"One of Simon Pegg's better films, this is one step higher than Sean of the Dead, and this film actually has a story line.You soon warm to Simon's character and ensue the mildly amusing one liners, but thats as good as it gets really. There are a few dull parts that could be cut out where the story goes a bit dead. But on the up side Simon and Co work well together and bounce off each other. The film does not look cheap, the scenes, wardrobe all look authentic. There are even a handful of laugh out loud moments too, but I shant spoil them for you.A movie I'd rent for a Sunday afternoon, but doesn't warrant a cinema ticket. Its far from a clever bombardment of jokes like Montypython, but does just fine to offer mild humour. Acted well, but scrip was lacking to fill the full duration of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Hot Fuzz works!,"Hot Fuzz opens with Detective Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) getting sent to the small town of Sandford because he's so good at his job that he's made the big city police force look bad in comparison. Angel gets a doughy sidekick (Nick Frost) and is forced to fix problems like escaped swans and rowdy jugglers. When a series of unusual accidents start to befall the residents of Sandford, Angel realizes that crazy doesn't always distinguish between the city and the country, forcing him to take justice into his own hands.Do you remember how well co-writer/director Edgar Wright and co-writer/star Simon Pegg used zombie influences to tell an actual story in Shaun of the Dead? At first, horror fans were just trying to spot the references to various zombie movies, but - and this is the reason why Shaun continues to grow in popularity - the movie quickly became enjoyable and interesting on its own terms, completely independent from the films that inspired it. Hot Fuzz does an even better job at taking a genre and not just spoofing it, but actually becoming a part of it. And it does it by being hilariously over-the-top and yet miraculously unoffensive. Without giving too much away, Hot Fuzz features some of the most insane gore you'll see all year, including an old lady getting kicked in the face, and a priest getting shot and shouting ""Jesus Christ!"" as he hits the ground. On paper, it sounds like the kind of thing that would offend most of the Red states, but it's so incredibly engaging and well-done, you'll have a hard time imagining anyone not having a good time. Hot Fuzz is so much pure fun, that if you don't like it, you don't really like movies.Finally, let's make one distinction clear. There's a whole genre of comedy nowadays that just takes what's familiar and simply regurgitates it with more fart jokes and mugging. (""Remember Borat? Wasn't that great?"") Hot Fuzz is absolutely not ""Action Movie"" (although that's probably not too far down the road from those Epic and Date Movie folks). Writers Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg LOVE action movies. Movies like Point Break are easy to make fun of - anyone could do that - but it's really difficult to find a way to both make fun of and pay respect to the cheesy action genre that most of us secretly hold as a guilty pleasure. The final act of Hot Fuzz actually becomes an over-the-top action extravaganza with some shoot-outs and car chases that are as well choreographed as most of the action movies released this year (it doesn't hurt to have recognizable genre faces like Edward Woodward and Timothy Dalton in major roles). In fact, at the end of the year, Hot Fuzz may be both your favorite comedy and your favorite action movie of 2007, and that's no joke.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
over rated,"thats basically what it is, over rated.i thought shaun of the dead was over rated, same goes for Hot Fuzz. It has its moments, some funny, some cool fighting clips, but overall it just added up to a mediocre action flick. the story line was pretty weak it tried a little mystery aspect and did NOT pull it off.The directing was interesting which is where most of my 7 stars went, he definitely has a certain style in his films which is new and exciting, he just needs the right story and right approach. Using his talents to portray and tell the story of an underground murder cult in a small town just didn't do it for me.It had the same smart quirky humor as Shaun Of the Dead, and the same bloody outcome for most of the characters, but all in all, it was weak.I can feel Edgar Wright, hes about to bust through, maybe with one more crack at the old movie game and he'll come out with something truly original. I still have hope for him, might as well rent this just to see his progression and be ready for something new and even better.5 of my stars goes to the directing style, and 1.5 goes to the effort, unfortunately there are no half stars so i have to round up. 7 stars from me on a moderately entertaining film, that is not worth buying except for the true Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"""Ever fired your gun in the air and yelled, 'Aaaaaaah?' ""","How to top Shaun of the Dead? Such a question had been endlessly circling between moviegoers worldwide since the release of the impeccable satire yet tribute to zombie films mixed with romance and a healthy side of British comedy in 2004. The combination (cleverly billed as ""rom-zom-com"") clicked, but with expectations raised so high, the possibility of a follow up which could match or exceed Shaun in terms of creativity, cleverness and sheer enjoyment factor seemed a daunting prospect indeed. Fortunately, director Edgar Wright and his co-writer and star Simon Pegg proved ahead of themselves, as they embraced their sudden fame rather than falling prey to its trappings, following up their previous hit with an exuberant and masterful send up of the oh so stereotypical buddy cop movie. The result? Hot Fuzz.Director Wright's body of work is an interesting one indeed, as he seems constantly torn between showing immense knowledge of whatever genre he is satirizing, while delivering a superb entry in said genre all the while - a trait he continues with Hot Fuzz. Chock full of enough references of classic (and some classically bad) action films to keep even the most experienced action buffs busy, Hot Fuzz is itself a testament to the sheer quantity of knowledge and enthusiasm Wright and Pegg had for the genre. But all the same, while Hot Fuzz is clever enough to never take itself too seriously, and remain for the most part a wonderfully tongue in cheek satire, the filmmakers don't shy away from the task of creating what is simply one of the most adrenaline fuelled, blood pumping action sequences ever seen on a movie screen. Wright also keeps things interesting throughout with a rapid fire editing style (seen in smaller doses in Shaun), showing blindingly fast montages with exaggerated sound effects, a wonderfully unique technique which really succeeds in retaining the audience's attention without seeming pretentious or mind-numbing.It is this final combat scene and the few preceding it which really make Hot Fuzz the wonderful piece of work it is - while the build up throughout the film, establishing the characters, the setting and the pseudo murder-mystery feel to the plot, and throwing in a few chuckle-worthy one liners all the while is for the most part comical and entertaining, it proves a bit too slow and uneventful, with the clever comedic touches too sparse to really make as much of an impact as one might hope. Fortunately, the climatic showdown is enough to make up for any of the film's prior shortcomings - gut-wrenchingly hilarious, yet endlessly energetic and exciting all the same. It is in these last few scenes Hot Fuzz really excels, and raises the limit from simply chuckle-worthy to flat out hysterical and supremely entertaining.It helps of course that Wright seems to have rallied up nearly every British character actor on the planet to make an appearance, though it goes without saying that the real attraction of the show is the simply wonderful dynamic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost reuniting once again after TV's Spaced and Shaun; this time as a hard edged, obsessive London cop and his witless country bumpkin partner (with Pegg playing the straight man for a change, allowing Frost's dimwitted character to pick up most of the punchlines). But there is also wonderful comedic support from the supporting cast, including Jim Broadbent as the bumbling but warm hearted police chief of the backwards British town Pegg's character is sent off to, a scene stealing Timothy Dalton, a far cry from his Bond days as a hilarious and very suspicious seeming grocery store baron and Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as verbally abusive detectives with highly questionable facial hair. The film's tongue in cheek cameos are also highlights, with the likes of Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan raising many a laugh in their minute scenes as Pegg's jealous fellow London policemen, and unrecognizable, blink-you-miss-'em appearances from Cate Blanchett as Pegg's ex-girlfriend and Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson as a murderous Santa Clause. What's not to love?All in all, Hot Fuzz proves itself as one of the most gutsy and energetic satires in recent history, side-splitting action cliché parodies mixed with adrenaline pumped tributes to the genre, fuelled by a wonderfully witty script and Wright's trademark rapid-fire editing and brilliant cinematography. It's just a shame it takes so long for the film to really get going, but once the plot picks up and the action starts, Hot Fuzz makes its place as one of the most entertaining comedies or action films in recent history... see it for 'the greater good'.-9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A worthy follow up.,"When you have made a film like 'Shaun of the Dead' it is always going to be a tall order to follow it up but the team have done it with cop comedy 'Hot Fuzz'. Although not quite as good as Shaun (what could be?) the boys give rural policing the zombie treatment and give us a right laugh in the process. There are no punches pulled here and the laughs are often full on or simply gross outs. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost after living and working together for so long have built up a report that aids the comedic timing of both and they play off each other so well, Pegg makes a convincing if not quirky leading man of sorts and Frost is the source of much of the amusement as the bumbling buffoon. Elsewhere there is an amazing supporting cast and at times it is like spot the face, Coogan, Woodward, Nighy, Dalton, Freeman, Considine to name but a few, but not unlike 'The League of Gentlemen' there is an unseen element to the overall piece and that is writer/director Wright. Along with Pegg the script they have delivered is not just full of great lines but great action sequences and in the last quarter of the film it gives them licence to be exceptionally over the top. It is also one of those films you will have to see more than once to spot all the homage's to other films I spotted 'Leon' and 'Bad Boys' but I know there are more. If you liked 'Spaced' and 'Shaun' then you will no doubt love 'Hot Fuzz' it's well made, clever and damn right funny, plus you get to see Pegg kick a granny in the face what more can you ask for?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Oh Pegg... where did it all go wrong?,"All hail the mighty Simon Pegg, two series of Spaced, an instant cult classic of a film in Shaun of the Dead and a multitude of cameo performances in the cream of British comedy... so what the hell happened with Hot Fuzz? This journalist, like many other of Pegg's die hard fans was ecstatic at the prospect of a new film featuring him and his partner in crime Nick Frost but left the cinema with a dejected sense of disappointment. Hot Fuzz cashed in shamelessly on Shaun of the Dead's success mimicking scenes and catchphrases beyond the acceptable point of cross-referencing.Don't get me wrong, it's a decent enough film, Pegg plays hardened uber-cop Nicholas Angel, who is ousted from the Metropolitan police by his colleagues (great casting of Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy) for having a 400 per cent higher arrest rate than anyone else. Embarrassed, the Met send him to the quiet West Country village of Sanford to sweep him under the carpet. What ensues is a well contrived homage to the range of films and TV shows that rely on a seemingly peaceful English countryside village being the murder capital of the country.While the on-screen relationship between Angel and the incompetent constable, Danny Butterworth (Frost) he is partnered with is amusing at times, it's simply not a laugh-out-loud comedy by any stretch. This would be fine if the films obvious one-liners weren't so clearly trying to be just that. Seemingly confused about it's genre Hot Fuzz flicks from comedy horror, to a bad episode of Midsomer Murders concluding with an action finale straight from Die Hard throughout its course.This all may seem a tad harsh, but it's hard not to be disappointed. With such a great track record everyone was expecting an original and hilarious film from writers Pegg and Edgar Frost. What was produced was a funny film, less witty than its predecessor perhaps, but not without it's moments. The all-star cast of Jim Broadbent, Bill Bailey, Timothy Dalton and far too many more to mention are perfectly suited to their roles with the exception of Frost who's bumbling action film obsessed character sounds like a bad impression of Vicky Pollard with half the depth.Hot Fuzz is undoubtedly worth watching but perhaps wait until the DVD.

Biggest '08 Oscar snub.,"If nothing else, this film is an enormous technical achievement, that would have easily won the Oscar for Best Editing, had it even been nominated. That said, it also could have garnered a Best Actor nomination for Simon Pegg, who hit every single beat and layer his character needed, and Best Supporting for Broadbent, Nick Frost, or Paddy Considine. I think it could be one of the best parodies of all time. Multiple viewings are absolutely necessary to get the full experience of how detailed and fabulously put-together this film is.P.S. - I've never, EVER seen a film that has as few loose ends as this.

"Wright, Pegg, Frost; these three are the future of comedy","With the cinemas being flooded with a bunch of pathetic comedies (Norbit and Epic Movie to name a few) it is a true relief to see a comedy that is actually funny. The more surprising thing is that has a great story, hilarious actors and it is very clever. Much like Shaun of the Dead was (kind of) spoofing zombie movies, Hot Fuzz is spoofing action/cop movies and like Shaun, it does it really, really well.Nick Angel (Simon Pegg) is the perfect cop. With an arrest record 400% higher than any of his other colleagues and top in his graduating class you would think the police force would want him around. Instead they ship him off to Sandford, a crime free village. But of course not is all what it seems. A series of grisly ""accidents"" have been occurring lately and Nick suspects foul play so he teams up with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) to uncover the town's secret.The Shaun team know how to make comedy. They blend witty humour with slapstick and spoof and they produce one of the funniest movies I've seen for some time. From start to finish it's non-stop laughs. The only thing that really lets this movie down is the poor usage of CGI when it came to the deaths. It was too obvious and at times really laughable. But that does not ruin the entire movie as this is probably one of the best comedies that will be released this year.4½/5",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"Phwwooooaarrrr, Geek Porn!!!","English quintessence is nothing if not the humble country village  that non-threatening, twee piece of rural idyll where everyone and everything has been unmoved by the monstrous engine of industrial and sociological change. In Britain, where programmes are commissioned for an imaginary constituency of women, old women and the very old who can't leave the house, such pastures have become of staple of popular drama, enlivened by the occasionally grim but statistically improbable murder. So what if they drag like sin, are 'gentle' to the point of coma and less slick than a camcorder movie made by a person with Parkinson's who broke the image stabiliser  there will always be an England and we must look at it whether we want to or not.Hot Fuzz is what happens when English people brought up on American Action blockbusters and buddy cop gunfests but lacking any manifest gun culture of their own, mine the very funny conceit of recasting a plodding Sunday tea time rural murder mystery as a Michael Bay-style actioner. A great idea because what could be further away from the world of Tony Scott, Bay and co than Gloustershire and the St. Mary Mead-esquire village green? Its been done before  the comic strip made two very funny 'action' versions of the fall of the GLC and the Miners Strike in the American mould, but those were parodies  Fuzz in contrast is more a valentine to the Bruckheimer stable, played for laughs but not the self-referential bore it might have been. That it has to be a movie in its own right is apparent from the off because the frantic, machine gun style of Wright would be hard to live with for two hours if there was no story per say, just the ticking of cliché boxes. His crash zooms, whip pans and fitting camera operators are like someone shouting ""I WENT TO FILM SCHOOL"" in your ear for 2 hours but it's a love for the b-movie form that puts a big silly grin all over your face. That said it's pure fan-boy masturbation, conflating everything from the Wicker Man to Straw Dogs along with numerous other movie and T.V references. It stays on the right side of affectionate however and rather than simply jumping in with exchanges of fire and explosions, the clever script builds the story to a point where you can suspend your disbelief long enough to enjoy the terrifically overwrought, 12 gauge climax. 30 minutes of pure joy which is impossible to describe without using the tired cliché of 'its X meets Y' but that, in essence, is the formula for the whole movie.Wright's direction plugs the gap left by the relatively sparse sprinkling of jokes as its OTT hyperactivity is part of the gag and complimented perfectly by some ludicrously rat a tat tat editing. The kind that makes it look as though the editor was buggering the AVID. This, plus the likable leads and spate of intrusive cameos from jobbing comedians keeps things buoyant but in keeping with its parent pictures  Bad Boys 2 and the like  its too long and the second act though never dull, starts to draw attention to its length so that the final half hour acts as a welcome corrective. Pegg mentioned on T.V that length was a problem for these pictures but seemed to think 2 hours was the optimum running time for such things. As a geek brought up on Eighties genre flicks he should know that most were about 20 minutes shorter than that and for good reason  you set it up, do the minimum to get the denouement and get out. See Back to the Future's perfectly judged 100 odd minutes for a masterclass in how to do this. If it were made today it'd be 2 and half hours long  have we all gone crazy or have filmmakers just become more self-indulgent? There's just 100 minutes of good material here but if you can forgive the padding Hot Fuzz is nicely judged, slam bang entertainment. Wright is terrific but it would be interesting to see what a pure Edgar looked like by which I mean a picture he envisioned without an all night trawl through his DVD collection....good as it undoubtedly is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Wright/Pegg's Cornetto Peak,"After British director Edgar Wright and his leading man and writing partner Simon Pegg scored with the zombie comedy SHAUN OF THE DEAD, it was time for straight-out action that, while also loaded with hijinks, takes the cop genre more seriously, especially Pegg's against-type performance as a tough guy instead of the usual shrugging slacker from DEAD and before that he and Wright's pop-culture-referencing sit-com, SPACED...And there are even more nostalgic homages here as HOT FUZZ is a mega-satire on American buddy-cop flicks ranging from LETHAL WEAPON to BAD BOYS II to POINT BREAK; but for the British it's loaded with iconic cult actors of that country's more cerebral crime genre past...These include Billie Whitelaw, who started out in kitchen-sink noirs like HELL IS A CITY and I PROMISED TO PAY to underrated James Bond Timothy Dalton (devilish as hell), THE EQUALIZER and before that CALLAN star Edward Woodward, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK villain Paul Freeman...And an actual LETHAL heavy in Stuart Wilson: all of whom play residents in a rural English village that Pegg's supercop Nick Angel is sent from London for making his fellow officers seem comparably unfit and under-par...Yet he's not soon humbled in that squeaky-clean/creepy-neat village, reluctantly paired with his usual SPACED/SHAUN sidekick Nick Frost as Andy, the endearingly inept son of Jim Broadbent's jovial police chief in what begins as the usual 'two contrary cops warming up enough to trust each other' to a frantic horror flick concerning a cloaked serial killer and tons of violence, thrust under Wright's signature fast-paced snap-cut style, livelier and deadlier than ever...Forcing his characters to keep up with the film itself that, despite running about fifteen-minutes too long (and with about two too many climaxes), gets better/clearer with each viewing as both the main character and audience remain deliberately lost in the dizzying, ever-changing plot-maze, and, despite paying hyperactive tribute to those mainstream American flicks, HOT FUZZ becomes its very own British cop classic in the process.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Olivia Coleman, Edward Woodwood, Martin Freeman, Bill Knighy and Rory McCaan (The Hound from TV's Game Of Thrones) are all here offering solid support.This film plods along grabbing every easy laugh along the way.

Lots of fun!,"What can I say? It's a brilliant comedy that works on the same levels as Shaun of the Dead (even though I haven't seen it!) The story goes that Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg, who also co-wrote this film) is one of the best cops in the UK. But his colleagues are very jealous. So, they send Nick to the sleepy town of Sandford, where not much happens a lot. To make things worse, he's teamed up with a wannabe-cop named Danny (Nick Frost). But soon, a series of murders start to happen, and Nick is convinced that this town may not be so sleepy after all.This film works as a brilliant comedy and a mystery thriller. The thriller only adds to the humour of the film. Simon Pegg was great and brought a lot to the film.This is the best British comedy in years. Very recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Action comedy makes fun of action movies, so is it a parody of itself?","Hilarious comedy combining a wide range of humor, from slapstick to satire, in an 'in you face' way. Basically this movie is filmed like an action movie: flashing between camera angles making a 'whoosh' sound, plenty of swearing, over the top characters and the quintessential action movie cliché large explosion to top it off.There is very little action except about 20 minutes, most of it at the end. The movie is about the perfect police man, Nicolas Angel, who gets transfered from his London job--because he makes the others in the department look bad--to an odd little village in the country. There with his lazy incompetent partner who is infatuated with action movies he investigates a series a 'accidents' which he believes are really murders.Other than his perfect reputation, Sgt. Angel is a realistic police man the only really plausibly realistic character. He does not like to get in to physical confrontation because there is ""a lot of paperwork"", he dislikes guns and says his best police tool is a notebook. By contrast, his partner Danny Butterman is lazy, incompetent and irresponsible.Most of the movie plays out as a mystery comedy with action-like- sequencing. Plenty of British humor and slapstick. And when the movie truly gets heated up the multi-layer humor makes this one of the best comedies in recent years.If you like--or maybe even dislike--most action movies and love comedy then this movie is an excellent choice--but caution: some action involved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
One of my favorite movies,"After seeing a relatively enjoyable experience with Shaun of the Dead, I found myself with an incredible treat known as Hot Fuzz. It proved to be the refreshing film that I think any action movie fan needs to see. Now I have grown so accustomed to action sequences that I have rarely been impressed by action films and 'Fuzz' is definitely one of them.I sort of see it done the same way that Life of Brain was done. You know that this is a comedy about action flicks yet you cannot help but feel that this is something else entirely. It is that well done. I would actually go as far to say that this is one of the best films that the 2001-2010 decade has dished out. And I think the relations between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were better realized in this film.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Not bad,"I work with a guy who saw ""Hot Fuzz"" at a preview screening. He came into work the next day and announced that it was ""The best comedy of all time!""Er... No. It's not the best comedy of all time, but it isn't bad. Yes, it is too long, but it's mostly very funny and I thought (blasphemy!) that it is probably better than ""Shaun Of The Dead"" (which also wasn't bad, but not as brilliant as everybody thought it was). A riotous mickey take, especially towards the end, of those high octane action films that we love and loathe. Lots of great cameos (see if you can spot a very well known Australian Oscar winner) and a great supporting cast of British character actors hamming it up. Great soundtrack of British pop music, as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Watcha' gonna do when the Fuzz come for you?,"Hot Fuzz is undoubtedly the funniest R-rated action comedy, film set in a quaint English village so far. The real question is; could it possibly be the greatest buddy cop film of all time? The genre has become so by-the-numbers of late that it seems ripe for satire. Fortunately writers Simon Penn and Edgar Wright appear to love the source material they delightfully skewer, making references-a-plenty to their predecessors  Lethal Weapon, 48 Hours, Point Break and Bad Boys to name a few. However, unlike the painfully dull, teen catering spoof movies (Scary Movie franchise, Epic Movie, Date Movie), the humour is not handled clumsily and neither is the screenplay overloaded with easy jokes and obvious references. Hot Fuzz is that rare movie which manages to satirize while giving the genre a complete overhaul. At times the film reaches Python-like levels of comedic brilliance.The setup is simple enough: Nick Angel is metropolitan London's top cop. His office is on the streets of the city and business never closes. As a matter of fact he's so good at his job that he singlehandedly outshines his entire department. This does not sit well with his superiors who quickly promote him and pack him off to the sleepy village of Sanford  winner for the last several years of the coveted ""Village of the Year"" crown. Once here the film begins on an entertaining fish out of water track as we witness Angel's toughest assignments which include a crackdown on underage drinking and capturing an escaped Duck (scene stealer of the year!) Naturally he is reprimanded by his superior officer, Inspector Frank Butterman, played ably by the wonderful Jim Broadbent, who always seems to be too good for the parts he plays. He is formulaic-ally teamed up with the less competent Danny Butterman, whose puppy like enthusiasm and man love for his new partner injects hilarity into the inevitable male bonding moments of the film. Look a little closer though and you'll see how good the satire is. We are never shown Nick Angel's love interest - a metaphor for the fact that the love interest in a buddy cop film is typically unmemorable? Except of course for Téa Leoni in ""Bad Boys"", but I digress...All is not what it appears to be in Sanford, naturally. Someone is killing residents of the village and the murders appear to be connected. The rest of the local police service is content to call each case an ""accident"" and shut the books, but Nick Angel is not convinced. ""Sanford hasn't had a murder in over twenty years"" he is told, but what of the malicious remarks made by supermarket owner Simon Skinner? (Played by Timothy Dalton obviously having a great time.) Don't worry; I haven't spoiled anything for you. The movie makes the identity of the killer fairly clear from the outset, though you may be surprised by the motive. As with Shaun of the Dead and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, it's the menace used to underscore the humorous screenplay which works effectively by keeping the audience amused and unsettled in turns. A serial killer is at the very least disquieting and each time the viewers settled into the comedy groove of the movie, the writers orchestrated another gruesome ""accident"". The fate that befalls one plucky reporter is a particularly cringe worthy moment.The film's biggest laughs come at the climax when the action ventures into the preposterous not simply because of the level of violence (which brings to mind the term 'disproportionate response') but also because of the setting. I loved the ""man with no name"" reference just prior to the final confrontation which had the audience screaming hysterically at my screening.Having said all that, a few things did not work for me. The reveal scene in particular lasts a tad too long and while suspension of disbelief is a given with a story like this, the logistics behind the ""accidents"" are mind-boggling considering Angel keeps such a sharp eye on the town. The odd joke falters and Angel escapes a Mexican standoff too easily. These isolated moments do not detract from one of the most entertaining movie experiences of my life, and the film works really well as a date movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"Funny, but not as good as Shaun of the Dead...","Saw this movie on preview night with thoughts of Shaun of the Dead in my mind - one of my favourite comedy movies of all time.Hot Fuzz starts off slowly with a few laughs in the opening third, but when it finally gets going there are a number of very funny moments.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are perfectly cast, bouncing off each other brilliantly.There are a couple of references and in-jokes to Shaun of the Dead that also work well. The fence jumping sequence is hilarious.The final third is a shoot 'em up extravaganza, with lots of guns, car chases and explosions.Overall, it is pretty good stuff, but the other reviews on IMDb seem a bit OTT. For me, Shaun of the Dead had far more laugh out loud moments, and is a movie I could watch again and again (I bought it on the day of release on DVD).

Another Great UK Comedy,"When this film was released in th UK, it was inevitable that it would be compared to Shaun of The Dead, the team's previous film.

Some critics reviewed the film as being funny but slightly too long. I did not find it too long at all, and the ending was one of the funniest moments. I have to travel about 25 miles to get to the nearest cinema, and I was glad that the film wasn't the usual 90 minutes for a comedy film because I felt that it was worth the trouble to get t the cinema to see it.

One of the Best Action Movie Spoofs I've Ever Seen,"""Hot Fuzz"" is, simply put, one kick-ass movie.I haven't yet seen ""Shaun of the Dead"" (though it's now going right to the top of my list), so I didn't know what to expect from this follow up movie from the same team, actor/writer Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright. I expected something much more jokey, more along the lines of a ""Naked Gun"" movie. I had no idea this was going to be so unpredictably crazy and so relentlessly clever.Pegg plays a hard-core police officer married to his job who is assigned as sergeant to a wee, quaint English village that has absolutely no need for a police department. However, once there, he becomes convinced that a string of grisly deaths are not ""accidents,"" as the townspeople are convinced they are, but rather brutal murders. He concocts a complicated theory about the who and why, but the truth turns out to be far simpler, yet much loonier. This twist gives the movie its biggest jolt of energy, and from the moment the real truth is revealed and Pegg turns vigilante cop, the film becomes one of the funniest action movie spoofs I've ever seen.My favorite thing about the film is that Pegg's character, cynical and suspicious of this perfect little village, is proved right in being both cynical and suspicious.""Hot Fuzz"" caught me completely off guard and ended up being one of the best movies I saw in 2007.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Must See,"You see the thing with most action movies is they are already funny inherently. I mean Rambo?

And, yes Point Break is funny even though its two stars are far from funny, (though Ted Theodore Logan is pretty darn funny). But none of this has anything to do with how funny ""Hot Fuzz!!"" is except that the filmmakers love those types of action movies so much they are willing to spoof them in a completely over the top way.From a ridiculous plot and collection of characters to even more ridiculous directorial techniques from hyper active editing of mundane things to overly wrought sound design the movie makers tapped directly into the hot vein of American action genre films. And it is hilarious.Whether you love or hate the movies they are spoofing you'll love ""Hot Fuzz!!"" It's smart in all the right places and completely ludicrous in all the right places which makes for a jolly fun time at the cinemaplex.There has been a glut of ""spoof"" movies from the ""Scary Movie"" cycle to the horrible ""Date Movie"". The difference here is this one rides its own merits of story, character and plot while reminiscing about those great to mediocre action movies of the past without simply twisting a scene directly form those movies.Or simply: these guys are original.

It's very well casted with some great names in there.There's countless great quotes and scenes in here: in the one where they encounter the farmer and are struggling to understand him, the joke was lost on me the first time as I understood most of what he was saying having a strong West Country accent myself.

"A Valiant but Sophomoric Attempt from a Growing, Very Talented Troupe of Players","Hot Fuzz reviewed by Samuel OsbornHot Fuzz is Edgar Wright's follow-up to the clever UK cult smash Shaun of the Dead. Both films run on the same fuel, wearing the chassis of a spoof picture over a more respectful genre comedy underneath. The formula works tepidly this time around, working off a less compelling genre (what can be more compelling than zombies?) and an even less clever screenplay. The same players thankfully return though, with Simon Pegg in the lead role and Nick Frost returning as his adorable doofus foil. The whole project feels like a valiant but sophomoric attempt from a growing, very talented troupe of players and filmmakers. It's not the kind of transitional failure that's bound to oust Wright and company from the business; but the sort of disappointing follow-up that'll quench their loyalists thirst just long enough to wait for their third, hopefully much-improved outing.Edgar Wright mentioned at the screening last Monday that he and his co-writer Simon Pegg aren't out to make parodies, just genre pictures that are funny. So the chosen genre for Hot Fuzz is the Buddy-Cop Film, popularized by the likes of Lethal Weapon, Vanishing Point, and Bad Boys. Their own version of this cop duo is Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) and PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). Angel has been shoved out of the London Metropolitan force for being too efficient. Bill Nighy, in a sly cameo, puts it shamelessly by saying ""You're making us all look bad."" So Angel is relocated to the crime-free village-of-the-year, Sandford, where he meets a dorky gang of police officers sitting around their precinct chowing cake. Without crime there's little need for cops, making Angel an irrelevance. Thankfully, a glib serial killer gowned as the Grim Reaper starts decapitating villagers nightly. Though the rest of the precinct sees the deaths as unfortunate accidents, Angel insights correctly that they're the work a murderer. So as the body count rises, Angel and his cop-flick obsessed partner Butterman, start an investigation of their own.What must be remembered is that a British cop film hasn't been released in a while, probably because police officers aren't allowed to brandish firearms in the UK, rendering much of the drama that officers unload here in the States moot. Wright capitalizes on this fact and makes it a kind of running joke throughout Hot Fuzz. Without the fingering of triggers and clinks and clanks of reloading and cocking of the gun, Wright turns to every other noise to emphasize. Car doors opening and closing, the unraveling of caution tape, and even the application of a super-stylish toothpick all get their own ridiculous sonic exaggeration. The film also gets progressively American, Wright says, the further into the mystery Angel burrows. The dialogue repeatedly gets dumbed-down from talky British humor to single-syllabic American expressions. By the end, the usually over-explanatory Angel reduces his speech to a single, grimaced word: ""Idea."" But it's only these clever directorial tricks that remind us that Hot Fuzz is from the same womb as Shaun of the Dead.Bluntly, Hot Fuzz just isn't very funny. It embraces its chosen genre as fully and lovingly as Shaun of the Dead did, but without the same clever severity. The jokes generally aren't molded to fit the Buddy-Cop genre and are scooped more often from the buckets of broad, common humor. Making matters more dull, the Buddy-Cop device fails to be compelling. Sergeant Angel is cold and mechanical, but not humorously so. He's a yawn at best. And though PC Butterman fishes out most of Hot Fuzz's laughs, he isn't much more than a broad, rounded goofball. The whole thing looks fine enough, as Edgar Wright is a budding, impressive filmmaker with a lot of insightful ideas about the movies rolling off his tongue; but this project is a mild misfire.Samuel Osborn",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"""A Great Big, Bushy Beard""-amount of fun that holds up over the years","Fifteen years later, this film holds up really well in terms of British comedy and poking fun of buddy cop shows in general, and it is the best Pegg/Frost movie at least in my opinion.Even for when this was created over a decade before BLM and Blue Lives Matter hit the American psyche (think the Fascist vs Hag bit) and was a better indicator of how policing works where the ideal, safest places are not what they seem in reality. Specifically, the fact everyone is armed, which is more reminiscent of America in 2022.It also pokes fun at the overall state of policing as well, where the officers who perform really well (the supercops like Pegg) tend to get punished by the lazy, tenured ones in power who don't really care to serve the community. It's a sad dose of reality.Also a shout out to the video editing; there's something about the fast cutaways that add to the comedic and cinematic value and is very enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
The most fun I've had in the cinema EVER,"I went to see this film on the back of all the hype. Friends had seen it and said it was funny and there was so much built-up about it that I presumed it was going to be a huge disappointment.

Only mildly funny but quite a fun ride nonetheless,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a London copper so good he's embarrassing his superiors and fellow officers. So they transfer him to a sleepy village in Glouster called Sandford, where crime doesn't get much worse than some kids drinking under-age or even someone just dropping litter. It's so quiet even the police don't make much of an effort, which Nick discovers when he's partnered with PC Butterman (Nick Frost), a portly copper fascinated with Nick's big city back ground and Hollywood action movies. Frustrated and bored beyond belief, Nick succombs to a Limbo like existence in this sleepy English town- until residents start getting mysteriously bumped off by an unseen assailant. The finger of suspicion points towards suave, sly super-market owner Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) who stands to gain the most from the deaths. But just when things start getting interesting again, Nick starts to discover a truth more baffling than even he could imagine.As a much better reviewer than me has already said, it's unfortunate that Hot Fuzz came out in a week when gun crime had hit the headlines of British newspapers in a manner unprecedented to anything seen before. Even for a film setting out to parody Hollywood action movies and the British mentality to gun violence, many probably thought it in bad taste after the week's shocking events. Still, it doesn't seem to have hurt it's box office performance too badly, being the second film from writer/star comedy duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost after the over-rated but highly successful Shaun of the Dead.As I've already said, it's setting out to send up Hollywood action films and simultaneously mocking the British response to this way of life. I did snigger a few times but I can't say there was anything that really made me explode with laughter. It's more successful as an affectionate tribute to the films it's setting out to take the p*ss out of, beaming through with Frost's character passionately singing the virtues of such films as Bad Boys II and Point Break, just two from his over-flowing library of such films.The film does well performances wise. Pegg is actually really quite convincing as a hard, no nonsense policeman, even though he's playing it for laughs, whilst Frost is great fun in the support role, eagerly and joyfully trying to emulate his big city partner to great effect. As the villain, Dalton's far more restrained than his days where he played James Bond, although it's safe to say he'll now be typecast forever in this dastardly English villain role. And there's also a nice supporting appearance from Jim Broadbent, content to play a secondary character in spite of his wider recognition now.I'd liked to have laughed a bit more, but I can't say I didn't have some nice fun with this film. More than I was expecting after the disappointment after the hype of SOTD. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Best comedy of all time, a masterclass in writing","If I would have aspiring filmmakers watch a single movie to see how to write a film script, it would be this one. Not a single wasted line. Everything is either a set-up, continuation or pay-off to a joke. Sometimes all 3 at the same time. Seemingly random lines come back later to hilarious effect. Additionally, this movie mixes horror, British murder mystery and cop action movie, all while being a comedy, and does it all perfectly. Only one minute into watching this movie, I knew it was going to be a masterpiece. Knowing how small the budget was and how little time they had to film it, only makes it more impressive. Additionally, no one does editing better. Edgar Wright can take things that are mundane and boring, and present it in a visually very interesting way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A hilarious action-packed mystery movie with plenty of style,"Hot Fuzz is a magnificent addition to the Cornetto trilogy. Edgar Wright's style is iconic, unique and hilarious. A legendary director that I dearly admire. His humor is one of the best in the biz and one that anyone can get into. He has a playful nature in his movies that's very enjoyable to watch. He always has these fast-paced tightly-edited sequences in his movies and they're always great. A director who focuses on making some of the most entertaining and exciting movies in a fresh way. He has a way of making his movies flow beautifully. The pacing in his movies is excellent and is no exception in this one. The audio design, music, soundtrack and sound effects are always brilliant and cleverly put together. The way his movies are edited so tightly is something I admire. He has a fresh and exciting way of shooting action sequences as well. Zoom-in shots are always hilarious.You can tell something's off, something's awry, once Nicholas (Simon Pegg) gets to the sleepy countryside town. Although something's amiss with the town, I love the whole quaint and quiet vibe of it. There's something kind of cozy about it, like nothing bad can happen. It's quite clever how the town slowly becomes less cozy and more creepier as things start to get more ominous and serious. The DVD collection that Danny has is quite impressive. Apparently, a lot of those DVD's belong to Edgar in real life. This movie is chock full of movie references both in the dialogue and the way they film certain scenes.It's a cleverly written story that sort of satires the English murder mystery shows that take place in the smaller rural towns. It's also great social commentary on the hidden secrets and conspiracies that might exist in our world, even in small villages. Small villages that try to preserve themselves from outsiders so that their town can continue to be perfect and pleasant to live in, undisturbed by filth. At least, this is what they're trying to convey with the neighborhood watch in this movie. I love how the living statue at the end still has his hands up but now with a fearful look on his face. It's ridiculous to the point of hilarity the lengths the townsfolk are willing to go to in order to keep their town perfect. The movie's climatic over the top shootout sequence at the end is amazing.Hot Fuzz is a hilarious and action-packed mystery movie with plenty of style. This one's a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Don't go see it with a hangover! Yarp,"A very good friend of mine dragged me out the day after quite the night before to whitens this comedic odyssey of village policing. In fact I'm only just over 'the night that was' now, forty eight hours since it all started. Enough of my personal problems. Though I must share with you one of my shortcomings before I proceed any further. I am not at all familiar with the work of Mr Pegg and Mr Wright. So I was going into this film with no perception of quite what to expect. A lot like the whole of the rest of the weekend for that matter.We both arrived somewhat dazed at the cinema just as the opening trailers started to roll so by time we queued and stocked up on sugary products and popcorn in order to rejuvenate our somewhat flagging serotonin levels we strolled in to find our seats midway through the last ad just in time to see the BBFC's certification of the picture flash up on screen. I know this bothers a lot of people, even me on occasions, but for an afternoon screening in our local cinema this kind of behaviour is recommended in order not to have to endure the drollery of the hooded mass that makes up Southampton's Hoodie clad Chav 'maseve'.On with the show! I found the film absolutely enthralling. I could identify with Pegg's character through out as I too can be something of the perfectionist. That's all I'll say about the plot. The humour I must admit I found rather accommodating. (I lied earlier when I sad I was unfamiliar with their work, I once saw twenty minutes of a episode of Spaced and didn't think too much of it).Both my buddy and I are quite the closet film geeks so we were throughout able to fill in the gaps in each other's knowledge. And we felt rather superior as we roared with laughter and applauded as the Chav mass around us stared blankly into their mobile phones. Despite this the uncouth behaviour of our fellow movie goers there was only one rude interruption when the cinema's fire alarm was tripped. My buddy suggested tearing the place up. But I told him I was too hung-over and that he probably was too. So he ran (as best he could) off to the lobby for more fizzy pop.After this crude interruption the film rolled on. The second half having even more action and laughs than first. So much so I almost had to leave the theatre. My nausea almost getting the better of me. But I endured. With gritted teeth and tears of delight running down my face as the film unfolded before my eyes.Seriously film fans, go see it But, not with a hangover.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Brilliant!,"I am a huge fan of ""Shaun of the Dead"" so when I heard about ""Hot Fuzz"" coming out I knew immediately that I'd want to see it. The problem is that I only heard about recently  it's a shame that it hasn't gotten the marketing and advertising it deserves. I swear that crap reviewed movie ""Next"" has a commercial every break but I think I only saw a handful of commercials for ""Hot Fuzz"" and most of them promoted it in the wrong way.Anyway, back to the review, I don't think that this movie was as sharp as ""Shaun of the Dead,"" however, it was still the best movie I've seen this year and the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Everything was done in superb excess from the violence to the profanity to the over the top graphic gags. I have missed films that overindulge in the use of the whip pan, crash zoom and jump cut and I can't think of a better comic duo than Pegg and Frost. My only real complaint is that the ending got a bit long and I would've cut it a little sooner, but still even with that the movie is hilarious.Truly a must see!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Fun movie with slick action,"Hot Fuzz is an action-comedy with great humor and, well, great action. At times it seems serious and slick enough to be a real action film. But then something down right silly and outrageous happens and you realize that it IS a comedy. Where Hot Fuzz triumphs is the way that they use all the gimmicks of action movies to give it the feel of an action movie (like quick camera angles, catchy noises, and awesome sound track). And though I would say it's a full blown comedy, sometimes it is to serious or slow and makes the viewer really want something funny to happen. But no worries, every scene somebody has something to say that has a harsh wit to it. When it all comes down to the last 20 or 30 minutes, Hot Fuzz then really brings out the humor. Lets just say it's one of the funniest and most intense action sequences I've ever seen. This movie is a MUST SEE for any fan of Spaced or Shaun of the Dead or Action movies. Good stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
fantastic but falls apart in the home stretch,"From the makers of ""Shaun of the Dead"" comes ""Hot Fuzz,"" a takeoff on cop buddy/action movies that is hilarious for about the first hour-and-a-half or so of its two-hour-plus running time, until it falls victim to its own over-the-top excesses.Nicholas Angel is a London police officer with the highest arrest rate on the force. Does this statistic earn him a round of applause, an increase in pay, or a promotion to a higher rank, as one might expect? Heavens no. In fact, Angel is so good at what he does that he has become something of an embarrassment to the far less highly-motivated cops who work with him. Thus, he is sent to serve and protect the good citizens of Sandford, which is, we are told, the village with the smallest crime rate in all of England. At first, Angel understandably balks at being such a big crime-fighting fish in such a small, seemingly crime-free pond. And, indeed, he begins his service to the community by arresting large swaths of the city's population for decidedly minor infractions. Soon, however, Angel finds himself embroiled in a far more pressing case when prominent citizens suddenly begin showing up dead, the victims of a possible serial killer who may recently have begun operating in the vicinity.In its initial stages, ""Hot Fuzz"" is wickedly funny both as a parody of cop movie conventions and as a wry commentary on British rural values. The typically dry and subtle humor arises from the juxtaposition of the by-the-book stick-to-itness of Angel with the lackadaisical indifference of virtually everyone else with whom he comes in contact. It would have been very easy for director Edgar Wright and his co-scenarist, Simon Pegg (who also plays Angel) to have reduced the character to the level of a mere caricature or buffoon. Instead, Angel comes across as a man fully aware of his high-strung obsessiveness (he's lost at least one marriage over it) yet powerless to change it. Pegg is wonderfully restrained and deadpan as the highly focused, crime fighting Angel, while Nick Frost makes a perfect foil as his inept, but starry-eyed partner who thinks the life of a cop should be more in keeping with what he sees in movies like ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys II"" than what he regularly experiences on the job in Sandford. There are fine performances, too, from Timothy Dalton, Martin Freeman, Jim Broadbent and Paddy Considine, and many others. And I defy you to pick out Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan and Peter Jackson in their uncredited cameo appearances.""Hot Fuzz"" might have been a flawless, classic comedy had the filmmakers been able to refrain from over-indulging their very obvious fondness for large-scale action sequences. Indeed, it is not too long past the midway point that the movie begins to spiral out of control, as Wright and Pegg fall into the trap of mistaking parodies of tedious action scenes for tedious action scenes themselves.Still, I choose to dwell not on the weaknesses of ""Hot Fuzz,"" but rather on its strengths, for here is a film that at least knows how to make us laugh for a good deal of the time that we are in its company. And that's saying quite a lot these days.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
The greater good...it's great and good.,"Hot fuzz is a must see for all movie fans; there is so much to see and so much happening.Starring as always the brilliant Simon Pegg and the funny Nick Frost as two policeman (Nicholas Angel and Danny) in the sleepy village of Sandford (or IS it sleepy?) This film manages to combine laugh out loud humour with drama, murder, kick ass action sequences and in some ways a love story. The script by Simon and Edgar is very witty and well thought out.The supporting cast are great too with great, peculiar personalities that really confuse Angel when he first arrives in Sandford, Jim Broadbent especially comes to mind as he gives a great performance as Danny's father.Overall the film is worth watching again and again as you miss loads the first time you watch it; the acting and direction is great and everyone works so well together. The only bad point is that it should have been about ten minutes shorter but that's just being picky.Another triumph from Simon, Edgar, Nick and the crew.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
oh my god!!!                           how to be disappointed in 121 minutes,"This is cheesy, actors have made this film to enjoy themselves (jumping into loaded skip, jumping and shooting at the same time...) this SO does NOT live to expectations. BEWARE of the misspent £15 for two! Jokes are extremely bad, acting is pathetic, this film does not achieve anything: you barely laugh, there is no suspense, you're not surprised as the plot could have been invented by a seven year old and it does not make any point. I suppose if you liked scary movie and others of the same genre, you will like it. however, it certainly does not top Monty Python (favourite classic), or so many other excellent British comedies. Finally, I would not be surprised if they decided to make it a TV series that would be ditched after the first season as it would be slated by the entire country. Bit of advice, do not waste your time and go and see this. Don't even bother renting it, borrow it from a friend who has got more money than sense and then waste your evening but not your cash.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Bring on the Fuzz!,"I absolutely loved this film. I can not wait until the DVD comes out so I can watch this over and over! I am not familiar with the guys that wrote, directed and starred in this, but man, they absolutely hit the nail on the head in their send up of American bad-arse cop movies. They hit the perfect note with the cop that can do no wrong surrounded by inept cops.Simon Pegg is picture perfect in this film. I have yet to see Sean of the Dead, but this film has me wanting to pick that title up sight unseen.I love the quick cuts and the mix of British sensibility with American hotshot cop flicks.

"Comedy, Action and Horror ! ! !","Multiple nods to Shaun of the Dead are also made, including the fence-based short cut (""What's the matter Danny? Never taken a short cut before?""), but with a role reversal of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the one-worded Cornetto requests, the way Angel and Danny describe some suspicious characters on the street, a pub slot machine jingle (Oo-ah-Dracula) heard in the 'Winchester', the product advertised in the pub; in Shaun, the rifle in the Winchester was thought to be deactivated but was not while in Hot Fuzz, it was thought the sea mine was also deactivated but was not.Also, when the massive shoot-out is taking place, Danny asks where they should go, to which Angel replies ""Pub?"" which is also said with the roles reversed in Shaun. In Shaun, Ed (Nick Frost) is said to have shot his sister in the foot with an air-rifle. In Hot Fuzz, Danny shoots Dr. Hatcher in the foot twice: the first time, accidentally with an air rifle; the second time, deliberately by 'surrendering' his shotgun.

I also thought them showing us the killings all over again was a bit too repetitive. I doubt the adults will enjoy it much. Depending upon if they love teenage humor and comedy and things teen i doubt they will enjoy it. If your parents love true funny movies and know what comedy is about bring them along.

"Decent movie, a bit long and the main characters are impossible to relate to","First, let me start off by saying I think Shaun of the Dead is one of the best flicks out there. I was going in expecting another similarly stellar comedy. Instead, the chit-chat humor and quick shock chuckle moments that SOTD have are basically non-existent in Hot Fuzz. The humor is in the entire scope of what is going on.There's no way to personally relate to any of the main characters, so the humor is seemingly in the disconnect. For example, somebody is over the top stiff and dedicated, another is comic book villain evil to the core, another character is simply annoying, yet another character is a big evil fuddy foe, and that's basically the joke. The entire movie is based on how nobody is actually like any of the characters, so it falls short of any personal connection. Yet Hot Fuzz tries to draw you in with the dialogue and fails to deliver with any good comedic substance.The plot also suffers from identity crisis. Is it an action movie with lots of explosions and silly solutions to gunfights? Is it a slasher? Is it face paced? Is it slow paced? Can I view the entire movie without fidgeting in my seat?Hot Fuzz really isn't a bad movie, it's enjoyable on some levels. I love Dalton in this movie, I don't think they could have casted a better fit for his role nor anyone else have pulled his character off so flawlessly. There are some funny moments too, but they are few and far between. The movie pretends to have a fast pace yet it moves VERY slow. So you're constantly trying to put lots of focus and energy into following the movie and the favor isn't returned.The movie looked like it was a blast to produce, but in the end, it just isn't memorable.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Fuzz Facts....... Watch movie again,"The best thing about this movie is in the extra features.

Thoroughly enjoyable.This feature definitely changes this title from an 8 (for being funny as the parody comedy it is) to a 9.This movie is watchable twice (or more....) a very very hard comedic feat, making it an obvious A lister.Up there with my favorite films, but not quite......",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Brilliant,"The most brilliant movie I've seen all year. The humor is both subtle and outrageous, a la Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. The rapid-fire editing style moves the scenes along and the equally rapid writing is engaging and hysterical. The chemistry between Pegg and Frost is simultaneously touching and genius. This movie begs, borrows and steals from other movies in the ""cop"" genre without apology, and to great effect.I am a big fan of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, but I do not want to compare Hot Fuzz to Shaun of the Dead and Spaced. Hot Fuzz is brilliantly funny, ironic, subtle and well-crafted in its own right. I am sorry for the limited release in the US, as this movie deserves a wider audience.

Non-hilarious,"Hot Fuzz is one of the most revered movies of the year, and especially in it's native Britain it has been the object of unparalleled praise. I for my part, find the HF-phenomena a bit strange. The reason is not that the movie is crap, it's just not that funny. I have no problem seeing what Pegg/Wright are trying to accomplish, and their target is a good one when fulfilled. However this is not the case, and HF ends up being caught in a vacuum between action, crazy comedy and splatter, instead of being a crazy action/splatter comedy. The action is OK but not mindblowing,the gore feels awkwardly misplaced, and most important; the comedy is not funny enough. I find myself slightly snickering in stead of belly-laughing. Although containing the ingredients, this movie fails to be hilarious, and a crazy-comedy short of hilarious is unfortunately a failure. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the gore-scenes are the gross-out, squirm-inducing kind, not the ludicrous, splatty, funny ones. The plot is not the most important thing of this genre, but I was surprised by the smalltown premise, after the promotion of HF as actioncomedy/buddy/police-parody, which usually are set in the city. In summary; I'm overall disappointed, both due to my own (maybe unfair)expectations of what kind of situations the movie would include, but also by the failure to deliver the gags that actually ARE in the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"Yes, it is as good and fun as you would expect.","It's really a movie that is made great by its writing and style. Edgar Wright has a very particular and stylish directing style. His movies bring comedies to another level. You'll be always able to recognize an Edgar Wright movie (even when Simon Pegg isn't in it) through its style. It's fast and enhances and makes truly the movie its comical moments. But also the writing is great. Despite the fact that it actually has a very simplistic concept and the movie is basically a one joke movie (a big-town, successful police officer, who does things always by the book gets promoted away to the dull and slow countryside.). The story and its script are filled with some great and just plain silly (in a good way) moments and some unusual, funny characters.Of course things in the country side are not as calm and innocent as it seems at first sight. Soon he stumbles upon a series of sudden killings. So yes, there actually is still a main plot present in the movie as well, which is an enjoyable one that knows to keep you interested throughout as well, no matter how silly it gets at times.After this some crazy, absurd, over-the-top action kicks in, which really makes the movie all the more hilarious to watch. It's obviously deliberately done totally over-the-top, just as are the movie its characters all. The movie is needlessly violent and graphic, which actually works all the more hilarious for the movie its comedy because its all so extremely well and professionally done. It was the foremost reason why for instance ""Shaun of the Dead"" also worked out so well.Simon Pegg's and Edgar Wright's previously successes have as a result for this movie that some big well known actors show up in this movie in some small roles. Actors such as Stuart Wilson, Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent and Cate Blanchett all appear in this movie. It even has Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson in it, in a 3 seconds cameo. Of course Simon Pegg still is the central character of the movie but this time he and Nick Frost don't need to carry the movie as much alone as they for instance still had to do in ""Shaun of the Dead"". They are both great comedian actors but it's a real good thing that the movie has also some great supporting actors.If you liked ""Shaun of the Dead"", you will love ""Hot Fuzz"".9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Great fun and terribly clever,"""Hot Fuzz"" completely exceeded my expectations. I never would have thought that Edgar Wright and the gang could possibly top the wonderful ""Shaun of the Dead"" from back in 2004, but somehow ""Hot Fuzz"" does with flying colors. This is literally a belly laugh a minute type of film, which was made possible by the great performances by Simon Pegg and the always oafishly hilarious Nick Frost. Action movie junkies will also be pleased with the wealth of in-jokes and homages to popular action/cop/buddy/crime movies of the past such as Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Police Story 3, Leon: The Professional, Point Break, Bad Boys 2 and even Straw Dogs. Mixed with it's seemingly flawless blend of action, humor, gore and slapstick makes ""Hot Fuzz"" not only one of the best films of the year so far, but one of the best comedies I've seen in the past few years.Highly Recommended*",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Bonum Communae Communitates,"""Hot Fuzz"" is a wonderful film about people who take their matters very seriously in a world that doesn't, about them being imprisoned by their own goals and about the great liberation that comes with the opportunity to make their cause public and publicly fight for it in their own way.As such an uplifting film and besides that very funny. The self reference here is ruthlessly choreographed, there's not one word of dialogue, not one name, that wouldn't be there for a reason, that wouldn't relate to another part of the film. And the actors do a superb job letting the characters become real life persons, no matter how weird they are, they are so intensely portrayed that they grow familiar inevitably, so that, all together, it is almost a theater play of great inner texture, from whose arbitrary inadequacies its humour is derived.This is a wonderful film, I already said so, a present day ""Arsenic and Old Lace"".

The Best Film By Simon Pegg And Edgar Wright,"This film is amazing! if you didn't catch that that was a quote from the outtakes on the two disc DVD.

really not that good actually,"It's a little suspicious that the first few comments on IMDb about this film tend to be bad or mediocre, but that bad comments have since been swamped by thousands of not just good, but ecstatic ones.I very much wonder if the production companies publicity machine is at work here. Or maybe there are just a lot of people out there who are happy to see a British comedy that recycles enough Hollywoodisms to be familiar enough for them to process without doing any work at all. Fair enough, why not. I'm all for supporting local talent. But at the end of the day, let's not pretend it's anywhere near as funny as it out to be, anywhere near as funny as the American action comedies it's based on and which it spoofs.The jokes are clichéd, the one liners are tired, the renderings of British stereotypes are nowhere near as incisive or memorable as even a show like, say, little Britain, let alone the Office or Baron-Cohen's stuff. Even by British standards, the comedy isn't that hot, the plotting is weak, and the slippage between action and comedy at which the original American films excel is sloppily executed. With low expectations, you can definitely enjoy this film, it's funny in parts and it is after all great to see home-grown jokes with recognisable home-grown characters. But don't get your hopes up.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A Different Kind Of Comedy,"An instant classic, an interesting story with some memorable characters and a unique comedic style. While it wasn't hysterically funny, the slight references to just about every other cop film ever made and the intensity of Nick Angel are pretty good. When it comes to mystery movies I'm like Batman, I figure it out pretty early. It still kept me interested all the way though and the exact details of how everyone in the town was involved in the conspiracy surprised me. I think the best comedies are the ones that parody a particular genre like Kung Pow to martial arts films or Austin Powers to spy films. Hot Fuzz does a pretty good take on cop films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Scorching,"I feel compelled to put a comment in on this film. I am a big fan of the Wright/Pegg/Frost combination, and was hoping for something in the vein of ""Spaced"" or ""Shaun of the Dead"" - which i wouldn't call this. The homages to film and television are still there (i'm sure it will take three or four viewings to spot them all), but Simon Pegg and Nick Frost don't have the comfort of basically just playing themselves this time - they have characters to portray, and they both pull it off admirably (especially Pegg, who he has demonstrated his acting skills on a number of programmes previously in the UK).This film is also more plot driven than ""Spaced"" or ""Shaun..."", and as such i think more accessible to audiences who maybe won't see or aren't interested in the *nudge-nudge* pop culture references. There are belly-laugh funny lines that don't require an intimate knowledge of George Lucas's universe, ""Resident Evil"" or electro music; (some lines WILL be much funnier if you've seen ""Shaun of the Dead"" first, though). The cameos alone (just glance through the cast list...) will be enough to satisfy those of us who would have appreciated an homage-o-meter to spot all the single shot or two-word references to films both classic and cheesy.Anyway... skip to the end...I do have reservations about the last two minutes or so, and it isn't the trickiest 'whodunnit' to work out (obviously i can't be specific - i'm not writing any spoilers in this one, but it isn't as blatant as i've made it sound either); but these points certainly weren't enough to ruin what was a top-notch piece of cinematic entertainment. Apart from an open air showing of ""Enter the Dragon"" at Glastonbury, it was the happiest, loudest, liveliest cinema audience i've ever been privileged to sit amongst.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Edgar Wright And Simon Pegg DO IT AGAIN!!!!  EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!,"SHAUN OF THE DEAD's creators: Edgar Wright And Simon Pegg have now brought us HOT FUZZ!!! If you loved SHAUN OF THE DEAD's, you will love this flick too! These guys really love movies and pay tribute to their favorites every time they produce something new!!! THIS FLICK ROCKS!!! Hot Fuzz is a homage to every action movie that has been produced for the past 20 years. Not only do they pay tribute to movies like Point Break and Bad Boys II, but they have fun doing it! Their trick is that they don't make fun of these movies, they embrace them and their conventions, improve on them, and make them funny. These guys make this type of movie, dare I say it, even more enjoyable!!! Not exactly an easy task!!! This is the type of movie that makes you believe that there are people out there that really want to make good movies, not just a few bucks!!!

Naked Gun is very funny. Fuzz is not funny at all!,"The trailer made me laugh out loud, and that's why I went to see this piece of nonsense. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the funny parts. I'm not kidding! I felt so ripped off!! I was ready to walk out after watching the first 15 minutes without even cracking a smile. I love dry humor, but this was way too dry! Every gag in this movie has been seen before too, so maybe that's why I didn't feel like laughing. No movie has made me laugh more than Naked Gun when I first saw it, and this movie is no Naked Gun. Not even close!!!!! People who find this even 1/10 as amusing as the Naked Gun series must be out of their minds!Action scenes in this movie sucked royally too, and there are no gun fights until the last 20 minutes of the movie. Worth the wait? NOT! Nothing original and like I said before..if you've seen the trailer/previews then that's all you needed to see of this pathetic film. I had more fun laughing at the stupidity of John Cena in The Marine then I did with this film.Craig Ferguson of the Late Late Show is very funny. Monty Python is funny. This movie is not!

Great flick,"I loved this movie. It's about a cop who's very obsessive with Law Enforcement & takes his job way more seriously than the other cops. No crime is too small - he chases guys for blocks just for pocketing candy bars. He's better at his job than the other cops & therefore gets harassed & made fun of. City politicians & people in the town make fun of him too. He's a loner without friends. Because he's been solving all the cases the other cops want to get rid of him. He makes them look bad. He gets relocated to a small country police dept & is issued a new partner. His new partner starts to notice how much of a good cop he is & starts to learn from him. They end up being good friends & work to solve all the crimes in the town. It's a funny movie & has a lot of feel good, heartfelt moments in it. I liked that this is a movie that puts cops in a good light helping people & the community. The good guys keep trying & eventually win over all the bad guys!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

The Boys are Back in Town,Hot fuzz the film that proves the successful transition from small to big screen of the Edgar Davis / Simon Pegg partnership accompanied by Nick Frost was more than a one off hit and does so in style. Edgar Davis shows that he is a competent director playing with different genres and even though this is a comedy all the way down the line the action sequences are well enough done to suggest that he could churn out a great action pic. Simon Pegg is Nicholas Angel a high performing Police Officer who has to relocate to the country village of Sandford from London and in doing so the has to deal with more than a little culture shock at the same time as unearthing a few village secrets. The movie rattles along at a good pace with no scene wasted and at least one laugh in every scene. Pegg is ably supported once again by Nick Frost as his bumbling side kick Danny. Then as the movie unfolds we are treated to who's who of British comedy and drama filling supporting and cameo roles. I would give particular kudos to Timothy Dalton who steals pretty much every scene he is in as the magnificently sleazy Simon Skinner. The movie comes to it's inevitable conclusion that still had me laughing and certainly warrants repeated viewings.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"an OK film, but it doesn't deserve the high rating that regional pride has given it","I've personally given this a 1, but only to try to compensate for the horde of British that are all voting this as a 9 or 10, simply because it is British.It's not a bad film, I'd probably give it a 6 though... except for the jiggle game. That drops it to a 4. Unless a film is ground breaking in some fashion, or impressive in some way (and this film is neither, everything here has been done before), an 8+ isn't really the way to go.Worse, and I simply can not stress this enough, I had to leave the film at the end. The special effects with the ""mega-jiggle"" cam are so horrid, so terrible, so inane, that I simply could not watch any more. I can only presume that the special effects were so poor, or the acting so inept, that the action scenes needed to be utterly overridden by this new horror.The jiggle cam horror.What is it, that makes film makers think viewers come to the cinema, to *not* see any special effect save the jiggle cam? When a car is exploding, when bullets are flying, when a 1 million dollar stunt is occurring, wouldn't it be a good idea to allow the view to actually see what is happening?! I guess not. :/",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A parody of movie/TV shows about cops & bad guys,"The ""Inspector Morse"" or Helen Mirren's series on PBS is about as far as I go in this police genre but ""Hot Fuzz"" is a good parody of all cop films, clashes between the cops and bad guys. Having seen few of them, I missed the many scene quotes but could readily believe there were hundreds. The film is like a Saturday Night Live or Monty Python view of the genre.As others have mentioned, the first third sets up the viewer for the following two-thirds.While there is considerable violence, it's so over the top it creates no flinching. Guns blaze, hundreds of rounds of ammo are fired, and no one drops.I enjoyed the subtle(?) twitting of a particular social group about their desire to have everything ""nice and in good taste"" so it's a cardinal sin to depart from that. That segment of English society has no monopoly on such a view, of course, but here they represent that attitude in cultures other than just the UK.Good fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"One of the funniest, fastest and most thrilling comedies I have ever seen.","Comedy often takes many different forms. Some comedies rely on ""slap- stick"" humour, where sounds and visual gags make up a large portion of the jokes. Other comedies rely on satire or irony, in which absurd situations and mocking parodies makes the fabric of its amusement.Many say that one of the most important aspects of a joke is the timing, and this is exactly what director Edgar Wright uses to create his films.Hot Fuzz is the second film in the planned trilogy; Blood and ice cream, directed by Edgar Wright, featuring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. It is the follow up to 2004 film; Shaun of the dead, featuring primarily the same cast as Hot Fuzz, which is not strictly a sequel to Shaun of the dead, since the two films have completely different plots and characters.Simon Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a talented young police constable in London's metropolitan police service, who is very dedicated to his job. He gets called to the station one day, and is offered a promotion to sergeant, the downside being that he has to leave London, to take his sergeant post in the crime-free, idyllic country town of Sandford, Gloucestershire. When he declines the offer, stating that he enjoys his current job, it turns out that it is no offer after all. The reasoning behind this is that he is so good at what he does, that he is making the rest of the police look bad. He is left with no choice but to take the post and leave London.In Sandford he is partnered with fellow police officer Danny Butterman, played by Nick frost, a childish and naïve man, with whom Pegg's character gradually builds a friendship with. Danny and Nicholas are polar opposites. Nicholas is a perfectionist and a workaholic, while Danny is a slacker who longs for a more cinematic, action filled life. Against all odds, their personality turns out to be a perfect fit, as Nicholas mentors Danny to become a better officer, while Danny teaches Nicholas to ""switch off"".As the days go by, strange deaths starts to occur, and while Nicholas suspects murder, the rest of the force brushes it off as accidents. Maybe this town is not so crime-free after all.This all leads up to a very satisfying climax, one that I do not wish to spoil. All that I can say is that it is action packed, hilarious and exquisitely put together.Edgar Wright's comedies rely heavily on timing, and this film is no exception. The movie moves fast, and the jokes move along even faster. You can watch it over and over, and always find something new to laugh at. It is filled to the brim with jokes, each joke funnier than the last one.Edgar Wright has a very distinct style of cutting, with fast scenes used as transitions or visual gags. These scenes are usually very clear and straight to the point, such as the scene when he travels to Sandford, a very fast sequence of clips, primarily highlighting the facts that not much is happening.Edgar wright's other work consists of mostly amateur films and television programs. He has only directed two other feature length films with a theatrical release; Shaun of the dead, and Scott Pilgrim VS. the world, both of which were well received by critics. His upcoming works include The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn, which he is co- writing, as well as the third and final entry in the Blood and ice cream trilogy; The world's end.Not new to the silver screen, is that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are both great in their roles, delivering their dialogue perfectly. They are a perfect duo. The rest of the cast includes actors like Timothy Dalton, along with other great actors, whose screen presence is easily recognisable.Pegg and Frost, as the duo is commonly referred as, have also starred together in the recent film Paul, where they once again play a duo of best friends.The film is great, not a single joke falls flat, the timing is perfect, the pace is great and every character is played well. Few films can be viewed so many times without feeling old, but this one can, due to genius writing and a truly great sense of humour. If you like to laugh, if you are amused by the amusing, and think it is fun having fun, this is a film you absolutely have to see. You must be saltier than the see and colder than the permafrost of Antarctica to not enjoy this. I give it a perfect score, A+, 100%, 10/10 and six on a die. Go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
The best movie of the year so far,"Hot Fuzz is fun. Amazing fun. While Shaun of the Dead is a tribute movie to zombie films, Hot Fuzz is a tribute to the action genre while poking fun at Agatha Christie/Midsomer Murders.The plot revolves around Nicolas Angel ( Simon Pegg ), a top policeman whose record in the Met is becoming an embarrassment to the other policeman; so much so the the Chief Inspector ( Bill Nighy ) transfers him to the countryside village of Samford; where he meets; amongst others his new Inspector ( Jim Broadbent ), Sergeant Turner ( Bill Bailey ) and his new partner ( Nick Frost ). He also meets Simon Skinner ( Timothy Dalton ), a very devilish supermarket conveyor. This sleepy village however, is soon seen to be something more as a mysterious amount of 'accidents' lead Angel to believe that something is afoot at Samford.The acting in this movie is great with numerous comedians and seasoned British actors getting their two cents worth and looking like they're thoroughly enjoying themselves. The script is razor sharp and adds plenty of laughs and the last 45 minutes is fantastic.Movies should, above all else, get you involved, and Hot Fuzz does that in spades. English comedy is ready to kick a** and take names.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
The Best of the Cornetto Trilogy,"Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz is about Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) who is transferred from London to the village Sandford for being too serious of a cop that is doing everyone's job. Sandford turns out to be a largely crime free village and Nicholas is bored to death and is trying to find something interesting when some ""accidents"" begin to happen. Nicholas believes something more is going on and this is what makes up the rest of the movie.Honestly this movie might be my favorite of the Cornetto Trilogy, named as such for the recurring Cornetto ice cream cones in the three movies with Simon Pegg. It has the right amount of comedy and a proper mystery which is also laced with the right laughs. Honestly the mystery aspects are quite interesting that made it my favorite, the fact that it has a solid story line which holds up even if you put aside all the jokes and comedy. It's a quite interesting whodunnit which leads to an interesting conspiracy thriller.Apart from being a mystery this movie has a great buddy cop angle which has you hooked in and rooting for the two cops, Nicholas Angel and PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). Honestly the buddy cop angle is just awesome and the chemistry between Nick Frost and Simon Pegg is just one of the best parts of the movie. It's definitely taken to the next level coming from Shaun of the Dead.The gags which serve as call backs to Shaun of the Dead are just hilarious and watching both the movies in the same day truly made me notice and appreciate them a whole lot more. The comedy is just the major highlight of the movie and Edgar Wright hits it out of the park with the comedy in this film. He definitely topped Shaun of the Dead, it has so many quotable moments and Edgar Wright definitely became one of my favorite filmmakers after this movie. The retorts and meta jokes are just taken up a notch and hilarious.Overall, the movie is definitely a must watch for fans of comedy and for fans of Shaun of the Dead or any other Edgar Wright film. In fact, this may be one of the best of his Cornetto trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Bad Ass,"I loved Shawn of the Dead. When I saw that the guys who made that had another comedy spoof coming out I was STOKED.

So if you aren't well versed in the action movie genre (Such as Bad Boys II, or Top Gun) then you might not enjoy this film nearly as much as I did. I really loved all the action movie questions that Danny keeps asking Sgt. Nicholas throughout the film, then in the final action sequence all of the things Danny asked Sgt. Nicholas if had done, he ends up doing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Slightly overrated...,"Whilst I am a big fan of Simon Peggs films (Shaun of the Dead, Run Fatboy Run), I must say that, in comparison to these other two titles, I was somewhat disappointed.The actors are brilliant, especially Pegg, he and Frost bring their rather unique sense of humour to this film, but is there enough of it? What I believe this film lacks is the comedy that the others have. Don't get me wrong, it has its fair share of humour, with witty comments and ironic moments, but nothing that would make you laugh aloud too much. It also has a rather slow start, the first hour or so is very much a slightly amusing build up to a terrific final 45 minutes.The second half of this film is what makes it rather good, its action packed with unexpected comic violence, this makes the first dull hour worth watching. I do recommend this title, especially if you are a fan of Pegg and Frost, but I don't think you should expect it to be as good as Peggs other two major films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

"By Mr. Edgar Wright, nuff said.","After being injured by a petty criminal dressed as Father Christmas, Nicholas Angel, top London cop, is sent to the countryside because of his team's rather selfish reasons.

But almost as soon as Sergeant Angel arrives, a chain of brutal murders take place that the local detectives dismiss only as mere accidents. It is up to Sergeant Angel to get to the bottom of the conspiracy and catch the mastermind behind the plot. Seriously, this film is not one to miss.

A very unique comedy,"I must admit that I've only seen bits and pieces of ""Shaun of the Dead"" so I was not sure what to expect from ""Hot Fuzz"". I expected the usual from a comedy, a few chuckles throughout. From the very beginning, I was sure that I was wrong. Instead of the usual serious guy in a strange situation plot that comedies tend to over use, we had elements of great storytelling throughout. Even when things tended to get silly, everything was still woven together and very much made sense. It wasn't until half the movie was gone that I had realized that I was laughing very hard and had been for most of the movie. It is a rare thing for me to experience at the movie theater.Hopefully ""Hot Fuzz"" will not be subject to just the cult level of popularity as ""Shaun of the Dead"", which I'm sure it will have. This movie is better than that, if people give it the chance and see it. Far too often, movies will fall into that ""cult movie"" level that scares casual movie goers away.It takes the rare and original form of comedy that was all over ""Hot Fuzz"" to get the kind of reaction it did from me.

Is there anything excusable for my blatant disregard for human decency? I suppose I could give to charity OR adopt an orphan.

"Brilliant, hilarious","This movie is fantastic. It starts with a hilarious premise (that a London ""Supercop"" is transferred to the quiet countryside b/c he makes his colleagues look bad). Then, w/o giving away too much, it becomes unpredictable (amazingly so) and even manages some convincing action moments thatrival those from the flicks that it somehow manages both to parody and emulate at the same time. The cast is phenomenal. Even the minor players are funny and convincing. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are great. I've only seen them in ""Shaun of the Dead"" but they have pulled off incredibly different roles from one film to the next. Pegg successfully switched from the unassertive slacker who rose to the occasion in ""Shaun"" to the uptight, ultra straight-laced super cop who learns to lighten up without losing his edge in ""Hot Fuzz"". Frost's roles weren't quite as different but he transitioned well from a very likable (albeit crude) Ed in ""Shaun"" to a lovable and immature Danny in ""Hot Fuzz"" who finds a new hero and best friend in Pegg's character.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Loved Shaun and I love this one too!,"Hot Fuzz - Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's second film collaboration in which super-cop Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is reassigned (on account of making everyone else on the force look bad by comparison) to a sleepy town where the crime rate is near zero. Yet a hint of intrigue is in the air, in the guise of ex-007 Timothy Dalton (I give away nothing. The movie glaringly implies his malevolence half a dozen times.) who is finally given something of merit to do film-wise. Angel meets bumbling sidekick Danny Butterman (Nick Forst, lovable as ever), his new partner. Frost and Pegg have such wonderful chemistry and it doesn't really matter that Frost is really just rehashing his character from Shaun. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. There are numerous cameos that only the British or BBC America fans will notice, but you might recognize Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan and Steven Merchant.This movie is off the f*cking chain! It lampoons quite possibly the easiest to parody of movie genres (perhps second to slashers), yet makes you remember the films with fondness. Where other parody films would just put down the film or, more likely, mimic a scene from the film with some fart joke or cartoon violence (Date/Epic/Scary Movie hacks, I'm thinking of you). The film has numerous take-offs like a stupid strongman with near invulnerability, a la James Bond of course, and also makes reference to films like Point Break, Bad Boys and many others.Like Shaun of the Dead, A movie I love, this movie actually transcends comedy and willfully becomes a part of the genre it spoofs. I actually kinda want to go and watch Point Break now. Also like Shaun, it has incredible wit and numerous jokes that come to be prophetic and revealing about the plot. It's quite likely you'll miss a few jokes (sometimes because you laughed too hard at some part the first time, sometimes they're too subtle), making replay value of the film a bonus. The talks about one-liners are hysterical. There's also enough gun-play and explosions to satisfy any action movie junkie. And the movie has a heart to go with the laughs, due to the film's oh-so likable lead duo.A wonderful comedy/action film. I know I'll buy it on DVD and watch it many times over. A's all the way.

'Fuzzy Vice',"The very best parodies don't only mock the things they make fun of; they also embody them.Take ""Shaun of the Dead,"" the 2004 zombie movie from the team of writer-director Edgar Wright, writer-actor Simon Pegg and actor Nick Frost. It was a delicious comedy, a sharp satire of English manners, a spoof of zombie movies and a pretty brain-eater picture all in one. You couldn't help but love it.Now the trio have taken on another hoary genre -- the Hollywood cop-buddy action movie (""Bad Boys,"" the ""Lethal Weapon"" films) -- and transported it, lovingly but with wicked, piercing humor, to the English countryside. The result is ""Hot Fuzz,"" a film that's terrific fun as a comedy if not quite taut as an instance of the genre it spoofs.As in ""Shaun,"" ""Fuzz"" skewers movie clichés and lifeless verities of English life with merciless wit. Once again, the goings-on are only a slight distortion of the movie genre being sent up. And once again, the weakest portion of the film is the last, when plotting and the impulse toward a full-circle ending smother the script's vitality. It's delicious comedy overall, though, building on, if not exactly surpassing, the promise of ""Shaun."" Pegg is Sgt. Nicholas Angel, a London cop so gung-ho and effective that his superiors have to get rid of him: He simply makes everyone else look slack. Shunted off to the crime-free village of Sandford, Angel finds his resolve even more unwelcome, if that's possible. The cops are witless clowns, and they and the townsfolk care more about winning the ""village of the year"" contest than about what little harmless crimes occur. But then people start dying -- always by accident, always with plausible explanations -- and Angel just knows that something big is going on. With his only ally the particularly stupid officer Danny Butterman (Frost), he determines to ferret out the killer that he believes is afoot.It sounds like your basic A-B-C police-fish-out-of-water picture, which, of course, is part of the point. Pegg and Wright explicitly introduce standard bits of the movies they're mocking, then ingeniously undermine them with humor while leaving them standing: hard-as-nails Angel is an absurd martinet with ludicrous devotion to duty, yet he really is tough and smart and good at his job; Danny is almost too stupid to credit, but his passion for the very movies that are being parodied fuels the satire even as he never truly overcomes his ineptitude.Around his heroes, Wright has an embarrassment of swell English actors having a grand time: Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy as Angel's dismissive London bosses; Jim Broadbent as the village police chief (and Danny's father); small-town cops including the sneering detectives Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall; and a gallery of iconic village types including Timothy Dalton as the local grocery tycoon and lady-killer.As in ""Shaun,"" the final act is overstuffed with action, and while some of it amuses, you feel that the film has fallen on the wrong side of the line separating parody from its object. Moreover, it doesn't make as much of the theme, shared with ""Shaun,"" of male bonding and maturity.But it's smashing fun, nonetheless, made with razor wit and continual invention and far, far fresher than not only Hollywood buddy-cop movies but also Hollywood's own spoofs of them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Great parody of action comedies and loaded with dark humour.,"Nicolas Angel (Simon Pegg), who is outstanding police officer in London. Which Nicolas unintentionally makes others police officers looks painfully bad. His superior (Bill Nighy) sends Angel to a small, seemingly dull quiet town. But once Angel arrives, he sees otherwise and his partner is a ambitious wannabe action super-cop (Nick Frost). Both police officers are trying to uncover an bizarre conspiracy between the town's villagers are not what they seemed to be.Directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) made an entertaining dark satirical comedy with terrific moments of humour and action sequences. Director Wright is certainly paying tribute to filmmakers like Michael Bay, John Woo and especially Tony Scott in the well staged action scenes. Pegg and Frost are certainly hoots in their roles but they are surrounded by a top British supporting cast like Oscar-Winner:Jim Broadbent, Paddy Considine, Timothy Dalton, Billie Whitelaw, Edward Woodward, Paul Freeman, Staurt Wilson and more.The Three Disc Collector's Set of ""Hot Fuzz"", the DVD extras are terrific. Disc One has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5,1 Surround Sound. Disc one has five commentaries tracks from the cast & crew also including Oscar-Winner filmmaker:Quention Tarantino! Disc one also has Outtakes, Deleted Scenes and more.Disc two has an amateurish but rather amusing action spoof... directed by the young director at 18 years old titled ""Dead Right"" with two optional commentaries by the director and actors:Pegg & Frost. Disc two also includes an featurettes.Disc Three has the extended ""The Fuzzball Rally"" uncut with optional commentary by Pegg, Frost, Wright and Joe Cornish. Disc three has more DVD extras. This three disc Collector's Edition DVD is certainly one of the best produced DVD's out-there. ""Hot Fuzz"" is certainly an fun action/dark comedy that pays homage in a humorous way to memorable action American cop films. If you haven't seen ""Hot Fuzz"", don't miss it.

Action+Edgar Wright+Simon Pegg+Nick Frost=Greatest movie ever!!!!!,"I loved Shaun of the dead, and loved this movie even more. It cracked me up during the whole movie with hilarious lines and situations. Once again, Edgar Wright made a parody that was pure genius. If you have no good movies to see, you should go see this, as you will laugh until you cry, and want to see it over and over again. Even if you hated Shaun of the dead or never saw it, go see this!!!!!!!!! Edgar Wright is a great movie writer, and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as just as funny as they were in Shaun of the dead (Actually even better), and this is definitely the greatest movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Excellent comedy!,"What another great film by the British comedy duo! I laughed so hard, I had tears running down my face. What a thrill to see such great artists in such a non-blockbuster comedy! Stars from Timothy Dalton to a cameo by Peter Jackson and Cate Blanchett keep you guessing as to ""where do I know that actor from?""Constant spoof scenes and hilariously worded lines really made this movie rock. A bit violent, but if you never feel that grossed out as it never looks that real. Excellent references to such famed shows as He-Man and Bad Boys II. If you really need a laugh, you should definitely rent this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
When comedy masterminds reunite...,"Wow. Just wow. That was my reaction the first time I had finished watching ""Shaun of the Dead"", the masterpiece that had put British comedy on the map again in a large scale. Perfect casting, extremely original storytelling resulted in the making of a one-of-a-kind ""rom zom com"", as it was affectionately called by its cast and crew.When I first heard the cast and crew were going to reunite to make another film, my expectations were soring to previously unexplored heights. The thing that appeals to me most in Wright's work is that he doesn't make stale parodies, but actual homages to the genre he's focusing on at that particular time. ""Shaun"" was a great visual representation of how a five-star zombie movie scenario might take place in a London suburb, and in ""Hot Fuzz"" they try and figure out how a huge Hollywood action movie might look in the small countryside village of Stanford.The movie starts off a bit slow for the first twenty-or-so minutes, but the same could very well be said for ""Shaun"". Wright takes his time to unfold the storyline and get all pieces set up for the actual events that shake the very foundations of the rustic little village. After the first half hour, the movie starts flying past your eyes at an incredible rate. The movie is just about two hours long, but it feels like half an hour, and in my book that's a very good sign, because time always flies when you're having fun.The comic duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost once again do a great job, Bill Nighy (stepfather Philip in ""Shaun"" and of course Davy Jones in the latest installments of ""Pirates"") has a rather minor part as the Met Chief Inspector Kenneth, but pulls it off wonderfully. The characters in the movie are all very ""British"", by which I mean they are very extreme. Every character in ""Hot Fuzz"" is a stereotype of what these people look like in other movies. The pious vicar, the nervous gossip, the scary old landlady, and so on. This interesting mix of characters makes ""Hot Fuzz"" all the more fun to watch.On top of all that, the film makers don't take themselves very seriously, and have added plenty of blatant references to ""Shaun of the Dead"" and other movies they admire.I might not say this very often, but if these people are able to come up with a quality Britcom like this every three years or so, they can keep doing it as far as I'm concerned, there are plenty of different genres I'd like to see a homage of. Mafia movies perhaps? Or maybe even fantasy? 9/10 well earned, and the only reason I am not giving this a 10 is because I do not believe in perfection...",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

How do you follow up Shaun of the Dead?,"With a budget busting send up of all things action, with a positive skew to our good old boys in blue, and all the silliness of a small village Agatha Christie, Hot Fuzz is easily the most quotable, most detailed and most flat out fun of the Cornetto Trilogy. Is it my favourite? Not by a long shot, but it's hard not to admire a send up of Bad Boys 2 that also manages to be completely its own beast.
Hot Fuzz is so densely packed that it's hard not to appreciate a new gag each time; and although it doesn't quite have the timing and pacing and quality of gags and lines and character that Shaun did, its reverence of the en vogue action films of the time is enough to allow it to shine.
Also very much timeless and a product of its time. It seems Edgar Wright is a talent in this department.
The film that put Simon Pegg on the map as a real credible action/comedy/dramatic star. A film that sometimes buckles under its own bloated complex and layered plot, and its myriad of influences not least of all Wicker-Man horror, Broadchurch style provincial Brit crime mystery, Man on Fire acid action flicks and Michael Bay excess.
It's got broad, British gags, some absolutely blinding acting and line readings, perfect parody/homage, and tight jokes that make up for the fact that Wright struggles against the budget and his still-youthful directing style and forms a choppy and overlong but still robust and entirely entertaining film of silliness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Don't believe the hype,"To judge from the plethora of glowing reviews on this site, you might be lured into the idea that 'Hot Fuzz' is quite the funniest film made this decade.It's not. It's quite appalling. And very very dull and predictable. I can only surmise that all those 5 star reviews were written by friends of the production. I have just come from my local cinema where the substantial audience grew more and more restless as this tedious film wore on.The cast reads like a who's who of British acting talent. Sadly you see very little of most of them. Bill Nighy must have had no more than 6 lines to say and Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan even less.A truly bad cinematic experience.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"GREAT MOVIE!!! lives up to it's ratings, very funny and suspenseful","Action packed film filled with humor. The humor isn't dry and it is actually quite original. This movie was one of the best I watched in 2007. You will not want to stop watching (you will WANT to know what happens at the end). The acting is magnificent (the actors really hit their target when they were acting out their jokes.) the plot is suspenseful yet humorous at the same time. You will be at the edge of your seat. Fast-paced movie, but the action doesn't come in until an hour after- the first half of the movie is devoted to character development and plot build-up (climax). The movie is lengthy (2 hours). These 2 hours will be filled with adrenaline, literally. (Watch ""Shaun of the Dead"" before seeing this! It's the prequel and just as good if not better than ""Hot Fuzz""---the actors are the same, but the plot is different.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Hats off to the SOTD team!,"When I heard the SOTD team was making another movie, I was like OMG I HAVE to see it! I went out and seen it at the theatre, and I must admit, I was pretty amused. It's some pretty funny stuff. It had a solid story line, good actors and moved along quite nicely. It is basically about this awesome cop, who goes above and beyond the call of duty. He is the best of the best, and it makes his comrades, and superiors look bad. So, they bump him of the city beat, to a hick town with no action so that he can't make everyone look so bad. While in town his first night, he seems to enforce the law to the extent. He about arrests the entire town from underage drinking to looking at people the wrong way. He even arrested his partner - not knowing it was his partner until the next day. It is a pretty good flick, and my hat is off to the SOTD team, they got past the first movie, and I think we'll see more of the SOTD team's movies in the future!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
meh,"Hot Fuzz was a nice diversion, but here's the thing: it just wasn't funny. I could tell where the jokes were. I said to myself hey, that was a joke and I should have laughed. But I didn't. To be fair, there were a few mild chuckles, but no out and out belly laughs. I expected more from the creators of Shaun of the Dead. SotD was funny and sometimes subtle and clever. Hot Fuzz was neither subtle or clever. I suppose this wouldn't really matter if the movie had been funny.I think that part of the problem is that the movies Hot Fuzz makes fun of already have their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks. Bad Boys II and Point Break are already parodies to a certain extent, so what's the point of making a parody of them?",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Another well deserved hit for Pegg and Co.,I give this film a 9.5/10.From Big Train to Spaced and Sean of the Dead. Simon Pegg has done it again. After being introduced to Pegg through a friend i have become a fan. This man is a genius but the best thing about him is that he doesn't realise it.The best part about the film is the partnership with Danny. This is the source of most of the comedy.I also loved the twists in the film. I openly admit the fact i couldn't see what was coming.Another highlight of the films is the small gags. Even the gory scenes are done in such a way you can't help but laugh. Anyone who dislikes this film needs to analyse their own outlook on life.I look forward to the next Pegg film.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
A Film with Personality,"With Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright has managed to make a perfect movie. The screenplay, acting, directing and editing all work in tandem to deliver a sweet, satisfying experience that leaves one feeling exhilarated. What makes this film so good is the consistency; the beginning of the movie establishes this break-neck pace that follows the film through every scene. Even quiet scenes still have lots of energy to them, and it really gives the film a personality.The movie is essentially a parody of over-the-top action movies, and it captures all that make these films appealing, while ditching all the baggage these films carry. This film has a tongue-in-cheek quality to it, but it never treats its characters as lesser-than. The characters all take their world seriously, which makes the ridiculous plot even funnier and makes it easier for audiences to stay connected to what they're watching.Too many parodies make the mistake of being immature nonsense, making it difficult for the audience to connect at all emotionally to the film. Hot Fuzz however manages to ride the line between dumb and sincere, and so you're left not only laughing constantly at the witty dialogue and editing, but you also feel connected to the characters; a testament to the wonderful screenplay by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg.Like other fantastic movies, every scene matters and leads to the next scene. Even the dialogue is critically important; on a second watch it becomes apparent just how much reincorporation of certain elements there are. What might sound like a silly throwaway line ends up coming back later to impact the plot. The characters are also hugely memorable. There are characters who show up for 2 minutes and yet they somehow manage to make a huge impression. This is not only due to the actors being naturally good at what they're doing, but it is also proof of the stellar direction. Edgar Wright knows exactly what he is doing every frame of this film. The entire thing feels so perfectly orchestrated that by the end you can't help but smile at how everything came together.This really is a wonderful experience and it leaves you awestruck at the power film can have. The editing is so hard to describe but it adds so much to the experience and makes Edgar Wright stand out as a director. It's no wonder he has become a household name among film-fans!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Hot Fuzz raises the bar for Action/Comedy - Fantastic.,"Having loved 'Shaun of the Dead', the arrival of this film appeared as a bright light on the horizon during a time when my interest in films had reached an all time low. Having not seen any films for months the trip out to the cinema was tense with excitement - this film would either renew my enthusiasm for the film industry or cement my disinterest. Sitting as we did for Shaun of the Dead, my friend and I were not entirely sure what to expect from this film.The light dimmed, and the sirens began to howl gradually opening to a beautifully composed opening shot - only cutting to begin one of the best edited opening sequences ever presented on film. That was it - everything else going on in my life at that time vanished from my mind as I was strapped in for 2 hours of pure entertainment. The initial pace of London is broken, as our protagonist Nicholas Angel is thrown into the country. The pace is initially slow in Sandford, but the film is very kinetic - with the energy of the film building throughout until reaching a crescendo with an extended shootout in town.This film has so much going for it - superb directing, an excellent cast and well written script. Hot Fuzz is funny - I laughed (actually out loud) more times than I could count - but it also mounted the tension, and had me excitedly awaiting the action. Boy does the action deliver.Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick frost are together again - the result? One of the best films of the year.Bring the noise!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"

Gr8 Movie,Another masterpiece by Mr.Edgar Wright . The movie can not be categorized under any genre this is undoubtedly the mixture of feelings which makes you laugh hard and on the other hand scares the heck out of you meanwhile your romantic senses are tearing your heart out this movie is really something. While it takes you in very normal and calm village with normal people trying to convince the audience as if they are innocent and kind suddenly the movie changes the phase somehow that you can not believe it . I believe it is a work of art when a movie can make you laugh love and scared at the same time which is incredible. I'd really suggest this one to every one.

Fantastic.,"Many so called ""comedy"" films these days aren't funny, and are about people getting hit around the head with things etc and generally being of bad taste. I blame ""Family Guy"" for making people think this stuff is funny.I never saw Spaced or Shaun of the Dead before I saw Hot Fuzz so I didn't know what to expect. But I wasn't expecting what I got. In the store I was choosing between this and Sin City and chose Hot Fuzz simply because I hadn't seen it and if I didn't like it I could get a refund. I'm glad I did, since it takes pride and place right at the top of the list of my favourite films, and has made me a huge fan of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's work together, including Spaced and SotD. It may not be the best film ever made, but it doesn't stop it from being my favourite. It's what a I call a ""clever comedy"". I've heard some people criticising it for not being funny, but they're the kind of people who find things like Norbet or Little Man funny and wouldn't know comedy if it was shoved up their arse. Hot Fuzz is witty, hilarious and is actually a pretty impressive action film as well. I've seen some reviews complaining about the editing in the action sequences but I really don't see anything wrong with it, but I can see why it may get annoying for some people after a while.The soundtrack is filled with very entertaining music, giving me flashbacks to the 90s when bands like Supergrass were my favourites despite me being only 7 or 8, and newer bands like The Fratellis. The music always fits in with it's scene and is excellently done.I won't give the plot away because then you'll know what happens before you see it, but I will say that if you've seen a lot of action films then you'll be able to guess the baddie straight away, but if you haven't then you'll be humming and ah-hing and changing your mind about people and is quite an entertaining mystery if you're a first-time viewer.The film also has the cream of British actors in it, including Timothy Dalton who practically steals the show as supermarket manager Simon Skinner, having the lines in the film that make me laugh the most. Watch out for cameos from two Oscar winners as well.Glad to see that there are far more people who find this funny - Hot Fuzz really does deserve it's 8.1/10 and let's hope it stays in the Top 250 where it belongs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Pure unadulterated entertainment,"By the end of Hot Fuzz, me and my wife both agreed that it's a very cool movie. We could not find any other adjectives to describe it. The movie deliberately wants you to think that way. The music, the action, the fast foward scene switches all scream an element of 'cool', something that the movie absolutely nails. Pegg was absolutely made for the character, and it plays it with a sense of purpose. The story sways like a pendulum, and it keeps you glued to the screen till the very end. The subtle touches of horror coupled with comedy put the movie in a very unique space that is occupied by a select few, and we can now say that Wright is the master of this sub genre. I now need to search for more of such movies, because Hot fuzz has scrathced an itch that few other movies can fulfill.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
The second film in the Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy is action satire done right,"2004's Shaun of the Dead was a huge success upon release, critically and financially. So it seemed that another movie by the creators of Shaun of the Dead should be made. So, in 2007, the second film in the Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy was released and is called Hot Fuzz and was written and directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) and was written and stars Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead), Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead), and Jim Broadbent (Moulin Rouge). The film was a box office hit and a critical hit upon release and has been widely praised on one of the greatest comedy films of the 21st century.Nicolas Angel (Simon Pegg) is one of the best cops in London. So much so that the other cops feel that he is making everyone else look bad. So, Angel is reassigned to a rural village where life is different and people are mysteriously being killed off and it is up to Nicholas Angel to figure it out.Hot Fuzz is action satire done right. Yes, it seems cliche to say that but it is even more surprising and even more true after watching it for the first time. Edgar Wright not only does what made his previous outing, Shaun of the Dead, good, but he even improves on his work here in this film. There are plenty of nice editing tricks involving match shots which are fairly impressive to see. Not only that, where Shaun of the Dead, satirized zombie movies, this film satirizes American action films and even references them by name. The film pokes fun at the American action movies while being a love letter as well. Poking fun at the cliches while in itself taking a part in these cliches. That is what Wright knows how to do. Callbacks. Many many callbacks occur and this film makes sure there is a callback for everything that occurs and it ends up being even more funny. There are even little moments that with repeat viewings, you'll finally realize. Meaning, you won't catch all of the little details in your first viewing. A part of the comedy stems from the two main leads of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who starred along side each other in Shaun of the Dead and like that film, both Pegg and Frost have great chemistry together. Here is the thing. Pegg's character is a well trained cop who has seen it all. Frost's character is some country village cop who hasn't seen much in the countryside. Pegg is the mentor to Frost's student and seeing this relationship evolve is really interesting to watch. The story overall is a fish out of water story with Pegg's character having to adjust to the country life. The story becomes a murder mystery and climaxes to an all out action scene. Along the way there is an unexpected twist that really surprised me.Hot Fuzz, in my opinion, is better than Shaun of the Dead. Hot Fuzz sees director Edgar Wright doing what he did in Shaun of the Dead and further improving on it. It is a cleverly funny action satire and is one of the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Off the f&*@ing chain!,"After the genius work of Shaun of the Dead, I was excited to see Hot Fuzz, and took the opportunity to see this movie as soon as it came out.Luckily I was not disappointed. The movie begins with PC Nick Angel (Pegg), a high-flying, intelligent London copper who is so successful that his superiors find him an embarrassment with his successes compared to them. When he leaves, he is sent to Sandford in the middle of the West Country (and miles from anywhere else), and finds himself with the job of re-capturing escaped swans, trying to cope with his new police team who usually seem to fail to take police work as seriously as he does, and working with his new partner Danny Butterman (Frost), who assumes that police work should be shooting up bad guys and car chases.However, the bored city cop and the impressionable country bobby soon discover that their work is about to be cut out for them when several gruesome deaths begin to occur in Sandford, and that they may be linked.It was great to see some of the people from Shaun of the Dead make a comeback (Bill Nighy for example in a bit part), and the different characters of Nick Angel and Danny Butterman make up for comedy gold, so before it all finally kicks off and bullets begin flying, you will not be bored. Added to this, the characters are brilliant, and the action scenes are hilarious, with spoofs from everything: From Hollywood action like Bad Boys 1 and 2, Point Break, and Lethal Weapon (even films like Wicker Man and The Omen) to British comedy such as the Vicar of Dibley. This is pure gold which shouldn't be missed.Who says we Brits aren't good at making movies?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Better the more I see it.,"Hot Fuzz is one of those movies that really grows on you. The first time I saw it, I was a little disappointed, as I was expecting something very much like Shaun Of The Dead and instead felt that this was even more of an ""homage"" to the films it built off of rather than a comedy. And really, it is. But upon repeated viewings, you'll likely notice a lot of jokes you had never noticed before, and even more, you'll come to appreciate the brilliant pacing of the movie.It's fair to say that Hot Fuzz starts out very slow. Despite it's obvious influences - including a couple of action movies mentioned during the film - it really stands out above all that it borrows from with some surprisingly smart writing. The movie's plot (and clever twist) won't blow your mind, but it's one of the best action movie story's ever to grace the screen if only because it never insults the viewer's intelligence. Hot Fuzz succeeds just as much as a mystery and suspense film as it does as an action movie, and thus ends up - like Shaun Of The Dead - combining several great genres of film into one, though in a much less obvious (and ultimately better) manner than its predecessor.What really sets Hot Fuzz apart from the crowd is the pacing, though. It's funny to think of it, but in terms of pacing, it's can easily be compared to Kurosawa's classic The Seven Samurai. The film starts out slow, introducing the characters and including just a few brief, sporadic scenes of action. The first time you see it, it may even seem a bit boring (though, as I said, it becomes easier to watch upon repeated viewings as you begin to catch some of the better, more subtle jokes in the dialog). But it all culminates in a very long, nearly non-stop fight scene that seems simultaneously subdued and over-the-top. The entire movie strikes this sort of balance throughout, which is one of the main reasons it succeeds as being a genuinely great film. Since it also succeeds at being a genuinely entertaining movie - and since it only seems to get better the more times you watch it - I'd easily consider it one of the best movies I've ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Hot  Action Flick,"Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is the finest police officer London has to offer, with an arrest record 400% higher than any officer on the force. He's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel's superiors send him to a place where his talents won't be quite so embarrassing -- the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford.With garden fêtes and neighborhood watch meetings replacing the action of the city, Angel struggles to adapt to his situation and finds himself partnered with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), an oafish but well meaning young Constable. Just as all seems lost, a series of grisly accidents motivates Angel into action. Convinced of foul play, Angel realizes that Sandford may not be as idyllic as it seems. With his faithful partner in tow, Angel fights to prove his instincts are correct and uncover the truth about Sandford. Is Angel simply losing his mind in the safest, sweetest village in Britain? Or is something far more sinister at work? A small village is about to get some big city justice. Hot Fuzz 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
"quite enjoyable, but not as funny as i thought","First of all, i REALLY enjoyed this film, it is the first Simon Pegg outing that i have seen and i thought he was absolutely brilliant, the film was well directed and the actors all did quite a good job. However, it was not a laugh-a-minute comedy that its portrayed to be, quite the opposite actually, the humour in it is VERY subtle and this i like but for some, it might seem a little boring.The purposefully ridiculous storyline and over-the-top action and dialogue is what keeps this movie in the comedy genre and out of the crime/thriller genre. However, i think this is where the movie triumphed cause you don't see many movies quite like this one out there and the few obvious jokes in the dialogue were quite good and very British tongue-in-cheek.

Best in the Trilogy? For me it is.,"""Danny, this is murder.It's not murder, it's ketchup.""First of all, I didn't know there was a trilogy. It is after I finished watching ""Shaun of the Dead""; only then I've come to the realisation that this was just the beginning, the introductory part of Wright's ""Cornetto Trilogy"". Why such an unusual title? Well, I suppose Mr Wright has a profound admiration for Ice-creams.Petty jokes aside, Hot Fuzz is pretty incredible! To tell you the truth, I was a little dissatisfied earlier seeing Shaun of the Dead; it's in no way a bad film though, don't get the wrong impression. I did like it for what it was, It's just that, for me, the expectations were a little bit different.Not this time as I feel quite ecstatic about what I have just witnessed. To put it mildly, this second part of the so-called 'Cornetto' trilogy is simply fantastic. As compared to the previous occasion, here the comedic aspects are rather clever, and considerably better written all-around.

Damm Funny,"Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, director/writers/actor respectively, struck gold with their previous film Shaun of the Dead, for what is a cult hit. Wright and Pegg, tapping the same source of Shaun, are far from bleeding their well dry. Spinning conventions of the zombie genre. Wright and Pegg give action it's due in the small village of Sandford, where death is more prone from an over indulgence of tea and cake at the local NWA.The chemistry of Hot Fuzz lies upon Pegg and Frost. Perfectly complimenting each other, whether Pegg is stiff and robotic and Frost runs with the shenanigans, or both in action mode, there is a natural play off one another, never fighting for the punchline or spotlight. Writers Wright and Pegg, don't really reach the creative level of Shaun of the Dead, in retrospect the revelation of who's behind it all is rather esoteric, but that and plot holes are quickly filled with a 'who cares' mentality. The comedy is non stop, along with a constantly spiked energy level, with Wright showing of his flare as a talented director in one bombastic yet creative shoot out. Pegg and Wright have laced moments, heavily on Point Break and Bad Boys 2, with myriad of references to virtually every buddy cop film, cop show and other films and shows to spark the childhood memories.Maybe a western next guys",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Want to see what all the fuzz is about?,"hot fuzz is one of those films which is impossible not to enjoy, it manages to combine everything that is good about cop films (shoot outs, great partnerships and sinister villains.) adds British humour and stars and then tribute and mock them all in the name of a good night out.The plot is as follows Nicholas Angel is a good cop, so good in fact that his superiors (Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy) conspire to get him sent away. Nicholas having just come out of hospital after being stabbed by a man dressed up as Father Christmas (a blink-and-you'll miss it cameo by Peter Jackson) Nicholas is then moved to the town of Sandford he meets up with well meaning police officer Danny Butterman (Nick Frost)and the rest of his new team (including Jim Broadbent, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall.) he soon discovers a series of murders and maybe Sandford isn't all that it seems.Hot Fuzz has been described as ""Bad Boys II meets Midsommer Murders."" and that is an apt description though thankfully without the formers crassness. Director Edgar Wright infuses the camera with a lot of energy as the camera zings around the town during the action sequences and seems content to stroll around Sandford during its quieter moments.Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have infused the screenplay with a smattering of cop film references some obvious there is a running bit about Danny's love of Point Break, some not so Jim Broadbent's off hand remark about a Callahan park. there is also the teams customary wit ""Judge Judy and executioner.""as Nicholas Angel Simon pegg is better during the scenes when he's character relaxes later in the film as while he is an excellent everyman his hard-as-nails Angel still has shades of Shaun poking through, though maybe that makes it easier for us to support Angel as he is shown to be a nice guy as well as a good cop. Nick Frost is still hilarious as Danny who while he may be an adult he seems much like a teenager who idolises Angel. Jim Broadbent one of Britains foremost character actors shows just how capable a comedian he is. Timoth Dalton is a revelation as Simon Skinner this has to be the most inspired piece of casting of the year he perfectly captures the moustache twirling gusto needed for his part. people often forget how hard it is to go-over-the-top and still be entertaining and malevolent Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall are also especially memorable among a supporting cast of British comedians.and now I'm going to answer the question everyones been asking ""is it as good as Shaun of The Dead"" my answer is no. and you know what I don't care. when the end of the year comes and I look back I'll be surprised if I see anything more entertaining, the only thing that looks like it can rival this is Spider-man 3. and lets face it the web-slinger has got competition from Sandfords finest.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
It's for the greater good.,"Every time I watch Edgar Wright's satirical masterpiece - which I've seen many, many times to the point where I can almost quote it verbatim and I'm still not tired of it, I find some clever little detail that I previously missed and the feature has me laughing not only at the jokes that always work but also at the ones I didn't even notice before. That's just how meticulously thought-out and devilishly well-made 'Hot Fuzz (2010)' really is, working on multiple levels each as successfully as the last, and it's also the thing that most closely ties the 'Cornetto trilogy' together. The flick is simultaneously a hilarious comedy, a successful spoof, an exciting action-thriller, a believable buddy-cop 'bromance', a fish-out-of-water tale and a dark detective drama. Every frame of film and every word of the screenplay feels like they've been wholly controlled by masters of the craft to create the ultimate viewing experience of this kind and one of the best films ever made. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Overrated in my opinion but still pretty entertaining and funny,"Rated R for violent content including some graphic images, and language.I missed Shawn of the dead which seemed to be a big hit.I saw this film about a month ago after hearing great things about it.I found it a bit overrated.It was pretty funny at parts but it wasn't uproarious like people are saying.It was entertaining and a fun spoof of cop/buddy movies but it doesn't deserve to be in IMDb's Top 250 or anything like that.The film is about a tough cop who must move to a small town in england where the cops aren't as good.He cleans up crime on the streets but there are a series of bizarre murders that are going on.Its up to him and his partner who is a big fan of cop films to solve the case.The ending is pretty surprising and I will not spoil it here.If you like British comedies or cop films, you should check out Hot Fuzz but I found it to be a bit overrated.Still entertaining though.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Jealous colleagues conspire to get a top London cop transferred to a small town and paired with a witless new partner.,"Doesn't sound like a very good movie does it? I promise you that if you see this movie you will laugh.What might seem like a clichéd, stupid-joke-filled movie really isn't. Why? Because the movie's objective isn't a laugh a minute throwing up because you can't take it any more and this allows the director, writer and actors set up a solid background that actually make you like/hate the characters so when something happens to them further in the movie you actually care.Don't get me wrong. This movie is very, very funny. And I firmly believe that the majority of this humor comes for the superb acting of nearly everyone involved especially the leads, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. Without this timing the often silly and out there behavior and context of the movie would not have worked. But luckily it did and my $5 was worth it.With great acting and great satire this movie only has one flaw at the end they drag it out too long and they didn't seize the opportunity to characterize the sometimes underused Edgar Wright. But in all reality that is inconsequential to enjoyment of this film.For more thoughts on this go to http://movies78.blogspot.com/2007/04/hot-fuzz-anti-stupid-comedy.html",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
Who knew this would be so funny?,"After seeing the hilarious ""Shaun of the Dead"", I began to wonder if there would be any movies like it. Then I saw the trailers for Edgar Wright's next big comedy, Hot Fuzz. I had pretty low expectations, I thought there was no way he could compare this movie to Shaun of the Dead. Boy was I ever wrong. This movie was HILARIOUS! It was sort of like Shaun of the Dead, but in a different genre. And it worked very well. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost impressed me once again with this movie, Edgar Wright really wasn't trying to cash in on the success of Shaun of the Dead either. I think those are some of the reasons this movie was so special. That and the storyline: totally original in a parody-style. It was great. The characters were very good also, very clueless and stupidly funny. If you're looking for a good action comedy, Hot Fuzz is what you want to get. 10/10. Hopefully Edgar Wright's next movie doesn't disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Mystery"
