Roller-coaster of emotions,"Like Altman's classic Short Cuts, and Anderson's Magnolia, Crash, by writer/director Paul Haggis weaves a tale of multiple characters through the web of streets we have come to know as Los Angeles. Unlike those other two films this one has a very specific theme to explore. From the opening line uttered by Don Cheadle we know this is to be a film about how people relate, and from the interchange that follows between Jennifer Esposito and Alexis Rhee (pretty sure she plays the Korean female driver who rear-ended her) how people relate tends to be ruled by first impressions or prejudice.Race is paramount in this film, and all our preconceptions of who people are get twisted and turned through the intricate plot. With each new additional character we find another assumption, another stereotype, and then watch as that preconception is obliterated as the character develops. It is a credit to the deftly written script, tight direction and exceptional acting talent that every one of these many characters is fully realized on screen without ever feeling one-dimensional.I would love to discuss some of the details of what happens to explain how well it is done, but part of the magic of this film is allowing yourself to be taken on this ride. Mind you, this isn't a ride of pleasure. The first half of this film is unrelentingly in its ferociousness. I could literally feel my rage at some of the characters forming to a fever pitch. The fear and hatred I was confronting wasn't just on the screen, but in the pit of my stomach. And in one absolutely brilliant moment I was literally sobbing at the expectation of horror unfolding, only to be cathartically released in a most unexpected way.Mr. Haggis was in attendance at the screening I saw and explained that the idea for this film came to him one night sometime after 9/11 at about 2a.m. when his own memories of a car- jacking experience from 10 years before wouldn't leave him alone. Clearly this film was his way of relieving those demons of memory, using the catharsis of his art to unleash them and in doing so has given to all viewers of cinema an opportunity to examine our own preconceptions about race relations and how we treat each other and think of ourselves. He mentioned in the discussion after-wards that he likes to make films that force people to confront difficult issues. Films that ask people to think after the film has ended and not just leave saying: ""that was a nice film"".This isn't a ""nice"" film, and I would expect that it will provoke many a discussion in the ensuing weeks when it opens nation-wide. It's a discussion long overdue for this country, and it took a Canadian to bring the issue to the fore in this brilliant, thought provoking film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bold and Compelling Treatise on Racism in Modern Society,"Take the pop-cultured infused socio-political discourse of a Spike Lee movie, the glossy grit of a Michael Mann LA crime story, and the compelling mosaic story-telling technique of a Paul Thomas Anderson film, and you'll get the ""feel"" for Paul Haggis' stunning directorial debut. To boil a film like ""Crash"" down to such terms, however, would do it severe injustice. Powerful and thought provoking, this is the most accomplished and compelling film since ""21 Grams"" premiered back at the end of 2003.""Crash"" brilliantly shows through intertwining vignettes, that are often blazingly funny in their brutal honesty and fascinatingly gut-wrenching in their melodrama, how subtle racism (often guised in nervous humor) and overt prejudice (often exasperated by sudden irrational violence and an overabundance of readily available firearms) completely permeate our culture and everyday interactions within society. A hyper intelligent script showcases not characters, but brilliant representations of real people, people we know and pass in the street every day, people not unlike us. People who at first seem to be lost causes in the war against racism (witnessed in Matt Dillon's harried beat cop and Sandra Bulluck's spoiled District Attorney's wife) can often become the most unlikely solutions to the problem, while people who ride in on their high horse (witnessed in Ryan Phillipe's noble young police officer) can turn against the tide in the blink of an eye. No one is immune to it no matter how hard they try to rise above it (witnessed in Don Cheadle's quietly tragic detective).In the end, everyone is flawed, the racism is inescapable, and the audience feels a twinge of sympathy for just about everyone. Perhaps that is what Haggis is hinting at to be our answer. Showing empathy and being able to relate even on the most remote level to every human being out there is the first step to that true brotherhood of man. Because the film offers no real solution, the discussion and discourse it creates in the minds of the viewers is the first step in solving society's ills. We can't tackle everything at once, but we can open a dialogue, and hopefully, one person conversing with another will be the first step to our salvation. It takes a bold film to raise such questions, and an even greater one to compel an audience to talk about the potential answers, and that is exactly what ""Crash"" accomplishes.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"a realistic, gritty, no-nonsense look at the way life is for so many....","After seeing this movie, I was able to really understand what ""Six Degrees of Separation"" means. There is a thread that weaves its way through the landscape of life connecting, influencing, and defining all. This movie is certainly thought-provoking, one cannot watch it without feeling either privileged to have become part of the fabric, or like a fly on the wall - seeing, yet unable to influence or guide. There is almost a sense of frustration at ones inability to be no more than an observer in this movie since it compels you to want to shout in warning, gasp in shock, cry in sorrow, and hold in comfort. ""Crash"" is definitely not a movie to use as a venue to escape life for a couple of hours, but it is a movie that certainly makes you take a second and third look at who you are within yourself. The actors are surprising not only for their depth of performance, but also because they do not play characters you think you know. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes drama, action, comedic relief, or just an appreciation for a well-thought out movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Review: Ensemble cast delivers top-notch performances in reflective drama,"In a drama strikingly reminiscent in style and tone of P.T. Anderson's film Magnolia (1999), the narrative in Crash shifts between 5 or 6 different groups of seemingly unconnected characters, whose relationships to each other are only revealed in the end.Not to be confused with the David Cronenberg feature of the same name, this Crash is the feature-length, studio-released directorial debut of veteran Canadian TV writer/producer/director and two-time Emmy-winner Paul Haggis. An in-depth exploration on the themes of racism and prejudice, cause and effect, chance and coincidence, and tragedy, ""crash"" is a metaphor for the collisions between strangers in the course of day-to-day existence. Set over a 24-hour period in contemporary L.A., it is a social commentary on the interconnectedness of life in the big city.Crash features a top-notch ensemble cast which includes: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Loretta Devine, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe and Larenz Tate. All put in superb performances in a tight script which is at once gritty, heartwarming, shocking, tragic and witty, and which will ring true with viewers of all demographics.Centering around two disturbing car accidents, a carjacking, vicious workplace vandalism, and the suspicious shooting death of one police officer by another, the drama is set against the backdrop of a racist LAPD and Los Angeles justice system. Action shifts between the various characters, whose lives collide with each other in unpredictable ways as each faces their own moral dilemma, and tries to cope with the consequences of their resulting decision made or action taken. Each of the dozen or so main characters undergoes some type of a personal metamorphosis as the various story lines head toward a striking, common conclusion, which succeeds at being both cathartic and unsettling.Crash is backed by a solid and varied, original soundtrack and excellent cinematography. Sweeping, wider shots alternate with disjointed camera angles which convey the chaos and confusion of the characters and the unpredictability of life. Occasional lingering close-ups -- on occasion without sound -- capture the actors' facial expressions, which suitably detail key moments of the characters' aching pain, fear, anger, bitter anguish, remorse or grief, far better than any dialogue could.This breathtaking film is destined to be a critical smash and box-office hit. Five stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Volatile Redemption,"""Crash"" is a complex movie with a simple premise: set in Los Angeles it follows 8 main characters (and many, many more supporting) from all walks of life and races whose lives intersect at some point during one 24 hour period. These people are all different yet all alienated, to the point of breaking, so much so that when they come together, things explode.The complexity of the film comes from the encounters between characters and their tangled lives and worlds. Haggis' screenplay is so intricate and delicately written I couldn't begin to try to summarize the actual plot line (which destines this article to be kind of vague), but everyone meets everyone else at some point in the film (and there are a whole lot of characters). Sufficed to say these meetings are variably intense, casual, fleeting, dangerous, but they all effect the participants in profound and provocative ways, causing lives to find enlightenment or swerve violently, and watching it all unfold is mesmerizing because Paul Haggis (Oscar Nominated writer of Million Dollar Baby) made the film meaty with messy characters and topics and stories to chew and hurtle along with.The all-encompassing theme of the film is racism, and it is dealt with bluntly, honestly, and without reservation. Every single character participates in the perpetuation of the ugly cycle but also suffers because of it. Where racism makes for an interesting enough subject for an already provoking and fairly experimental film (I was surprised to see this get wide release), it's only the catalyst for a deeper, resounding story of redemption and the universality of our lonely situation which the movie becomes during its second hour (what you could call Act II). It switches from a somewhat depressing contemplative amalgamation of moments about racism in everyday life and how destructive it is, to a throbbing, intense web of choices and consequences -- life and death, vivifying or soul killing -- and the chance at redemption.Following their actions in Act I, everyone meets a fork in the road or is given a second chance of some sort. Some take it, some don't, but regardless, by the end of the movie everyone has changed. This is what gives the movie wings during its second hour, makes it interesting, keeps you guessing and on knife's-edge. It also gives the characters depth and souls and shows that despite perceived and upheld differences, when it comes down to it we aren't different (which we see in a shattering scene between Ryan Philippe and Larenz Tate after Tate notices that he and Philippe have the same St. Christopher statue), in fact we desperately need each other. It's one of the few films I've seen where everyone is at fault somehow and yet there are no villains. It makes it hopeful, particularly with something as ugly as racism: everyone's fallible, but everyone has the capacity for good and nobility. That said, each of these character's inner struggles makes for all the conflict and resolution you need.A talented ensemble drives the film, sharing almost equal amounts of screen time, but the folks who really stood out and had my full attention each time were Terrence Howard (plays a TV director), Matt Dillon (as a patrol cop), Sandra Bullock (a rich housewife), , Don Cheadle (a detective), and Michael Peña (a locksmith). These five gave deeply, deeply felt performances portraying a wide range of emotions and personal situations, giving souls -- alone, yearning, and searching in a world that doesn't seem to care -- to shells of imperfect people. But the actors triumph in little moments of human contact: a glance, an embrace, a pause, a smile, a wince, things that breath the film to life and with simple visuals give it profundity. This is beautifully illustrated in a small scene between the downward spiraling Jean (Sandra Bullock) and her maid after she's begun to realize all her problems may not be about the two black guys who car jacked her, but her own life.Some closing notes: it's obvious it's a debut. At times the dialogue and acting can be stilted and unnatural; some of the initial ""racial"" situations seem forced; certain scenes could have used some editing or fine tuning, but by the end I didn't care. It also may be helpful to know that the first hour spends its time setting everything up for Act II, although it will seem more like a photo essay on racism than a setup. But by the time Act I ends you're ready for something substantial to happen, and at the perfect moment, stuff happens. I was entirely satisfied with this movie, I couldn't have asked for anything more. Still it's impressive, with his debut Haggis made a film that magically maintains a storytelling balancing act about people's lives that almost seamlessly flows, takes an honest look at racism with an understanding of mankind, a belief in redemption, and even hope. As I walked out of the theater into the rainy night it resonated with me and colored my thoughts as I made my way through the crowds of unknown fellow people filling the cinema. That's about all I can ask for in a film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The #2 Feel Bad Movie of the 2000s,"""Crash"" is a superbly made film. The actors are first rate, the camera style is engaging, and production value is tops. And despite all this, I would never recommend it to anyone. Why? I'll explain in my 4th paragraph but first let's talk about the story.This film follows the lives of a dozen or so people over the course of 2 days all living in Los Angeles. The opening scene gives us the aftermath of some ambiguous tragedy (the titular ""crash""), and the next scene flashes back to ""yesterday"" and shows us the events in these people's seemingly unrelated lives, leading up to that opening moment. If you've seen ""House of Sand and Fog"" (the #1 Feel Bad Movie of the 2000s), you'll recognize an identical sort of chronology and foreboding tone--so similar that I wonder if the Crash filmmakers were somehow involved in House as well. Both films are very powerful and effective at what they aim to do, and that is, simply put, to disturb us.Disturb us it does. Within the first 15 minutes, we see things that are so disturbing to the pit of our souls that I almost shut the movie off twice. Racism, hate, justified racism, justified hate, brutal stereotypes. The film masterfully shows us not only the worst quality of humankind but it scrutinizes the reasons why humans are this way. There's no good guy/bad guy; it's all bad guys. The first 15 mins is designed to make us hate almost every character, if not every race. By showing the atrocity that each race supposedly inflicts on the other, it paints us a Hatfield-McCoy cycle of hatred that has no known origin. It just exists and burns hotter. Non-whites are subverted by white society, so they exact revenge by committing crimes against white people which in turn causes the white police to hate and abuse non-white people who in turn become criminals against white people. The cycle of hate is not only explained but validated in a well-crafted, brutally told, highly disturbing way.Which leads me to the 4th paragraph where I explain why I would never recommend this film. It's because IT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL BAD. For nearly 2 hours you get the same feeling you get when you watch too much cable news. And just as psychologists warn that watching too much news leads to depression, I would say the same can be said of films like this which, like the news, expose and scrutinize the absolute worst of humanity.But then one might say that films like this are necessary to inspire change. Normally I would agree, and I'm sure that that's the intent of the filmmakers here. But let me ask you: who needs to change? Answer: racists and bigots. But are racists and bigots really going to be watching ""Crash"", stroking their beards and saying ""Golly, I need to stop being a racist""? Probably not. And that is the film's undoing. By taking a heavy, ponderous, complex look at racism and hate, it alienates the fury-driven haters who most need to grasp this message. And instead ""Crash"" merely preaches to the choir, making the choir feel gawd awful lousy about the state of the world.The film attempts to lead us to redemption, and there is at least 1 truly powerful scene of triumph that's worth the price of admission. However, other subplot resolutions seem a bit contrived, if not completely unnecessary, such as one character's climactic tragedy & epiphany which was so random I literally burst out laughing (the moral of the story being: don't wear socks indoors!). Ultimately ""Crash"" tries to tie things up neatly with a positive message, but it's precisely this neat tie-up, simultaneously with every sub-plot, that feels a bit contrived and ultimately unbelievable. At the risk of cutting out half the award-winning cast, perhaps the film should have focused on just 1 story & resolution, rather than pulling the ""Fantasy Island"" formula of having half a dozen stories wrap up neatly in the last 10 minutes.Ultimately, despite its excellent presentation and first class acting, ""Crash"" couldn't sell me on its optimistic spin and instead left me feeling pretty horrible about the reality of living in a world where racists don't often have magical transformations. If you understand what I'm saying, you might want to skip this flick because, regardless of how it ends, the subject will just make you feel bad.",,Anonymous,Crime
There is Good and Bad in All of Us,"There is good and bad in all of us. This movie explores this like no other. It will make you think about the nature of bigotry and stereotypes. The characters switch from heavy to hero in a way that is deeply moving and exhilarating. It is TV drama style writing where several different groups of characters and plots interweave (Paul Haggis) but with none of the limits of TV, it reminded me of ""Hill Street Blues"" which from me is a big compliment. I am a Don Cheadle fan and he captures the role. Sandra Bullock plays against character and pulls it off with ease. The most impressive performance to me was Ryan Phillippe's. Almost every nationality in LA was represented and they all were interesting and realistic. The ensemble cast and various plots blend together and keep your interest.

Shockingly Overrated,"I can't believe all the reviews I'm reading. And not just on IMDb but in the printed press too.

Yet, if that was all that mattered, Phantom Menace would be an Oscar winner.It seemed to me that there were very few original ideas in the script. The racial plot lines were done better in ""Grand Canyon"", ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""Boyz n the Hood"".If you haven't seen any of the above movies, perhaps ""Crash"" will open up your eyes to the depths of the racial divide in this country.

Lives in change,"The film does not allow any character to fall into a stereotype despite the initial appearances. Everyone is redeeming, in a greater or lessor degree, in their own world, despite their frailties and prejudices. The writing is crisp and no easy turns are taken. The film has unexpected twists but none of them are contrived. Each character is developed just enough for us to develop our opinions of them and then things change. Those of us familiar with LA will recognize the icons of the city and the mix of cultures. Each character has enough prejudice or hate in his/her repertoire of life to demonstrate we had better not be too quick to judge without exploring what might in us be similar to the characters' flaws.

"here's your yearly dose of tripe, lap it up","This movie is bad on so many levels, it's hard to know where to begin and could never all be covered in one review. Never mind the fact that only an amateur audience mistakes forced melodrama and abundant clichés for award winning acting, writing, or directing for now.This movie proposes that everyone acts and reacts to everyone according to race. It pushes and stomps the idea that white people are always rich, racist, and afraid of other races. And a few non-whites aren't always perfect. If there was such a thing as politically correct police in the world, this would be the movie people would be forced to watch in prison.Movies that do peoples thinking for them sure get old. And this kind of movie doesn't unite anyone. It sparks issues that people who know how to speak for themselves and have their own brain, have already gotten past.Whatever tired p.c. ideological point this garbage tries to make, it's been done to death.

a breathtaking film,"Although the isolation and interconnectedness of automobiles and traffic are (forgive me) one of the driving metaphors of Paul Haggis's film Crash, the experience of the film's characters is more like a roller-coaster, where random strangers are thrown together through twisters and turns of a journey out of there control. A harrowing travail for them, but an impressive thrill for the audience. Equally impressive, perhaps, is the way the large cast quickly and completely inhabit their roles. This film isn't perfect.

"L.A., A Caldron Ready to Blow","""Crash"" is certainly the best recent American movie that I have seen for many years. The contemporary story of intolerance, racism, fear and redemption for some characters is disclosed along two days of this important American city through the lives of different ethnical and economical groups, which interacts with the others. The most important, the interface between their lives happens most of the times in an unexpected way.When I see in IMDb that Paul Haggis wrote also ""Million Dollar Baby"", I include him as one of the best contemporary American writers. In my point of view, it is very difficult to successfully develop several characters along 113 minutes running time through several stories and in a very sensitive way as he did. I felt touched by the story of the Iraquian immigrant that buys a gun to protect his shop and the Latin locksmith that tells a fairytale to his daughter. I confess that I cried when the girl used her invisible mantle to protect her father, and that I jumped over the couch when I saw that the guy actually shot blankets instead of bullets. I can not judge the life of people that lives in Los Angeles, and I do not know whether this movie represents a sample of American society, but honestly it seems to be scary for minorities to live in USA in the present days of intolerance. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Crash  No Limite"" (""Crash  In the Limit"")",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
What Foreigners Think Happens in Los Angeles but Doesn't,"The performances are really strong especially in the face of dialog that has to remind the actors of Days of Our Lives more than any day in their real lives.Every single person in every scene is a racist and/or a bad guy. Los Angeles is a very racially tolerant place (if you don't think so, I invite you to travel anywhere else and see how much you know about racial tolerance). You would be considered a nut case for making comments in public the way many of the characters do. Some people may make comments in private to friends, but the friends would consider them outside the mainstream for many of the remarks made in this film. Another example is with LAPD, where officers are thought of as under-supervised and half crooked. But even LAPD is portrayed in an unbelievable way. Leave aside that LAPD wouldn't patrol with 2 guys if they were in the area shown in the movie, it would be one, and they would not be both white if it were two. More to the point, if an LAPD officer were going to grope a girl he had just stopped, it would be anyone but the character in question. Officers would be, if anything, afraid of touching a black female if she were a member of the media especially. A mere accusation from such a person would trigger 3 investigations: internal LAPD, FBI for civil rights violations, and the news media. LAPD officers who have been arrested in the past show a pattern of abuse of power, but it's against gang members and drug dealers who have no interest in calling the police to report that their illegally obtained cash has been stolen along with the drugs they've been selling. If the filmmakers had thought to use that, it would have been more interesting and damning of LAPD than anything they presented. The movie is just asinine and anyone who takes it seriously is being taken for a ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"If you're big on superhero movies, good for you, but try this","A truly remarkable film. Inspiring in a very dark brilliant way. Don't believe anyone who says this film is about ""racial tension"". The ethnicities of the characters are a background and somewhat a catalyst for events, but this is a film about humans. Hypocrisy. Selfishness. Opportunism. Randomness. Subtlety. Forced compromise. Foolhardiness due to anger. And it's about hope and the goodness in people when the occasion arises. The little girl with her cloak of invincibility. Sandra Bullock hugging her housekeeper with a certain realization. Don Cheadle allowing his mother to believe something that's untrue. The examples of people trying and failing are paramount, so it's genuinely heartwarming when they succeed. There are no false notes in this film, only the occasional coincidence that doesn't detract.

Clashing Crash In Devil's City,"Lives, ordinary lives, vital part of a city where, I'm sure, the devil has him home. Contradictory, awful, enlightened, confused. There are so many good moments in ""Crash"" that I felt the need to see it again less than 24 hours later. Matt Dillon lead us through his own contradiction with the humanity of someone who knows he carries something rotten inside. The explosive dissatisfaction that permeates Sandra Bullock's life is ferociously real and the frustration of Thandie Newton's character is a first on the screen. We've never seen it quite like that and her performance will stay with me. Larenz Tate personifies both sides of the equation, the one who understands but goes against his instincts, and still there are chilling flashes of innocence in his eyes -- his performance reminded me of the wonderful ""Seeds Of Tragedy"" were his innocence was intact.

Superficial,"Crash is in essence a glossed up remake of Grand Canyon. The premise is the same: a racially diverse group of people in Los Angeles who live separate lives are thrown together by coincidence. But for these coincidences, their lives would never intersect. Every interaction in Crash is racial in a way that hits the audience over the head with the movie's theme. Racism in Crash is a matter of not being treated with sensitivity. People are meant to endure the ""tryanny"" of being insulted. The people in Crash, like Grand Canyon, live lives of unremitting grimness that seems gratuitous. The movie suggests that if only people would be more racially sensitive, life would not be so grim. The oppression of having to actual endure racial insensitivity is unintentionally juxtaposed with lives that don't seem that bad. I definitely got the impression that the film writer (who can stand in for most of the Hollywood establishment) projects his own personal racial isolation on the world at large. This accounts for the film's superficial take on the subject. People who actually interact with people from other racial and socio-economic backgrounds know that life is not so gratuitously race-obsessed. The Magnolia-like editing of the film means that the characterizations in the film are not nuanced. We see only a sliver of their lives. The one exception is Dillon's character, but none of the other actors did anything remarkable. The film does have some decent plot twists. The film is well done, but is style over substance. A decent film, but not an Oscar-worthy one.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
spoon-fed drama,"Crash is not nearly as good as everyone has hyped it up to be and here's why: The film is filled with drama and it's mostly forced. What I mean is, the film abandons logic so we conveniently find characters facing the most dramatic, heart-wrenching scenarios imaginable. Of course, this ignites emotion out of the audience, but the drama is spoon-fed and the reason is because it doesn't hold true to story and, in some cases, character. In simpler terms, once you discover the film's dramatic pattern, the characters and story mostly feel fake. And consequently, you may realize that what you're watching isn't a true and real story, but an obvious attempt by the filmmakers to bury the audience in drama so they have no choice but to shed a tear. In addition, most of the movie feels like a music video. These filmmakers feel like the only way they can successfully weave together this large cast of characters without confusing the audience is by adding music to most of the film. Camera movements, acting and editing are all dictated by the music. That's when you know you're watching a music video. Plus, the music is not very good. The soundtrack makes you want lay inside an empty bathtub and down a bottle of aspirin tablets. All in all, the movie is full of silly coincidences that audiences mistake for good screen writing. It's a film that banks on America's vulnerability to films on racism. However, with all that said, I don't want to come across as Mr. Negativity. Here are some good qualities about the film that get lost in its desperate attempts to spoon-feed its audience: Performances by Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, and Terence Howard; their characters were the best written of all in the film and, despite having their characters flung into unrealistic situations, they managed to turn in believable performances. Also, keep an eye out for the relationship between Bullock's character and her housekeeper. This portion of the film tends to be overlooked because it's the least tear- jerking, but it may be the best presented. And, despite the films flaws, it attempts an important and somewhat original message. That's more than I can say for most modern-day Hollywood films.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Powerful,"Wow, what else can be said. This movie is sheer power not only in language but visuals. Picture life and the world we live in, most people live their lives through their own lives. Thinking their story is the movie being played out. But in fact this movies breaks down that barrier and shoots the the story from so many angles and fills in the wholes with imagery. In a perfect world I am sure we would not look at each other with different views and opinions, but we do not live in a perfect world.The cuts of racism run deep in our culture and our lives that we automatically assume. The movie was a movie where people are shown the lives of so many people and their views and practically overnight it is radically changed.""You think you know who you are. You have no idea."" This is the perfect tagline in the movie, and the perfect phrase coming from Matt Dillon.When we are first introduced to these people we can only see first impressions. But, who they think they are is not truly who they are. This movie speaks wonderful messages and it was shot beautifully.Paul Haggis did a wonderful job. The cast was also wonderful, and believable in being real people. I say this because people like Don Cheadle take the role and give it to the audience in a way that they would understand it. They would accept and see the social implications it brings within their own life.The transitions in the movie from beginning to the end gave the movie itself a real credible front. The art of storytelling went beyond telling a story but delved deep into the audiences soul prodding forth some sort of emotional understand of the deep message.Evil is not always evil, and good and not always good. sometimes it is hard to tell which is which. Or even prove that either really exist.I hope everyone takes the time to watch this movie but take it for what it truly is.

Different lives intertwine in this brilliantly thought-provoking film.,"We are shown many different characters in LA and never seem to focus on one, but rather the whole film focuses on the diverse cast. What first seems to be a film about racial prejudice and discrimination further develops into how people can change, and that sometimes the people who overtly show discrimination might not be as dangerous as those who keep silent.There is a great cast in this who did an incredible job. But because there are so many main characters, we don't really get so in depth into their characters, that I honestly don't even know their character's names. However, we see enough of them to get a basic snapshot of their character and this is enough to gain our sympathy when something happens to them.There was this tone that was consistent throughout this film which was established right from the start. This tone had me expecting a really surprising ending or something of that sort and though I did get surprised, I think I was more confused. And though I got what this film was about after thinking about it for awhile, it just feels like it fell short of what it had me expecting.Or maybe it's because that there are a few characters who I don't know what happens to. The characters are split into two groups, those who redeem themselves and those who cross over and does something we wouldn't suspect of them. We are shown a few examples of both but there are some characters who don't really fit into either categories so it has me wondering what their role in the film was. I understand that this film thrives on the different lives intertwining but I feel that a few less characters would have made it much better.The song ""In the Deep"" by Bird York (Kathleen York), that is played near the end of the film is a kind of epilogue which fits the story perfectly. This film was really well written, acted and edited.My final thought is that I don't know if this film is just so brilliant that my brain can't register or whether I'm so confused as to what I just watched. So I'll take it as a confusingly brilliant film. OK wait, I've got the word for this now. It's a heavy drama. There we go. I think I've got a headache from thinking about this too much.Read more movie reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Absolutely brilliant,"Why can't all films have the integrity,intelligence,innovation and inventiveness of this future classic.If you have read the previous comments ,you know the plot.The underlying racial mistrust is evident throughout with one's own prejudices coming to the surface after a multitude of scenarios all interlinking with ease.Great dialogue with clever scene switching calls for a pacey, breathless and disturbing journey into several characters frightened existences.

Such A Fine Line Between Oscar and Lifetime Channel Movie...,"While this film was well done, I am stunned at both the average voter rating on IMDb and it earning the Best Film for 2005. This is a 'tidy' account of racial conditions in the USA, but no more cutting edge than the content found in any 'All In The Family' sitcom from the 70s. There is little character development, with each being one-dimensional regarding their personal discriminations. If this film is supposed to deliver a message, it was lost in my viewing. It appeared that every character's racial subjectivity was influenced and primarily based on the most recent event with that race. In my opinion, racial conditions have improved and evolved in our country further than this film suggests. Personal discriminations in the film are not subtle and are stereotypical to a fault. It was void of subtleties and wit that truly represent an individual's approach and reaction in real life. Comparing this to the other nominees this year, I wonder what criteria the voters based their vote upon to select Crash as the winner. This would be a 'surf-through' movie if you passed over it on the Lifetime Channel (only A-list cameo appearances save it from this deserved placement). This is a 'one-watch' movie and will likely date itself quickly. I am sure the idea for the film came out of a graduate student's thesis and would work well in stage form with an ethnic cross-section of serious undergraduate drama majors.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Poorly constructed morality tale,"The film tells several extraordinary stories happening over the scope of a few days and connects them using implausible coincidences. This makes it difficult to suspend disbelief during the entire film. All the stories share the same motif: There is good and bad in all of us, and racism has complex causes. There is little variation and little originality in the presentation of this theme.I think the makers of the film were aware of this, and tried to make the film more interesting by arranging it chronologically in such a way that the process of the different pieces of the puzzle coming together is meant to be interesting. Both the film title and the introductory dialogue allude to this, but to me it seemed like a poor excuse not to tell rich, conclusive and well-developed stories.I do appreciate movies that do not follow a simplistic good/evil pattern; I would have liked to see a more developed and refined story of Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his interaction with Shaniqua and his father, for example. But there are too many plot lines to make any single one stand out, and as a consequence, the characters seem artificial rather than realistic. (As a European, I cannot judge whether the individual subcultures portrayed at all resemble reality.) The movie is not ""trash"" as some reviewers have called it, but it is forgettable and certainly not deserving of an Academy Award. As opposed to ""Brokeback Mountain"", I doubt anyone will talk much about ""Crash"" in 20 years.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Look at me, you embarrass me, you embarrass yourself""","This is among my favorite movies ever. I have seen it 3 times in a time period of 2 months so far.There is no ""single"" plot to Crash. It has 7 main plots. Many of them are very emotional and powerful. A locksmith and his daughter, 2 detectives, a couple who got carjacked, 2 criminals who are the carjackers, A persian store owner who got robbed and blames it on the locksmith, A cop and his ""partner"" who pull over a man and his wife for sexual acts, and a screen director and his wife who get pulled over by the cop. All of these people, lives, they intertwine at some point in the movie. And it is truly genius.The acting is perfection from nearly every actor except Jennifer Esposito, whom I have never been a huge fan of. I find that she lacks the emotion. But the other actors make up for it.As for the cinematography, the visuals (graphics, effects) are perfect, nothing wrong with it, the audio (the sound, the quality of the sound and the soundtracks) is all great as well. I do not have any criticism for it.It is a very entertaining movie that may be confusing at first. But it is entertaining as hell, and it does not get old. It is more emotional and sad and dark, but it is very good to watch.The emotional impact is a 100% from me. It makes you think a lot, and it successfully makes you feel bad for something you probably did not even do. And it does it very well. It is powerful, and very very emotional.And it is also highly realistic, actually, among the most realistic films I have seen to date. There is nothing I can think of that is unrealistic about this film.The character development is crazy. Every character has a purpose and is very useful to the film. And the evolution is done so very well.And finally the ending, and the ending is impeccable. Every story comes to a conclusion at the end. Some are good conclusions, and some are bad. And the good conclusions make you feel great. And the bad conclusions are simply destructing in a good way. There is even a plot twist that was far from expected.In conclusion:

A near miss,"Haggis' directorial debut is a powerful and thought provoking look at a slice of LA life. In some ways, with its multi strands, it reminded me of some of Altman's ""Nashville"". The film successfully pulls all the strands together to make some pertinent points about different races fearing and misunderstanding each other without resorting to platitude too much.On the flip side I found it schematic, too reliant on coincidence and frequently implausible (it would seem that there are only 5 cops including Officers Dillon and Phillipe in the whole of LAPD). At some points the film begins to bow under the weight of its own ambition - I would usually say that is a good thing, but here I felt that less incident would have given the characters more space to breath and come alive for the viewer. At times I felt that the characters moved from interesting 3D portrayals to screenwriters mouthpiece and this distanced me from an otherwise powerful film We need intelligent and provocative cinema and, in many ways, Crash delivers but I still think that it has been overrated by an audience desperate for something more than the usual popcorn fare",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"THE DEFINITIVE CINEMATIC WORK ON TENSIONS + ISSUES WITHIN THE ""MELTING POT"" THAT IS THE USA!","A LOT going on in this 2006 CLASSIC!!!...But FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title's Content and Context:After seeing CRASH for the first time, in September, 2005, I said to myself... ""WOW!... Why haven't I found out about this movie before?"" (Well, maybe it's because it was released in the U. S. just a week before going to Colombia on vacation, on May 14, 2005.)This is the kind of film that you often dream about seeing, but are really lucky if just one of its caliber is released in a year! Scenes from the Movie seem to have kept swirling around in my brain for weeks! HERE, I'm going to explain exactly WHY:CRASH impacts not so much for its action as, perhaps, its title might imply, nor fantastic scenes utilizing dazzling ""CGI"" effects, but by the undeniable quality and human warmth of the story it tells.Time and again, CRASH shows us people, whom, at first, seem so easy to decipher, so black and white, and then, in a matter of seconds, disorients us with a chilling dose of unadulterated, hard reality: People are not at all one-dimensional, like in the comics. We are flesh and blood, replete with clandestine simmering passions, occult emotional scars, irrational internal conflict, and oftentimes victims of relentless, implacable, merciless fate!In stark contrast to its title, CRASH impacts for the subtlety that it displays from beginning to end. Boasting a truly majestic cast, CRASH is directed, orchestrated and integrated with inspiration by Paul Haggis, who also demonstrates here his creative genius in the capacity of writer, producer and composer. There is absolutely none of the ""formula"", which so infects almost all Hollywood films, in this independent Lions Gate Films production.CRASH takes place in my hometown of Los Angeles, which serves, in this case, as a microcosm representative of the entire United States. (Which is really not all that far removed from reality.) That there have been films in the past that have focused on racism or racial prejudice is undeniable. The vast majority of these pontificate on racism as the worst of evils, in a repetitive manner, without any real in-depth perspective. In addition, they almost always focus on one particular ethnic group. (Prejudice against Blacks, Jews, Mexicans, etc.) More often than not, in these films the oppressed are all saints and the oppressors are all demons! There is a certain disconnect with reality.In contrast, there is multiracial interaction in CRASH. Whites with blacks, blacks with Asians, Orientals with Latinos, Asians with whites, Arabs with whites, blacks with Latinos, etc.In its notes about the production, IMDb lists a figure of just 6.5 million as the total cost of production. Absolutely amazing, considering that within the cast there are several actors who probably typically charge 5 to 10 million to perform in just one movie! Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality), Don Cheadle (Ocean 's Twelve, Hotel Rwanda), Matt Dillon (Something About Mary), Brendan Fraser (The Mummy, George of the Jungle) and Ryan Philippe (Cruel Intentions), all in roles that are in stark contrast to the type of role that made them famous, and each portrays a resonating, multi-faceted character who is very credible. CRASH makes it easy to identify with many of its characters, regardless of race, ethnicity or country of origin.There are no sex scenes or graphic violence in CRASH, but as there are many issues that are aimed at adults, consequently, it doesn't seem that CRASH would be of much interest to those under 12 years of age. Of over 90 000 movies on IMDb, CRASH is ranked at Number 423 and rated a 7.9!....

Potpourri For Prejudice,"""Crash"" was one big citadel for disseminated catastrophe! The film, ""Crash"" habitually purported the unnecessarily ruthless aspects to the questions of: ""What about this?"" ""What about that?"" Fatal consequences are incurred just because people find everything around them to be just a little too irksome to stomach! The premise being; ""Make it easier on me, let me hate my neighbor!!"" The penchant for belligerence is very widespread in this movie. The characters in ""Crash"" possess a callousness which is assertively second nature to them. Their attitudes manifest themselves by perpetually saying: ""I'm always angry, why? No real reason!"" The film's racial unrest was so ubiquitous that some seemingly normal individuals would ask this question with a very cavalier disposition: ""Is he black, or is he white? Yeah! It definitely matters!!"" The scenario is situated accordingly whereby all parties concerned perceive money to be everything, and a lack of money to be the only thing!! Such a collage of pejorative proclivities has manufactured a myriad of emotional hang ups with this film. So why did this flick win for best picture? My guess; Because of the film's originality. ""Crash"" was a movie which was comprised of these ingredients: A dash of violence, a pinch of sexually depraved behavior, a bevy of great actors and actresses, (Including Sandra Bullock and Matt Dillon) and finally, it was topped off with wonderful directing. Galvanize all of these attributes, and it is not surprising that ""Crash"" was selected to be recipient of the proverbial and extremely coveted Academy Award Oscar for best film, above all other flicks that were competing for this honor in '2005! I personally liked ""Good Night and Good Luck"" better! This film was a runner up academy award nominee which was produced during the same year as ""Crash"" was! While ""Good Night and Good Luck"" was an intensely intellectual film, ""Crash"" however, was a much more elaborate production. The movie, ""Crash"", became the precarious purveyor of non justifiably violent responses which served as a subterfuge for camouflaging grotesque human indulgences. Mannerisms of this nature correlated to the wry vindication of everybody's personal misunderstandings! ""Crash"" can best be categorized as a sagacity for sinners. This film was a creative doggerel that became a reflection of the dark and psychologically unnerving criminal antics which concurrently prevailed! This plethora of felonious atrocities victimized everyone in the film in one way or another! These nefarious escapades eventually snowballed into an onslaught of cumbersome afflictions that wound up burdening the value system by which many typical Americans live! The film ""Crash"" is a demented depiction of how the truth is offensive because the truth is also stubborn, hence, it is simply the truth! Basically being a cunningly creative homogenization for hatred, it stands to reason that ""Crash"" should have won the academy award!! Indeed, ""Crash"" deservedly won for best picture! Okay!! So, what's the bottom line here? We have acquired a painstaking realization of just how deplorable our fixations on discriminating judgment really are!! Are we going to do anything about it? NO!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
An intense cinematographic experience,"With all these comments, both negative and positive, about Crash, I had to participate and present my point of view. Not that do people from the US care about a Mexican's opinion, and I'm really from Mexico, not from Puerto Rico nor any other Latin American country.I almost missed the incredible experience of seeing it on theater. Wow! It's been one of the best cinematographic experiences I've had. And yes, it has its flaws, but I think we all go to the movies to enjoy the experience, not to criticize every scene, every technical detail.For those who say the film is predictable, well, you were not involved in the movie, then. And it must be boring for you to go to the movies and know what's going next. I pity you.For those who say all characters are stereotyped, well, think about this. We see stereotypes in people we don't know. Yeah, we have friends who are black, Latin, Asian, or other race, and we know they are not like they are shown in the film. But what about the people we don't know? we refuse to have contact with them, due to the stereotypes we have. Think really about it. That's what the movie is about, how we treat the people we don't know, how we reject them without really knowing them, avoiding contact, and this because of our prejudices.Too many coincidences? well, it's a movie, it's a fable. it had to be like that. And you're not paying attention to the people around you, but it happens in big cities. People are not that distant from each other.The music, the editing, the acting, and the writing were simply superb. I really can't understand why some people don't appreciate all of that.I loved this film! and it really hurts to see how some people treats it like trash... as they surely treat people they don't know similarly.Crash.... a truly deserving Oscar winner.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A masterpiece by Haggis,"I am surprised at the negative review on the opening page. This is a masterpiece by Haggis and worth many repeated views. He does a classic job behind the camera and weaves a gripping tale of inter connected stories. The fact that an action which might seem of little consequence can go on to be pivotal for somebody else is the underlying current of this film.It's not about racial discrimination as some reviews might suggest, though that is a sub plot.You shouldn't look for a hidden social message in this film. But if you are looking for an entertaining story that grips and touches you deeply, this is highly recommended. Very seldom one comes across a movie that's edge of the seat stuff without being an action thriller. This movie certainly is.It's brilliantly directed and makes you feel the emotions each character is going through beautifully. You feel for the characters and empathise with them. The twists, turns and surprises are very, very well done. If you happen to read this review, just go for it. And ignore the opening review, it's not accurate.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Well-intentioned, often gripping, but  too facile to be honest","As has been stated, there have been many incendiary films made about race and prejudice in America, notably Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing."" There have also been numerous acclaimed pictures about the urban African-American experience made by filmmakers such as John Singleton (""Boyz in the Hood"") and the Hughes Brothers (""Menace II Society""). There have also been numerous films made with large ensemble stories and multiple intersecting characters, especially in the films of Altman (""Nashville"" ""Short Cuts"") and P.T. Anderson (""Magnolia""). And thus, pureeing all of the aforementioned together with some heavy white liberal guilt, you get ""Crash."" ""Crash"" has some outstanding acting and a clever structure, but it's also too tidy and too easy--the stereotypes presented on screen are too often just that: stereotypes. Moreover, the film reduces almost every character to their worst instincts and racist impulses (even when doing so defies rationality), and the film thus sacrifices logic and depth for scenes of emotional confrontation, hysteria, and shrillness. (The film's prejudices, interestingly, revolve almost exclusively around race, and never touch on religion or sexuality.) Worth seeing for some knockout work from Cheadle, Dillon, Newton, Howard, and others, but it's a darn shame that Spike Lee's oeuvre doesn't get the respect it deserves (nor, for that matter, did Altman's--at least not from the Oscars) while those who should know better slobbered over this picture. (Several of my white liberal friends loved it and spoke of it as being ""SO important""; notably, several of my African-American friends hated it.) The highly mixed reviews worldwide that greeted this film when it came out are always going to follow it around like a stain, reminding folks that its bewildering current lionization (and the vitriol often simultaneously directed at ""Brokeback Mountain"") reveal more about prejudice than anything in ""Crash"" truly does. I'd be very interested, in a mirror of the Oscars, how many people really vote FOR ""Crash"" as opposed to voting AGAINST ""Brokeback.""",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
overrated piece of trash,"I do not want to do an in-depth analysis of this film. Rather, I'll point out what I consider makes it a very poor effort: the script. The same guy who did the script for CRASH also did the script for MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Both won the Oscar for best picture. I must be pretty out of touch to criticize this guy, but here goes. The main problem is that every character is ""invented"". That is, each character is so obviously the product of a fertile (and I am using that word kindly) imagination. In CRASH the politician and his wife are absolute stereotypes. They speak the most inane lines, like from a comic book or low-grade soap opera. The two cops are similarly contrived. One is a good guy and one is a bad guy. One is an idealist. One is a cynical veteran. I imagine such categories of cops do exist, but to give them life it takes someone who knows the genres, like Joseph Wambaugh. (In fact, to see how really bad CRASH is, just compare it to THE ONION FIELD). We also have the two foul-mouthed gang-banging black youth, hell bent on insanity. Big deal. Anyone can produce such characters. There is the misunderstood, good-guy Mexican plumber, who just happens to love his young daughter oh so much. Etc. Etc. Each character has the depth of a comic-book creation. They all speak in litanies of clichés. The plot too is just a clever manage of intersections. It is so obviously the product of the next cup of coffee or cigarette. It is cleverness without depth or substance. Christ, that this film won best picture just begs belief.While I am getting in my two cents here, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is the same cliché-riddled mess. It is obvious that the guy who wrote knew nothing about boxing. The characters are pathetic, lifeless creations.What has Hollywood come to that such movies walk away with top prize?",,Anonymous,Crime
The most powerful movie of 2005,"Paul Haggis' story of human destinies and cultures colliding in the present-day L.A. is without a doubt the best American drama this year. The way Haggis deals with the most flammable issue, racism, is to be highly respected. Haggis is able to show us that no person is entirely evil, but not completely good, either. The characters develop vastly throughout the movie, and we find out that none of them are really happy with their lives. What makes this movie so great is the intense screenplay. I had to watch this film twice to understand all the small things that eventually make a big difference. Truth be told, Crash would breath much more freely being 15-30 minutes longer, now the audience has too much to deal with in such a small period of time. Should Paul Haggis not receive the Oscar for best screenplay in next February's Academy Awards, I will be completely confused.Ten out of ten.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One to make you think,"Crash is a powerful movie about the perception of minorities in modern society, a riff on racism that challenges stereotypes and the way in which we, as human beings, are prone to make assumptions based on the appearance of an individual, often playing off of pre-conceived idea's that have been embedded into us from an early age.Opening with a car crash, we then backtrack to yesterday, as an ensemble cast's lives intertwine in the diverse density of the L.A. metropolis. But, unlike Magnolia, Crash is less interested in the ways in which fate and chance dictate everyday events, and more with how bigotry and racial tension exists in every corner of this multi-cultural melting pot. Where Crash is most successful is in how it challenges certain racial stereotypes and how it subsequently portrays the effects racism has on everyone's lives. It's not just a simple case of white vs. black. It goes much deeper, as we realise that intolerance is widespread and isn't confined to the white middle classes, that it exists between all colours, all races, all cultures. The finger of blame is easiest to point at somebody who doesn't look like you, who doesn't have your upbringing. Because of this, they must be in the wrong, right? Matt Dillon's veteran cop has this outlook. His father lost everything because of minority rules and he holds a deep grudge against all blacks, regardless of age, sex or profession. Yet this bigotry is awkwardly juxtaposed between his genuine care for his sick father and his honour and duty as an officer of the law, something he later demonstrates during a life or death situation. Director and writer Paul Haggis twists the stereotypical views further with the characters of Terrence Howard, a young, black film-maker and Michael Pena, who gives an outstanding & extremely subtle performance as Daniel, a young Hispanic locksmith with a wife and young daughter, with whom he shares one of the films most touching moments. In fact all of the cast do a fine job with their roles, even Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, in an attempt to branch out, providing some of the funnier moments of the movie with his musings on black oppression. And lets not forget Don Cheadle, as a cop who finds his integrity challenged after investigating a messy bout of cop on cop action.Ultimately though, the thing that will stay with you the longest is the simple message that shines throughout the film. ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Every character displays the devil inside of them but it's only one part, there is good in everyone, it just needs an outlet, an opportunity to break through. As the film reaches its climax we are forced to consider how we look at people in everyday life. How we label and pigeonhole certain cultures, certain races, into one group, with no distinction between the good and the bad. In an increasingly paranoid world, where we are being schooled in how to be suspicious of unfamiliar practices and alien customs, Crash serves as a hard reminder that while we must be careful in our own daily lives, we must be equally cautious not to discriminate and adversely affect the lives of many hard working, decent citizens just because of the actions of a few.If there are any gripes with the film (and these will be minor) it's that what your watching is a collection of vignettes, snippets of these characters lives beamed direct to your brain for your benefit, and not a cohesive story that links seamlessly between strands, in the vein of the excellent Magnolia. At the end of the film characters have reached resolutions, but these aren't earth shattering, life changing epiphanies, rather smaller, more personal realisations that will, you assume, change their way of future thinking. Like much of the movie, it uses a lo-fi approach to the drama, making the final payoff that much more powerful and ultimately, delivering the emotional kick necessary to immerse the audience within this world.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Emotional, moving, insightful and beautiful","What Paul Haggis has achieved with Crash is nothing short of remarkable. The brilliant script and expert direction ties together dozens of seemingly separate characters as they live 36 hours of their lives. One character might happen to be the nurse for another set of characters, and whilst nothing comes of their interaction, it shows us how easily we can be touched by the lives of strangers.Each character, despite having to share Crash's short run time quite sparsely, is deep, well- developed and the viewers never lose sight of their motivations. Racism is shown not to be a purely vile trait, but motivated by ignorance and our interactions with others. A Persian family are called Arabs, Koreans are called Chinese. African-American Graham Waters tells his mother he's in bed with a white woman, who is in reality Latino. Not only does Crash strip back the violence and hate, but also the small misunderstandings that we have in our own lives.There are some poor lines that ignorant viewers might think of as Haggis' poor attempt at demonstrating negative behaviour. However, a deeper understanding will show why the characters are acting in this way. William Fichtner's Flanagan swears off black people for failing to be an upstanding members of the community who he could set up as a hero. His line ""f*cking black people"" may shock audience members, but a deeper understanding will prove otherwise.The acting is very good, especially by some standout performances from Sandra Bullock as a fearfully racist housewife whose xenophobia is reinforced when she is carjacked in her first scene; Terrence Howard as a successful TV director who is forced to direct his black lead into a more stereotypical fashion and gets sick of being pushed around and Thandie Newton in an Oscar-worthy performance as Howard's wife, a black woman mistaken for white and then intimidated by the police for talking back. Michael Pena steals the film in one of the most heartbreaking and emotional scenes I have ever seen.Paul Haggis' direction is superb, his screenplay is sublime and the editing is so superb that eight interwoven story lines fits into a 2 hour film seamlessly and without leaving any character underdeveloped.For opponents of Crash, try to put the controversy of the 2005 Oscars out of your head and watch it with an open mind.

Crash seems to make its own accident,"Maybe I'm just naive and I was impressed that this movie had such A-list talent. I thought the script was too contrived and having grown up in San Francisco and being Chinese-American, I would like to think I am ""color blind"" to such issues. Sure I've had my own feelings of stereotyping other races but not to the extent that these characters did in this movie. I think Los Angeles is an area of 10-15 million and how could this movie so easily intertwine the 10 or so characters in this movie? Hollywood!!! Entertaining, but too much of a morality play. Perhaps a movie of this kind is best shown to an audience in some Podunk town in Alabama where they still think Whites and Blacks should live in separate environments. I for one just thought it was WAAAAAY over the top. Still, I was impressed by the acting. The script just tries too hard to be something of an ABC after-school special.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An overdone, melodramatic, emotionally manipulative piece of ""issue"" film-making, clearly not the Best Picture of 2006","""Crash"" is a perfect example of a preachy, polemical ""issue"" film that takes itself far too seriously. Its almost absurdly overdone message, that racism is bad, that it affects us all regardless of our ethnic background or position in society, but that we all have a chance at redemption by just...trying a little harder...to understand one another...and just get along...; is so extraordinarily simplistic, and yet throughout the piece so force-fed to the audience in great fits and gasps, that at times it makes the intelligent or thoughtful viewer cringe. I was amazed that Crash was even in the Best Picture lineup, along with ""Munich"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"", both of which are far subtler, darker, more genuine pieces of film-making that seemed neither preachy nor polemical. And though it had a clear message of the importance of journalistic integrity and press freedom, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" was a brilliant work of political noir which achieved contemporary relevance without trying to in any way, given its unerring focus on the events of the McCarthy era; again, its bravado and punchiness made it a far more powerful, engaging and meaningful film than ""Crash"". I have not yet seen ""Capote"" but by all accounts it is a masterful work; I find it hard to believe that in light of the accolades it has received, ""Capote"" could be outdone by ""Crash"".I was even more amazed that ""Crash"" actually won Best Picture in the face of its opposition. Clearly inferior to at least three of the four films it was competing with, I'm just bemused as to why Academy Members chose this movie for the coveted Best Film award. The fact that it was set in Los Angeles, as some commentators have suggested in the last few hours since the ceremony? The fact that it deals with racism, albeit in a remarkably heavy-handed and sometimes clumsy fashion? The fact that it deals with an issue, though perhaps not as contentious an issue as the decades-long repression of gay rights? I think the choice of ""Crash"" should be instructive as to the sorts of films that aspiring Oscar-seekers should try to make in future: ""issue"" films that bludgeon their message home, and more importantly that address the ""issue"" in a manner which, ultimately, most people couldn't help but agree with (after all, who could possibly legitimately challenge the proposition that ""racism is bad""?); that don't really challenge an audience, but instead simply bathes them in ideology - albeit ideology barely concealed behind a thin veil of coincidences, crossed paths and ""learning to be a better person from the misery of the world"" character arcs.""Brokeback Mountain"" was not an issue film. It was an understated love story that asked a lot of its audience without really asking anything at all. It did not cram the issue of gay rights down the viewer's throat (no pun intended), but instead focused on humanizing the characters to such a profound extent that their plight became real, and the ""issue"" arose of the audience's choosing, not the film-maker's. In dealing with themes of repression and desire that are universal, it struck much more of a chord, certainly with me and with everyone else I know, than the reliant-on-coincidence, parable/fable atmosphere created by ""Crash"", which at times seemed fake, contrived and almost ridiculous.I have given Crash 7/10 for its performances, which were excellent in the main (Terence Howard and Ryan Phillipe in particular stand out in my mind), and for its technical achievements, which were impressive. The cinematography was quite beautiful in places, with LA afforded a haunting feel, coupled with a score which, though melodramatic and emotionally manipulative, set the film's tone and gave it a sense of wider meaning. But again, ""Crash"" was outshone even as a technical achievement by the gritty urgency of ""Good Night and Good Luck"" or the sweeping, heartfelt and achingly empty landscapes captured so well in ""Brokeback Mountain"". Even ""Munich"", with its grim depictions of Black-September-era violence, to my mind eclipsed ""Crash"" as a technical piece, refusing to shirk from the heavy, mind-dulling impact of its grisly imagery and perfectly capturing the atmosphere of Europe and the Middle East in the 1970's. In the face of such competition, ""Crash"" pales into the background.To my mind, subtlety, complexity, and allowing an audience to make difficult decisions for themselves are far more powerful mechanisms for both story-telling and argumentative reasoning than establishing a theme or an idea, and literally ravaging your listener/viewer with it. Though in its convoluted story and interconnected, disaffected characters ""Crash"" gives the appearance of employing the former, in reality it employs the latter, berating the audience with its notions of race, mutual respect and tolerance in a quite extraordinary fashion - though these are noble themes, propagandizing them belittles their value to an audience and greatly diminishes the impact of these grand ideals. For these reasons, the decision to name ""Crash"" the ""Best Picture"" of 2006 must, in my opinion, be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism, which must thereby raise difficult questions about what exactly the Oscars are for in this modern age - are they genuine artistic endorsements, or are they merely marketing tools or vehicles for endorsing simplistic, uncontroversial idealism that gives Academy Members a warm, fuzzy feeling without really challenging the established norms of a society? I support the Academy and the Oscars as an institution, but my overall faith in their ability to make good decisions dwindles in the face of such a film taking the most important accolade any film can obtain in the industry, particularly in light of its impressive, and underrated, competition.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Forgot About this One,"Watched this film for the 2nd time. 1st time was shortly after it was released in 2006, so a long time. Not sure if the actors read these reviews but I wanted to say I have been a fan of Matt Dillon since he was in My Bodyguard and Little Darlings, but my favorite film of his is Beautiful Girls. Kind of pains me now after all of these years that Matt hasn't received his due with an Oscar nod. He was stellar in Crash. Crash was a tour deforce of so many fine actors, Don Cheadle stood out, and Ludacras in an early role, who has found his way in the Fast series. This film is an emotional ride and it was a few stories all in one film with some of the best acting in a long while.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crash - review,"The movie ""Crash"" deals with the topic racism and stereotypes and how it is handled in the society. It is about many different people with different origins and opinions who come together at one point. At the beginning the movie is splitted up into many different stories that get connected in the end.All the stories take place in Los Angeles, but have nothing to do with each other at the beginning.I am most impressed by the way how the different stories are told and how the stereotypes are represented. The story is very well thought out but it is a bit confusing while watching it the first time.Overall ""Crash""is very interesting and fun to watch and I would definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Wonderful ride,"I missed Crash in the theatre. It came and went too quickly, and I only saw it once it came to DVD. And after I did, I watched it four times in two days. This is movie that exemplifies the best in story telling, movie making and acting.I admit I didn't have a strong feeling about the movie. I just rented because I hadn't seen it yet. And five minutes in, I was ready to stereotype this as just another cliché liberal sermon on racism. That quickly changed about 6 minutes in. I misjudged the movie, just as the characters in it misjudge each other. This is a masterpiece.Rarely can a movie make you laugh, cry, feel outraged and embarrassed all at the same time. But this one does.The overall movie making here is wonderful in every way. But I was blown away by the level of acting here. Every character, even in the smallest bit part, is someone I felt I completely understood. Ryan Phillippe (Officer Hanson), Sandra Bullock (Jean), Don Cheadle (Graham), Shaun Toub (the Iranian store owner) and Terrence Howard (Cameron) each take us through their private journey with honesty and force. Chris ""Ludicris"" Bridges (Anthony) delivers an excellent performance in his first film, and I expect to see big things from him.Like its title suggests, this a movie where in modern LA people don't merely intersect, but 'crash' into one another -- sometimes out of serendipity, sometimes tragically. Don Cheadle, in my opinion, is the anchor of the movie. The torture of his character is painful to watch and his simple, understated deliverance is powerful.The two scenes involving both Matt Dillon (Ryan) and Thandie Newton (Christine) are so intense you are afraid to watch and afraid to look away at the same time.While so much has been made of the racial implications of this movie, for me, the heart of the movie comes from the interaction between Michael Pena (Daniel) and his daughter Ashlyn Sanchez (Lara, played wonderfully by the young Sanchez), and by Bahar Soomekh (Dorri, whose beautiful eyes fill the scene with emotion and tenderness) and her interaction with her parents. These three characters represent the only true goodness and purity in the movie. All other characters are flawed and 'crashing' tragically into one another, but these three represent what we all want in ourselves.Director Paul Haggis has created a masterpiece here. Every scene, every line, every lighting shot, is one that can be analyzed and studied for years to come. When create a work that complete, it eclipses by far, in my opinion, his overly rewarded work on ""Million Dollar Baby"". This is a movie people will remember for decades.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Message Mangles the Means,"The message at the heart of Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" is admirable and true: as human beings, we are all afflicted with racial biases and a tendency to stereotype those who are different from us, consciously or unconsciously, and this demeans and distorts a great many of our relationships. Thus, we are always ennobled by overcoming our prejudices. I whole-heartedly agree with this message and I believe it is worthy of respect. Unfortunately, in art, no matter how good a message is, it doesn't justify mangling the means used to express it.The means of a story are character and plot. Strong characters can sometimes save a weak plot, and a compelling plot can sometimes support weak characters, but no story can succeed when both of these elements are dysfunctional. In ""Crash,"" the characters are little more than collections of cultural attitudes: more character types than real human beings. They interact in a highly contrived plot made up of preposterously unlikely coincidences. These coincidences converge in various dramatic scenes which are well performed by excellent actors, and occasionally they even have some good dialogue to work with. But since the characters aren't fully developed, and many of the situations are so pat and improbable, there is no verisimilitude in many of the critical scenes, and thus, no sympathy for the characters, and so, no real drama.""Crash"" has good intentions. In this case, they paved the road to, if not mediocrity, then a more fashionable suburb close by.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good Picture? Yes. Best Picture? No way.,"I like this movie. It gives the viewer something to think about. It has a few outstanding performances (Matt Dillon, Ludicrous) and some weak performances (Ryan Phillipe). All that aside, this movie never departs from feeling didactic and --well--like you are being subjected to a moral tale.Other movies have done this: If These Walls Could Talk, American History X, those safe driving videos I watched in drivers education years ago. It's not wrong for movies to solicit a morality. It's just difficult to escape that and find an artistic harbor, too. (I feel that American History X did a much better job getting cinema legs under it then Crash did, for that matter.)Overall, this movie was good but never reached the free-wheeling levels of cinema brilliance that movies like Brokeback and Capote did this year. The ""Academy"" giving the nod to this movie is laughable and misguided. The academy's vote makes it painfully obvious that 3000 of the 4000 Academy members live in Los Angeles and don't think for themselves.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Revenge and redemption along our collective racial divide...,"Various denizens of Los Angeles cross paths in ironic, cathartic and, as they say, life-changing and life-affirming ways. ""Crash"", the Academy's choice for Best Picture of its year, is unabashedly melodramatic; hence, it hits a preachy speedbump now and then. Still, its themes of personal self-loathing, lack of self-worth, impatience and rage come across succinctly, both verbally and emotionally. It's a carefully planned (one may say shrewdly planned) portrait of apathy in our present-day society, though director Paul Haggis ensures intense and sobering moments. The film begins at an almost elemental level, yet it eventually raises the bar for social issue dramas, and the ensemble cast is very fine. Sandra Bullock stands out as a wealthy white woman distrustful of anyone who doesn't look like her and Matt Dillon is solid as a deeply troubled cop (both are redeemed by circumstance). Other Oscar wins included Bobby Moresco and Paul Haggis for their screenplay, from an original treatment by Haggis, and for Best Editing. Dillon was nominated as Best Supporting Actor, Haggis for his direction, and Kathleen York and Michael Becker for their song ""In the Deep"". *** from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tough Racial and Psychodrama Picture,"It had all the modern premier film touches: great shooting, good acting, but a flawed, cheesy script and theme with that annoying ethereal emo music. I was not impressed with the same old racial stereotypes, but they did change them up a bit. Even the black punks in the beginning, who babble on about imaginary racial conspiracies while proving the black negative stereotype correct, felt flat. For instance, the bigoted gun store owner, not a far out stereotype from my experience, would probably put business ahead of bigotry and not tick off his Iranian customers. Though to it's credit it showed everyone being racist to everyone else. There was even a subplot where two undercover cops crash into each other then shoot it out, a dead black the surviving white. The LAPD wants to hang the white survivor out as a scapegoat to the black power mob while the black investigator assigned to the case has serious doubts.One of the saddest scenes was when the black investigator's junkie mother was ranting about how ""his people"" killed her other criminal carjacking son. Well, technically it was true. But if anyone led to her dead criminal son turning out how he did, it was his worthless junkie mom. In a sad way that is so real, the people who do the most complaining cause the most damage.Basically, this was a B level melodrama that would have been dynamite in the 60's but in the 2000's, it sounds worn out, exploitative and tinny. But it did try to tackle a serious issue and is probably one of the best of its type. I went back to this because of all the racial tensions created by the media and the black power race baiting mob in these days. The latest racial nonsense like the Oscars are too white really grind my gears, not to mention such rubbish as making a total punk lowlife like Michael Brown into an innocent victim, replete with lies about how he was holding his hands up when he was shot. Compared to all the garbage like I mentioned, this movie was almost documentary and objective. AND IT WON THE Oscars, yet the race baiters like Jada Pinkett seem to forget that. As well as having some good twists.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Melodramatic nonsense,"I have a serious issue with how most ensemble films come together. Most of them take an ensemble approach to go in a variety of different directions that never really connect in anything more than the most basic of mechanical manners, making the films feel like they go off in random directions without any real central point (this is the James Gunn approach). That's not what Paul Haggis does in Crash, his Best Picture winning film. Everything is interconnected with the same central ideas of racism, communication, and redemption. However, Haggis leans heavily into the melodrama of everything which, combined with the sheer number of characters going on, makes the final hour or so just outright ridiculous.It's the story of a roughly twenty-four hour period that primarily views Los Angeles (not America, the milieu is far too specific to LA) through the lens of race, beginning with a car crash involving a black man, Graham (Don Cheadle), a Hispanic woman, Ria (Jennifer Esposito), and a Korean woman, Kim (Alexis Rhee) where racial epithets fly free and clear between Ria and Kim. This should be enough, but Haggis puts an aimless little soliloquy into Graham's mouth about how we crash into each other for contact in our enclosed little lives, and it's just this obvious bit of explanation, right at the beginning of the film, that the obvious main inspiration for the film, Robert Altman's Short Cuts, eluded because it was more confident in trying to convey through dramatics.This sort of thing really does rely entirely on the strength of the characters, and there are simply too many, especially when Haggis is trying to paint a complex portrait of human experience filtered through race as he's doing here. I genuinely do appreciate the effort at a complex portrait (I thought it was working for a while, perhaps the first half of the film), but it's when he starts having the actual and eponymous crashes occur that the thinness of character betrays the film's overall point. Where the film works best is when it actually gives us time with a character to get to know them beyond caricature. The worst of these is probably the Los Angeles DA played by Brendan Fraser and his wife played by Sandra Bullock, especially her. She has a grand five minutes of screentime, but she goes through this grand change to realize that she's always mad, but it somehow relates to her gripping her purse when passing two black men on the street, and ends up manifesting that her maid is her best friend? It's simply too much in too little time to actually make an effect.The film's strongest point is probably Michael Pena's character of Daniel, a locksmith who crashes into Farhad (Shaun Toub), a Persian shop owner who starts the film by buying a guy because of a break-in. Farhad isn't a great character himself (he's fine but doesn't really rise above caricature), but Daniel has this very nice moment with his daughter where he gives her an invisible cloak that has protected him from the violence of the world around them. It's a quiet moment of gentle humanity that is probably the best thing in the whole film. And then Daniel has the worst moment in the film as Haggis goes fully ridiculous melodrama when Farhad tracks him down because he blames Daniel for a second break-in. I mean, this is the stuff of parody, especially in terms of its execution.One of the most tortured pieces of narrative is around a pair of cops, Matt Dillon's John and Ryan Phillipe's Tom. John is a racist who has a father with a chronic disease that leads John to having to call the representative at his HMO who is a black woman, Shaniqua (Loretta Devine). He also stops a car with Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton) where he molests Christine during a pat down and gets Cameron to act subservient to him while he does it. He then has some great redemption when he rescues Christine the next day (how many people live in LA and how big is it?, this is Home Alone 2 levels of ridiculous coincidence) despite having...not grown? I dunno. It's too short. Tom, on the other hand, also, independently, runs into Cameron (seriously?) and talks him down from having a suicide by cop because...Cameron is having trouble with his black identity as a studio executive?And then there's the two black men who scared Sandra Bullock, Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate). Anthony rambles constantly about the state of the black man in Los Angeles, pining for the days of the intellectual black activist from the 60s, while justifying stealing from white people all while Peter hangs on and just kind of laughs through the whole thing. I suspect that this was Haggis' effort at pointing the finger at some element of the black community for contributing to the overall racial strife, but it's such a messy portrait at the same time. Throw in the fact that there's an accidental hit and run involving a Korean man, Choi Chin (Greg Joung Paik), who ends up married to Kim from the beginning and was...transporting Chinese slaves in his van? This is a mess.So, I appreciate some of what Haggis is doing. He's doing a lot, and the embrace of complexity around human interactions works decently well for about the first half, and then the melodrama kicks in, revealing all of the major flaws with the thin portraits who are working through what's going on. The majorly heightened events are so far above the angry phone calls of the baker in Short Cuts (which is also about an hour longer), revealing that Haggis's efforts trended much more towards the thinly melodramatic rather than the meatily humanistic. It makes me glad that Clint Eastwood denied him a second draft on Million Dollar Baby.This isn't The English Patient bad, but it's not really good either. It feels like the serious version of Love Actually that Inarritu would manage much better the following year with Babel.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Crash is head on to greatness!,"Director Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" is a big cinematic hit! It is no accident that moviegoers and critics alike are voicing their positive opinions of ""Crash"". The film centers on several subplots of Los Angeleans during a 48-hour time span. The story lines eventually merge and collide with issues of jealousy, morality, benevolence, conflict, libel, corruption, and on the forefront: race. The characters that drive ""Crash"" include: a district attorney & his domineering wife, a noble police officer & his Latin hottie partner/lover, a racist cop & his ethical rookie partner, a Puerto Rican locksmith & his devoted family, a successful African-American television director & his outspoken wife, a Hindu shop owner & his concerned family, and a couple of garrulous thugs. The performances by the actors which portray the aforementioned multicultural characters were bravura. This stellar ""crash unit"" includes Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe, Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, Terrence Dashon Howard, Brandon Fraser, and Jennifer Esposito. Dillon, Howard, and Newton should crash their way to supporting acting Oscar nominations. In fact, The Oscar red carpet should already be designed with a welcome ""Matt"" for Dillon. It is the best performance of his restless and underrated acting career. Writer-Director Paul Haggis, who also scribed ""Million Dollar Baby"", developed a powerful cerebral film in ""Crash"".

A poor shell of successful predecessors,"At the time of this writing, this film ranks #92 on IMDb's top 250. The only explanation for this is that most of those voters haven't seen Amores Perros, Thirteen Conversations about One Thing, Magnolia, or several other intersecting-lives movies.The intersecting-lives template was already played out by the time this movie came along. Why it won Best Picture? Maybe it just sucked the least of the films up for consideration this past year, or maybe the academy didn't want to award it to the gay film Brokeback Mountain, as so many are hyperventilating. I haven't seen BM so I can't say. The Oscar award probably also explains the high IMDb rating, because many simple-minded folk went and saw this due to the controversy of it beating BM to the Oscar, who otherwise would be busy seeing things like Kill Bill or Shrek 2.It really seems like a clumsy attempt at something beyond its capabilities. When cellular car phones first came out, in the 1980's, I saw a crappy cheap car with a bumper sticker that read ""I love my cellular phone"". I looked in at the front seat and there was a common house phone sitting there, pretending to be a cell phone. A cheap, non-functioning, clumsy attempt at imitation. Another example is ""fusion"" cuisine. Some foofy upscale restaurants develop fusion menus, and suddenly there are walk-up counters in food courts with laser jet printed signs saying ""Fusion food served here!"" So what am I getting on about with these illustrations? Crash is really a poor attempt at the form done very well in Amores Perros, and slightly less so in 13 Conversations and Magnolia. Heck, the American remake of Traffic, also with Don Cheadle, is a better intersecting-lives movie and it doesn't really fit the template! Why isn't Crash so good? Well, if you see the aforementioned, you will see much further developed character arcs and little politics and supermarket checkout stand magazine sentiment. The characters in Crash do everything but cite bibliographic references for the issues they are each assigned. The audience should be trusted to reach some conclusions on its own based on the strength of the movie, rather than have them dictated to them.And don't forget the musical interlude 3/4 of the way through! You know, where some sappy song is played, and each character is seen looking out the window, presumably contemplating the drama they have just been through, but in actuality probably hoping this movie doesn't sink their careers.The only reason to see Crash is so you can see the movie that knocked the cowboy lovers out of their saddle.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
marvelous crossover in narration,"It is not easy to figure out various characters'personality sharply with even showing time, as there may be a potential risk that hiding the core of the story. However, ""Crash' is not the case.Even though there are so many main characters in the film, their own personalities and the incidents happened for them were still described in detail, no confusion and insufficient portrayal. It owes on the strange crossover which linked all characters in a proper time and scene. As a result, the showing time will not be over while the content became more attractive because of the interaction between the guys involved.The core of the story is initiated by the sense of touch which was further developed in a different ways: a crash of the cars; knocking down of the old man; incivil touching to the wife of the director; and even the wrangle between those couples are also regards as conversation touching. How do the sense of touch raised various incidents in a short period of time(just 2 days, it also remind us that there are many unexpected things happened all around the world in every second. The film has shown various occasions with the time-line of 2 days, but which were held in US only), and if the touch is necessary or inevitable, is what the movie would like to point out.Actually the answer was given at the ending in which the crash was happened again and it just like a cycle for what occurred in the beginning. No one can escape from touching each other in such a crowded city. We look like want to prevent it happen but instead, it make our life to be more diversified and fresh.

"Over-rated? Well, OK...But still good!","Let me be blunt...Crash won best picture because the Academy did not want to give it to Brokeback Mountain. It's a good film, but not the best of 2004. And the Oscar for the script is also a bit of a stretch. The editing Oscar, however, is well-deserved.The script and the multiplicity of plots are full of exaggeration. This bothered me at first, but as the interconnected plots began to reveal themselves, I was drawn in. The cinematography and the performances of the ensemble cast are exceptionally good, but the plot - frankly - seems more like a collection of 30 minute TV detective show plots all tied together by a few threads and themes than a post-modern masterpiece.The theme is primarily racism, and it is exaggerated and overdone (in some of the plots and characters) almost to the extremes of Do The Right Thing. But Crash is no comedy, and in its tragedy, some truths about prejudice in general are revealed. The film also ties together many other themes which are less well examined. The cast of characters have a bewildering array of problems which they must sort through or yield to.A few of the performances really stand out: Don Cheadle, Michael Pena, Matt Dillon and Karina Annoyave are particularly impressive after my first viewing. The film is really a long string of vignettes which appears to take place over a fairly short period of time (one of the many rather unbelievable aspects of the plot). Each character is followed briefly for the resolution or advancement of the subplots in which they are involved and then it is on to the next. Yet the film does not quite achieve the level of post-modern semi-coherence that, for example, Magnolia, Inland Empire or Slacker did.Some of the scenes are unforgettable. Matt Dillon's epiphany as he rescues a woman from a flaming car wreck - both cinematographically and in terms of performance - is a masterpiece.I recommend this film. Although the whole film tends to be over-the-top, and the script creates characters that are neither wholly likable nor truly credible, it does a nice job of balancing its nightmare/fantasy elements with the reality of the human condition. It also brow-beats its audience a bit - and then follows up with redemptions, sacrifices, and commitments to humanity. Finally, if you enjoyed Babel, you are likely to enjoy Crash - structurally and dramatically very similar films set in very different places and with very different characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Sure it's a good movie - if you've never thought about racism before.,"""Crash"" will tell you that racism is bad. It will also tell you that we all have our problems and we all have some kind of prejudice. It will suggest that maybe we need to put ourselves in someone else's shoes before we judge them. It shows us that sometimes good people do bad things and bad people do good things. Oh, and guns are bad, too, mmmkay? All of these sentiments are well and good. However, they are presented in a manipulative, preachy and not very plausible way. I suppose ""Crash"" is thought-provoking if you have never thought about racism before.

A must-see!,Are you the kind of person who loves to sit down and get completely involved in a movie that will change your life? Do you appreciate really really good actors? Are you tired of the same dime a dozen crappy films that come out? Well then this is your kind of movie. This movie demonstrates every wonderful quality a movie should! The actors are fantastic. The dialogue is so captivating its a wonder more writers don't take pride in their work and write scripts like this. This is the kind of movie that keeps me going to the theaters. Movies like this don't come around very often so take advantage! Treat yourself to this wonderful film!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
High budget Hallmark movie,"Is it me or did this ""made for video"" Hallmark-like production just win the best picture at the Oscars? Oh dear, the state of American nation must be even worse than I thought.OK, the good points. The acting is decent, though somewhat amateurish. The score is fantastic. The storyline is interesting and the storytelling doesn't leave a boring moment.The first bad point of the movie is the look and feel of it. It is so Hallmarkish. I am not sure why that is, either due to the poor dialogue, or due to the stereotypical characters - don't believe the publicity, the Hollywood stereotypes are not broken in this movie, they are just reinforced. However, the really BIG bad point is the whole idea of the movie. After all, if you didn't know that race relations were a complicated affair, you must've come from another planet, populated by a single race. Now, let's use the ""chain reaction"" and the ""six degrees of separation"" phenomena combined to demonstrate that well-known fact. Sounds intriguing? Of course it does. The problem is that the creators of ""Crash"" use this technique to state the obvious, and that is really, really disappointing.Bottom line - there is not much to this film. It has Hallmarkish feel, Hallmarkish look, and it's ideas are as shallow as a puddle, despite the creators' best efforts. Watch it if you are really intrigued, but be ready to be very disappointed. I still can't figure out why it got an Oscar.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A thread of common humanity,"There is a process in a consciousness training I took many years ago in which people pretend that they are scared to death of the person sitting beside them. When they discover that that person is scared to death of them, the only thing to do is laugh. Urban society breeds fear, intolerance and lack of trust, especially of strangers of different ethnic backgrounds whom we see as potential threats rather than as people with problems similar to our own. In Crash, Paul Haggis has the vision to see the thread of common humanity that connects us beyond the socially conditioned fear. He has assembled an outstanding ensemble cast that includes Brendan Fraser, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe and all are first rate.The film is divided into several episodes and, as it unfolds, seemingly unrelated threads intersect to form a connection. In the opening segment, as a young black man brazenly complains that white people automatically assume that all blacks are criminals, he and his partner incongruously hijack the SUV of a District Attorney Peter (Brendan Fraser) and his young wife Jean (Sandra Bullock). The carjacking by the two African Americans (Ludacris, Larenz Tate) leaves Jean in a racist outrage, demeaning her housekeeper Maria (Yomi Perry) and venting her anger on a locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena), a Mexican-American working in the house. Typical of many, she tells a friend on the phone, ""I'm angry all the time and I don't know why."" In one of the film's most touching episodes, Daniel returns home to provide his frightened young daughter with an invisible vest to protect her from harm. When Daniel tells an Iranian shopkeeper Farhad (Shaun Taub) that his door needs replacing, the shopkeeper becomes visibly upset and directs his anger toward Daniel who is only trying to provide security. When his store is vandalized, he buys a gun and threatens Daniel and his little girl in a heart-pounding scene that leads to a true epiphany. In another thread, TV director Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton) are pulled over by a racist cop Ryan (Matt Dillon) who suspects some wrongdoing. His sexual touching of Cameron's wife, however, is humiliating for Christine and she becomes furious with her husband for standing by and letting it happen, irrationally ignoring the potential danger if he resisted.Taken aback by the ugly incident is Ryan's partner Hansen (Ryan Phillipe) who requests reassignment but soon has to confront his own demons when he gives a ride to a black hitchhiker. Meanwhile, a different side of Ryan is shown as he lovingly takes care of his sick father and rescues a black woman from certain death in a car accident. The final thread has Graham (Don Cheadle), a police detective, dealing with his estranged relationship with his wife Ria (Jennifer Esposito) and his mother who is a drug addict. Though the film is gritty and confrontational, the soothing music by Kathleen ""Bird"" York alleviates some of the shock and nastiness and reminds us that there is a divine melody always playing in the background of our lives. Though flawed by some contrived coincidences, Haggis has given us a crash course in confronting stereotypes and looking beyond outward appearances to see the humanity that people are capable of.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
There are no words for the quality of this film...,"Besides that when I was watching it with my good friend Lauren Littlefield, we were so very starved for entertainment she took the cap from my pen and stuck it into the rump of our friend Tom Raymond sitting in front of us.

Outstanding!,"Writer-director Paul Haggis interweaves several connected stories about race, class, family and gender in Los Angeles in the aftermath of 9/11. Characters include a district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his casually prejudiced wife (Sandra Bullock), dating police detectives Graham (Don Cheadle) and Ria (Jennifer Esposito), a victimized Middle Eastern store owner and a wealthy African-American couple (Terrence Dashon Howard, Thandie Newton) humiliated by a racist traffic cop (Matt Dillon).Director Paul Haggis turns the screws on a nation's anxieties and helps light the way of personal responsibility through conversation and, if need be, a little divine intervention in a surprisingly funny and touching film. It's the kind of film that starts arguments and stimulates passionate discussion about topics that still make most of us cringe. It's intelligent and always brazenly alive. Crash is masterful film making... a taut, credible, exciting drama of police corruption and more.Haggis knows how to grab the viewer's attention, via intense confrontations as well as by planting dramatic seeds that bear fruit in, more often than not, grimly unexpected ways. Despite a few preachy moments, the film is a knockout. Its large and talented cast are fantastic, packing every sentence with passion. It's a must-watch film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
As contrived as it is a classic,"'Crash' is about the tensions between various races in Los Angeles. Yes, hardly a topic for a light-hearted romp through the city. You'll probably have to be in the mood for something a lot darker (and at times poignant) which will make you think (just don't think too hard... but I'll get to that).The first thing you'll notice is the wide range of A-list actors on display here. Yes, it's one of those 'ensemble' casts and even those who don't have their own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are definitely also 'recognisable faces' meaning that even those who don't have quite as much screen time as the major stars are all capable of turning in a strong performance.Sandra Bullock may be the 'biggest' star on the cast list, but, in my opinion, it's Matt Dillon who steals the show. What you get is a selection of random - some average, some more privileged - people in L.A. whose lives are all due to 'crash' into each other in one way or another. Yes, that's where the title comes from, but, just in case you miss this meaning, there are also at least a couple of literal car crashes in there as well!Personally, I loved the film. It shows good and bad people of many different races and gives you a bit of a 'whistle-stop' tour of what it's like to be them. You could be expecting one hell of an epic film with so many people on the cast list. Surprisingly, it's not overly-long and, although this is good that it never drags, many of the characters never really get 'fleshed out' as they probably could have done (had this be made today and given its own Netflix TV series, or something).I don't see that as a gripe, but those who didn't enjoy 'Crash' as much as me do tend to dwell on how it's all a little too contrived. They ask, 'Would all these life-changing events really happen in such a short space of time?' The answer: probably not. But who cares? Do we stop watching 'Eastenders' because too much happens in such a small area?It's a film. It's making a point - and quite a brave one. It shows that no one race is all good and always right, possessing the 'correct' way to live their lives. We all have flaws and we all have people of our own 'kind' who are good and bad. I remember it even won some awards when it was first released. I agreed with that decision, but I also recall people disagreeing. However, if you want to see something that is as dark and tragic as it is funny and poignant then definitely give 'Crash' a go.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
I cannot think of a more powerful film,"I hope this film is remembered at Oscar time. It is simply brilliant. Haggis is a master craftsman. ""Crash"" should be required watching in every high school. On the surface racism rings out as the pervading theme, but it goes so far beyond that. Watching it one week after hurricane Katrina walloped the Gulf Coast made ""Crash"" more relevant than ever. We are a world fueled by anger that stems from misunderstanding and ignorance. That's it, in a nutshell. There are scenes in this film that I will never forget. Don Cheadle's final scene with his mother. Sandra Bullock hugging her maid. The impenetrable cloak put to a test. There are some films with great promise coming out between now and the end of the year, but I doubt any of them will come close to this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

This has moved into my top 10,"This is the most surprising movie of the decade! Just when you think you know where it's going, it broadsides you and veers into another area entirely. Crash highlights a 24 hour period where a dozen or so characters, who normally would not interact, eventually careen off each other in surprising ways. The viewer is exposed to the very best and the very worst in many of the characters over that brief period. What a ride! Take tissues. My second viewing was even better, and more emotional than the first! Don't miss this! Take friends, and family. This is appropriate for all sensibilities, but not the very young.

Could be good,"I just saw Crash last night and I must say I wasn't impressed.

The interpretations were mostly really good also.But then I think he lost it because he tried to give it too much that tragedy feeling which had no reason to be since the tragedy was already there.. so he did that ridiculous last scene ""à la Magnolia"" with the song playing loud and clear and showing all the characters in their suffering or feeling better about themselves.. I think Haggis went for the easy way of touching people. But I don't think he needed that.Sorry about my English.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not My Kind of Movie, But Certainly Well Made and Interesting.","When the lives of an L.A. cop, a half black couple, two black thugs, a rich couple, a black man whose mom favors his son, a middle easter shopkeeper, a Mexican mechanic and his daughter, and a rookie cop collide, there is no stopping the skid marks from appearing. This film was made in the style of one of my favorite films. MAGNOLIA. The different characters and they way they interact with each other just gives off that fresh cinematic feel. The film works very well.The whole racist theme seems at first to be what holds the character's lives together, but these characters are very human and everyone does know people who behave these ways. The acting is, overall, top-notch. The storyline is generally well crafted, and everything else, from the music score to the filming style and cinematography, is perfect. And yet, I do not like this movie.It is simply not my kind of movie. I don't really like movies that try to give you meaning and not knowing how to do it. Don't get me wrong, this film has a good message, but the way it is delivered feels too overdone. This film will make you think, and this film does need to be talked about after it is finished, but I just wish the film gave the audience a chance.Not everyone likes a movie that teaches you or forces you to think. But by giving the film too much of a grim tone set aside by spectacular and inspiring and breathtaking scenes, it just doesn't feel right. And that's where MAGNOLIA gets it right. And that's why this film irritates me. There is a particular scene near the end that i will not ruin suffix to say that the scene throws a completely unfair blow to the audience. It is especially irritating that the circumstances surrounding the scene are completely unlikely.Overall, i recommend the film and i do feel that there was a great deal of talent working on it. The film had won Best Picture for the Academy Awards of 2005. Do I think it should have won? Hell no. The other four films that were nominated were wonderful films that i felt deserved the Oscar far more than this. This, to me, was okay, as a film, its a step in the right direction. I just wish that the stem was a little bit bigger, thats all. Recommended. I hope that it dazzles you and changes your life.",,Anonymous,Crime

What Dickens would have written and directed today,"I am a passionate student of Dickens, preferring his more somber works such as Bleak House to his sillier fare. But even that sillier fare (Great Expectations, Oliver Twist ...)somehow managed to find the human truth of each character, and explore the important social themes of his day, among the improbable and unexpected plot twists. Crash, written and directed by Paul Haggis, is a film that Dickens would have made if he were alive today.The negative reviews I have read on this clearly have missed the point - ""Crash"" was overtly trying to be Dickenesque while taking-on a major social issue of today - internal and external racism among black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Persians and various other Americans. Yes, at times it's improbable, but never illogical or impossible. And isn't that like the after effect of a real crash? You never know where the pieces are going to end up, sometimes in the most unlikely of place, but that they got to their destination is a simple and undeniable fact of physics.Just like Dickens, but in less than 2 hours, you come to intimately know 8 major characters and 10 minor characters. But more importantly, each of these characters give you an insight into your own thoughts, prejudices and self-delusions. The bottom line here is that racism exists because we are sure we know exactly who and what the ""other"" is; however, that ""other"" is always far more complex than our racism will let us admit. The secret truth to this movie is that we may think we know who we are as well, yet our own racism is far more complex and affecting than we will ever admit.Haggis gets the best from his actors. Matt Dillon gives the performance he's been wanting to do for 20 years, as does Sandra Bullock and Brandon Frasier. And Crash answers the question which no one would ever have dared to ask ... Tony Danza actually can act, and act well. Who would have thought? Don Cheadle proves that Hotel Rwanda was not just a one-shot acting triumph. Even better, Haggis gets sterling performances out of a number of actors, many of whom you'll recognize from phoned-in performances from other lesser films and TV experiences who suddenly flower and deliver under this director's attention.The pace and editing of the film is amazing.This is probably the best film I have seen yet this millennium. It's worth seeing at least twice.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Well Deserving Of Oscar,"An outstanding film that grips you from the start, Crash is a riveting story that addresses the polarizing issues of race and separation in modern America. With a wonderful cast, Crash is rich in texture and emotion and adeptly drives home the message of how pervasive racism and prejudice is in America, permeating each of our diverse cultures. Truly a must see film, Crash provides insight into a difficult situation without offering up any cliché commentary, which I believe makes the film all the more potent. Far too often film-makers find themselves compelled to proffer a solution to a political problem when that in fact is often better left for the viewer to pontificate after watching the film. Crash deserves every bit of it's Oscar for Best Picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wonderfully Nuanced Treatise on Racism,"This is an exceptional film on all levels. Technically it is masterful. The filming is exceptional. The acting is top notch all the way through. There is a lot of very deep, but suppressed emotion, in the acting. There were no weak performances throughout this film. There was one scene that perhaps could have been edited a little more tightly, but that is a genuinely trivial complaint. This film really hit the mark with me.Structurally, this film is very close to ""Short Cuts"" by Robert Altman, which is also a favorite of mine. This tells the interwoven stories of an ensemble cast of characters as they face the frustrations of daily living. Racism isn't black and white. Interspersed throughout the film are the multiple nuanced facets of racism in all of their ugly shades of grey. There is no overt KKK-style racism here. It's all about the subtle assumptions that we make of people based on their appearance. Sometimes those assumptions are correct, but wrong. Sometimes they are wrong, but correct.This is a brilliant screenplay. Sure there are some coincidences that are quite unlikely, but they are there to contribute to the point of the stories, so that level of poetic license is quite alright with me. It didn't detract from the message.There are so many wonderful actors and performances in this movie that it is unfair to pick out one out. However, I thought Don Cheadle - whose acting I am always admired - had the best performance of his career. His ability to convey emotion through expression was just plain exceptional.It takes a truly exceptional movie to impress me enough to earn a 10 of 10.

too many characters leave them feeling thin,"It's a day and a half in Los Angeles. Police detectives Ria (Jennifer Esposito) and Waters (Don Cheadle) get into a car crash.

It tackles issues of race and perceptions. This has some great individual scenes. The problem is that Haggis has included so many characters that the heavy subject matter feel very superficial.

Incredible and Remarkable,"Brilliant dramatic masterpiece by director Paul Haggis.Crash stars Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Terence Howard, Larenz Tate, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe, Thandie Newton, Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges and Brendan Fraser. Stunning performances by Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon, and that's just some. This film is seriously sad, so many sad moments and is very comparable to Traffic, the only difference is this topic is about Racism, not just to African-Americans, but to Oriental people and White people and all colors. If you see a man on the street and he has needles coming out of his beard and he has blonde cornrows. and he walks up to you and he's a doctor and soft-spoken guy, then you judged him wrong and that's what Crash is all about. Never judge someone simply by looking at them. You don't see a movie half the time you're watching this movie. It's very believable.Actually, the entire cast was believable. Great cameos by Keith David, Tony Danza, and Daniel Dae Kim. This is one of those movies that you can't get enough of, this music is very sad for it's moments. The music is awesome. ""In the deep"" and ""Crash"" are the best. Bird York's(who also has a cameo)her voice is perfect in ""In the Deep."" Kansascali, demonstrates perfectly what the movie is about. Watch the video to see what I mean.The movie about four story lines Don Cheadle as Det. Graham Waters(and his relationship with his girlfriend/partner and his family), Brendan Fraser as Rick Cabot and his wife Jean(and her racist actions), Matt Dillon as the racist Officer John Ryan and Ryan Phillipe as her rookie partner, Officer Hanson,(how Hanson thinks of his partner). Terence Howard as Cameron, the TV producer and his wife, Christine played by Thandie Newton.(their marriage after Farhad and his daughter, Dorri(a young Persian woman and her short-tempered father), Larenz Tate as Peter and rapper Ludicrous as Anthony (Peter & Anthony's look on life and their actions). Michael Pena as Daniel, the locksmith and his daughter(everyone seems to pre-judge him.) In my opinion, all the story lines were awesome and simply powerful as hell. Definitely worth a look.You must pay attention, though to actually understand it. So, if you going to watch it, no kids in the room, turn off your pager or your cell phone and sit and prepare to be left in awe. Spectacular film, destined to become a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Burning Mess with a Touch of Beauty,"""Crash"" is a movie that has one character crashing into another. Several questions arise watching the film. I ask, is everyone in the world spewing hate-mongering statements 24/7 and looking at people who are of a different race and nationality as criminals, terrorists, or thugs? The film deals with far too prevalent acts of racism. These acts are not nearly as prevalent as they were 40 and 50 years ago in America, which is probably when this film should take place, but even then there would be one too many racists in this film. Not every person is filled with hate, but we get the impression that we are. ""Crash"" wants to be bold and outgoing on a touchy subject and does a good job in doing that with the actions of the characters, but ultimately it never gets to where it wants to be.The only person that you get a feel for being 100% racist is Matt Dillon's character. After an inspiring act of humanity and selflessness from Officer Ryan it reaches its climax right then and there, half way through the film, and unfortunately never recovers until the final moments. This will be the first of many occasions where we see some good show through an evil character or some bad show through a good character. Veteran Police Officer Jon Ryan played by Matt Dillon gives an Oscar worthy performance. His performance ends up getting lost in the shuffle of the swinging door of one racist character after another and how we see them redeem themselves. His story along with the black couple that he comes to know on a personal basis like no other relationship you could ever imagine is truly some of the greatest work I have ever seen in film. We see the most volatile in man in one traffic stop from Officer Ryan then we see the most humane, noble, and heroic in an incredibly inspiring, emotional, and beautifully crafted rescue scene.Each and every character goes through a transformation which is preceded by a crazy and unrealistic event that happens in their lives that gives them a new outlook on life and a new outlook on the people around them. The bad end up good and the good end up bad.The film really misses on it racial slurs, but hits on all cylinders with its racial actions. The problem is that they didn't take it all that far. In all reality it's really lightweight stuff when you really listen to what they're saying with what they should or could be saying. Watch a Martin Scorsese film and then talk about racism. This movie tries to go all the way, but fails at the end of the day with the tone of the film not matching what we hear. It doesn't match what the characters are saying with what they're doing. They're supposed to be racist, but they speak in politically correct racism. Racism is no holds barred and this film is trapped in a 6X10 steel cage just waiting to explode.There is just one too many people changing for the good. And one too many people changing for the bad. To symbolize this, it snows at the end (In LA) to show that people can change and that it's possible. That anything is possible; when in these cases virtually none of it is possible. If you can get past all this over the top stuff that really brings the film down you can see what the filmmaker is trying to portray; you realize this film is not about racism like I thought it was after the first time I watched it. It has much more to offer.The second time I watched this film, the final images really jumped out at me. Maybe I had a better understanding, maybe I was watching closer, but we see all the characters looking out their windows, or out into the dark night, or out upon the city lights. We first see this with the newly resurrected Officer Ryan who is a changed man as he looks at a brightly lit Christmas tree in the city possibly resembling his future, but he still has a look of grief and sorrow for his actions on that same street that could make anyone sick. Then we see Daniel (Michael Pena) looking out his window after he nearly looses a loved one. We see him looking at the beautiful world in which he inhabits and the ugliness that he has seen as he wonders if that bullet from his past is still following him. He appreciates all that he could have lost and fears what he could lose.We see the DA (Brendan Fraser) looking out his door just after he comes home. He looks out his window wondering if he's safe and questioning his purpose in life. Prior to this scene we see that he has more than just a working relationship with his black secretary, Karen, which his wife(Sandra Bullock) would surly oppose. Finally we see the city of LA as we just witness Anthony (Ludacris) change into a hero and Shaniqua get rear-ended by someone of a different background. She then spews a toned down racial epithet. Here we see the beautiful images of LA where mankind's most vile and heinous acts have been occurring, but we also see its great acts of heroism and humanity. We see that people can change. We also see that people are good hearted and everyone has good and bad buried in them. They just need to examine themselves, step back, take it all in, and just let go. The final message is that, maybe tomorrow everyone can find their way. The final shot reassures us that maybe there is hope amidst all these despicable acts because of all the great acts of humanity that we see from the despicable.There's a lot to like, but it's just too heavy handed.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The whole cast is top notch with top notch performances. Paul Haggis has created a masterpiece that I will remember for a long time. It brings you laughs, tears, and raises a lot of eyebrows. The ""Best in Show Male"" has to be the amazing Matt Dillon who brings the character of a racist police officer with a dying father to life. Never before have I seen a more real, true performance. Sandra Bullock takes a break from her ""cutesy"" girl roles for a some strong supporting performance. Her screen time is minimal but every time she is on screen you find yourself engulfed in her eyes. Terrence Howard is the breakout star of the year who carries many scenes on his bare shoulders. He shows you so many emotions with a tear falling down his face. Michael Pena is the most likable character of the movie and the one I sympathized with the most. He's too unknown to garner Oscar attention but we should be seeing him in the future. Don Cheadle gives a pretty decent performance but not as good as last years Hotel Rwanda. And last but certainly not least is Thandie Newton who's raw intensity gives the viewer a shutter. After last years bomb the Chronicles of Riddick she returns with a force to be reckoned with come Oscar time. I would love to see both Bullock and Newton nominated like McDormand and Hudson back in 2001 but that's very rare. The rest of the cast is great but it was just these few that stood out.

Excellent movie and awesome plot !!!,"It was a great opportunity, to see at last (but not least), this excellent film, eighteen years after it's first release day. I would consider the story pretty good moreover the cast awesome as they did their best. Their acting was fabulous during the whole film. In my opinion, the plot was awesome and very humane. Another reason I liked the movie was due to the incredible sequence of events. In the end, the film makes you think and challenges you to reconsider some point of views that basically have to do with racism, from whatever side it comes from. Finally, I will never forget, the shocking scene where the Persian shopkeeper, unaware that his gun was only loaded with blanks, shoots the Latino father who has his daughter in his arms. For all the above reasons, I would undoubtedly suggested it !",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amazing twists and connections!!,"In the midst of racial differences we follow a collection of people from every walk of life during a two day period on the gritty streets and sprawling suburbia of Los Angeles, California. A stereotypical wealthy caucasian couple, one a district attorney and a privileged wife. Another wealthy black couple, a racially frustrated wife and a husband disillusioned to racial tension. Two black car jackers who use their race as an excuse to act stupidly. A pair of seemingly racist police officers, one embracing this and the other pushing it deep down. A black cop with a drugged out mother who blames him for the criminal nature of his brother. An East Asain man being run down in the streets and left for dead. A disconnected Persian man who differences clash with an hispanic handyman. All these walks of life with their stories intertwined in such an incredible way just going to show that even in a city as vast as that we're all bound to crash into one another.Set in the backdrop of a justice system plagued by a racist ideology behind closed doors and a usual unspoken but very real fact of the matter. Even those who don't project racism so obviously are still usually so blinded it comes off subconsciously. A beautiful piece of cinematography backed by an even stronger soundtrack that fits well. This film also has a tremendous ensemble cast that flows together very well. This film displays racial differences without reservation and very bluntly. A beautifully written film that effortlessly connects each character in such a natural raw way, everything fits and not much feels forced. For a directorial debut we get a very complete multi-faceted story.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
lack of narrative subtlety prohibits Crash being a truly great film,"Its lack of narrative subtlety prohibits Crash being a truly great film; there are great performances and breathtakingly captured scenes, however, the scriptwriter's immense confidence, in an admittedly clever concept (however crudely executed), appears to be to blame for the contrived feeling of the resulting film.The over simplistic narrative unnecessarily highlights the intentions of the filmmakers and makes it feel like a medium for crudely constructed and (somewhat paradoxically) vague ideology making it hard to focus on the story rather than the story telling. Crash is based on a challenging concept that was sadly underdeveloped (resulting in a slightly heavy-handed and a clichéd script) but otherwise very well made.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Crash is not a bad film, but that doesn't mean it should've won Best Picture","I can understand why the Academy gravitated towards this race-oriented drama. However, it picked a film that beats you over the head with the idea that racism is bad. I'm pretty sure most people watching this film already knew that. While there are some creative sequences, there are an awful lot of incredible coincidences that tie these characters together. Some of the transformations are a little far-fetched as well. The actors do a fine job for the most part, even though the father/daughter scene is pretty melodramatic. I really don't think this is a bad film and worthy of the insane amount of hate it gets, it just is a bit simplistic for a Best Picture winner in the modern era.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An Important Film, Even If an Imperfect One","""Crash"" has so many good things going for it, it's a shame that it's hampered by a clunky, obvious and over-earnest script. The movie is very Altmanesque in design, featuring a large ensemble cast and a plot that intricately weaves various plot lines together in surprising ways. Unlike Altman's best films, though, ""Crash"" doesn't have that spontaneous, improvised feel; everything feels too forced and overly scripted. Every scene plays out in the same way, creating an ever so slightly monotonous pace. It's a movie with great intentions that isn't entirely successful at fulfilling them.But, the writing is my only complaint. From a directing and acting standpoint, ""Crash"" triumphs. Paul Haggis makes the leap from screenwriter to director ably, and does a wonderful job of keeping his story moving fluidly along, no matter how implausible it might be. And as far as the ensemble goes, this is ones of those movies (also very like an Altman film, come to think of it) that has a cast full of actors who you've never seen act as well as they do here. I wouldn't say I've ever been much impressed by the dramatic range of Ryan Philippe, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser or Sandra Bullock, but they certainly impress here. Bullock, despite a tiny role, makes an enormous impression, and her brief monologue during which she describes what it's like to wake up every morning filled with anger without even knowing what she's angry about, was one of the most affecting scenes I've seen in a movie all year.Other cast members are excellent as well: Terrence Howard as a movie executive ""selling out"" to white America; Thandie Newton as his frustrated wife, angry at him for not standing up to the very people who have made her privileged life possible; Don Cheadle as a hardened detective who has resigned himself to the unfairness of being judged by the color of your skin.Whatever its faults, ""Crash"" deserves high praise for tackling with intelligence and conviction subject matter that other film makers wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. How refreshing in our time of political correctness that a film would dare suggest that stereotypes might be based on truths, and that a white director and writer can make a sharp film about the race question without feeling the need to cushion everything through the gauzy haze of liberal white guilt.Not a perfect movie by any means, but one that I think deserves to be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A stereotypical script that ruins great acting and cinematography,"After the latest awards, I was really excited to go rent ""Crash"", which I had missed in the theater, and having recently become interested in the various films that explore the modern demographic fractal of Los Angeles.The story tries to follow 8 main characters that interweave through a day in Los Angeles, and there is some excellent acting, with actors playing against type. Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock and Matt Dillon all put in fine performances that deserved more publicity, and Ludicrous makes an impressive acting debut. The lighting is great and a pleasure to watch.It's just to bad the story and dialogue are so horrid. Every incident is pulled from a ""racial dynamics 101"" after-school special, with none of the subtlety and tension that underlies the real interplay between race, ethnicity and class in modern America. It comes across as a film about diversity and conflict as written by a white liberal who has never experienced any of these incidents, nor really knows someone who has.By the middle of the movie, it's lost any sense of surprise, it's an interplay of stereotypes rather than characters, and it leaves no sense of tension. The one surprise for me involved the incident between the Hispanic family and the Persian store owner, and since that was my one surprise, I spoil it for you.By it's end it was rather tedious, and I can't believe that this film won Best Picture unless the other candidates just stank. It's a real shame that this ones and ""A History of Violence"" (good - not great), wasn't even nominated.Watch it for curiosity, but don't expect a good movie.

"""Crash"" - head-on","""Crash,"" the new film by Paul Haggis would play out even more like a slice-of-life urban drama if it weren't for the realities of the O.J. Simpson case, the Rodney King beating and the subsequent Los Angeles riots of 1992. That all these events took place in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, and that Haggis' film too is set within the City of Angels over the course of 36 hours, it's not without the blinding in-your-face irony of the reality it attempts to convey to the audience that we're looking into ourselves. Haggis has assembled one of the most dynamic casts for this multi-character drama that includes Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Ludicrous, Larenz Tate, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Esposito, and Thandie Newton. In several poignant vignettes, the sensitive race issue is explored in deep, painful, and resentful fashions - no sides taken - and the people in the audience are left to ponder the film's message, as well as examine their own innermost prejudices. If it weren't for the realities depicted in ""Crash,"" we would not have such an in-depth look into the near-complete absence of human compassion and emotion.

"Copycat of Magnolia, melodramatic but still good","It clearly shows being influenced by Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, but changed to race issues. It is full of racial stereotypes and clichés, which disappointed a little, plus that soap opera 'telenovela' style that irritated me in some scenes, but the message seems clear and that's good, which is that everyone can't avoid being a bit racist or fall in stereotyping other people because of their race. It's not realistic though, because most people in LA don't think in race every time they take a walk outside, I would say. It is funny how the film portraits ""racist"" and ""tolerant"" people, showing their hypocrisy and double standard.

Lives up to the hype and then some...,"Recently bought this on DVD, having heard a lot of rave reviews for this film. It far surpassed any expectations i had. Crash is a brilliant ensemble piece about racism centering around a shooting by a white cop of a black cop, a car-jacking, and a racist cop pulling over an innocent black movie director and his wife. Director Paul Haggis has created a powerful, moving, and sometimes hard to watch masterpiece which only falters with the occasional cheesy line or gimmick (like one character's imitation of country music). But such things are easily forgiven or overlooked in the grand scheme of the film. The soundtrack is simple yet haunting, and the cinematography is absolutely top-notch, making the actions of the characters seem like real things done by real people, and not actors. The REAL reason this film is so good, however, is the acting. EVERY actor and actress in Crash is at the top of their game, and by the time the credits roll, viewers will have both favorite characters whom they connected and sympathized with, and characters who they will loathe for their actions. Though its hard to pick a favorite actor, i have to say that Ludicrous, Michael Pena, and especially Terrence Howard (who after this went on to star in the highly touted Hustle & Flow, with Ludicrous in a supporting role)gave riveting performances that stick with you after the film ends. Howard's climatic confrontation with certain characters towards the end of the film is by far one of the most dramatic, well-acted, and tense scenes i've witnessed in any movie in a long, lonnnng time. Watch this film. BELIEVE the hype. It will keep you talking and arguing with your friends hours after it ends.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Cinema at its absolutely very best.,"This one follows the line of Grand Canyon and Magnolia. I say it ""follows"", but it actually goes far more deeper, as far deeper as I can recall when it comes to Hollywood taking into account complex stuff about human nature. Best attempts I had glimpsed until now, where some of Kenneth Branagh's, and that's it. Which in turn makes me wonder that director Paul Haggis must be definitely involved in some kind of serious school of self work. Sandra Bullock's appearance is quite short, but it's the first time I happen to watch her out of the usual silly ""light"" stereotype and she does really great. Indeed, almost everyone performs a brilliant role here. Many actors are to become famous from this film on. Remember. The only pity with Crash is that it is so good that you don't want it to end, and when it does you feel that it's going to take quite a long time before something equally good is made again. But that's life, isn't it? By the way reader, do you really think you know who you are?! Je, je, je. :) You have absolutely no idea. Believe me.

Style over zero substance mixed with unrealistic racism conflicts,"While I admire Crash for raising to the glpry with so little budget(6.5 million was spent to make this film), and how well the money was spent in editing and FX, the film as a whole is disturbingly B level(apart from a few members of the cast, obviously, Sandra Bullock and all)and not deserved at all it's Best Picture win.It has an abominable script. Period. It doesn't matter if it won various screenplay awards or not. It's terrible. Screenplay's teachers often say that the dialogs are irrelevant - well, in a commercial point of view, yes; but awards-wise, the story is(or should be) completely other. Crash obviously wasn't nowhere near of having the best screenplay of it's year.And still, Crash has some of the dullest, forced dialogs that I've ever heard, and often they involved racism. Yes. It was so unrealistic that I couldn't help but laugh. It was hilarious. It was so bad that it makes James Cameron screenplays looks like Shakespeare plays in comparison. Is just ridiculous.The character development is another thing I strongly disliked. For a film that wants to be so 'emptionally involving', the characters are just pathetic. I couldn't care any less for what was happening, and again, I just observed with a smirk on the face all the hilarious attempts of the film to make emotional contriving situations, because really, It was awful, forced and completely unrealistic. But yes, the music and the flashy editing are two things to be appreciated in the film. Matt Dillon acting is good, actually, and the film's pace isn't bad, the film always goes ahead, so it wasn't a boring experience. The editing, in fact, was the only aspect that truly deserved awards. The rest, forgettable and average at best.I think this film is not worth of your time at all, certainly one of the worst Oscar winners of all time. 5.9/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Trash & Burn: Or how I learned how NOT to make a movie,"This is by far one of the very worst movies I've ever had the displeasure to view. It was so bad I was laughing out loud during scenes which the awful writer-director (Welles he definitely ain't & never will be) I'm certain believed would be 'thought provoking', or 'heart breaking gritty realism'.It's so very badly written, acted, edited, shot but somehow (amazingly!) somehow this manipulative- pretentious-after-school-special (actually that's insulting to millions of students) got nomination after nomination. I can only imagine that cleverly marketed to the do-gooders of the Hollywood out-of-touch- elite (Please Google George Clooney's acceptance speech where he makes ridiculous comments like 'Hollywood has always been ahead of the curve.' And he reminded us that Hollywood was progressive enough back in the so-called Golden Era of H-Wood to give a black actor an Oscar....eh hmmm....it is for these types of 'petite' racist morons that Crash was made).If you're even a little aware of American culture please don't bother with this ""film"" (for lack of a better name). You would do much better watching TCM's specials on African American Films from the Golden Age to current times. Or their more recent month long subject of Asian Images in Hollywood than to throw your money away on this insulting piece of filth.It's not even offensive to me the ""how's"" of ""how"" this crap got made. Misogyny is popular with producers and studio heads and these same important men like to feel as of what they do in Hollywood trickles down to us mere mortals like manna from heaven. These important men like to believe that Hollywood is still relevant as far as social issues and changing times (which we all know hasn't really been the case since the great American cinema of the 70's). These important men also love paying 'homage' to other films. As others have noted Haggis lifts scenes and ideas directly from earlier films like Pulp Fiction and Magnolia. Truly the mark of someone who isn't very talented.Although I admit it annoys me terribly that lots of money gets thrown into such bad projects like 'Crash'. What is really insulting and offensive is that there are good filmmakers making beautiful and important films and their work was over- looked so that this piece of idiotshiot could get oodles of nominations (I think it even won a bunch - too depressing for me to look up).Oh and Academy - please stop trying to bewitch me! Matt Dillon can NOT act. He's a terrible actor & us mere mortals know it! He is to acting what Haggis is to directing/writing. Quick note on Haggis: He's a Canadian whose lived in Los Angeles for over 20 years of his adult life and this was his portrayal of Los Angelenos and ""realistic"" dialogue?

The casting was very good and I was pleasantly surprised by the rapper Ludicrus - he played his part well and a lot of the films basic premise depended on his performance.Thandie Newton finally proves to the world she can act. I saw he debut in the British film The Young Americans (dir: Danny Cannon) and it was clear she wasn't just eye candy (watch her in Mission Impossible 2), there is a kind of fragility to her acting and when she is given the chance she can deliver. Her scenes with Matt Dillon are electric and the scene with the 'girl and bullet' was just heart pounding stuff.This film should be shown in schools and colleges around the world because a young person watching this could end up viewing the world and his fellow human beings in a more positive way.

Simply stated  excellent and a pleasure to experience.,"Crash is a story of redemption and second chances, about the toxicity that comes from polluted motivation, namely fear.Told through the easily understood and recognized frame of racism in Los Angeles (no pre-story is required here as most viewers know of Watts District Riots, Rodney King, OJ Simpson, et al) a number of stories are interwoven and told in the manner of Claude Lelouche, Robert Altman, Terrence Tarrantino, et al.When the edges of each of these stories touches on others, the true nature of shared experience of what can only be called institutionalized fear is engaged. Even newcomers are quickly made fearful and paranoid due to a culture of violence bred from incessant feelings of disconnectedness in their lives, their environments and their choices.Crash challenges you to look beneath the layer of racism to explore the underlying message that in fear, in adversity, in us-and-them, only bad can result. But when motivated by strength and empowerment, when fear is left to lie, even those characters most despicable can be redeemed with second chances. A lovely thought.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

S10 Reviews: Crash (2004),"'Crash' is the wonderfully told story of an unrelated group of Los Angelinos who are all quite literally crashing into each others lives. The many stories are finely interwoven with so many fine layers and textures. A black detective is working a case involving a cop shooting who also deals with his drug-addled mother and crook brother. A pair of philosopher car-jackers whose hypocritical musings perpetuate the very things they supposedly abhor, a District Attorney and his spoiled and pampered wife, a Persian shop owner and his family and a locksmith providing for his family. 'Crash' grabs you right from the beginning with Mark Isham's emotional deep and haunting music score. Paul Haggis (whose recent accolades include writing the equally emotional 'Million Dollar Baby') directs and produces his emotional and racially motivated script with amazing skill. Some films with this many stories can lose or alienate the viewer but 'Crash' is written like a page-turning novel, you couldn't stop it if you tried. The ensemble cast (Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraiser and dozens of others give amazing, high-caliber performances. Perfectly cast and wonderfully acted all the way around.

Under the skin of the city of angels,"Maybe all the film wants to tell us is to reconsider our behaviors a little bit and look at them more, and not let ourselves get caught up in sudden, emotional decisions.In fact, we humans of all races adhere to the principles and rules they have created for us through the environment in which we grow up, and Paul Haggis proves this in the film. In fact, this film shows that we are the tools of the state (the state is the invisible element or actor of the film that surrounds the characters of the film). The effect of our behaviors and our reactions (we see no action in the film, we all see a reaction to an Elman) may all be predetermined.I do not believe in systematic racism, it should not be attributed to everyone, there are a few of them, but the media portrays this minority as if it were the entire population of the planet.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best film of the year so far!!!,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsLos Angeles. A place of massive cultural diversity, that doesn't always go hand in hand together.A man has been found murdered on the side of a lay-by. There's the black detective with the hispanic wife who's leading the case. His brother is a tear-away who couldn't have chosen a different life. There's the district attorney, obsessed with public appearance and his constantly angry, fussy wife. Their car is robbed by two young black men who've only become what they are because the society they live in has inadvertently allowed them to. The couple's door-lock is being fixed by a dodgy looking gang-member type who's in fact only trying to make ends-meet for his daughter. He gets into a dispute with his employer, an immigrant salesman who everybody mistakes him and his family for Iraqis. There's the reserved music producer and his wife who chastises him for not being manly enough, stopped by a cop with a dying dad and a racist grudge. There's his rookie partner, nervous about making a stand against it.Cleverly combining the twin threats of a city already on the edge with a lot of post 9/11 angst still running rife, Crash is an intelligent, powerful, thoughtful, compelling and absorbing study of how prejudice and unjust phobia can tear not only a community apart but a city apart. It's an inspired and clever idea, high-lighting a lot of the potential ways in which the strife is caused. It shows not only the effect on the society, but on the soul as well, with the powerful score and the silent parts.As for the cast, it's really a mix of those who's careers are already on a high and those who'll be lucky to be offered something as deep and meaningful again in years. Having seen Hotel Rwanda just last week, Don Cheadle continues to shine here in one of the lead roles. The film has a similar feel to Traffic, another film he was in, and it looks like he'll have a career appearing in these kind of arty, high-brow flicks and good for him that he's appearing in roles that are worthy of his talents. There's good work too from Sandra Bullock and, continuing to distance himself from his goofy earlier work, Brendan Fraser. Speaking of which, rap star Ludicrous is really one of the main stars of the show here, creating a great contrast with his clever, insightful presence here with his role in the slightly less provocative 2 Fast 2 Furious. Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillipe, two actors who've always left a bit to be desired, surprise and shine here and create a great double act as the harder, more influential older cop and the vulnerable, more naive rookie. And as for Thandie Newton, well, all I'll say is if I'd judged her on the basis of The Chronicles of Riddick (the only film I remember seeing her in!) I'd have been missing out on a lot. The remainder of the supporting cast are all very good as well.The film is directed by Canadian Paul Haggis, who's only other theatrical release has been the little heard-of 1993 movie Red Hot. He handles it all well right until the end with the cloying use of the okay but woodenly over-used Stereophonics hit Maybe Tomorrow over the closing credits. But other than that, this is the best film of the year so far and one Crash that really makes an impact. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"well-shot and often well-acted, but it's so subject heavy...","I had heard so much about Crash over these past months in 2005, seen it pop up repeatedly on top 10 lists, and only heard a couple of reviews from friends or critics saying it was a bad movie. After finally seeing it, I feel like I've seen a film in conflict with itself, which is for better or worse depending on who is watching it. The stories in the film revolve around several characters (ensemble style), including cops, gangsters, foreigners, upper-class types, lower-class types, who get in such conflicts with each other, practically all by racial attitudes and bigotry. It's a tough call for me as a viewer, because I respect the effort that has been put into it, the initial ambition to track the kinds of racial boundaries that make things with people on edge all over America, not just Los Angeles. And performances by the likes of Sandra Bullock (her best since Miss Congeniality 2...just kidding, really top notch), Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton, Matt Dillon, and even Brendan Fraser, go above expectations. The problem I see lies in the script.Writer/director Paul Haggis, who scored some points for his script of Million Dollar Baby (an adaptation, but one that did have a level of simplicity that helped), sometimes confuses making bold statements by these assorted types as being perfectly modulated alongside the style. The funny thing is, the photography is quite interesting, in its hand-held, quasi-Traffic style, however even under the surface I almost felt there was a kind of TV-movie feel to it that I couldn't shake. Un-like a real masterpiece about racism in America, Do The Right Thing, there aren't many any sidebars (or little details) to the characters really that break up the more tense moments. And it's not just the pile of coincidences that one has to take fully into account, or that many scenes seem like rushed climaxes, but that even when things get dramatically correct and strong (later in the film, when not too melodramatic) it isn't as real as it should be. Maybe I'm missing something, or maybe it's that the movie isn't very subtle, but it's no great film to me. It is good, sometimes provocative, and not in totally in the league of other non-linear films that have come out in the past decade. Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Preachy, contrived, ludicrous, heavy-handed, self-serving","I don't like films that beat me over the head with a message and Crash uses a BIG HAMMER to continually beat you for 115 minutes with the message that racism is bad. Well, duh.The script is contrived to the point of being ludicrous. You can spot what is going to happen way before it does. I've never seen so many coincidences in one film. This film has enough coincidences for 20 movies.Hardly any of the characters in the film are less than totally despicable. They're all hateful. Matt Dillon's cop is not only a bigot but a sick bigot as well. When he pulls over a couple he needlessly frisks the woman in a manner that is actually an assault Yet the film has the audacity to excuse his behavior, and he is never punished for it, because of some lame explanation about how his father was run out of business because of affirmative action. Somehow the scriptwriter is saying that he's a bigot because of affirmative action and that is okay. What a bunch of hooey. The Persian store owner is also hateful, about as abusive as they come. I found myself wishing these clods would get what was coming to them.I feel that the screenwriter has violated the well-known principle of ""write what you know."" This man has no idea of the characters he writes about and he has no idea what it's like to be a person of color. His attitude actually seems Uncle Tom'ish and very condescending.I have nothing against the actors in the film, they were good. But what terrible lines they were given. I feel sorry for them.I guess the movie folks in L.A. think they did something good by giving this film an Oscar, to somehow show they are not racists.

astonishingly excellent.,"Dear MovieLovers, this movie is a must see for everyone alive today. there are not words that can express just how good this movie really is. not only was it the best written screenplay i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing, the content & the sound was more impactive than any movie i have ever seen. my favorite signature mark on this film besides the unique writing was the way the sound played in on the film. you got to hear the voices of many of the actors before you got to see their faces. here you heard these familiar voices & got to guess, by sound & sound alone, who they were. this film was approaching some very controversial subject matter with more heart & more love than imaginable. this film has been added to my top five favorite films of all time. if i were to have the talent to write a film/screenplay, i would only dream to write something just like this. ""Crash"" is finally a tall drink of water in a dry hot desert of such a long sequence of horrific movie making. Thank you to all involved in bringing ""Crash"" to fruition. it was a true honor to witness such brilliance. Perpetually Thankful,Nikki.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ture Greatness,"This is what all money in Hollywood should go towards, as film that forces you to consider all your views, beliefs and understandings of the world we live in. This is a truly remarkable piece of film making an puts to shame all of the big blockbusters that we the paying customers have to suffer year in year out. This film, along with the likes of American History X, should be a part of all modern education as it says more about the world we live in than any text book could. Thank you so much for this experience. The acting in this film hits the spot, with no one member of the cast (including Tony Danza) letting the show down, instead it only helps reinforce the points being made. These points are very hard hitting and so this film should be be rented if you are looking for a good time or a laugh, instead it should be taken to heart. This is a film that should not only be seen by the public, but should be on the receiving end of many an Oscar, Best Picture, Best (supporting)actor/actress, Best Direction, all should be claimed by this film. It leaves the winners over the past 5 years standing, but i fear that this will not be the case, as the topics targeted within this film might be to challenging to win these awards.

What's All the Fuss About?,"After more than the usual hype surrounding a film and after wondering what was so good about this film after it won a few awards I finally broke down and rented it the night before the Academy Awards. I had to rent it because it never aired in theaters in the town where I live. That's not surprising in a place that seems to try and show only kiddie movies. In any event I carried it home with the hope of finding a real gem, after all I had the read the hype.I have to say that I was more than a little disappointed. I saw nothing at all new here and nothing that was even all that well done with the exception of the construct of coincidence carried to ridiculous levels. The film is a collection of overlapping vignettes (but lacking the requisite subtlety) that purport to describe the condition of racial injustice in society. Instead it comes across like being assaulted by some crazy person getting too close and mumbling tired old clichés at you when you leave a restaurant after a good meal; the delivery is more disturbing than the message. There is nothing here to me that wasn't already old and overwrought in the 1970's.More unsettling may even be the ineptitude and prejudice of the film-makers. They seem to have one theme in mind and don't mind portraying it even if it's wrong or a bad idea. Take for example the piece concerning the Persian shopkeeper. It begins by showing him illegally buying a firearm in a shop but doesn't expand on his illegality or that of the seller in the manner of the sale. Instead, in a trite twist it later reveals that his daughter bought him a box of blanks for ammunition to go with it. That happens when he tries to shoot a man with it but nothing happens when his daughter accidentally gets in the way. This is just plain irresponsible. Any firearm shooting blanks does in fact expel very dangerous substances from the muzzle at short ranges, enough so to cause serious injury and even death. But they depict it as having no effect whatsoever. That is a great way to mislead naive young people in audiences into believing it and maybe reenacting it with serious injury or death as a result. If you don't think that's true try asking Jon-Erik Hexum, who found out the hard way in 1984. This is just irresponsible to show this in this way.The rest of the film eschews a muddle of trite old racist stereotypes and shows us examples of what the film makers think are examples of this. The thing was in all the writing I encountered before seeing the film the only place I saw a reference to ""racist"" with regard to the film were references to the Matt Dillon character. As expected, the Matt Dillon character was overtly racist - although it did give some insight to what may have propelled him in that direction. But at least he was openly and unashamedly so. The rest of the characters were more objectionable examples of it. I almost laughed at many of the characters because almost every character in the film was either a ridiculous one-dimensional stereotype or a blatantly one-dimensional racist. For example, the Don Cheadle character was perhaps the worst in the film as he wasn't only racist, but a cop who broke serious laws in accepting bribery from a corrupt city official, who worked for the passively racist Brendan Fraser character - that constituted a conspiracy based on racism; theirs.No, come to think of it, the most vile character in the film was the Asian man who was buying and selling other Asians. That has to be about as bad as it can get. Those were followed closely by racists such as the characters played by Loretta Devine and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges. One of the few characters who were close to ""normal"" was Cameron, played by Terrence Howard, whose performance was worth the rental price along with that of Dillon. Howard even manages to extract a degree of sympathy in a film overflowing with unsympathetic characters.As for remainder of the film, the overall production quality was better than I expected from a ""low budget"" film. In retrospect I think it was worth the rental price but not the Academy Awards it seemed to steal from a group of much better quality films.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Compelling, but ultimately unrealistic","On Oscar night, I do not think anyone was not at least slightly surprised that Brokeback Mountain lost Best Picture to Crash. Both were good films, but Crash, a crazy ensemble film, winning Best Picture? It seemed like a long shot going into the competition, but it managed to pull it off, and grabbed up Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay in the process. I managed to see Crash before Brokeback, and really enjoyed it, but even with some of it's problems, I still feel that Brokeback deserved the award.Crash chronicles the lives of various individuals over the span of two days, and how their lives and stories intertwine through violence and racism. The ensemble cast, including Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Matt Dillon (the only Oscar nomination amongst the cast), Thandie Newton, Sandra Bullock, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Ryan Phillippe, along with many others, bring the story to life, and are all given a very ample amount of time to prove their worth in the full scheme of the story.I was mesmerized by most of Crash as I watched it. The acting was great from almost everyone. These are actors playing real characters, and not cardboard cut-outs. Yes, a few members of the cast (like Bullock, Howard and Dillon) are nowhere near as good as others (like Cheadle, Bridges and Phillippe). And unfortunately, some of the great performances are overshadowed because of the need for some form of equal time on the screen for all of the actors. And for that reason, only one of the actors managed to pull off an Oscar nomination, which easily could have turned into numerous nominations if some of the other stronger actors had a chance to shine more. No one said being in an ensemble cast was easy and rewarding.The gritty feel of the film also added to the authenticity that the film contributes. Even though Paul Haggis is a Canadian, I will be damned if I do not contend that he paints a great picture of Los Angeles. His great screen writing talent only becomes better as a result of his excellent directing. His co-written words emanate throughout the entire production, and make for a hell of a greatly made film.But, even with us living in racist times, the question of just how racist everyone is really comes to mind. This film paints a picture of everyone in a city being totally racist. Some fight against it, but cannot help but turn out to be just as racist as the next person. But how realistic is that sentiment? I know for a fact that a lot of people are tolerant of others and their culture, so how is it fair to make it seem like everyone is racist? Had Haggis and Co. made some of the cast a lot more tolerant, the film would only become even more realistic than it is. At the point they left it at, it just really feels half-baked and incomplete. It feels weak in these instances, and it really does take away from the feeling the film has when it finishes.If Brokeback had its boring points sparked with fabulous performances, Crash has problems with its realism. It wants to be totally real in its creation, but the way it ends up being painted just is not. Crash is a great film, but it is one who is unworthy of the Best Picture prize.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good drama with a very distorted view on racism,"If everybody in the real world would act the way they did in ""Crash"" then we really are in big trouble. I understand that it is custom in movies to exaggerate in order to make a point. But the way they handled the issues in the movie made me quite sick. Everything was to the extreme and not realistic. The scene where the shop owner Farhad refuses to listen to the locksmith (Pena) because he thinks he tries to cheat him is a good illustration of that. It even gets more ridiculous when he doesn't acknowledge that he was responsible himself for not having the door fixed and blames Pena for ruining his business. The fact that he feels so strongly about this that he wants to kill him is something that doesn't make any sense. If people would act like this then we would have anarchy on our hands. All the characters in ""Crash"" seem to be occupied with the race issue every single minute of their lives. While that can be true for some that certainly is not depicting a realistic view. If racism in real life was as clear cut as in the movie then it would have been very easy to deal with it. But in real life racism is much more complicated and subtle. There are only a few who openly admit that they are racist and dare to speak up in public. The majority of the people do it behind people's backs and never say the things like some of the characters have said in the movie. At least not directly. Sure they would think it or tell another what they thought. But most people probably don't even realize that they are guilty of making racist comments. And that is where the real problem lies. I do think that ""Crash"" has some redeeming values. Some of the performances are truly excellent. And there were more than enough scenes that were moving. The moving scenes and the stellar performances make this a movie worth seeing. However I do hope that in future that a movie will be made that actually shows how racism works in real life.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Good solid movie, but didn't deserve best picture.","Now don't get me wrong... this is a great movie, and I am in no way saying it is over-exaggerating the problems of prejudice in big cities like LA.I'm just saying it could have been much better. Starting with the pros: It was a good script, with good directing and good cinematography. It held my interest from beginning to end, and there were several tear-jerking emotional scenes in there. ""Crash"" also had it's fair share of (incredibly) dark humor which leave you amused yet horrified at the same time. And now on to the cons... One huge problem in this movie was the casting. In several cases, the quieter, calmer scenes were over-acted, which made what might have been great lines unbelievable. The actors themselves are not bad at all, but they felt a little awkward in these specific roles. If the casting were a bit better, there would have been just one more problem for the movie, which is... subtlety. (of which this film has none) With all movies, there is a message that is trying to be conveyed. In great movies like Slumdog Millionaire, The Wall, and Doubt, the message is very subtle, as opposed to painfully obvious and screaming off the screen. The entire message of this movie was ""Racist people live in Los Angeles"", and it felt like that message was being shoved down my throat through a funnel that was way too small. Call me crazy, but this blatant preaching is a big pet peeve of mine in movies. So my overall consensus: A great movie, but there were others that should have gotten best picture over it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A waste of good acting.,"As a Mexican-American born and raised in the Los Angeles area, I thought this film was shallow and very small in scope. The message I got was ""everyone in L.A. is racist and corrupt."" The storyline was predictable and contrived -- not far from being a soap-opera. I mean, give me a break -- L.A. has a dense population, and yet these characters seem to keep running into each other in a matter of two-three days? I go weeks -- maybe months -- without bumping into people I know -- go figure! Furthermore, it was not truly representative of the cultural mosaic of Los Angeles; where were the Jewish and gay communities in all of this? They are two extremely large communities, and yet it was as if they didn't exist. Hmmm... what does that say about the person who wrote this screenplay? Interesting. Overall,it was a mediocre film. They could have simply removed the cursing and nude scene and aired it on the LIFETIME channel. Not Oscar worthy, in my opinion.",,Anonymous,Crime
If only people would learn before they erred...........,"I hated the initial chunk of the movie as purely racist only to gradually segue to grow with it and become an extra 113 minutes older chronologically and maybe a 113 years mentally. They should prescribe ""Crash"" as textbook for learners from all disciplines. A pleasantly composed soundtrack helps keep the heat on the harrowing travails of a bunch of irregular characters mapped together by co-incidence. This movie is fitting testimony to the fact that a stereotyped image clouds all perception albeit unprejudiced. You couldn't influence a head in a coin toss, neither can you influence the manifestation of your better side.If only people would learn earlier........ Ah well !

"Beyond race, it's about humanity.","Good pacing. Smart AND intelligent. Stark with some successful attempts at subtlety. It's very real but I couldn't shake away the feeling that it's all contrived. Not recommended for people who want tightly packaged stories with actual ""endings"". Well done loose ends, and I mean that in a positive tone. Not recommended for people at risk for Don Cheadle overdose. Brendan Fraser has come a very long way from George of the Jungle.Characterization of a group of individuals is always difficult in a movie. Shallow projects are your sterile, inhuman or superhero films like The Brady Bunch, X-men, LXG, Hellboy and don't forget Captain Planet & The Planeteers. Although, I enjoyed The Addams Family & Values immensely. At worst, everyone is stereotyped. This happens in cheap horror flicks especially annoying in the comedy-horror-teenage genre, and absolutely abhorring in spoof trash.BUT.When effort is placed in the details, when actors don't act like stars and when directors differentiate between reality and commercialism, when a movie is done with just the right amount of human depth, a drizzling of contradiction, a dash of irony and a wide spectrum of attitude... you get a very intellectually stimulating slice of life in less than 2 hours of technology-mediated performance art. The good ones are Identity, The Usual Suspects, St. Elmo's Fire, and a surprising Brit film Love Actually.Crash makes the list. It makes very strong statements about people that leave you tired. It shows you different personalities who clash and yet the movie effectively breaks away from tradition and allows the audience to identify with any single person in the movie. It is all so complicated. Just like in real life. Everyone has different roles to play. I am both protagonist and antagonist, both victim and guilty. I am a friend, a stranger, a relative, a customer, a significant other, and everything else in between. The movie shows everyone isn't all bad or all good. At some point in your life, you have to choose between good and better, between bad and worse, between instinct and emotion, between pride and more pride, between who you want to be and who you think you are. In the end, the insanely circular mystery that gets me is that even though each individual is different, we are all still human... and though we may all have the same needs, what we do to fulfill those needs are the things that make life so exciting.Race-related themes bore me, but Crash goes beyond racism. It's not about race, it's about CONFLICT. And, the main reason why most conflicts end ugly is that we let our emotions settle them. I am not saying we should ignore or stop our emotions, no. I think that we should go beyond our instincts, acknowledge our feelings and work on our common goals. The beauty of the film is that it does not draw the line between good and evil. In fact, it removes the concept of these two poles and paints society in indistinct hues with dynamic contrasts. When do you lose your dignity? How can you compromise your values? Do you ever really know what you are capable of doing until you do them? Too many questions, even more possible answers. I can't wait to discuss this movie with someone who's been there, done that and is wanting for more.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tasteless,"This film is quite interesting for several reasons, and I can understand why it won the Oscar for ""Best Film"" in 2006: its a film that combines several stories around a theme that was relevant that year: racism and prejudice. ""Crash"" is a film with more merit than it looks, although it went unnoticed through the theaters then.The script joins a series of isolated stories and sub-plots around a single theme: prejudice. In the film, this is the ""leitmotiv"" that unites all the stories, making the plot very difficult to describe succinctly. The characters are not connected, but they get to know each other through casual situations, which could happen to ourselves: going to a store, repairing a lock, stealing a car, a routine police stop. Its necessary to pay attention, and even so I guarantee that many intentional details will go unnoticed.Another important detail is the quality of the dialogues. There is no politically correct. The language is crude, although it does not use profanity or slang. The way it affects the characters is genuine and we can put ourselves in their shoes. About this, its a film that can be quite hard to endure, especially for those who have been through situations of prejudice. Of course, its an admittedly militant film with some moralizing edge, given that it tries to convey an anti-racist message and defend this, but the cinema is full of militant films and I think this will only displease seriously those who oppose that more fiercely. Personally, I handled it very well.Although it has a carefully selected cast, with some big names, we cannot say that there is a protagonist. Everyone is a protagonist in the story that concerns them. Personally, I liked the performance of Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe in the role of two very different policeman; Don Cheadle wears the skin of an investigator; Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser gave us characters from the white elite; Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard were also excellent in the role of rich and successful black people; Larenz Tate and Ludacris are good at the two outcasts; the film also features the excellent performances of Michael Peña, Bahar Soomekh, Loretta Devine, Jennifer Esposito, Howard Fong and Shaun Toub. Of course, given the theme, many of the characters - not to say almost all - will have attitudes that will displease us, but they were thought like that.Technically, the film has one of the best editing works I've seen in a long time: despite the intricate plot and mix of stories, everything is logical and in the right place, justifying the Oscar for Best Editing that it also received. The film runs at a very pleasant pace too, without wasting time. But its basically just that! The film conveys the feeling of having been thought for TV and is marked by uninteresting technical elements: a regular cinematography, sets and costumes and an almost atonal soundtrack. Technically, its a film that I would compare to food without salt: it has no flavor.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Touching and tragic, this is an absolute must-see for anyone who even remotely wonders just what the hell is happening to our society as we move into the 21st century.

On the other hand, the ending didn't really connect all the dots and have that aha moment. I understood it, just didn't really love it.

One Of The Greatest Movies Of Our Time,"Crash, directed by Million Dollar Baby writer Paul Haggis, is one of the greatest movies of our time and is in my Top 20 list. Crash really makes you think of how different cultures/races are treated by by everyone. Constant wars are plaguing us today and this movie really helps me see why these wars have started and it really makes me think about how we NEED tolerance in society if were going to live in peace. This movie sends the message of, it doesn't matter what colour you are or where you come from or who you worship. We are all humans and we need to tolerate each other.Crash has one of the best casts I have ever seen. Actors like Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe, Thandie Newton and Ludicrous all lend their talents to make this movie an unforgettable experience.The plot follows the lives of a group of people including a cop, a movie producer, a politician and two street crims, in Los Angelas in the 24 hours that leads up to a car crash that will link them all...This movie is really an unforgettable experience. The performances are flawless. Bullock and Fraser are great as the rich married couple, Newton is great as the sexually abused wife of a scared movie director and Dillon is very good as the cop struggling with life. I'm not surprised if any of these gets nominated for an Oscar, they all deserve it.The movies main moral/message is tolerance of other cultures. This may seem clichéd and boring but Paul Haggis has done a great job at making this a great, original piece of cinematic brilliance that needs to win a lot of Oscars.

"The diverse cast delivers, the plot unfortunately doesn't","Paul Haggis' two-hour episodic film shocked everyone at the 2006 Academy Awards when it won the top prize for Best Picture against the more highly rated Brokeback Mountain. Since that controversy, the thriller hasn't aged too well and is considered the biggest mistake in Academy history. Over the course of 48 hours, Crash follows fifteen residents of the US metropolis Los Angeles who have different social statuses. But they all have one thing in common: they are perpetrators and victims of widespread xenophobia, institutional racism and sexual assault.As ambivalent as the film's plot may be, its broad-based ensemble is convincing all along the line. Each of the fifteen actors has his or her own story, which is told over many longer and shorter sequences. Particularly ambiguous is that of Matt Dillon's character Sergeant John Ryan. Actually a cold-blooded racist and obvious woman-molester, in private he is a son who cares for his sick father. He is aware of his cruelty and it seems as if he doesn't know any other way to help himself. The same is true of Ryan Phillippe as Officer Tom Hanson, a young police officer who at first doesn't understand his partner's actions towards black-skinned people before becoming prejudiced against this group himself. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton, as an elite black couple, show what a traumatic event can do to you. They are seen in the most upsetting and volatile scenes, acting with great emotion and visible desperation. Chris Bridges and Don Cheadle are seen in very different roles, one keeping his head above water with criminal activities, while the other is a detective struggling with white supremacy in his profession and additional family problems. Although they never meet directly, the two have more in common than one might think. Michael Pena is protective as a family man struggling to make ends meet as a handyman in wealthy households and is the highlight of the film in one particular scene. Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser are an upper-class couple who, in all their self-absorption, experience moral lessons.First of all, it has to be said that Paul Haggis has good intentions with this film. He wants to present people with a realistic picture of the social situation in the USA, in which racism is clearly at the forefront, especially in connection with police violence. Other serious issues such as xenophobia, sexism and crime are also very much in focus. It doesn't read badly on paper, it just fails in its realisation. Without Haggi's handsome direction and the film's beautiful imagery, Crash would only be a below-average film. Some scenes are problematic and morally indefensible in the slightest. People are portrayed in a good light even though they don't deserve it. In addition, there is a lack of realism, which is an absolute necessity in a film with this theme. A stringing together of events in which all the characters at once demonstrate a connection? It may do justice to an episodic film, but that doesn't really add up to anything. Crash is a pretentious film that, despite a good premise and a fitting ensemble, has misconstrued its aim.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Wildy over-rated, contrived, lots of noise","There were a few exciting, tense vignettes between the characters of ""Crash"" but there were also some tendentious, heavy, hackneyed things that really stood out: Don Cheadle's voice-over, ostensibly deep (the voice of conscience in the film), Sandra Bullock's hugging her maid towards the end of the film and confessing to her that she (the maid) was actually her best friend, the really quite sappy Latino whose gets killed when trying to save her father (the ""red-cloak"" piece of malarkey), the condescending treatment of Asians (especially the atrociously accented Korean woman at the beginning), the long sequence involving Brendan Fraser in the courtroom (it didn't seem relevant and was slow, the Terrence Howard/Thandie Newton confrontation (a lot of sparks but not really that compelling except for the melodrama), and so on. That the Matt Dillon turns to the Ryan Phillipe character when they break-up as a police team, ""You think you know who you are but you don't have any idea, et. al."" is gratuitous. Like so many lines in this film, it comes out of nowhere.Not subtle, not a work of art, but plenty of adrenaline and action around a hot-button issue. Which is probably why less sophisticated, younger movie-goers (I just can hear them saying ""Really cool, man, it'so SO-O deep"") seem to have gone for this film. Most critics apart from Ebert and a few others were very lukewarm, if not downright very critical about this film. Believe me, it doesn't hold a candle and is definitely not in the same category as ""La Strada,"" ""Gosford Park,""...or last year's exceptional ""Brokeback Mountain."" Three much better films with superior screenplays/plot-lines, and character development are ""L.A. Confidential,"" ""Mullholland Drive,"" and ""Chinatown.""Dialogue clichés, lots of high-speed car chases, clichéd-characters, lots of movie-stars doing uncharacteristically small turns, and Hollywood's favorite liberal subject matter (racism) are a recipe for Hollywood acclaim and middlebrow American audience approval. This film made only about 33% of its receipts from outside the U.S., a pretty weak showing. ""Brokeback Mountain""'s receipts overseas accounted for more than its domestic grosses.That it won the Oscar is NOT that surprising when such middling fare as ""Beautiful Mind"" (pure schlock except for Russell Crowe's acting). ""Gladiator,"" ""Braveheart,"" etc. won.(This is definitely the last time I'll even pay attention to the Oscars).At ""Crash"" at least breaks the stereotype that all African-Americans are an unfairly persecuted, noble minority.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

Has it moments but too far from being perfect,"I had a strange feeling after the Crash. While everything seemed to be in place, the whole thing didn't deliver to it's promise. It took me days to realize what was wrong.Most of reviews adore performance by leading actors. Doubt it. Bullock? A few scenes to play a stereotypical heroine. Fraser? Nothing at all. Not their fault. Being so crowded with people, the script left almost no space to act for the most of the cast. The best performance actually comes from those who obtained the air in the script (TV director, his wife, corner shop owner).The essence of the movie is too simplistic. Good people could turn bad, bad people could still be good. Now try to tell the essence of Magnolia in brief, it will take much more lines and time.The mentioned conversions in Crash took place in pretty binary manner. Bad cop converts almost at once, which is looking to be not justified properly. Yes, there are reasons behind, but they are too difficult to figure out given with plethora of heroes and stories. Again the movie would have really benefited if the script was less packed. Compare with 21 grams.The most impressing scene with the child and the gun worked fine (I cried) but this move is not a revelation. Check Shyamalan's Unbreakable, where the same scene delivers to the top thanks to the slow and accurate developing towards it.Anti-racist face-slapping, personal drama, problem of authority possession, family drama  Haggis packed too many themes in one script. The only thing it probably misses for real is a drop of self-irony. That pre-final scene with the storm of ash heavily reminds of the frog rain from Magnolia, which was that only and necessary drop. Crash is taking itself far more serious, which is not making it wittier.Too many loose ends. If they followed that 2-minute discussion about Iraqi fireman nomination it wouldn't look so artificial. Did they finally change the locks in attorney house after that 4-minute rumble? Why showing in detail all that facial expressions by his unnecessary black female assistant? If Cambodians in LA was an effort to borrow some ironic finale from Magnolia it didn't work as well.OK, enough grumbling. Actually I gave 7 stars to Crash, which means I rather liked it.What's really captivating in Crash is that it deals with sensitive racial issues in sincere and straightforward manner. What others would hide in politically correct wordings Haggis takes naturalistic. For the first 20 minutes (before style flickering starts) Haggis even takes over Manderlay by Von Trier. Some parts are really great piece of screen writing and directing  I'm still under impression of that silent scene with parallel inner conversation by TV director and the shop owner. Episode with body search was really strong and precise. The less worked better again, which unfortunately applies not to the whole movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best movies i've seen...,"I saw this movie last night after the Oscar Ceremony. I've seen the ceremony live on TV here in Ialy and i was eager to see the ""Best Movie of the Year"". Well, ""Crash"" is surprisingly good, a masterpiece about human feelings, and we all know how human feelings are ignored in these days. There's a good and an evil side in every one of us and sometimes it's necessary to ""crash"" into something to see who we really are. The cast is great, there's not a leading role in anyone of the actors, but everyone does his job in a perfect way. In the movie we can see different people, living different lives, and then they'll come ""crash"" together in a melting pot of situations, guilty and redemption, racism and love, but in the end everyone must fight his own demons.In conclusion, this is really a great movie, everyone must see that and enjoy this rare example of fine cinematography.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Anyone else find this movie annoying?,"OK, so I registered with IMDb just to voice my opinion. I regularly use IMDb to decide what movies to see and have never seen ratings this high for such a transparent and contrived movie.The world portrayed in the film is *NOT* the world that I live in. That is not to say that I am ignorant of the discrimination that exists, it's just that I don't live in fear of being held at gunpoint, robbed, molested, or having the keys to my locks sold. I don't think being rich, being poor, or having a tattoo says anything about an individual except that they have money, don't have money, or have permanent ink on their arm. So I found this movie annoying because it tries to open your eyes to the racist world we live in. I don't live in this world, I'm sorry if you do and I'm even more sorry if you found this movie particularly profound or insightful.I gave the movie a 6 for good acting and unique cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"a wonderful profile of society, made possible with brilliant writing, direction, and acting.","'Crash' blew me away after I saw it the first time. I was still blown away the second time I watched it. And the third. And, you guessed it, the fourth. Just 17, I had never really bothered with films that weren't Spider-Man, X-Men, or Harry Potter, until 2005. Then I saw 'Crash', this incredible motion picture from Paul Haggis. Seeing this movie woke me up in every aspect of life, including my outlook on life, race, and the hardships of living. The movie focuses on several characters, with near perfect performances from the cast, which consists of: Oscar Nominee Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Ryan Phillippe, Oscar Nominee Terrence Howard, Oscar Nominee Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, William Fichtner, Michael Pena, Brendan Fraser, Larenz Tate, and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges.The film, as you probably know, is about how the lives of all these people, their stories, if you will, intertwine over one 36 hour period in Los Angeles. All of their stories will CRASH together because of racial issues, corruption, or other things. A movie full of twists and turns, it will seem a little confusing at first, but at about the 1 and a quarter hour mark, it will all make sense, and that confusion will be replaced with understanding of why and how that particular event occurred.This is the mark of the excellent directing of Paul Haggis (writer of Million Dollar Baby) and the fantastic cast (especially Bullock, Howard, Bridges, and Dillon) right here: during the movie, you will feel as if you are not watching a movie about the characters, but getting a look into the lives of these 11 people, because it is so well-acted and well-directed that you won't be able to tell a difference. The picture's Oscar nominated song (Bird York's 'In The Deep') best describes it: when you first hear the song, it's like it doesn't know what it wants to be. Should it be a dramatic song, a tragic song, or a romantic song? The movie is the same way. At the beginning, the character's do not know who they are and what they are doing, but by the ending, each one of them will have undergone a transformation that leaves them knowing exactly who they are and why they are where they are. It is so incredibly powerful, that more than one scene can bring you to tears, but at the same time, sarcastic one-liner's are thrown in to keep the mood right.Never before has an ensemble cast been this good, and while Dillon's Oscar nomination was nice, I believed that Sandra Bullock and Terrence Howard should have gotten one as well. Dillon is the best out of all, however, and I think he represented the entire cast at the Oscars. We get a surprising turn from Bullock, who has never really been taken seriously in movies before, but she is wonderful in this. Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges breaks the mold as a 'rapper-turned-actor'. He is just an actor. His performance is so convincing that you'll forget that he's a rapper. In fact, he even makes a joke about how bad hip-hop music is at one point. Terrence Howard was not only Oscar worthy in MTV's Sundance Stud, 'Hustle & Flow', but he was fantastic in Crash as a man who is unstable with his wife after an 'episode' with a police officer (you'll see), and another 'dispute' with a man (once again, you'll see). Ryan Phillippe also turns in a nice performance, as do Larenz Tate and William Fichtner in supporting roles. Don Cheadle's character is probably what you'd call the main character, as most of the intersecting events do affect him, even though he isn't present at all of them. Once again, he does a great job of reminding you of what a screen presence he is. The biggest surprise of the movie to me was Michael Pena. I had never seen him before, and was moved by his performance as well. Pena's character is probably the only truly good and moral character in the entire movie.Paul Haggis wrote and directed this film (written with assistance from Bobby Moresco), and he accomplished the goal that I'm sure was this film's: let the audience know that sometimes, the world isn't always perfect, and people are affected by actions as little telling your daughter about an imaginary impenetrable cloak. This is a movie you will remember forever, and I'm sure you'll spread the word. It deserved the Best Picture Oscar it won.Just remember: Moving at the speed of life, we are bound to collide with each other.10/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Should have won an Emmy not an Oscar,"This movie has polarised opinion from those who believe it to be a masterful and seminal depiction of petty racism in today's America, and those who believe it is stereotypical, badly scripted nonsense. Really, it cannot be said to be that bad - but is it really 'Best Film' good? I rented Crash after Oscar night because, like most others given its Box-office gross, it had passed me by in the cinema. This was the film smart enough to outrun Brokeback mountain in the final furlong of the awards season. On what basis, has to be asked. Script, performances, message? All of which could be expected from a network special - although Sandra Bullock has not been reduced to doing TVMs yet so is, here, reassuringly dreadful as an L.A. W.A.S.P bitch. Otherwise, it's a mildly diverting set of story strands set in present day L.A expressed in the not wholly original terms of agitated Persian immigrants, poor latinos, misguided youths, alienated whites, corrupted cops and middle class blacks struggling against tacit racism and their own sense of inferiority. All of are markedly familiar, but in the context of 'Crash' put into a stew and stirred up with some dubious coincidences mixed into the plot. There are moments of tension, pathos (admittedly verging on rank sentimentalism) and humour but nothing revelatory or 'pushing the envelope' of racial depiction as some admirers suggest. Nor, indeed is the portmanteau format of interveawing stories in Los Angeles in itself original.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

It works; but in such a manipulative manner that I couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted,"The directorial debut of Oscar nominated Million Dollar Baby screenwriter Paul Haggis, Crash takes a close-up look at the lives of a dozen or so Los Angeles citizens over one 36- hour span, and how, when ""pushed to the limit"", each of these characters will reveal their suppressed prejudice and racism. It is a picture that would really love to be important. It would really love to preach the good word about racism and tolerance in contemporary times, but sadly, it ultimately fails. In an attempt to assert the importance of Crash's message to the masses, Haggis here has taken himself too seriously and the result is quite the opposite: it's a little laughable.I couldn't help but feel like I was being beaten over the head with the film's message every ten minutes; such is the unnatural, repetitive nature of Haggis screenplay. There is a scene mid-way through the film where two policemen are discussing a crime which may have been racially motivated, and the white policeman spurts, ""f**kin' black people, huh?"" which almost makes one throw his hands in the air and give up. It's abrupt, ridiculous, and absolutely not the way anybody would naturally react in such a situation. In another instance, a white woman (Sandra Bullock) begins shouting racial slurs about the untrustworthiness of the Latino locksmith (Michael Pena) who's doing her a service, but - here's the kicker - she chooses to do so in the immediate vicinity of the Latino locksmith. Crash is littered with these contrived moments, seemingly written to force characters into situations of racial tension to remind the audience that the film is, in fact, about racism and tolerance (as if by some god-forsaken chance we'd forget!).Crash is not without it's positives, however. The majority of the ensemble cast do their earnest best with an average script, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges (whose every second word is something ludicrous about black people being mistreated by white people) aside. Matt Dillon gives probably the film's best performance, capturing the struggle and frustration of his situation with believability and conviction, and opposite him, Thandie Newton was superb.In addition to the good performances, Crash's second act does have two quite powerful sequences: the first involving a collision, both literal and metaphorical, between Dillon's and Newton's characters and the second involving the 5-year old daughter of the Latino locksmith who apparently has devastated a Persian store owner. Not surprisingly, these two situations are some of the more removed from Haggis' subject matter of race in Crash, dealing instead with issues like sexual harassment and a parent's inherent desire to protect their children. Of Million Dollar Baby's calibre this is not, but while I don't doubt Haggis' good intentions for this film, I do indeed doubt his execution.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Overrated,"This film has been entirely overrated. Viewing it with high hopes will certainly disappoint.The cast is excellent, and although the performances are quite good, the story itself is so riddled with preposterous racism and negativity, the movie as a whole becomes forced, frustrating, and highly predictable.Character development is polarized, making each sequence more predictable than the next. Dramatic scenes become almost ridiculous as these polarized characters are forced to clash. Everything to the extreme; in Crash there is no middle ground. While the film intends to shock the audience with the reality of racism and prejudice, it forgets that life itself, be it in LA or Kansas City, is not so divided, and not so grim. Yes, we all live in our separate worlds, with our own history, and our own lives, but we certainly do not throw down the gauntlet when confronted with differences. A world like this would be chaos, and contrary to popular belief we do not live in a world of chaos.Other outstanding reviews beg the question, do people really think this is the way life is? Sad. I can see now why Nicholson was so shocked to read ""Crash"" in the Best Picture envelope.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"I'm Not Okay, You're Not Okay","In Paul Haggis's Crash, people are neither good nor evil, but merely stressed-out. The film is a morality play for the era of Dr. Phil; the characters are placed in morally dicey situations by their inability to develop coping skills. In one scene, a racially insensitive cop, played by Matt Dillon (good to know he's still breathing), gets a little too hands-on with the wife (Thandie Newton) of a TV director (Terrence Howard) he's pulled over; his failure to control his impulses at this juncture has something to do with his frustration over his father's illness, and the way he's treated by the secretary at his HMO (the secretary is black, and so are the director and his wife). But this doesn't necessarily make Dillon a bad guy. In a later scene, Dillon rescues Newton from a burning car despite the danger to his own life. Duality of man anyone?Haggis' point is only-too-obvious: most people are neither good nor bad by nature, but are the product of their circumstances, and are therefore capable of great heroism as well as great ugliness. Dillon takes advantage of Newton because the opportunity presents itself, because being a cop has made him arrogant, because his outrage at being mistreated by a black woman makes him feel justified in taking out his anger at another black woman (such is the essence of racism). But when he climbs inside the crashed car and finds Newton there, a completely different, self-sacrificing impulse overtakes him. At no other time during Crash does the film become so thematically crystalline. We're all in this together, Paul Haggis is saying, whether we want to admit it or not. It makes no difference that we tend to snipe at each other, to be overcome by racial paranoia, to assert ourselves out of a sense of authority or privilege, or just plain everyday pissiness.The film makes a huge point of humanity's interconnectedness; the plot is essentially a series of unlikely, but thematically necessary, coincidences and chance encounters. Terrence Howard, having been made to feel vulnerable, unmanly and, what's worse, unblack by his wife's mistreatment, is driven to confront a pair of car-jackers, the eminently black Larenz Tate and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, the very same wise-cracking thugs who previously jacked a car belonging to D.A. Brendan Fraser and his frantic wife Sandra Bullock, the latter of whom hires a locksmith, Michael Pena, to install new locks in the house, etc., The result of these narrative acrobatics is a film that can often seem blurry in the short-term, but has a focus, a sense of purpose that asserts itself in the long-run. There are undeveloped characters all over the place, situations that seem like they could be interesting but go nowhere, performances that have no chance to acquire shading, yet the movie rises above these shortcomings. Director Paul Haggis has woven his situations together fluidly, and achieved a sometimes electrifying sense of urgency. The pieces may sometimes seem irrelevant by themselves, but they all fit into the mosaic, and contribute to the sense of building meaning.That being said, there's still a nagging sense of smallness to the proceedings. Maybe it's just the way the movie is structured; despite Haggis's proficiency, his ability to weave the different threads together, the movie can't quite get past feeling like highlights from a mini-series. Crash is like something that played on HBO once, and they cut it into pieces and stitched them together into a movie. One wishes the story had more room to breathe. What would happen if we got to know more about characters like Fraser's D.A., or Bullock's harried wife-of-the-D.A., or Don Cheadle's police detective? Each character plays their role in the larger drama, but something is lost by the lack of elaboration. Vital material seems missing from Crash, which is why, for all its thematic gravity, its hum, it ends up feeling like an exercise in clever plot mechanics and not an organic piece of storytelling. It's not a morality play in the way a Dardenne Brothers film is; it doesn't achieve the sense of uplift that Rosetta does, or La Promesse. It doesn't have the rawness of a Ken Loach portrayal of small people crushed by forces beyond their control. It's a commercial morality play (even if it's technically an indie). It's plot-heavy, and we're a little overly aware of the stars (it's hard to look at Sandra Bullock and not think, ""Somebody's fishing for indie cred.""). None of this makes the movie bad; in fact, it's pretty good. But it's good in a certain limiting way, a way that doesn't allow tendrils of meaning to branch off from the central conceit, that doesn't encourage a real sense of complexity. It feels like a big-time movie, and has some real dramatic high-points, but it's a little bit of a smoke and mirrors job. There's something to Crash, just not as much as there could've been.",,Anonymous,Crime
A Powerful Exploration of Prejudice and Understanding,"""Crash"" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that explores the complexities of race, prejudice, and human relationships in modern-day Los Angeles. The talented cast delivers standout performances, particularly Sandra Bullock and Matt Dillon, who bring nuance and depth to their characters. The film's interwoven stories of various characters effectively highlight the ways in which our actions and beliefs impact those around us, often in unexpected ways. The direction is strong and effective, with a focus on realism and a keen eye for capturing the gritty, urban setting of Los Angeles. The cinematography is well done, but with a few scenes lacking the same level of impact as others. The soundtrack is solid and serves the film well, but doesn't stand out as particularly memorable.

Good story but hindered by 'style',"I really wanted this movie to be better than it was. It had all the right elements  great dialog, clever situation, some good to really wonderful acting, good story line  but the sadness is that the director want a 'style' and that 'style' did not work. Like ""Miami Vice"" very few recall the stories but all recall the pastels and unshaven faces, ""Crash"" tried to capture the seedy part of Los Angeles, not by filming the grit but used technology to make everything gritty looking.It's a good film. Following the same story type as ""Go"" or ""Magnolia"" it is a fascinating story of interwoven lives and how we all touch each other eventually. It uses the same basic theme that all conflict is a statement of prejudice and it is a roller coaster of emotions, some honest, come contrived. The cast is simply wonderful.

Not a bad ensemble piece but not Best Picture material,"""Crash"" tells the intertwining stories of several Los Angeles residents as their lives are touched by racism in various ways. Some are victims, some are perpetrators, all are changed by their experiences.One thing that I will say about the story is that it throws subtlety out the window. I found it painfully obvious who I was supposed to sympathize with. There are no 'gray' characters, only black and white. Then, throughout the course of the film everyone learns some sort of blatant 'life lesson' and is usually the better for it.At least the cast is an excellent one with several fine performances from talented individuals like Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Michael Peña and Matt Dillon. There were a couple of questionable casting choices but for the most part the acting was well above average.Haggis's direction wasn't bad but I'm struggling to recall anything at all about it that made it stand out. Similarly, I can't recall even a single piece of music from the film, so that area obviously didn't make any sort of impression on me.While this film beat ""Brokeback Mountain"" for the Best Picture of 2005 I think that that was a huge mistake.

"powerful, truthful, honest, accurate","One reviewer said that 'societies stereotypes' were effecting peoples judgments. He missed the whole point of the movie. If that is what the movie said this would be just another Hollywood blasé movie about 'racism', which in itself just rehashes old stereotypes, usually about white people (All in the Family).No, the power of this movie is that it shows that there is VALIDITY TO THE STEREOTYPES. And people suffer from these truths, they get robbed by a black guy, or cheated by an Asian, or find out the Russians next door are the new mafia. These stereotypes AREN'T created ex nihilo, out of nothing. They start out with a foundation of fact.So there is a foundation of evil truth. This evil is then compounded when people who are EXCEPTIONS to the STEREOTYPE try to make their way in the world. They have a chip on their shoulder that is compounded by their own clumsy efforts to throw that chip off and others who mistake them for the stereotype. These are the true victims of racism in society  the exceptions.The only true universal truths in the movie are: 1) there is good and bad in everyone and the bad is valid  as is the good. 2) the Universe is arbitrary or, as the Bible put it, the rain falls on the good and evil alike.The movie itself demonstrates its greatness by inspiring discussion like this. I am sure there will be viewers who disagree with my viewpoint  passionately. Great! That shows what a great picture this is.If you're sick to death about 'racism' and automatically tune out when the subject comes up (and many people are fed up) don't let that stop you from seeing this movie. Its not the usual Hollywood stereotype of 'all white people bad, everyone who's not white is good'. It is an honest look at race in America (and refreshing at that) and our society today. Not the simple, one dimensional 'white man bad' type of film of the past. Because of that, because of its unflinching and honest look at the truth, it has power.Besides its courageous look at racial truth, what also makes this film succeed is that artistically it is a triumph.

There is Don Cheadle, Matt Dillion, Brendan Fraser, Sandra Bullock, Ryan Philippe, Ludicrous, Larenz Tate, Thandie Newton, and Terrance Howard who I hadn't heard of before this movie. the movie shows a bunch of races in a 24 hour period. A lot of people think that Brokeback Mountain deserved to win the best picture and even though i haven't seen that i would have to say this would be the better movie. So go and see it I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A chronicle of events when it all goes wrong.,"Everything about CRASH is woven masterfully with a beautiful cast crafted together with sublime chemistry, which often fails in movies where a lot of A-list actors are put together in one film, helped together with the right camera-work, music, and pacing.The movie entertained. It moved. It did what any good movie does. It makes one look within.Pretty honest look at how humans fail and falter, stumble and crawl just trying to get home.

Racist Trash,"Crash (2004)** (out of 4)Various characters in L.A. go through various racial situations before they all ""crash"" in the end. I'm really not sure if I should give this film a BOMB rating or four stars so I'll just settle on a two star rating. There's no denying that there's some truly remarkable stuff in this film but in the end I couldn't help but feel there wasn't any point to this movie. Black people are thugs. White people are scared of blacks for no reason. Foreigners can't speak English. Racist whites molest black women. Blacks are ashamed to be black so they act white. What the hell was all of this suppose to mean in the end? There's no doubt racism is still a thing in this world but good God this film pushes everything to the limit. I'm sitting here typing this and I really don't know what to say. I watched this movie with the girl I mentioned a few posts back and afterwards we went out to get a drink and discuss the film. She didn't know what to say either. As with the screenplay, this write up will probably be all over the place but that's where this film left my mind.I had a very hard time taking anything in this film too serious because everything is just so over the top. The racial stuff in this film are more make belief than anything we'd see in a science fiction film and I'd say even Planet of the Apes is more realistic than this thing. Writer/director Paul Haggis writes a screenplay that is constantly preaching at the viewer and hitting the viewer over their head with his ""message"", which is a message no one needs to hear. Everyone knows we shouldn't hate just because of the color of our skin. This crap was talked about with various Sidney Poitier films back in the more racist 60's so this film is doing nothing new. It's not saying anything new. Also, unlike those Poitier films, this one here doesn't work because of all the preaching.Also, I read a few reviews that said the racists are redeemed in the end making this a very positive film but I've got to laugh at this as well. Not once did I feel I was watching a movie with characters but I saw all of these characters being pulled on a string. The screenplay shows us how ugly these racist people are and in the matter of one day they are peaceful and love all races. Again, bullshit. How long has racism been a part of this world? Since Christ walked the streets, right? And now this message film is redeemed because all these racists turn the other way over a day? Another factor that really bothered me is something I hate in a lot of movies. It seems if a movie wants to be cute they get a cute little kid under the age of 5 to say a cuss word. This makes everyone in the crowd smile saying how cute it was to see a cute kid say a bad word. Talk about hypocrites but back to this film. The locksmith has a cute little daughter and the director jerks the viewer by giving her several cute little speeches, daddy tells her a cute story and then the director has us believe something bad happens to the kid. Again, just more preaching.The greatest thing about the movie is its cast, all of which deserve Oscar nominations (with the exception of Sandra Bullock). Matt Dillon really steals the show as the racist cop and Terrence Howard really caught my eye as well. Of all the redemption stories the one dealing with Dillon is the only one that works because we get to know him the best of the group even though he's one of the worst characters here. The scene with the overturned car was very powerful and the ""message"" here got across very well without having to preach.I've written the above and so far have taken three smoke breaks because I'm trying to think of more to say but can't. I really, really, really wanted to love this film but it just rubbed me the wrong way. I'm smart enough to know a white cop shouldn't molest a black woman and I don't need a film preaching to me about that. In 2005 we look back at dozens of films from the 1910s-1940s and call them racist in a bad way. I'm curious to know how people are going to look at films like this one in the year 2085.",,Anonymous,Crime
The Best I've seen in a while,"I was blown away by this movie!! I am not a seasoned film critic by any means, but I wanted to express just how much, and what I loved about this film. I loved it on so many levels. My husband and I watched it last night, and it prompted so much discussion on how people from all cultures form stereotypes of other cultures. The movie made us laugh at times, it made us cringe, cry, and wipe sweat off our brows. I was very pleased with the cast chosen, and even more pleased with the superb job they did in acting the parts I loved the no-frills raw look of the film. I really enjoyed the emotional soundtrack/score as well .Best of all...the movie made us REALLY think, and that folks is very rare these days for a motion picture to do that.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
wonderful and captivating,"I saw this movie recently, and I'm not really a ""movie person"". When I do go to the movies, I like to see worthwhile movies, and this movie lived up to it. It was touching, yet in a way as not to be predictable or cliché. It shed some light on some ""touchy"" issues that we all in some way or another are affected by (whether as a ""victim"" or simply an outsider). The movie made you really think about how we are all interconnected in some way or another, and how one's actions (although they may seem insignificant) do affect other people, and serve to either promote harmony or discord in the world. It was a wonderful portrayal of the diversity of people, and how that in itself plays out in a big city.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Basically amazing,"This movie was phenomenal. Some may think that there were not enough Asians in this racially charged film, but we must keep in mind that the Asian population is not very large in LA. Lots of really good irony, and double standards, and hypocrisy. It makes you think about your own prejudices and how deeply they can lie so you don't realize you're prejudiced. It was very emotionally charged and very affecting. You also learn about the potential for change and learning from mistakes and experiences. This is a movie than can potentially change your life.

"Good Film, But Rather Blunt","Los Angeles citizens with vastly separate lives collide in interweaving stories of race, loss and redemption.When this film came out, it was a huge success, both critically and with the general viewer. Looking back a decade later (in 2014), the reason for this is somewhat obscure. Although the film looks great, is well-directed, and has a cast with more than a dozen big names, it is hampered by some rather shoddy writing.Not five minutes go by without someone making a racist comment. Now, of course, this is the point: to show us how racism is going strong in the 21st century, and it is not just black versus white. But the way it is shown here is just so blunt that it takes away any sort of artistic merit and just makes the film a moralizing, proselytizing screed. A very good one, but still just so solidly plain.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"I have seen two Oscar favorites so far, and my own vote goes to Crash.","Brokeback Mountain, in spite of being a gay-themed film, did not move me the way Crash does.I can think of several possible reasons for this --other than the intrinsic merits of these films. In random order: The accents (I think I did not understand one-third of the dialogue) in BM, its slow pace, and the fact that I have seen enough closeted men up-close so that I look at most of them with a clinical detachment.Crash is also a tension-filled drama compared to BM's dry love story. The former leaves you with some hope, while BM leaves me, as a gay man, neither seething with anger at the homophobia (too subtle) nor does it make me cry buckets. I am not a fan of violence in film but here it was too fleeting to either hurt or outrage me (the way I was outraged by the violation of a woman's body in Crash). I would prefer the docu on the Matthew Shepard case instead.To me Crash is not just about racial prejudice but also a comment on America's gun culture. I have no knowledge about the situation in the States, but I know that enough discrimination exists on the individual level and there is enough violence involving guns to make them alive issues--they may disappear from the public radar but they do not go away. BM's flag for the gay issue is too underplayed for my liking.In India, coincidentally, at this time some cases of shootings are in the spotlight again, though unfortunately I am yet to see any debate around gun control. I am of course referring to the cases of Jessica Lal, Priyadarshini Matoo and now the latest Meher Bhargava case.It's time lawmakers and police officials made it more difficult for people to posses firearms rather than making it more tough to run places of entertainment.

Two Words,"I can describe this movie in only two words: BEST PICTURE.Since IMDb required a minimum of 10 lines in order to post a comment, I'll have to elaborate, but those two words sum up my feelings...The cast was perfect. The story was original and moving. The directing reflected a sensibility and sensitivity that is rare in cinema. The film dealt with serious social issues with a deft touch not often seen in Hollywood. All the elements fell into place beautifully. I'm sure some hot-shot film buff will come along and talk about ""holes"" in the story or some mundane issue like poor continuity or something -- because there's always that guy who likes to act like he knows something the rest of us don't -- but I can say that my first impression, having just watched the film, is that ""Crash"" is the best picture I've seen this year, hands down.

A Rusty Sledgehammer.,"Alas, here is a film mired by its excesses; one that comes so curiously close to moments of cinematic brilliance that all but embody the captivating possibilities of film-making, before disappointingly devolving backwards into a predictable, hammy and unbelievable preaching session.Predictable because it follows standards  and doesn't dare to take enough risks. Hammy because it is stiff, simple and suspiciously empty. Unbelievable because a woman is saved from an exploding car on a jam-packed LA freeway and booked into a hospital and the cop who saved her goes back to work minutes afterward and, apparently, her husband is never even notified of her accident (and, if he had been, wouldn't he have been concerned with her welfare and perhaps at least left work early to attend to her?). Later that day he is involved in a high-speed chase; the conclusion of this incident wants to impress us with its irony and depth, but the problem is that there is none. Irony is not irony when it is commanded to be so; these characters do not realistically bounce off each other as they do in Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" or Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction""  Paul Haggis' screenplay is contrived, and every time their paths cross, it isn't so much because they could cross (as in ""Pulp Fiction"")  it is because they must cross ways to service the furthering of the plot. It was irony in ""Fiction"" that the watch given to Butch was his father's saving grace and alternatively the cause of his own near-death. When the cop who sexually probed the woman ends up being her savior in ""Crash,"" it isn't irony. It's a gimmick.The film wants to challenge us, spiritually, intellectually, and emotionally  it wants to be on the edge  and it even thinks it is challenging  but in all actuality, it's very light, and the Academy's choice of awarding it Best Picture substantiates this. ""Crash"" plays it safe, too often and frustratingly so. It wants to force us into second-guessing our mentality  but this only makes it feel heavy-handed and manipulative. It proposes that people today (especially in areas such as Los Angeles) are racist  and extends this theory by proving their apparent racism through actions and dialogue  but this only works as a tool for awareness, not resolution. It worked with ""Uncle Tom's Cabin""  it opened doors for new racial policies  but that was at a time when people's eyes needed to be open. It is now the twenty-first century, and bigots and racists know who they are and embrace this fact. We don't need a warning, anymore  we need a solution, and ""Crash"" provides no solid answers.But it does have its moments  few and far between  that are stunning. (The rescue sequence, for example.) Matt Dillon gives a stellar performance, rich with depth and brimming with angst and hatred. Don Cheadle, in a similarly small role (from a cast of seemingly dozens), manages to convey exactly what the film needs in the form of a very human (and therefore very flawed) man from a shaky background who is struggling to maintain his image whilst dealing with a turbulent family situation  all of which comes to a breathtaking finale that doubles back on itself to the very beginning of the film.Yet, for a movie with the gall to proclaim it is firmly rooted in humanity and wants to expose our inherent flaws, and wants to tell us we ""don't know"" who we really are, it does little to connect with its audience  even on the most basic level. The movie is simply too silly to take seriously. There are the aforementioned moments that actually start to amount to something, and begin to captivate  but are unfortunately dragged to a halting stop whenever Haggis tries to nail the point with a sledgehammer. An example of this: Everyone is constantly referring to racism in the script; one character is a conspiracy nut that thinks windows are put on buses to showcase the blacks ""too poor"" to afford anything other than public transportation. One character to the next is having an argument dealing with racial issues  a black car thief claiming all whites are racist; a white woman ranting about blacks and Latinos; a light-skinned black woman calling her husband racial epithets; it's just one after the next, over and over; Haggis didn't need to do this. We didn't need to have the woman's feelings explained to us, explicitly, after she is unjustly probed by the bigoted police officer. Her face says it all  it elicits fear, pain, hatred, and ultimately, deep upset over her husband's fragility and lack of manhood; the actions (or lack thereof) fulfilled by a man so utterly crippled by a fear of his own ethnicity that he denies himself the most basic human rights; peer respect at the cost of humility and debasement.A better director would have stopped here. The face says it all. We don't need the rusty sledgehammer to drive the point in. Sometimes, all we need is the nail, and we can carry out the rest on our own.Note: I give this film seven stars out of ten because some of its better moments outweigh the bad. I reserve giving it a higher rating due to the reasons above, but I do want to make it clear that some parts of the film were very good, and it's a real pity that Haggis was so inconsistent with the movie and couldn't have extended the better parts into a perfect whole.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Why Crash won Academy Award over Brokeback Mountain,"Brokeback Mountain vs. CrashIn my opinion Crash won the Academy Award instead of Brokeback Mountain because it encompassed social issues that people of different races, ages, and social classes can relate to. As opposed to Brokeback Mountain, the film Crash was able to reach the audience and attain a sense of empathy. The film also allows the viewer to sympathize and connect with the characters, because there are a multitude of social issues to consider under the circumstances the film portrays. Brokeback Mountain strictly focuses on the difficulties that a homosexual couple faces during the early 60's. The time-frame covered in Brokeback Mountain itself poses as a roadblock inhibiting the audience from deeply relating to the film's content because it takes place in a distant setting. This is amplified by the fact that most of its questionable behavior(s) occurs in the mountains away from the general population. Since the early 60's, many American's frame of mind have changed and homosexual advocacy movements have made notable progress. These advances in civil rights for the homosexual community make some of the circumstances portrayed in the film irrelevant to present day and age. Crash displays a more accurate picture of present American society. Crash, successfully makes its main points: racism, prejudices, and stereotypes are still alive in the United States and affect millions daily. More importantly Crash allows the viewer to understand why these behaviors are problematic and especially conflictive for people in minority groups. Crash is a powerful film because you are able to observe the flaws, shortcomings, and weaknesses in the characters; this helps make them more realistic and humanistic. Throughout different scenes in the movie some of the characters are able to validate themselves and correct the error of their ways. This is refreshing because you are comforted by positive features of human nature. At the same time, it is eye opening because it is truthful, sincerely depicted, and believable. Because the conflict in Brokeback Mountain was centered around the hardships that the protagonists face as homosexual men, it is alienating to viewers who cannot relate or do not wish to understand the dramatic psychological, social, and emotional effects resulting from the stigma associated with homosexuality. The fact that the two characters personified rugged, ""gay"", cowboys, I found to be cliché and this made it incredibly hard to relate and understand these characters personally. To make my point I watched the film with a young heterosexual African American male; his reaction to the movie was that of repulse and un-acceptance to the film content and delivery. Like my movie-buddy, many viewers may have found themselves shutting out and away from the message that the film may have tried to deliver because it cannot be universally applied to all groups and their morals/belief systems. With no need for elaborate detail, Crash offered an accurate portrayal of present American society and applicable social issues. On any given day you can watch the news and hear about police brutality or incidents of blatant discriminatory acts and behaviors. One extraordinary example of how Crash accurately reflects American culture is through its use and depiction of Mid-Eastern characters. This is pertinent to current events because this minority group has become extremely susceptible to prejudice and discrimination in the aftermath of 9-11. I did not feel as if Brokeback Mountain was reflective of or applicable to a general population because it dealt only with homosexuality. Also, as noted earlier the plot takes place over four decades ago, making the viewer unable to relate unless they personally lived through that era. After watching both films and reading Annie Proulx's Blood on the red carpet I felt that the 78th Academy Award went to the better movie. I do not think that Brokeback Mountain's loss is attributed to people feeling uneasy about graphic illustrations of homosexual relationships and sex (although that may be a possibility nonetheless). Instead, I think that Crash was picked because it reached a broader audience and raised awareness towards racial and ethnic inequality; which is more commonly experienced and suffered throughout racial and ethnic lines. By exposing common stereotypes and prejudices it conveys the message that mass scale changes are necessary for the progress of our country and all its diverse groups of people.",,Anonymous,Crime
Conversation Starter,"This movie was completely unbelievable. We were unable to determine the outcome or the path to it. Undeniably, my husband and I live in a bi-racial world, not being completely accepted nor discarded. Yup, it feels a lot like that.This movie lets us talk to each other openly and continues the guarded conversation with our friends and family.Our friends and family only talk about it if it affects us, and not in front of anyone else, therefore keeping the status quo.

Human nature,"Crash shows all sides of human nature. In life, even when one is involved with friends, partners and siblings, it's difficult to know where one stands. I feel that Crash shows as many variations about human life as possible; prejudice, attitudes, feelings and basic life situations. Then, Paul Haggis shows the inter-relationship between each character with another. I think this is more than a cleverly directed and well written piece of work. Although, there is a meeting of characters, each individual shows a part of us that exists. All the performances are amazing despite this, the characters stand strongly intrinsically. If there is one film you see this year, it has to be Crash.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Ladies and gentleman - the Oscar goes to ""Crash""... well deserved!!!","""Crash"" was for me definitely the movie highlight of this year. It reveals a touching, thrilling story about inter cultural America, were sometimes everything seems hopeless, yet a glitter of hope always seems to shine through. The action involves a variety of persons from the most different cultural, social and family background, linked together by the coincidental streets of Los Angeles. It is interesting to view people interacting with each other without knowing what the other experiences in his daily life. A cop (Matt Dilon), whose father lost his business because of the black minority and is now very ill, has racist outbursts. A rookie (Ryan Phillipe) cannot agree with prejudice and racism, asks to change his partner, but societies public opinion about ""niggas"" gets to him and he reacts impulsive, shooting a car thief without reason. Cameron (Terrence Howard), a black movie director, is being stopped and his wife is being molested by a cop. He hesitates. He doesn't react. But his rage cumulates within, ready to burst at any moment... the list goes on.This movie describes a shaky society, dominated by prejudice, fear and confusion. The ""Land of the free"" doesn't have free citizens. They cannot free themselves from common belief without feeling guilty (Sandra Bullock) and continue living drenched in fear.An impressive movie, which makes me ask myself - why did the American Film Academy even consider giving the Oscar for best movie to ""Brokeback Mountain"", with a movie like ""Crash"" out there.

M.

Except in Crash, the characters are all in more than one story, and they're played by famous people too. (""Hey, that's Tony Danza!"")Oh, and they're all different races too, like Black and White, and Persian-Not-Arab, so this makes the film very important. And Ludicrous is in it, so that's a good thing. Ludicrous, like most of the characters, is prejudiced. He's prejudiced against White people and Chinese, and also against Negroes too! And he doesn't tip.The other good thing about this movie is it has a Message. Not a Message like Seventh Heaven (You can be the best preacher in the North American viewing area but if you're wife's not happy, nobody's happy) but a really important Message, which is Bad People Are Not All Bad, and Good People Aren't As Good As You Think. This is a really good Message, and probably should have been the name of the movie instead of Crash.It's called Crash, by the way, because people in the movie get up in each other's faces, like they're Crashing around in bumper cars.

Definitely a Lethal Crash,"Okay, lets all get a few things straight about this movie. This movie was good to people who usually watch *beep* obvious films that have absolutely no original arc to them. People would come out saying, ""Wow, I can't believe how much this film connected!"". Give me a break. If you want true art that's like this watch Magnolia. Here are my problems with Crash...1. The character development was terrible. Yeah, bad things are happening to these characters, but did they do anything that should make me feel for them and be able to identify? No. I've got Matt Dillon the racist, Terrence Howard the director who speeds away from the police for no logical reason, Brandon Fraiser who is the most pussy whipped man on earth. Sandra Bullock who's a one note bitch the whole time. Where do I look to find sympathy for these people? I mean when Bullock hugs her maid at the end, who gives a *beep* She's in so much pain from falling down the stairs and has a realization. ""Oh no, I'm a bitch. Now let me embrace the first person who puts up with me...even though they work for my money..."". None of these people were believable either. Cheadle's mother would have NEVER asked for his little brother to come home in real life. Real life junkies don't give a *beep* about that stuff because they're too fried after all the drugs they've done. They don't have any real feelings left. And come on with the Iranian family. The father is an *beep* and I'm supposed to care that he thinks god came down and stopped his bullet from killing some little girl. It's a blank, it's not hard to figure out, especially since your daughter left the box in your store that says in huge letters BLANKS on it. *beep* morons.2. The extreme push that everyone HAS TO BE racist against someone. Just take a concept and jam it down my throat why don't you? The first thing is about how Asians can't drive. Then there's the Osama comment in the gun store. Then the black car jacker who hates people who think black people jack cars. This whole thing is just showing how stereotypical you have to be to get people to notice you.3. The characters time on screen were so short lived that I couldn't give a *beep* what happened to them.4. The writing style was very contrived and not believable. *phone rings* *Cheadle picks it up* ""I can't talk now mom, I'm having sex with a Mexican."" *Cheadle hangs up*. Wow lets not try and stick a racial comment in there to cause a moment of interracial spat between lovers...5. The direction was self-absorbed and didn't reach out to the audience. Haggis just wanted people to think he's a great director with his exploding cars and people barely escaping and showing their faces full of indifference after they were so hateful. It's RIDICULOUS.Whomever thinks this film is one of the best films they've ever seen needs to watch more than four movies. I would have to watch only Gigli, Waterworld, and How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days to call this the best film I'd ever seen. This film is for the large audience of people who don't know anything about film. People who think a film is good when the acting is okay across the board and the topic is racism and OH MY LORDDD things actually connect in the end! It's like Pulp Fiction and Magnolia...but with down syndrome! Matt Dillon and Terrernce Howard saved this film. They were both outstanding...as usual. Haggis should get on his knees and thank them for saving his career because without them he'd be stuck with movie called, ""The Acting is Terrible and Everything is a Stereotype."" Instead it's just, ""Everything is a stereotype.""I hope you think about this next time you watch the film instead of thinking about how cool and unconventional you are for liking a film that's not starring the usual suspects in the romantic comedy scene.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The Most Overrated Film of the Year (perhaps, of the decade)","""Crash"" is one of those movies which, for some reason I can't really figure out, is considered by both critics/audiences a masterpiece. It got 3 Academy Awards: Best Picture (the one which should have gone to ""Brokeback Mountain""), Best Editing (Claire Simpson did a much better job in ""The Constant Gardener"") and Best Original Screenplay (well, any other film deserved it more, I guess), among many other prestigious awards.This is not a bad movie. It has some good moments and a few strong performances (Terrence Howard, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton - all the rest of the cast is just okay; Don Roos' ""Happy Endings"" has a much better ensemble, if you ask me). The idea of a film concerning the hatred policy that rules in LA is compelling itself - but Paul Haggis (who wrote ""Million Dollar Baby"") and Bobby Moresco's script is so schematic that ""Crash"" became just a shadow of a great film. The ""In the Deep"" moment shamelessly ripped ""Magnolia""s 'Wise Up' off (the comparison is inevitable). ""Magnolia"", by far the best film of 1999 and possibly the best ensemble drama ever, wasn't even nominated to Best Picture Oscar; but, at least, they awarded another great, daring film (""American Beauty""). Since in 2005 the strongest film was a ""gay cowboy love story"", the Academy puritans were courageous enough to award...""Crash"", which is more like a slightly above the average TV-movie.

"Rambling entanglement, but not protracted - and with brilliant cast","Big cities do not apparently conform to human nature - people are tired, nervous, and all this is reflected on rude behavior, including on people's gender, race and/or profession. Paul Haggis has created a realistic atmosphere in one of them - Los Angeles where people of different background and races must intertwine and cope with each other; unfortunately, race-related positive discrimination has created some injustice and abuse of ""advantage"", resulting with things easily getting out of hand.The cast is very strong, although there is no leading character, all have kind of supporting roles. But names like Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, William Fichter are a sign of quality, and they are pleasant to follow. But the most interesting role was played by Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges whose statements on racial tensions make you giggle - in spite of seriousness beyond... Most of characters act in couples, but not all pairs are equally interesting or contributing to the run of events, they seem to act in a parallel universe.Nevertheless, Crash is a conspicuous movie - no wonder it was awarded 3 Oscars (plus 3 nominations) - as it combines felonies and profundity in a distinctive manner.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
We all suffer from the same curse,"Crash, directed by Paul Haggis, is a collection of intertwining stories set in Los Angeles. We follow a pair of cops, for example, who in turn pull over a vehicle, the driver of which we then follow around for a while, and so on. Kind of like Pulp Fiction, but with the emphasis on theme rather than style.That theme in this case being that of prejudice. These characters are victims and perpetrators of racism, bigotry and hate. Or, as the movie want you to realize, they're often both at the same time depending on the circumstances. Being a victim of racial slurs and worse doesn't keep you from throwing similar slurs around in a different setting. Those who are bullied often become bullies themselves to seize back some of the power that was taken from them. And that's a vicious cycle.It's a poignant message, and what I appreciate about this film is its neutrality. It doesn't take sides, and if it condemns, it condemns us all as equals. Very few characters in this film are completely without a blame, which rings true to me as a viewer.The acting is also topnotch, as it should be for a film of this substance. Matt Dillon's Academy Award nominated performance is one of the best in the film easily, though I also like Shaun Toub and Michael Peña a lot. But truly there are no bad performances in this film.Crash is one of the best films about race, racism and bigotry I've seen. And it earns that through engaging storytelling, good characters and steadfast neutrality. Great watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Interesting, but not great","I found this movie quite interesting, but it was by no means great or worthy of ""Acadamy Award"" buzz. My biggest complaint about the movie is that they dive into too many different stories. Granted it was interesting to see the different struggles that each face, but it did not allow me to become as emotionally attached to any one character. For this reason I can't say I loved the movie. It makes it very difficult to get absorbed into the movie because just when you begin to get attached to a character your thrown into another story. It's this jumpy disconnect that I had a problem with. I found myself comparing the movie to 21 GRAMS in the sense that they are both emotionally driven movies that have an evolving story. Difference being, 21 Grams blows Crash out of the water and that is the type of emotion I was looking to feel in Crash but did not.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
City in Collison,"In the Film ""Crash"", movie viewers are challenged to remain ambivalent while following the life line of a city afloat in a sea of racial tensions. The story begins with a touching philosophical summery of modern life in the large metropolis of America. Don Cheadle, in what is likely to become a classic role for him, gives a most inspiring performance as a Los Angeles policeman in search of meaning. In his role as an investigative police detective, he searches for the murderer of his brother and a victim of a gunshot shooting. While he makes his rounds of the city, he attempts to hold his family together while all around him, other people are struggling with theirs. Each life is laced with personal stereotypical barriers which prompts others to collide with them. Each suffers through their own brand of racial bigotry and in turn allows the viewer to see themselves in this fascinating mirror of life. Memorable performances from Matt Ryan, Billy Gallo, and Ryan Phillippe as Hanson, highlight this amazing collection of stories. After watching this film, it's little wonder why it was chosen as Picture of the Year. ****",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
car crash commentary.,"Crash is the clever kid in your class. It rises above the usual Hollywood drivel by dealing with some tricky subjects in an intelligent way. It looks good, has a good strong cast and has beautiful music for 99% of the film. On the other hand it is slightly contrived and the plots twists are easily recognisable, there is a terrible bit at a murder scene and the film plays out with the stereophonics (wtf?) But these are not good enough reasons to not see this film they just let it down slightly. Overall the piece deals with racism in a way no mainstream movie has in our new climate of the terror of skin colour (be it terrorist or carjackers) it has a strong script that is brilliantly played out by actors such as Cheadle, Dillon, Bullock and Newton. Some of the scenes involving race issues are cringe worthy but ultimately rewarding. Crash plays out a little bit like magnolia but without the quirkiness and singing. It is a one of those films that critics hail as absolutely brilliant like last years sideways. Both films are good but not brilliant. I think what happens is when so many films arrive that are average and then one comes along that is slightly above that people get carried away. Don't let me put you off please go and see crash it is one of the better films you will see this year. A mainstream movie with a conscience and a heart.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great !,"Great movie ! A sad piece of reality, but still a great movie. Yet, better said, of the American reality I would say. It amazes me how, after all this time, these people didn't managed to learn what tolerance really is. Not a fabulous performance, but a great script and good directing. It is a movie that should make every one of us look deep inside ourselves and face our own demons, and measure our own level of tolerance. Because this is what this movie is all about. Tolerance. I think it takes great determination to do that and that this is a great exercise for all of us. I gave it a 9, because it was surprisingly good. I didn't expect it since it was just a movie I saw out of curiosity and since I had nothing better to do that late at night.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Forget everything that you ever imagined.,"For years, the movie industry was afraid to tackle racism, and when they finally did, the movies were good but were a little too straight forward about their subjects to fully get into the issues (think ""To Kill a Mockingbird""). ""Crash"", on the other hand, gets down and dirty in every way. Focusing on how a car crash and the racially charged associations therewith affect several people in LA, the movie is as gritty as ""LA Confidential"".It's hard to sum ""Crash"" up easily, as it looks more at stereotypes than at simple discrimination. It portrays the obvious tensions (if a white person avoids a black person, does that make him/her racist?), but there's also a gun store owner who implies that a Middle Eastern man is trying to start a jihad. As for the LA police...well, you'll see what I mean if you see the movie.The roles are all quite impressive. Terrence Howard plays a TV producer with trouble standing up for himself; Thandie Newton plays his hubby who gets on his case for not standing up for her; Matt Dillon plays a cop with a slightly aggressive streak; Ryan Philippe plays a rookie cop unsure about when to act; Don Cheadle plays a dignified but nervous detective; Brendan Fraser plays a district attorney fed up with his job; Sandra Bullock plays his unfulfilled wife; and Ludicrous plays a gang member.A very good movie, but remember, not for the squeamish.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Heavy-handed,"I was really looking forward to seeing Crash, but I'm afraid I found it quite dull and heavy handed. While the quality of the actors on screen is not in doubt, the large ensemble cast means that no one set of characters has much screen time and it is hard to get to know the characters and empathise with their actions. The handling of the race elements, although well-intentioned, came across as heavy handed, particularly the part of the film involving Matt Dillon's character, his background story and how he interacts with the health care/medical insurance clerk. However, what I did like about Crash was how the different elements of the story came together; I particularly enjoyed the strand involving Daniel the locksmith who was trying to make a better life for his family. I really wanted Crash to make me think about the issues it raised, but I left the cinema feeling a bit disappointed and let down.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Some excellent scenes and performances, but ultimately flawed","I expected to enjoy Crash very much, as it had a terrific cast and is a film built around a group of interconnected characters and stories, which draws its strength from characters and feelings instead of being a lazy, shallow blockbuster. I did enjoy it, but I was slightly disappointed that it wasn't as good as it could have been, and didn't completely hang together as a film.There are a lot of fascinating characters and situations here. A couple of cops, one male one female, who have a tense relationship, struggle with themselves and each other as they try and unravel a complicated and political case. A pair of seemingly articulate and reasonable, albeit contrary and frustrated, young black men turn out to be professional car-jackers. They rob a high-profile white couple and we see the impact on their lives, and on the black professional couple who are stopped by the police thinking the similar car they are driving is the stolen one. We also see a hard-working Latino family man and a hard-pressed Iranian working family who are the victims in various ways of prejudice and bad luck. These stories and more are wound together in a series of memorable scenes that pack a lot of emotional punch. There is a strong element of racial tension in the air, and the atmosphere is really well-captured by writer-director Paul Haggis.The problem is that having set up this fascinating collection of characters and stories, the makers unfortunately make some pretty wrong moves in deciding where to take them. A lot of really ridiculous coincidences are required to resolve a lot of the stories which are simply not believable, and some are quite badly conceived. It becomes melodramatic, which really jars with the very real and strong stories and people they began with and made the viewer care about. At least the characters are true to themselves in the way they act throughout, but a lot of the emotional impact is lost, and that compares badly to the strength of feeling Paul Haggis captured with his previous script, Clint's Million Dollar Baby.The film reminded me - and suffered in comparison to - two films I really loved, Magnolia and Short Cuts. And those films show where Crash went wrong. To make this kind of film work you either need to build up believable characters and situations so carefully that the viewer is totally on board and believes everything from there on in, like Altman the master did with Short Cuts. The other way is like PT Anderson's Magnolia, reminiscent of South American magical realism, to set up characters that you really care about and want to follow on their journeys, then say to the audience, ""OK, what happens next is kind of unreal, but let's pretend that there is something strange in the air tonight that makes this happen, and we'll see what it does with our characters."" The audience doesn't really believe it but cares enough to go with the film and believe in the emotional truth of the stories even if they are unrealistic. Crash falls between these two choices by creating enough reality to make us believe it, but not building up that magical atmosphere that would make us go with it. Also both Short Cuts and Magnolia were nearer three hours while this is just less than two, and perhaps that rush led the filmmakers stumbling down the path of melodrama to resolve these interwoven stories in record time.That said, there is a lot to enjoy and admire here, some terrific film-making and excellent performances throughout, especially Don Cheadle as a repressed cop, Sandra Bullock's best performance yet as a snippy, frustrated woman who hates the person she is becoming, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges as one of the car-jackers and (the pick of the bunch) Michael Pena, who is simply superb as the Latino family man who finds himself caught up in a lot of other people's problems while doing his best to deal with his own. I'm glad I went to see it, and it's better than most things that have been released this year, and anyone who likes this kind of movie will enjoy it. But it could have been much better - on the plus side, it's made me realize I should go and buy Short Cuts and Magnolia on DVD!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Truth Hurts Only When It Should!,"Paul Haggis pulls back the veil of hypocrisy in an effort to reveal that all species human, regardless of their class, status or skin hue possess varied levels of racism that almost always seem to find their way to the surface in times of crisis.The movie pulls no punches, but I for one, though at times felt shaken up never felt beaten up. At times felt saddened, but never felt abandoned. If Haggis was preaching, it wasn't brimstone and hellfire, and it certainly wasn't to the choir. It was more like a modern book of ""Revelations,"" and either you get it or you don't! Painful? Sometimes. But almost always poignant and often surprisingly funny, Haggis makes certain no one escapes his magnifying glass. At times the malevolence that spews from the lips of Sandra Bullock (The DAs wife) or Shaun Toub (The Persian shop owner) is brutal and is deliberately exceedingly uncomfortable. But for Haggis it's like a detox program on the road to recovery.The tapestry is woven with purpose and coincidence that may preach and pound but it never hems or haws or equivocates. It's the kind of film that tries to prove that an audience 'can handle the truth' (sorry Jack!).L.A. is a cultural melting pot and serves perfectly as an authentic backdrop for the movie's message and tone. Here Haggis paints a cinematic mural of his City of Angels. A city of hate, hope and redemption.In my opinion, ""Crash"" is never bleak, just refreshingly honest. It's funny, sad, poignant and finally, in its own way...healing.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Complelling Picture Adressing Important Subject Matter,"Crash is an incredible film and an important one.The film concerns an ensemble of characters from diverse backgrounds, different racial origins, different class in society and different life experiences. The film follows no particular plot as such but instead cleverly intertwines the many subplots of its various characters and how the directly or in-directly touch each others lives, for better or for worse. Before I move onto the subject matter, it is important to point out that this film has reaped some awesome performances from its cast, notably Matt Dillon playing a been-to-long-in-the-force type cop and the desperate and fearful housewife trapped in her own life Sandra Bullock.Crash tackles the always tricky and always heatedly debated subject of racism in society. The film has been set in LA, most probably as LA is a city with a massively ethnically-diverse population and a huge divide between the classes. However this film could have been set in nearly any big city in the western world. The world is now so globalise, there is very few places left where you will not meet/pass in the street/know/ignore a person from a different ethnic background to yourself.The film shows racism and ignorance in an un-apologetic and realistic context. Other films have (often successfully) tackled racism and the causes of, but none I have seen have shown it in such an obvious and everyday context. The characters in this film for the most part are not bad people, nor uneducated, nor malicious. However they do commit acts of racism and ignorance, small and large, based on the stereotypes and presumptions they have in their mind from personal experience or from the media. The film then goes on to show how even the smallest slip of the tongue, a lazy comment here or there can go on to have drastic impacts.The film never becomes preachy at any time nor does it try to impose any views on the audience. It shows in a matter of fact way, exactly the sort of things that happen everyday and exactly the sort of things we hear and sometimes say or think about people, just because of the preconception we have due to their apparent race.I work in a job where I come into contact with literally hundreds of foreign people, people of a different racial background to myself and people of many diverse cultures every single day. I wish I could show this film to all of my colleagues as the amount of pre-judgement I hear muttered or even see practised while working with these people is scary. This film would show certain colleagues of mine that what they think is a harmless remark, or even think that a view they hold is valid because they think they know something about a particular race of people, is the worst kind of judgement that they can ever make.Go watch this film right now.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The people you assume are evil and disposable wind up being both heroes and victims. The person I assumed was a hero is actually the opposite or maybe a dupe of his own liberal guilt.

Ironically, I felt both disturbed and inspired after watching it, and I'll bet that many people will feel the same way.

There is so much going on within all of the characters emotionally, that I immediately wanted to watch it again. I wanted to learn more from it. And this is the real beauty of the film. It appeals so much to basic human emotions; and to the very American ideals of justice and liberty for all. It's important that everyone watch this film because everyone is a part of its message. Everyone has discriminated and everyone has felt anger and fear. Everyone has played a part in maintaining stereotypes. And, as a result, everyone is a part of this Film.

"A bit preachy, but still thought-provoking","Twenty minutes into ""Crash,"" I realized none of the characters we'd been introduced to was all that likable. Not one person. They were all racist on some level - from the gun store owner who spews xenophobia in true post-9/11 fashion to the LAPD Detective Ria (Jennifer Esposito), who gets rear-ended at the start of the film by a Chinese driver; from LAPD Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon), who has one of the film's most unsettlingly creepy moments during a bogus traffic stop, to the D.A.'s hysterical wife, Jean (Sandra Bullock), who clearly has race issues.And I wondered what exactly writers Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco were trying to say.By the end of the film, their message is clear. This is a movie about the ridiculousness and stupidity of prejudice and intolerance. It doesn't matter whether you're white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Persian, Muslim, Christian or Jew. Prejudice is within all of us and, in this case, comes out in all its ugly glory. This is life in the 21st century melting pot, except our irrational fears and prejudices don't really allow for much melting.But it's also more than that. ""Crash"" also is about getting beneath the surface. People are not what they seem. Just when we think we've encountered a slimy S.O.B., he turns around and does something good. And when we meet a wholesome, righteous person, he turns around and shocks us with abhorrent behavior.Maverick American filmmaker Robert Altman clearly influences Haggis' storytelling style. Haggis weaves all his disparate tales together in Altmanesque fashion. This film borrows its style from ""Nashville"" (1975) and ""Short Cuts"" (1993), and even the other Altman-influenced movie, Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" (1999).And Haggis does it smoothly. He picks up stories just when they're fading from memory. He ties it all together very well. And, you could argue, a bit too well. Because some of the transitions from one character's tale to another depends a lot on coincidence. In this case, sometimes it's a bit too coincidental that one character would run into another. But it's a conceit I'm willing to buy. Because despite this movie-flaw, ""Crash"" still pulls us in quite remarkably.There's nothing needless or wasted in this film. True, you're being pulled in by coincidences, but that's also the film's charm. The stories occasionally get overwrought, but Haggis also pulls a few surprises, a few moments that completely jolt the audience.What surprised me were some of the performances. Yes, we know we're going to get a great one from Don Cheadle. The man never disappoints. Here, he again proves why he's one of the best. Dillon plays a despicable cop to perfection - his initial scene with Thandie Newton will make your skin crawl - but he doesn't turn Officer Ryan into a one-dimensional monster. It would have been easy to do so, but Dillon's adds great depth to his persona and, to his credit, makes us care about this person. Surprisingly, Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Esposito and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges turn in performances that I honestly never thought they had in them. After ""Crash,"" why on earth would Bullock ever return to making crappy romantic comedies?Haggis and Moresco also deal with our nation's post-9/11 intolerance of anyone who even resembles an Arab and our collective ignorance about other cultures. In one telling moment, an Iranian woman washes away racist graffiti and wonders, ""When did Persians become Arab?"" I don't think the film's anti-gun message is coincidental, either. Haggis makes it clear that our easy access to handguns clearly ignites or exacerbates tense situations.The film's virtues outweigh its less-than-stellar moments. Despite its flaws, including being less than subtle about being preachy and one too many contrived coincidences, this film makes you think. How many modern American movies can you say that about?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Movie of the year...or was there just nothing else good.,"Crash Wow the movie of the year! OK I can see why this film made the top ten list, but why did it get film of the year? Maybe because their was some greater lesson in the film....life, relationships, honesty, truth, real situations, greed and power......I guess these are the factors that make a film great. I liked the story line, and the plot was rich....eventually all the characters were intertwined with each others lives. I guess I have to see it again to appreciate it. All of the characters changed in some way, their was a lesson learned and we follow them on this journey. It is the most boring thing in the world when you don't care about a character or watch them for 2 hours and they don't change. Yet this film did both for me. When a movie wins an Oscar....I ask what is this telling the general public.....maybe that there is a lesson within this film that we all can learn from. Nothing in life is an accident. My vote is 6 out of 10 for this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Playing mightily upon our deepest fears and even deeper convictions about what it is to be human, ""Crash"" effortlessly hands the baton off to the multitude of characters again and again....In a 36 hours period, every character created by Haggis is affected by the world around him or her.

A crash of ideas and values,"This film is about 7 groups of individuals whose lives intersect on a certain day due to two car crashes.This film tried to examine the issue of racism, racial stereotypes and power. It also looked at good and evil; sometimes even the best person can be evil and other times the bad person can act gracefully. In this aspect, the film succeeded.However, I found the first half of the film too extreme. To see Ludicrous' character putting every single thing in his daily life to the product of racism was far too much. I worried that, instead of making people beware of racism, it was spreading racism and radical ideas.The plot of interwoven story was not undone before. The way that the characters interconnected was obvious and required little brain work. In this aspect, I preferred another film 11:14 starring Hilary Swank which was interwoven much more cleverly.",,Anonymous,Crime
Forgiveness,"Two black young men robed a white couple's car. Then more people were involved. The main content was about racial problem. In fact there were much information in the movie. Everything is not absolute. ""Bad"" cop Ryan saved the woman who he insulted. ""Good"" cop Hanson shot mistakenly the black young man. So everything can be changeable.In real life you need dealing with all kinds of relationships. The key is leniency. If you own it, you can get good relationship with anyone else.

No doubt it is the excellent screenplay that makes the film so extraordinary.Highly recommended. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent and heart breaking- - so why didn't I give it a 10?,"Few films have ever succeeded in breaking my heart; and Crash is one of them. This film is brilliant and it breaks your heart to watch it. I haven't seen any of the other nominees for the 2006 Best Picture Oscar so I have no idea how it compares, but Crash is indeed wonderful.The entire cast does an amazing job. Their performances (as individuals and as a whole) are stunning and inspired. There is not a single performance that I was able to find a problem with, and that surprised me. For one, it is a colossal ensemble piece, you would expect one of them to back down at least once. But they never do. In fact, some of the actors have redeemed themselves in my eyes. Most particularly, Ryan Phillipe as Henderson. He doesn't mumble, and his character isn't the sort of pathetic, self assertive, slime ball that I'm used to seeing him as. All the performances are excellent, but there are a few in particular that I would like to point out: Matt Dillon as Officer John Ryan. He plays the most disgusting, racist, bigot that ever existed. His anger (at himself, at his father, for his father) wells up inside until he sees no way to relieve it other than to be racist. He molests a black woman without a second thought. And then, he tries to do the right thing, only to find that his past actions have an affect on people, so much that they are unable to forgive him for some things. Another performance is Don Cheadle as Graham Waters. A black detective from the inner city who has risen to a level far above his beginnings. As much as he hates his past, he is still connected to it, as he takes care of his druggie mother, and shields her from what her youngest son has become. Sandra Bullock as Jean Cabot. Where's Miss Conjeniality now? She plays an afraid, lonely, and prejudiced wife, who feels as if she's always angry, but without a reason. I have a whole new respect for her acting abilities. My final favorite performance goes to Michael Pena as Daniel. An honest, law abiding man trying to make a life for his young daughter, away from the violence that surrounds their life. His role as a caring father is perfect, and it breaks my heart.My hat goes off to Paul Haggis. I cannot even imagine making this movie. The camera angles are wonderful, but I really loved the transitions. Weird, I know, but I do love them. They are not abrupt, there are no dissolves, or old school transitions. They are all smooth, flowing from one scene to the next flawlessly. They help to keep the film moving at a quick pace. The script is astounding as well, so my hat goes off to Robert ""Bobby"" Moresco as well as Haggis. I cannot even fathom writing this screenplay. The entire premise is so complex, that I just have to give it a standing ovation. The dialog flows and every single one of the characters are created perfectly. They come alive for us on screen. They *are* alive for us. There are so many twists and turns of the plot (just as with real life), that you are sucked in. I love, even though it kills me, the plot twist that happens to Henderson. That kills me. The young, white cop, fighting for equality, who does the one thing he hates. It's one of the truest moments I have ever seen on film.And that brings me to the reason that I am unable to give Crash a perfect 10. As superb as it is, the acting, the direction, the writing, it is flawed in too many ways - too many for me just to over look. Crash fails to wrap up many of the loose ends that its multiple story lines are bound to have. And it's a shame too. I want to know how Henderson handles what he did. I want to know what was really going on between Rick and Karen and how he breaks that to Jean, or if he just lets it slide. But all in all, Crash is a gem. I loved it, and I give it an extremely high 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome movie,"I think the first thing I need to mention are my preconceptions before first seeing this movie. I do this as I think your view of a movie can be affected by your preconceptions. For example I am sure I do not rate Gladiator as highly as it deserves due to the fact I caught it late on DVD after I had heard and read people raving on about how great it was, I was disappointed at least partially due to my expectations being overly high.With Crash however although I did not catch it until after it had won the Oscar I was not convinced it was going to be a great movie as I was indifferent about the cast and on reading the cover I could see it looked like one of those movies which would either work or just be an incoherent mess. Besides ""Gladiator"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" had won Oscars in recent years  both of which I do not rate that highly! I was slightly worried by the opening scene, it features Cheadle (probably the actor involved I rated highest before seeing this movie) but seemed to contain awkward dialogue, was not particularly visually inspiring and bottom line just failed to grab me. However the scene was just a setup scene out of context as the movie quickly moves into the true first act set a day before within the time line of the story.The story quickly progresses to show various characters from different walks of life within the city of Los Angeles living through the previous 24 hours. All of the stories involve the subject of racism and all end up being intermingled in the style of previous films such as the brilliant Magnolia.The script is often funny whilst at other times heart breaking and even though it has the sense of being contrived with the aim of getting an emotional response from its viewers it can be forgiven for this because at the end of the day it does work.For me a major revelation was Matt Dillon, he is one of those actors I had not seen much of before for whatever reason and he shone for me in a truly first class believable performance.I won't spoil the plot for those who are yet to see the movie but the road accident scene involving him and Newton is plain awesome and I love the interaction between them in the car and the way although his prejudices are wrong they do not in themselves define him as a bad person - just a messed up one.The film is not without its critics and many think it is Hollywood dribble with no clear or relevant message. I believe it shows none of us to be without prejudice of some form or another even if this is sometimes hardly a conscious thing.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Movie about racism and good and bad in people,"In a society where everyone has racist inclinations, everybody's path is bound to collide with each other, especially in a racially diverse city like LA. The movie has a very strong message but I am not so impressed by the way the message is delivered. The plot seems to me to be a little too contrived. The structure of the plot is similar to ""Traffic"" where there are different group of characters each living in their own world and their paths cross each other unexpectedly. It seems every character has an issue with a certain race. One cop doesn't like blacks and harasses a black woman in front of her husband, two other black guys don't like white people, and harass a white couple and steal their van, some middle eastern guy's store is broken into and he blames a black guy, some Chinese guy hates some other race (I cannot remember, there were too many hating going on). It's like a contest of hatred (whoever hates the most number of races wins!). The message is serious but I think some of the dialogs are just overdone. They are way too direct and not subtle enough. We get it, these people are racist and racism is a bad thing. We get it, we get it. The way the characters behave is just too over-the-top. The story and unfolding of the events are enough to give us an idea of what's going on in their heads, do we really need to hear every little racist thought they are thinking? I am also not so pleased with the way every group of character crosses path with the other - so many coincidences. I know the title is ""Crash"" and it is part of the movie's message: people colliding with each other. But again, some coincidences come off as contrivances (so long I don't read the screenplay writer's thoughts, I am OK with it but when I can read them, then to me they are contrived for a purpose and that takes away from the movie). Overall, not a bad movie but not good enough to win an Oscar.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The ""City of Angels"" is shown in a sad and painful light through 36 hours dominated by racism and prejudice.","Sadness, hatred and bitterness can be found behind every corner in the so-called ""city of angels"", racism dominates everyone's life in one way or the other and people yell and scream at each other simply because of their color and their language. Words are misinterpreted or misunderstood, which leads to conflicts and arguments, sometimes even fatal. This sad, but wonderful movie documents 36 hours in Los Angeles, with more or less average people finding themselves in unusual situations, and often colliding with each other in the most surprising ways. Whether you are a detective, a cop, a district attorney, a movie producer, a locksmith or a car thief, nobody is safe from being pulled into the Maelstrom of hatred and prejudice, which is ever present in L.A. The film is dramatically and intelligently intertwined, which will bring the audience to tears but at the same time is a piece of hope and optimism at the end.In Los Angeles, racism dominates the interaction between people and over the time of 36 hours many of them encounter it in closer ways than ever before. Detective Graham Waters is working on a case where a racist white cop shot a corrupt black one, and after finding $300,000 in cash in the black cop's car he is almost sure that the dead man was trafficking drugs. But the city, that wants to save face, wants to present the community with a fallen black hero instead of a drug dealer and persuades Waters to drop the case, in exchange for the clearance of his brother's criminal record. Jack Ryan is a racist cop, who after pulling over a couple that performed fellatio, sexually molests the wife under the eyes of her husband and his partner Tom Hanson. The movie director Cameron Thayer and his wife get in a huge fight after being pulled over by Ryan and Thayer's wife accuses him of being worried more about his reputation than her. Rick Cabot, the district attorney, and his wife Jean are attacked by two black thieves and their car is stolen. After that incident, Jean is in constant fear of people that are not of her race, and Rick tries to spin the incident to his advantage, no matter the cost. Daniel Ruiz, a Hispanic locksmith, gives his daughter a necklace, that is supposed to protect her from any danger, even bullets. After a communication problem with the Persian owner of a store, the store is robbed and trashed, and the insurance refuses to pay because of negligence. The owner is desperate and goes after Ruiz and causes a catastrophe to happen.This movie is a painful mosaic that spreads out over the city and involves numerous people of different ethnicity, languages and social classes. Just one small event, can cause a dangerous chain reaction that will end in casualties. Paul Haggis, in one of the best screenplays of the decade so far, ties up the plot strings convincingly and created a film with a powerful message. There are no good people in Los Angeles, no heroes and no saints, but some have their moments and most of them have their eyes opened by the end of this film. There is no true beginning or end, as it is just a glimpse into an average day for these people, one of many that is filled with sorrow and pain, but occasional happiness. The viewers are pulled in from the very first word on and won't be able to let go until the end credits start rolling. Some of the dialogs are even funny to a certain extent, because they are full of insults and swear words, but their content is so serious, that the smile just won't come in most cases. The language is extremely dirty and includes dozens of ""f-words"" that is because the atmosphere in L.A. was supposed to be as authentic as possible, and it certainly is.Don Cheadle is very calm and moving as Graham Waters, a detective, who tries everything to get accepted by his mother, and in the end she is always more fond of his criminal younger brother than him. Matt Dillon just blew me away, beginning as the racist asshole, who sexually molests a young woman, to the hero, who risks his one life to pull someone from a burning car. Sandra Bullock as the racist wife of a district attorney has not a lot of screen time, but she is so perfectly unsympathetic that one has to congratulate her for a job well done. Michael Pena, playing the only truly good guy in this film, is extraordinary and some of his scenes will move anyone to tears, especially the one that is shown on the poster, of him letting out a tortured scream as he is holding his young daughter. Ryan Philippe proves that he can be considered one of the best young actors in Hollywood right now, giving a great dramatic performance as the young, naive police officer, who goes through an unfortunate transformation over the 36 hours the film takes place in. Terence Howard's character also changes considerably, from an ambitious, well-worded man, to the aggressive, foul-mouthed one at the end. Thandie Newton as the victim of Ryan's sexual molesting gives a sad and moving performance and her scenes with Dillon are among the best in the movie.Coincidences shape the lives of the multi-ethnical people in L.A., often for the worse as this movie shows. In any case, Paul Haggis crafted a masterpiece of story-telling that goes deep into the people that have to survive the daily life in a city, where racism is constantly present are where trust is a word nobody has ever heard of. Nobody can prevent the crashes and coincidences of life, but we can make the best of them,instead of blaming each other because of a different skin color or language.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

For the most part the presentation flows seamlessly through the lives of LA residents as incidents follow incidents over the course of twenty four hours or so, but it soon dawns on you that it's as manufactured as the cheapest plastic plaything and done so just to elicit what can only be described as a faux reaction to the events - as a result the impact is diluted and devalued.Sadly, it's the constant stream of actual events and newsfeeds, from all over the world but perhaps more shocking in the so called developed world, that remind us how the road to a truly fair, free and open society is still as out of reach to some as it's ever been - on that we should all be able to agree.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Crash"" Is A Brave Look at Human Interactions","""Crash"" is one of those brave films that dares to confront issues that nobody wants to talk about. There have been other films about racism, but they have tended to point fingers or avoid taking positions that are not politically correct. But ""Crash"" is too intelligent of a film to do that.Instead we are given a group of diverse individuals, some of whom fit social and ethnic stereotypes, and some whom defy them. No one is demonized, not even those who fit somewhat into negative stereotypes, although all but one of the major character have serious emotional issues that they need to work out.The interesting thing about ""Crash"" is how much I found myself identifying with each of the characters in that I have both been a victim of racism, and yet have also been one of those people made to feel guilty every time I do not like someone of another race, even if my feelings about them later prove to be right.

Same with the bad guy. I found myself shouting at the screen because the scenes were so intense. The overlap with the characters is convenient but not overdone.

Flawed But Admirably Ambitious,"Crash is a solid movie for me, it's not amazing but I do think that it's got very good intentions and found the story to be very interesting and while I do agree that it shouldn't have won Best Picture that doesn't make it a bad film. One thing that nobody can deny about this film are the excellent performances by its entire cast with Michael Pena, Terrence Howard and Matt Dillon being the standouts. Pena gives a fragile and heartwarming performance here I loved his scenes with his daughter and you truly feel for him with the racism he has to deal with. On the opposite end of the spectrum Matt Dillon completely falls into his hostile and racist character but the best thing about his character was the fact that you understand why he is the way he is the fact that he has not got the right but the right reasons for his feelings and quickly turned from a hate able character into an intriguing and sympathetic one. Terrence Howard plays a perfect coward he's become used to the casual racism and discrimination that he has to put up with on a daily basis and watching him let it all happen while he wanted to do something was truly tear jerking especially in the scene with his wife. Technically this movie is fantastic Paul Haggis did an excellent job directing this film he panned along very nicely and he's back enough to left the actors to perform on their own without ever getting in their way with needles cuts and movements. This film won an Oscar for its editing and its very well deserved they knew when to cut at just the right time and managed to keep the film very well balanced. However this film is far from perfect for one, it lacks subtly instead of allowing the actors to just emote through their performances the writers felt the need to have them go on with big monologues or outbursts. When certain characters snap it just didn't feel earned while you certainly understand some frustration or anger it just seems as if they've lost the will to live and it just feels so out of place. An I found the ending of this movie to not really fit with the rest of the film it feels to much like a sitcom from the 90s. However I thought they did do a good job at closing out all of the character arcs in a satisfying way.Crash is not perfect it's got some narrative issues and some over the top moments and it. Certainly should not have one best picture against Munich (one of my favourite movies).

"Great Acting, Bad Screenplay","I have no idea in why this won Best Picture and had so many great reviews. Here, every character is either racist or a victim of racism, and if he/she is a racist it's because there's a reason, some sort of trauma in his past. Every character is one-dimensional and learns a lesson in the end. The dialogs sound fake, and the ONLY theme is racism, racism, racism. That even makes it less realist because people tend to speak about several subjects. Paul Haggis seems to think people will only understand the message if he repeats it all the time. All with me ""Racism is bad, racism is bad, racism is bad"". Now repeat this 500 times and you'll have a good part of this movie done. Even if obviously this is an important message, you don't need it to be thrown into your face. The stories come together in unnatural way, using to many coincidences, making it look false and predictable after some time. The changes some of the characters go through in the end are ridiculous and there's no reason for the to happen. Even if this is not a boring movie, it tries too hard to get you to feel something. If the characters had been better this would have been possibly a good movie. I'm not saying all were bad; a few had a certain dimension and their struggles were touching.The acting is the best thing about this movie. All the actors are very talented and make the most out of their parts. Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Michael Peña, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard and Sandra Bullock (during the first part of the movie) were very god. The worst performance was by Ludicrous, who just seemed too self-conscious and fake to me.Paul haggis direction is lame.I know he lacks experience, but I think this movie needed a raw, realistic style, not the emotionally manipulative shots used. Al the slow moving scenes, the bad use of sound and the still camera in angles that lack interest are useless.The technicals are good. The editing is simple and common in this type of movie, not original but well executed. The music is well chosen and beautiful. The photography, even if sometimes it should have been dirtier locking, creates some images with the right mood. Overall, this is NOT a great movie or even worthwhile, but it has a bunch of good performances and a good message, even if badly transmitted.",,Anonymous,Crime
I love the academy!!!!,"I got up today at 5:30 to just spot the first award won by Crash, for Best Editing. It still seemed like Brokeback Mountain was the hot favorite to win the Best Picture award, and Ang Lee's win in the Best Director category came only to confirm such predictions. By the time Jack Nicholson sat there looking at the piece of paper with his bewildering stare, getting ready to announce the winner of the Best Motion Picture of the Year award, I had lost almost all hope, on a night when surprise seemed to have given way to confirmation in all categories. All the more happy was I when I heard the magic word! Crash, my favorite, had done it, Crash had pulled the big upset! 2006 would indeed remain in moviegoers' memory as the year when Crash won the Academy Award. It was at that precise moment that I understood why I have always been so partial to the Academy - it's because they have nearly (they are human; remember Rocky vs All The President's Men?) always chosen the actual best film as the winner of the Best Picture Oscar! Of course, in the end, it's all a matter of opinion, mostly, but, as far as I'm concerned, the Academy knows its business!Quite obviously, Brokeback Mountain is also a very good film, and in a year that hasn't produced masterpieces the likes of The Godfather, Schindler's List, Forrest Gump, The Return Of The King - to quote just a few - it certainly would not have been a wrong decision to hand it the Oscar, eventually. However, Crash does so much more in terms of involving the audience (after all, not all of us are gay, so give us a break). Crash delivers its message with more power and clarity, and that is, I think, something the members of the Academy have always appreciated. Brokeback, on the other hand, approaches the issue it deals with from too many angles, I think, and it tends to get a little overloaded at times, not being able to deal with so many aspects in the limited time - what I mean is that it's not always to the point, and that isn't to its advantage. The performances are great, but the same can be said about Crash. Ang Lee I think deserved his Oscar fully. However, if there is a film this year that really moved me and made me think, that definitely has to be Crash.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crash evokes the mind and the emotions. It is a thinking person's movie.,"This movie illuminated the many-faceted racial stereotypes in America. While your blood pressure was climbing due to the strong dislike or hatred of the racist, the movie managed to tip-toe in the reason behind the racism. Suddenly, the individual that had caused your pulse to pound in your head turned from a monstrous ignorant, personality to just a person who had grown up in an environment that caused them to have racial issues. You found yourself almost understanding the racism.(I am a minority. This should not be happening to me, of all people)There is more. While your emotions are hanging in the balance towards this individual, the movie cunningly reveals a good side of the racist and your emotions are swirling again! How am I suppose to feel towards this individual now?The movie also showed what happens to people that can drive them to the brink of emotional break-downs and horrific actions. Again, you find yourself beginning to understand the individual instead of being repulsed by them.It was beautifully done The cast was right on. I will buy it as soon as it can be purchased. A movie that all should see. If it does not make you think, you are brain-dead.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
You have no idea...,"To be honest, I began watching ""Crash"" an hour before the Oscars took place. Also to be honest, I had wanted to watch it for a long time, and even when I hadn't watched it, I kept claiming, for some reason, that it would win the Best Picture Oscar. To be more honest then, I finished viewing the film after the Oscars ceremony came to an end, and to be even more honest; I might not write enough to explain what this movie generates in the person who experiences it.I find amazing how writers keep on finding ways to connect different people's lives. Writer/director Paul Haggis is not repeating any formula when he creates unions after a car crash; because he is taking his whole picture from a different angle. That's why it's amazing to me that today in Los Angeles racism is still a constant issueI don't know that, because I don't live there, but the first scene of this piece tries to analyze it.Detective Graham (Don Cheadle) has just been in a car accident, and he talks out loud, about the people's sense of touch: ""We miss that touch so much"", he says, ""That we crash into each other just so we can feel something"". Moments later, Anthony and Peter (Ludacris and Larenz Tate) are walking out of a restaurant, discussing about a coffee that wasn't given to them and wondering why a white woman hugs her couple as she passes by. ""She shouldn't be scared, we should be"", Anthony shouts angrily.What happens next is unbelievable as it is ironic. It shocked me and it will shock any viewer because people are not always like we think they are. Racial statements like Anthony's are all over the script, all over the film; but they're not stated just to be said: characters have motives to declare them. Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) sees his father suffering every day because he's got nothing left; he also blames (somehow) the black people in his father's industry for what happened. He is a racist because he resents black people.Due to his position, Rick (Brendan Fraser) must be partial with the black community, whether that causes them good or wrong. His wife Jean (Sandra Bullock) must also be careful with blacks and boys from gangs, even if she's naturally paranoid and asks her lock to be changed again after a young man with a tattoo (Michael Peña) fixes it. For our surprise, the guy turns out to be anything but a gang member.As it occurs with black people, it occurs with Arabs and Persians, or Chinese persons who are American citizens. They are perceived as the same thing, and starred at with the same rejection, although they are different. And I believe that this could be happening right now; this things could be being said, this actions could be taking place, when nobody is probably watching, or listening. Haggis and Moresco truly think they can show us what we could be missing.It's about films like ""Crash"", ""21 Grams"" and ""Traffic"" that we talk about infinitely; because they have original characters within; which include original and unique stories. Here, particularly, Haggis places each one of his characters (and I omitted many of them) in a contradiction and with an observing, confident camera, a lot of light and an overwhelming music (Mark Isham), he messes with them; with their heads and emotions so they can figure everything out.Some of them are already messed up and so desperately in need that they hug the only person who's beside them; for the reason that they need to let it all out. We watch closely and we feel sorry for them; for what they've got and don't appreciateAnd what they lack and will never achieve.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hightly stylized and well-acted but you can't polish a turd.,"This 2005 Best Picture-winning, West Coast ""Do The Right Thing,"" is a Disney-fied, unfunny attempt to expose our collective prejudices. Unlike the 1989 Spike Lee joint, it superficially places the harbored racist stream-of-consciousness of its characters on their sleeves. Of course there are people like this in real life; the pampered politician's wife (played by Sandra Bullock) who doesn't trust the tattooed Latino locksmith (Michael Pena), who is really a respectable, hard-working, God-fearing Dad. It's not that a situation like that doesn't occur in real life, but it is the hyperbolic way that it is presented that falls flat. There isn't very much depth to the characters. They all play these racist caricatures or victimized caricatures that serve as vehicles for monologues that the author wants to express, which is the cycle of racism and glass house-stone throwing culture of America that we live in. For example, the black insurance lady who had to sit through Cop Matt Dillon's racial tirade only to espouse her own stereotypes toward a fellow Asian motorist in a later scene. Almost every character does this and it just becomes predictable. Seriously, Spike Lee did this fifteen years prior with the infamous race-based soliloquies in Do The Right Thing, and it was not only effective, it was funny. Crash simply does not deliver.The ensemble of brilliant actors and solid performances couldn't pull this textbook ""Wild LA"" script from the burning wreck of its own conclusion. It was certainly watch-able for the performances alone, and I will say that some of the key plot twists were creative and well-placed. Which is why I won't trash it. It is a good movie in a technical sense but it certainly is not an Oscar-winner in my book. If the point of this story is redemption, then it did not succeed in conveying that. Especially with Matt Dillon's character. I don't believe that his actions in the film were redemptive. Fate can't bail out your guilt.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
so moving,"Crash is one of the most moving films I have ever seen. I loved every minute of it, and i believe that it did deserve to win the best picture award at the Oscars. So what if it was a little unrealistic, it still faced the issue of racism with bravery and passion, and in doing so, will move a very wide range of audiences.The film deals with the hardships of several different families and individuals all from different racial backgrounds and how they all connect with each other via a series of car crashes and crimes.It is beautifully made and wonderfully acted. The cast is absolutely brilliant. There were so many powerful moments during the film and I think many people will find it hard to hold back the tears.This film is not to be missed. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Does a poor job at getting its message across.,"These type of movies that follow multiple different story lines and characters simultaneously can work out great but I don't really see this movie as a good and successful example of the genre.Problem really is with its story. You could say that the movie is commenting on racism but to me it more was a movie about stupid people, doing stupid things, no matter what their ethnicity is. It besides tries to do and tell too much, in a too short amount of time, with as a result that the ending of the movie feels rushed and totally unsatisfying. Seriously, how are exactly all of the story lines resolved at the end? And how are some of the characters redeemed? The movie leaves an incredible amount of loose ends, with both its story lines and characters. In this particular case I wouldn't had minded seeing this movie being about one hour longer.Most of the actions by all of the characters are besides some very unlikely ones. The movie does a poor job, building up to certain things and not all of the character's actions are explained well enough or make much sense. Sometimes stuff just happens, to add to the overall drama of the movie. It lets the movie feel forced instead of realistic, while this obviously still was the approach that the film-makers were aiming for.It's not like I'm hating the movie but just too many things about it failed to work out to let me see this as a great or successful movie, at what it tried to achieve. It still remains a watchable enough little movie, also since it's never boring and always on the move. There is plenty happening, though not everything got handled equally great or interesting enough.You could of course also still watch it for its acting. It has an all star cast in it, with maybe not the biggest names but still some well known and respected actors in it. Some of them impress, while others get pushed to the background too easily. I particularly liked Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle in their roles, while Sandra Bullock for instance got pushed way too much to the background.Something that I thought was absolutely dreadful about the movie was its musical score by Mark Isham. It totally didn't suited the movie and was even kind of distracting at times.Not a great movie and it even somewhat annoyed me with the way it was handling some of its developments and characters but it still remains far from a horrible movie as well and is actually still pretty watchable. Who knows, changes are you might even end up loving it, since the movie has a pretty good overall reputation and even won the Oscar for best picture, back in 2006.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Interesting?,"I have recently rewatched this movie after quite a few years. And a lot of what reviewers are complaining about are absolutely true. This movie is heavy-handed and relentless in its portrayal of race relations in the US, but to those who say this is the worse or close to worse movie they have ever seen is completely off base. Yes, you may disagree with the premise and bemoan the 'contrived nature of the plot, but this movie has some terrific aspects. For one, the acting and cast are outstanding. The movie moves along at a compelling pace and never drags for even a single moment. Many of the 'vignettes' taken as single events are quite compelling. The directing is sharp and really cohesive regardless of what one thinks of the plot.My guess is that many of the negative reviewers probably tend to be more conservative politically and feel like they are being preached to. Fair enough. If you are sensitive about your own personal views on race and racism, this movie would seem to be hard to handle. However, if you take his movie with a grain of salt and view it in a larger context, I feel like you won't be disappointed.On a side note, I live in Buffalo, NY and am writing this in the wake of a mass shooting at a grocery store in a predominately black neighborhood. Somehow, bludgeoning the audience with this relentless take on race in America seems a bit more relevant than it might have two weeks ago.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Was this movie about race kind of racist itself?,"I am a white male, mid 40's. One of the issues that disturbed me in the film, was that it seems the writer allowed the white characters to somehow redeem themselves, whether outwardly racist or whether they used racial dialog. Even the Persian store owner got his chance. Yet, the movie leaves the African American characters without redemption; Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Ludicrous.....Just a thought. What do others think? This came up in discussion of the film several times with others. I previewed the movie at the Newark Black Film Festival and many others in discussion agreed with this statement.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Superlative acting, even if there is a hint of fromage :)","I was floored by this film, having seen it without having heard of it before. Like other reviewers here, I noticed the similarity to Magnolia, but since that is possibly my favourite film of all time, I am unlikely to see that as a negative! I was amazed that it was a directorial debut.What impressed me initially was the acting. The smallest exchanges were given a gravitas that I find too often missing from 'drama' movies, where only the 'Oscar moments' are performed and filmed with such visible care. It seemed to me like a series of vignettes, that even on their own, outside of the greater context of the film, felt important and special, and carried messages. I thought Chris Bridges (Ludicris) was great, and both Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon turned in complex and brave performances.Any film that makes me laugh aloud and burst into tears is powerful to me, because I think it's really hard for a film-maker to do both convincingly. Some of the dialogues were sharply witty, and yet didn't come off as smug. The emotional high points weren't forced or clichéd (well, with the possible exception of the little girl : 'I will protect you Daddy' - but who cares, I was bawling at that point anyway!), and when it was done, I was left feeling incredibly moved by some of the most powerful scenes.I do think the film will receive some criticism for what will be perceived as overt 'worthiness' or politically correctness, and I can see why in a sense, because there is just a hint of white middle class guilt edging in. However, I really couldn't see how this could have been done with a lighter touch, without losing the significance. To me it was about compromise more than just racism or corruption, how we all get chipped away at every day, and at some point we have to take responsibility for it, and change it or let it go on. There was redemption, but at a price, and even the ending, which had the teensiest whiff of cheese about it, left me smiling :) Oh, great soundtrack too.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Displays the ugliness and ignorance of society,"This movie really makes you examine the way you view and judge others around you. Many people are of a different ethnicity from you or are of a different religious persuasion. Sadly, this often influences our attitudes and behaviors towards them. The movie is well-written and the cinematography really adds to the ambiance and feel of the movie. The characters all experience their own situations where stereotypes and biases influence the way they handle these situations. All the characters come to a revelation in their own experiences and are challenged to correct their way of thinking or otherwise confront their own character flaws. While it seems the movie is a collection of unrelated events at first, it soon becomes clear that they are all interconnected somehow. This is much the same case in real life, where our actions have a ripple effect in our society. I highly recommend this movie.

Brilliant Snapshot of Human Behavior,"Consider every stereotype and negative thought you have had about someone of another race or ethnicity. Remember any time you have allowed those thoughts to actually form words that come out of your mouth. Then watch this movie. Sometimes you will be stunned into silence, other times you will laugh out loud because in your mind, you think ""it's just so true"" or ""I can't believe they just said that"". This movie will stretch you to look deep inside and search for where your prejudice lies, where your fears are, and why they exist. Everyone is shaped by their interactions with others, good or bad, rich or poor, young or old. This movie reminds you that everyone is human, everyone makes mistakes, and everyone can be redeemed, no matter what country you were born in or what color your skin is. This movie also reminds you that the innocent often times are the victims and that the victims can suddenly turn into the perpetrator. It spins and weaves an amazing story about the lives of very different people living very different lives, yet they all have their families and their jobs and after all is said and done, they are all people with feelings and tragedy and hope and love. Truly an amazing film that obviously has caused a great deal of controversy. Kudos to Don Cheadle and Terrance Howard, who are brilliant, and to Sandra Bullock for taking a roll that is rather small but so out of character for her, and she is very convincing. Micheal Pena is wonderful as a hard working man trying to do right for his family. And this Ludicrous fellow, wow. This is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Finally, another important movie","Paul Haggis is a gifted writer. You can read his biography here http://imdb.com/name/nm0353673/bio. I heard this was an inspired movie and it has won 26 awards in total. None of this prepared me for the hard-edged reality this movie dishes up. It has some of the same feel as Memento, but this movie has more of a Hollywood look, and less of the quirkiness of Memento. I apologize for giving it a 10 rating despite the fact that it has production flaws. It's just that there isn't anything better out there, and at least one film deserves to get a 10. Haggis has proved that he can direct a great film on a budget, and should be getting even more financial support for his projects in the future.The film is an ensemble piece that argues that, in a world with Political Correctness, no one is really safe. In LA is where it all happens, about every 5 to 10 years or so, it even snows, at least somewhere, in LA. This film is about what happens one evening when it snows, and during the 24 hours leading up to it. Four of the main characters are members of the LAPD, two others are the District Attourney and his wife. After this is a film maker and his wife, an Iranian shopkeeper and his daughter, a Mexican-American man and his daughter, and two street hoodlums. The script and camera make plenty of use of parallelism and foreshadowing. For the most part the story pivots and weaves amongst these 14 characters, allowing our minds to make whatever connections we find most suitable. We may side for or against any of the characters at any one time, but if we do, it is merely a temporary illusion that has allowed us to do that, an illusion as apparitional as race itself.The Crash, which occurs, is merely a metaphor for the life-changing event which will occur in the life of most of the main characters. A transformation, in each case, that was ""meant"" to happen.In the end, almost all of the survivors have undergone a transformation, and not merely a ""spiritual"" transformation. The transformation is usually that their life has changed and they will never be the same person again that they were before the ""Crash"". One of the deeper interpretations of this movie may be that we should perhaps be someone other than who we are, but we have not yet realized the reality that exists within us because we have ignored or suppressed it day after day in our quest for a peaceful, secure lifestyle.You can place this movie next to Fargo and Casablanca in your collection, and be assured, it will not wear out its welcome.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good movie, But a little over the top","I just saw ""Crash"". I have to say it was a good film, defiantly better then a lot of films put out today. If you compare Crash to movies like Magnolia and 21 grams, Which are the same type of those interweaving movies that bring together many characters, it simply just does not compare. Crash is focused on playing the ""Race card"", and if you ask me the biggest problem about this movie is I think it was very overplayed in some scenes. In a couple scenes they take the things way to far out of proportion. This movie has that type of up close filming that is in your face and meant to be dramatic and intense. The only thing wrong with this is that the used it thought-out the whole movie, and when the intense scenes did come along this filming method did not have the full effect. The film Crash will bring you through a roller-coaster of emotions and is worth seeing. Just when you go, don't expect to see a Magnolia or a 21 grams.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
It was beautiful and meaningful,"A complex yet simple work that often maintains its uniformity and tells a story. The film ""Paul Haggis"" has a relatively complex structure, and this complexity is not an expression of artlessness, but serves the cinema and the audience's sense. This complexity has been solved in the narrative structure as well as the visual texture of the film so well that it does not bother us at all when we as the audience encounter this work for the first time. We completely understand the story and can accept this multiple story without serious ambiguity. We focus on the exact collision so that it may be an escape among the multitude of absurd and meaningless works that are the product of this weak cinema.

You think you know who they are. You have no idea.,"By the end of Crash, it was clear to me that the movie's tagline can be turned on the audience as easily as on the characters. The thing about this film that really got to me is that the actors, the writers, the director don't allow you to feel comfortable with yourself. You are forced to re-evaluate each character over and over throughout the course of this complex story, until you're left with only a partial understanding of the difficult and often unexpected decisions both likable and despicable people can make.Crash weaves together the stories of several groups of people from many races and levels of society in Los Angeles. A Persian store owner is accused of being a terrorist sympathizer. A young black man, working with a friend, rails against the injustice of stereotyping against blacks while stealing cars. The LA district attorney tries to balance his chances of winning an upcoming election with a possibly racially motivated killing. These and several more plot lines run tangetally to each other, touching at significant points to illustrate just how thin the line between right and wrong really is--and how much moral grey area one can fit there.The acting is tight and superb. The fact that there are so many ""main"" means that no one person dominated the film, but it also meant that we ere given a Hemingway-esquire treatment of each--short and to the point, without wasted and unconvincing emoting, or sloppy tug-at-the-heartstrings moments.Recommended whole-heatedly.",,Anonymous,Crime
One of the most honest films you will ever see,"This film was certainly deserving of the Oscar it won. It is excellent in every regard - writing, photography, directing, acting, storyline and character development. It just simply doesn't fail anywhere.The film is well paced and highly interesting - showing very versatile people in ways that make them seem completely three dimensional and real - so that the viewer should never fail to see where each character is coming from, why he or she thinks, feels, and behaves as they do and what their motivation is.The characters themselves, however, frequently fail to truly see themselves or the other person or persons with whom they are interacting.While racism and preconceived beliefs are at the heart of this story, I think it also has something to say about how the fact common courtesy has fallen by the wayside contributes to the friction in society. Almost every time one of these characters is frustrated in some way, they react with immediate anger, insults, and sometimes violence.The other problem these characters have, to use an old quote of Strother Martin from Cool Hand Luke: ""What we have here is a failure to communicate.""If only people could learn from this film how wonderful that would be, but I know that's too much to hope for.I gave this film 10 stars - and it deserved every one of them.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Its a personal favorite of mine, because i found the characters to be very interesting, the screenplay was amazing to me, and i thought it was very believable. I didn't find it contrived, I actually thought it was very open to interpretation, it kinda argues that not only white people are racist, that everybody has racist attitudes at times.

A series of events sets off their worlds to intertwine causing them to need the people they love to hate.This movie is directed by Paul Haggis (In the Valley of Elah) and stars Don Cheadle (Avengers), Sandra Bullock (Demolition Man), Thandiwe Newton (Mission: Impossible II), Keith David (Requiem for a Dream), Tony Danza (Taxi), William Fichtner (Black Hawk Down) and Matt Dillon (Drugstore Cowboy).Crash is a microcosm of the United States wrapped up in one little outstanding movie. The characters are very well written from their dialogue to their backstories and everything in between. The circumstances are realistic and well executed and the acting is outstanding top to bottom.

"Excellent Movie, one of the best of '05","Crash is a movie that almost anyone can enjoy because it delves into characters and brings the spectator an incredibly beautiful visual experience with incredible camera work by James Muro and superb story telling by Paul Haggis. While Haggis did once create Walker Texas Ranger, something that can never be forgiven, he did also create Million Dollar Baby, so that tells you something about his scale. The most amazing and interesting thing about this movie, is that it takes the actors and puts them in roles many people wouldn't expect them to have the ability to perform well in. Matt Dillon easily presents his greatest performance on film and Don Cheadle does a great job in not only acting but bringing the film to the screen the right way. The most surprising role in the film is the work of Michael Pena who delivers a very powerful and believable performance. The one thing that almost kills this movie however is the constant banter from Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges mouth. The constant racist jokes from most actors and paranoid conspiracy theories spilled out of Ludicrous' mouth are enough to take the spectator out of the movie entirely. Many of the jokes are in fact hilarious, but they often go way to far as to have to tell them once every 3-5 scenes, turning the film into saturated crap in some parts. However take a great job from both crew and cast and a very well written screen play, and add Mark Isham's incredible score and you have a Class A film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Flawed Gem!,"'Crash' is A Flawed Gem! Though Not worthy enough to have Won Best Picture at the Oscars, it still has some strong merits.'Crash' Synopsis: Los Angeles citizens with vastly separate lives collide in interweaving stories of race, loss and redemption.'Crash' is partly astonishing, partly bland. Its a strange film in many ways, as some of its episodes leave a remarkable impression, while some appear tasteless. I was particularly impressed by the chapter involving a racist white police officer, (played by an astounding Matt Dillon), who disgusts his more idealistic younger partner. Another chapter which is interesting is the one involving a black detective, (played by Don Cheadle), who's estranged from his mother; his criminal younger brother and gang associate. The rest of the chapters are either passable or under-whelming.Paul Haggis & Robert Moresco's Screenplay has its pluses & minuses. Haggis's Direction, on the other-hand, is decent. Cinematography is classy. Editing is fairly done.Performance-Wise: Of its mammoth cast, its Matt Dillon who steals the show. He enacts the racist cop who later comes in terms with his humanity, with brilliance. He very worthily was Nominated for an Oscar. Another impressive performance comes from Thandie Newton.

brilliant,"I have never ever seen a real movie like this. This hits you like a religious experience. At first, the race dialog seems ripped from the Spike Lee preaching book but the dialog has purpose, and that purpose is realized when the characters CRASH into one another. You just sympathize and emote and the last hour is just packed with heartbreakingly beautiful scenes. The scene between Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton is just so kinetic and intense and the scene with the Persian shopkeeper and the Latino locksmith was INCREDIBLE. If I was in church that would have brought me to my knees. That connection between people and pain and that silence was just so........real. The vibrancy is built from the vulnerability of the characters and their inability to truly change the situation but the worth of their questioning is noted. Don Cheadle bristles like a man on fire throughout this movie. You just vibe and you vibe and you vibe. No characters are given quarter. Ludicrous' idealistic robber is shown for his brilliance and his ignorance. That is what this is about. It is about everyone being imperfect and how perspective is so important to the situation. The characters CRASH and what remains is just so real to what humanity is that I think that Haggis is some kind of prophet ahead of his time.

Not deserving of best picture but still a good movie,"I don't think this film is a 10/10 best picture academy award winning movie, I do think it's a good movie that deserves praise for what it does right, but I think best picture is giving it a little too much than it deserves. The cast does a wonderful job with their performances. Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Brendan Fraser, Michael Pena, ludicrous, Ryan Philippe, Thandie Newton, and Matt Dillon all give very deep powerful performances. Acting is what this film really gets right, it's the best thing about the movie in my opinion. This is one of those movies where it takes many different kinds of characters from completely different backgrounds and intertwines their story lines and it asks the audience to ask some pretty serious questions about heavy issues that face our society and country. The script is well written and there are only a few parts in the middle of the movie where I felt like it dragged a bit. The acting really is what keeps the audience watching, the performances are just so well done and raw. There are some scenes that really do touch you in that special way and that's good because it's meant to stir feelings. There are a couple of African American male characters at the beginning and the one played by ludicrous is talking about racial profiling and discrimination and then they do something that is completely stupid and self destructive and truthfully embarrassing for the African American community. So that kinda ticked me off, and then you have a white rich couple who lets just say aren't the nicest people ever, even though you do come to sympathize with the woman (Sandra Bullock). And you have other characters that face Islamaphobia, racial stereotyping, and family issues. The movie for the most part does a good job with dealing with these tough issues. I wanted the film to be a little more shaking and remarkable than it was. It was shaking in a lot of ways, but I personally just don't feel like this one was best picture material.

But that didn't disappoint me.So you ask me what Crash is about and I will tell you this: Crash is about ordinary people in America from every ethnicity and how all their lives are connect. It's about the hidden and open racism that every ethnicity has, it's about the little things we do that can actually be a disaster for others, it's about change and to see the world through new eyes.In short it's about everyday life and how our everyday actually is connected to so many other people most of them without us knowing it.If you are looking for an action movie (as many people on my screening were) you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a good movie, that can move you and maybe even give you a new view on life this movie is for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overrated,"OK film, but much too short to fully develop the characters and the complexities of how their lives crisscross. The locksmith character stands out as a whole person, not the two dimensional, cardboard characters that you find with the rest of the cast. All of these stories are much too complicated to be told in under two hours. It's almost like this is the outline to a film. You would think that great actors, powerful themes and an enthusiastic director would make for a fine film. But it misses the mark in spite of the fine acting. The breath is literally squeezed out of most of the stories - not enough time to tell them. And with the clock ticking, Haggis resorts to gimmicks. Michael Pena and Dashon Howard stand out in this very fine cast. Paul Haggis has the makings of a storyteller, but... I had a hard time believing that all that individual unhappiness in LA expresses itself in racism and bigotry. But then again, I don't live in LA.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
the insight of a bad school essay,"This film has to be a contender for least deserving Best Picture winner of all time. If only those cowboys in Brokeback Mountain hadn't been so, well, gay...It tackles the issue of racism in American society with all the insight of a bad high-school essay. Some whites are prejudiced against blacks and think they're all criminals, but then some really are criminals. And some blacks are prejudiced against whites. But then some whites aren't very nice. etc. etc. When the film finished with an incidence of racism between a Latino and a black character, I realised that deep down, inside of us, we really are all the same. Beautiful.As ever for a Hollywood movie, it can't conceive of political issues outside of the personal. Thus, the racism of Mat Dillon's cop is explained in terms of his own father's experience rather than as an expression of any kind of structural prejudice in American society.One can only imagine the level of self-congratulation which must have been felt by all those involved. That's racism sorted. Now how about a nice movie showing how much we care about those gays? Just mind that there's no sex between men though. That really kills your Oscar chances.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Took me completely by surprise.,"When I saw Sandra bullock was in a movie I figured it would be something pretty light weight like Hope Floats. But Sandra Bullock has a relatively small part in this interwoven and complex character study, Crash. The movie, which has a number of very big stars and familiar character actors come together brilliantly to give us a showcase of the American identity, in race, and in our acceptance of others. So many stories come together to create a brilliantly subtle and awesome movie about who we are.The plot is too complicated to go into in a forum like this, but there are a number of different small stories, such as the cop who is a bigot, and who is trying to get decent health care for his ailing pops. then there is the black TV producer who sees bigotry in more ways than one even in his wealthy lifestyle. So many other small stories but those are some of the plot lines of note.The characters are quite incredible, and are generally much more real and substantive than a lot of characters in Hollywood films, but here the characters seem so real, they seem so multi-dimensional, the good guys turn out sometimes to be bad guys, and the bad guys turn out to be good guys. A lot of times in this movies characters no matter if they are good or bad turn out to be completely unexpected.There have been so many movies that have examined their perspective times and mores many years ago, some movies were so good at showing who we were as a society, and examining ourselves. there really hasn't been a movie in recent years that has examined our generation in such a way. As we speak society is becoming more isolated and distant, even from our own neighbor. In this culture of distance and isolation Crash comes up and examines the culture, and is set in a city that might be the epitome of modern day isolation, distance, and decadence: Los Angeles.The movie also examines the increasing multi-cultural society that is becoming America and how everybody, rich, poor, powerful, working-class, fits into it. Kudos to all of these actors who make this really good script come to life in such a way. I am sad that there are so few movies like this. There was a time movies like this could not have been made, with this kind of intensity, with this kind of social commentary, there should be a lot more movies like this. A lot of movies, even independent movies do talk about social situations like this, but the characters sometimes seem fake, and the story lines contrived. But this movie has rich people, poor people, every kind of person from every kind of background you can think of, nobody in vogue, not too many people that are extremely popular, the movie is just real, one of the most real I have seen in recent memory, this movie is a must see, and hopefully an Oscar Contender.",,Anonymous,Crime
Everything it's cracked up to be,"I hate to be one of those people who just does something because everyone else said it was good ( I wouldn't buy Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code if I wasn't one of these people), but fortunately I was like that with regards to seeing this film. I have no doubt that i would have seen it eventually, but i mainly wanted to see it because it won the Oscar, and how deserving. Paul Haggis (writer of Million Dollar Baby) is at it again with this film, which is once again a triumph.The script is a rich tapestry, gracefully weaving through a range of human emotions. There are several significant characters, most switching between being god guys and bad guys at some point, and Haggis manages these emotions with expertise, knowing exactly when to introduce the next piece of action in each character's story.Every performance is solid, with a standout performance from Terence Howard, who epitomises good acting, and judging by this (without seeing Hustle and Flow), he probably deserved his best actor nomination at the 2006 Oscars. Honourable mention to Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, who turns in a great performance, and a big 'thumbs up' to whoever cast him in the role, his fast talking rap skills were perfect for the role.The picture was very deserving of the Best Picture Oscar, and I wait in anticipation for Paul Haggis' next effort",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Just go and see this movie; do not ask or loose even one minute,"It is not fair to say that CRASH is the best 2005 movie. CRASH is the best movie of the last five years or probably the last decade.CRASH can be compared with Altman's SHORTCUTS or with MAGNOLIA; however is better than the first one and far-far better than the second is. While those movies try to explain the human relations in a metaphorical or intellectual way; sometimes using images without any real significance (like the frog's rain in MAGNOLIA) or long and sometimes boring monologues (just to justify some actor's ego); or focus mostly on a mid-to-high class, CRASH use real day to day situations and people, from every social level.Trying to tell the history is difficult. Let's say that a chain of events create temporary situations between unlike to be together humans beings. A wealthy couple is robbed from his SUV in a rich LA district; looking for the car a frustrated stops a black couple and abuse the woman in front of her husband. This humiliation causes a crisis in the couple and a meditation of ethnic rights. Similar abuse an Arab in a store (the store clerk calls him OSAMA and blames him for throwing 747 in American buildings).The first half hour of the movie, looks like everything is about racial conflicts; which is somewhat a tricky subject even when the arguments are acceptable, but suddenly more twist of events, shows another side on almost every character.The characters are so well defined (even in very short scenes) that at least three situations generate more horror or suspense than all RINGS movies together (without using any ghost).The acting is outstanding. Every actor put his or her ego aside and play their part no matter how risky they are. Sandra Bullock is very good as the hysterical and racist wife goes credible from the queen of the bitches to break your heart in the last scene. Even better is the rest of the cast.This movie is about people, about both sides of the coin. It carries the most important meditation about the human being in less than two hours. Sadly IS TOO GOOD TO WIN Oscar but at least give it a commercial success; so who knows, probably Hollywood starts doing GOOD MOVIES.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

You Thought You Had All the Answers ...,"'Crash' is a film of many intersecting lives charged with racial conflict in Los Angeles, California. It won the 2005 Oscar for Best Picture.Crash is one of those films that tries to seriously tackle a big issue from all sides, through many different characters and multiple plot lines. One of the negative raps 'Crash' has received is that it relies on unlikely co-incidences in some plot developments. Some people don't agree with this, but I did get this feeling. Some of the meetings between the various characters are quite unlikely by themselves, and the whole thing isn't helped by introducing all the main characters at the start and then just having them interact only with each other through the whole long film without introducing anyone else noteworthy. In other words, it feels like Los Angeles is only populated by these people, making their surprise interactions even more jarring as the plot twists and turns ... and twists some more.The film's tagline, said at one point by Matt Dillon's cop, is 'you think you know who you are? You have no idea.' And the film gets this point across at various instances by repeatedly scratching the surface of its characters. The victim becomes the bigot, the bigot discovers underlying humanity etc. Its a simple message, of course: scratch the surface (the colour of a person's skin) and you'll find depth.The film is entertaining enough and the tone is pretty much what you would expect from the above description - empathetic, serious, dramatic conflict and self discovery. The acting is good with Don Cheadle displaying a Morgan Freeman ability to make us feel what is going on underneath his sombre, still exterior. Thandie Newton gets the biggest scenes and crackles with intensity. Overall its good - there's one scene (impenetrable cloak) in the middle that gave me goosebumps and is now one of my favourite movie moments - but occasionally kind of florid and a little bit amateurish.Oh, and for the record, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a much better, focused film than this and should have won the Best Pic award.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crash,Great movie. Wonderful performance from Matt Dillon and the locksmith bloke,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A flawed narrative cannot put a dent in the strength of the characters, themes, acting and all round writing","A minor car accident is the end of the story. It is here where a group of strangers of all races and classes connect, whether they know it or not.It is a simple premise that sets up a Short Cuts style story of multiple characters and stories that only have brief narrative connections but yet, in this film, have significant thematic links. In this case it is race and this is what the film is about  not a car crash but a personal picture of a city that is split along lines of race, class, wealth and, simply put, the fact that people are people (bad and good) no matter where they fall in these categories. For this reason some people may find the story itself to occasionally be contrived, it goes to extremes, it pushes the action beyond what can easily be swallowed and every link in the chain is about colour. However to me this was not a problem because I understood that this is what the film was about and the focus was not this story, not other aspects of the characters lives (eg not a political thriller about a cover up) but about their views on race and the impacts they have.As such it is relentlessly interesting and thoughtful and Haggis has crafted a screenplay that works on so many levels. It tackles many issues and it doesn't pander to any one ethnic group  doesn't allow poverty to be an excuse or privilege a let-off. The film is in the characters and again it is impressive how well Haggis has, with so little time on each, avoiding clichés and created characters we care about and are able to easily understand. Haggis doesn't give answers  everyone gets their space to be complex, everyone gets their chance to struggle. If I did have to take a message it would be that ""people are good or bad no matter what colour they are"" but writing this sounds so corny and I assure you that if the film does deliver a message, it certainly doesn't force it down your throat. Yes the coincidences are all very tidy and unlikely at times, while the action does go to extremes to set things up, but if you are focusing on this aspect of the film to the point where it bothers you, then you are probably not allowing yourself to think around the theme  which is what Haggis is focusing on after all.The cast are impressive on paper but few scream out as superb leading actors, so I was surprised by how many were actually very strong, and kept the script from creating clichés (even covering the extremes of the narrative well). To pick one for praise is hard but Dillon works well with a complex character that you hear on the radio phone-ins all the time, that forgotten, oppressed minority group, the poor white man. Dillon doesn't force his point, he is honest to the character and he is excellent  you hate his views while also agreeing with them. A slimmed Bullock is also very impressive, she is fully in touch with her frightened, angry character and the script trusts her to do a lot herself  which she is more than able to. I have never knowingly liked Howard but here he is very good, bringing the conflicts within his character to the surface without being so crude as to use words to spell it all out (a compliment that applies to most of the cast actually). He is supported well by Newton, who has a smaller role than I expected but was still impressive. Fraser is solid and reliable, which is all the film asks for; he won't win awards but with such talent around him, it is no surprise not to have him shine. Cheadle is as good as he is proving he can be of late  his character is flawed regardless of colour and he is the key to a lot of the point (he is also blessed with the funniest line in the film). One of the biggest surprises to me was Ludicrous, a man whose music is so unashamedly unpolitical and booty-worshiping that I expected very little of him. However he avoids cliché really well and turns in a performance that deserves to be noted in the face of so many of his peers churning out offensive and demeaning ""ethnic"" comedies. Phillippe is another guy I just don't rate but even he is good here  his character is the ""good guy who sees no colour"" but assumes the very worst when pushed and is left with nothing to cling to; it was a challenge and I was very impressed by how well he pulled it off. Tate is more relaxed but he is natural and that is what was required. Support from David, Esposito, Finchtner and others is all good and helps give the feel of a film deep in quality, which it is. I know I have missed some of the cast out  but I have a word limit and I can't do them all justice within that.Overall this is not the film to come to looking for a simple, acceptable narrative because it is here that it is weakest. All the stories play race issues as their central theme and the events are often extreme and unconvincing. However this is not the focus  the themes of race, empathy, flawed people (not races) and other issues are what we are there for and the script does well to address those without forcing them down our throats while also avoiding cliché and making good characters with very little time. In this area he is helped by a great cast all hitting the target producing a flawed film that is also very strong indeed.",,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent,"Very different to what I expected, pleasantly surprised. Probably more a movie a college sociological student should be reviewing, not me.""Crash"" intertwines a bunch of stories revolving around people involved, directly or indirectly, in several car crashes over 24hrs in LA. Those involved include cops, gangsters, a TV producer, a politician, an illegal immigrant smuggler and more. We get an insight into their lives and situations and are left with a bunch of questions. Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? What is racism? Is prejudice ever acceptable? Like most modern movies, the decision is left to you- the idea of the movie is to get you thinking.The movie is shot extremely well, written brilliantly and outworked by an excellent cast including Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser (in his best role since ""Encino Man"") and a bunch of newcomers who were outstanding. It was also refreshing in it's lack of falling for predictable scenarios, often even setting you up for it but surprising you. Well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Oscar bait with broad appeal - yet a remarkably thought-provoking film and one of the most interesting portraits of L.A. to date,"Writing, directing and producing Crash, even through a heart attack, suggests that Paul Haggis is perhaps a remarkable individual, though not necessarily remarkable at any or all three. The result, however, suggests that he is. Crash is remarkable and noteworthy for a number of reasons, and could repeat some of the success of Million Dollar Baby (which he wrote and produced although, perhaps unfortunately in the opinion of this reviewer, allowed Eastwood to direct).The start of the movie shows the scene immediately after a car crash. A number of people start arguing, racist remarks are made. It is set in L.A. - a challenging city in many ways, not least for its complex racial mix.Crash goes on to look beneath the surface of such destructive attitudes by examining a number of incidents the day before the crash in question. In doing so it achieves not only challenging self-reflection but maintains the dramatic pace in a way that many such movies fail to accomplish.In many ways, American society (ie US society) has got itself into problems that are nigh impossible to fix (and often not for want of trying). With race relations, Haggis looks at deeply embedded attitudes and failings that are not only common to many ethnic groups (including white American) but where people are in a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" situation.Sandra Bullock (in a relatively small part but one of the best she has tackled) has relatively few pressures in her life. She is married to a D.A., has a housekeeper and a gardener, but finds she is waking up angry every day. An intelligent individual, she goes as far as seeing it is something within herself rather than just blaming everyone else. Her questioning goes further when she has a small accident (that lands her in hospital) and her 'best friend' is having a massage and hence too busy to help.Earlier in the film, Bullock asks herself: if she sees a black man in a white neighbourhood and (instinctively) knows that he means to harm her, she will be dubbed 'racist' if she takes steps to protect herself yet come to harm if she ignores her well-seated gut feeling. (Her gut feelings are not always right, but how often do you want to gamble when it's your life at stake?)We see similar dilemmas (also often over-exaggerated, misconstrued, or interpreted with tragic lack of streetwise, from the point of view of Blacks, Hispanics, Chinese and Iraqis).The subplots of various characters keep us glued to the screen; any simple value-judgements are confounded. We see the love and (sometimes counter-stereotypical) bravery of the most 'unlovable, 'racist' characters. We see the real people behind what others (ie others of different ethnic origins) see. We question the obvious 'answers'.The USA is imbued with ideologies that, whilst survivalist, are not self-healing (transferring the government of, say, New Zealand for 25 years might help). Traditional Christian virtues alone are insufficient to deal with such problems (the 'Good Samaritan cop not only gets himself in deep water but ends up doing more harm than good.) But so is populist psycho-savvy: "" . . . if we can't duck this thing, we're gonna have to neutralize it."" (D.A. faced with a politically problematic prosecution of a black man who's given him problems.) ""What we need is a picture of me pinning a medal on a black man. The fire-fighter - the one that saved the camp or something - Northridge... what's his name?"" It didn't matter that the hero was an Iraqi - but it mattered that he happened to have the common first name of 'Saddam' - no good for P.R. that one . . .The principled approach of Don Cheadle's character has similarly little effect. He tries to be an upright Detective in a politically corrupt system and so gets caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. There are very few winners in Crash.Yet the overall formula is a winner. It lacks answers, just as America probably lacks the ability to use applied philosophy to solve problems in its own back yard - at least in the foreseeable future on this issue. But it's integrity as art, its ability to move us - to laughter, to tears, to compassion, to shock - to enable us to look within ourselves, that integrity and independence of thought is quite strong and all the more remarkable for an American movie these days. It even lacks the self-congratulatory tone of Million Dollar Baby (which may be invisible to many Americans, especially those not extensively exposed to European and other cinema that is more art-based than big-business based). If you've had six pints of lager and want lots of explosions, Crash may not rock your boat but, for mainstream quality cinema-lovers, it is a breath of fresh air.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worthy of an Oscar,"From Paul Haggis' writing comes a stylish, witty, and charming level of dialogue that has something that many other films lack - sincerity. Having recently read an interview with the director I was acutely aware of the subject matter prior to watching, and once you are engaged in the film it is easy to understand how this could have all gone wrong. The key seems to be that this multi character driven narrative (like magnolia) contains characters of real empathy who do not tend towards extremes of reaction as a substitute for action. The style of the piece is also awash with natural lighting and documentary-like filming, which adds to the engagement of the viewer - it comes across like little snippets of reality. It is most definitely a humanistic film, as each stage passes and a little more character is revealed our perceptions of those people change, which in turns questions our own alliances with character in film. The cinematography was satisfactory although there are times that the screening quality is not the highest and in this digital age it may have benefited from being filmed in HD, but these scenes are few and far between and do not detract from the quality of the story. Therefore if you wish to see a film that eloquently weaves race, guns, and politics together with real heart then go see this, it will open your eyes (especially to the idea that Sandra Bullock can occasionally act).",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good review for some of us baby boomers....,"We were taught since centuries ago that the ""police"" were always there to make things safe. And, without understanding the origin of policing in our country, we accepted these teachings. It's always been understood that there are ""good cops and bad cops"" but in seeing the systemic use of their force on others simply because of race or socioeconomic status is very disturbing. It comes to mind how in my world we didn't have to worry that our family member may never return simply from driving a car, etc.So as an individual, who knows very little about the cinematic value of this film, I found it to be a valuable tool resulting in a sort of awakening to this one cruel truth about our country. 😢",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Truthful Anger Expressed Through Stellar Acting But Thwarted by Contrivance,"This omnibus fable is as provocative as its daring concept - thirty-six successive hours of hostile, racially charged activity intertwining diverse characters in contemporary Los Angeles - and contains some powerful acting. But at the end of it all, I was left rather hollow by the experience. Steeped in allegory with scenes that start with a key assumption (either on the character's part or ours) and end with some unexpected redemption, the novelty of first-time director Paul Haggis' 2005 film is initially powerful but gets wearing over its running time.Haggis ambitiously presents a multi-ethnic city full of unremorseful anger - where the inhabitants without exception eye each other with suspicion and ignorance to the point where the familiar epithets fly. Much of the early dialogue is uncomfortable to hear at first, but Haggis and co-screenwriter Bobby Moresco derive the shock value from the innate familiarity one has with the pent-up feelings expressed in such an unfettered and sometimes blackly humorous manner. The intense honesty of the dialogue is the film's chief virtue, as it is rare for Hollywood to acknowledge any race problem in its backyard. More often, filmmakers pontificate about it from an antiseptic soapbox (consider ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" as a prime example).A labyrinth plot has been constructed entirely out of the fabric of humanity torn mercilessly by racism, and the travails of over a dozen interconnecting characters make for quite a chess game. An ambitious young and white DA and his ice-cold wife are the victims of a carjacking at gunpoint that leads the wife into a state of hostile paranoia. She has the locks changed at their house by a Latino whom she myopically suspects is a gang member. In truth, the locksmith is a devoted family man who must face daily prejudices in his customer-oriented job. The carjackers are two young, seemingly educated black men who commit the crime out of an uncontrollable rage.A black TV director faces the humiliation of seeing his wife groped by a racist white cop, while his young, naïve partner watches with equal helplessness. A Persian store owner, constantly labeled an Arab, has his daughter help him buy a gun for protection. A black detective, saddled with his drug-addicted mother and criminal brother, is partnered professionally and personally with a Latina, as they to solve the mystery of a dead body in the road. They all collide in ways that are alternately compelling and manipulative.Most of the acting is stellar, but accommodating the complex plot with an expansive cast does not allow much screen time on an individual basis. Cast against type are two actors more famous for their light comedy roles - Brendan Fraser and an especially unsympathetic Sandra Bullock as the DA and his wife. With this brief role, actually with one confrontation scene, Bullock may just have overcome the hurdle that constantly befalls Meg Ryan - her perky likability has convincingly been subverted by a sharper, nastier edge of anger. I hope she does more such adventurous work in the future. Michael Peña plays the locksmith with dignity and provides one of the film's most primal moments when an angry customer blindly seeks restitution from him. Larenz Tate and a particularly impressive Ludicrous play the carjackers with intelligence and fury.Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton sharply delineate a marriage where they straddle precariously between their black identities and the white power base that keeps them living in style. Matt Dillon does some of his best work in the challenging role of the racist cop, while a surprisingly effective Ryan Phillippe embodies the moral ambiguity of Dillon's partner with élan. As the detective, Don Cheadle - who also served as producer - provides the authority to bring it all together. Even an out-of-character Tony Danza shows up in a cameo as a racist actor complaining that another actor is not sounding ""black"" enough.But there is an evolving contrivance to the story, especially toward the end when plot threads are sewn up in an almost too circular fashion. For example, there is no denying the power of scenes such as the second encounter between Dillon's and Newton's characters or the revelation of the dead body's identity, but there is also a sense of parable that undercuts the credibility of the situations. The fates of key characters seem to follow a similarly moralizing pattern as previously deplorable bigots show their courage and compassion under emotional duress or dyed-in-the-wool liberals tap almost too easily into their inner misogynist. Everything just seems too neatly thought out to make the movie truly transcendent.The DVD is surprisingly skimpy on extras - a throwaway introduction by Haggis, a by-the-numbers making-of featurette that focuses more on how the actors desperately wanted to be part of the film, a music video and several trailers that I fast-forwarded through. Haggis, Moresco and Cheadle provide concise though informative commentary on an alternate audio track.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Well written and some truly great performances. Hard and uncompromising, real life indeed.","Mixed reviews on the Internet, big cast, multi-angled story, to me it sounded like a few other movies that have treaded the same ground but still very interesting. The talents of Paul Haggis and the exciting casting of Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, et al, attracted me to this movie and I am thankful that I ignored what the critics have said.The movie is a group of stories of different people that all connect through each other and all relate in some way. It's a strong story, and quite a controversial one. Large in both it's concept and it's cast. I can guess some of their negative reaction has been due to the uncomfortable feeling the movie has throughout and the very strong nature of its content. It's a difficult journey, but well worth going to see.From the opening scene you're pretty much guaranteed to be shocked and uncomfortable, I know we were and we weren't expecting the tirade of abuse, one of the more uncomfortable aspects of this scene is that it's from a white man to a Persian, whom he thinks is actually an Iraqi. A very disturbing scene, and something that the movie is all about. The abuse doesn't just stop at the white American on Persian, it moves to Latino against Chinese, Chinese against black, black against black, black against white, white against Chinese, and so on.It covers how hard it is for people in L.A. (and indeed any city) to actually get close to someone else and understand them. It seems to be much easier to blame problems on others than to actually face up to them, and if this movie is anything to go by, racism is a very common aspect of this culture.The movie is telling us that if we take some time to get to know the people around us, perhaps make conversation and don't stereotype them, we may just get along a little better. Lives might even be saved. Don't make the mistake that it's all happy though, it isn't. Even those who think they have made the connections already, haven't done so on anything more than a superficial level.Couple these aspects together and you have one serious movie. Although it is hard to watch and it does make you feel very uncomfortable, it makes you feel something, and that is what cinema is about for me. I left in debate about the movie, both of us, and that's a great thing.Acting wise I was very surprised. Both Bullock and Brendan Fraser play characters well out of their normal sphere of acting, specifically Bullock and she absolutely excels as the D.A.'s wife who is very much on her own. If you ever thought she was a light actress you should see her performance here, strong with a well written and performed fear and growing racist anger, I can't be vocal about her performance enough. The only sad thing is that it is all too short.Fraser also acts out of normal character, he plays the D.A. and there's not a hint of comedy in the script, unfortunately there is in his face and actions to camera.Thandie Newton actually provides a good performance, although yet again she plays a woman with a chip on her shoulder and huge attitude, just like many of her previous characters. Yet she has more range here I felt, and she shows it well. Her frustration, anger and almost all consuming fear is so obvious on screen, and she really does give the performance a great deal.For me Newton and Dillon gave two great performances, and the interaction between them on the two different scenes give a very powerful message. Not only about the Police force, but also about race relations in general, and shows a common understanding between both characters. This is one of the most powerful relationships in the movie.However, the strongest pairing and the best acting in this movie for me goes to two non-lead actors. Michael Pena and Bahar Soomekh as the Hispanic locksmith and the Persian local store owner respectively, give the most heartfelt and strong performances in this movie. They, without a doubt, steal the show from the big names and quite rightly so.There are some poorer aspects to the movie though, I felt a couple of the scenes were presented in quite a contrived manner, and instead of events leading to them being quite explainable or understandable, they felt strained and stretched. A perfect example of how this could be avoided was with the second Newton-Dillon scene, no explanation, no lead up, the event had just happened and the important thing was the story that unfolded before you and the aftermath. That's real life, often things happen and there's not a need to overly explain the lead up.The ending, although not all good by a long way, reminded me a lot of Magnolia. Not because of anything more than a moment of plot device, but coupled with the same style of storytelling it was enough to knock me out of the movie and make the connection.Overall the messages are strong, uncompromising and often quite bleak. Do not make a mistake, this is real life and not a nice fluffy bunny tale. Despite some moments that are a little contrived, there are a surprising amount of exceptional performances to be seen and the story gives you a real kick in the head about how we really should be as people.

"Good, but not groundbreaking","""Crash"" is a good film but over-hyped; in terms of both craft and subject matter, it is neither ground-breaking nor earth-shattering.The movie's structure---following an ensemble of characters who cross paths via intersecting story lines---is interesting but not new. Director Robert Altman has done it for years, as have more recent flicks ranging from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Magnolia"" (both of which are better films than ""Crash"").The flick's subject matter---exploring race relations and conflicts, in LA in this case---is important, but here the script falls short . The first 45 minutes is almost completely dominated by unsympathetic characters behaving in unsympathetic ways, a problem that isn't solved by having most of them flip into highly sympathetic behavior late in the story. If anything, this sort of ""cheat"" appears as a feeble attempt to create a ""nice Hollywood ending,"" which isn't what you'd expect (or want) from this sort of movie.It is not the sort of movie I'd watch several times. Maybe twice. Disappointing. So I give it a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
a powerful and convincing portrayal of today's world,"Provocative, well-crafted urban thriller is a contemporary look at all the racism, fear, and stereotypes prevalent within our society. Story focuses on an array of multi-ethnic Los Angeles characters as they interact and unknowingly affect one another, ranging from a loyal detective trying to appease his mother (Cheadle), a pampered television director who gets a firsthand look at racism in more ways than one (Howard), two verbose gangbangers who feel justified by their low economic status (Bridges, Tate), a veteran cop with a short fuse caring for his bed-ridden father (Dillon), and his new, idealistic young partner who just wants to do the right thing (Phillippe). These characters, their lives, and their inevitable encounters with one another provide the foundation for the film, as it gives viewers a believable, in-depth look at the anger, harshness, and ignorance of bigotry and race relations in America. Strong, convincing performances and sure-handed direction make this an impressive showing from all those involved. ***½",,Anonymous,Crime

"36 hours of violence and racial strife in Los Angeles county, pop. 85","OK, so it's not quite as unbelievable as the frog storm in ""Magnolia"".

But the coincidences, happenstances, chance occurrences that bring the dozen or so characters together again and again over a couple of days could never happen in real life, certainly not in a major city.Film critic A.O. Scott was on the money when he noted that judging from this movie, the population of Los Angeles must be well under one hundred souls, give or take a handful of illegal Thai immigrants. And it's even more preposterous to suppose that nearly all the major characters in the film have had life-changing experiences in just this 36-hour period.And even in LA, does everything really hinge on race and prejudice like this?

"""Crash"", A Remarkable Film, Destined To Become A Classic","I never expected this movie to be as good as it was. I didn't understand why the cover of the DVD had twelve names, but it makes sense after you watch the movie; they are all important to the movie and they all have the same amount of time on screen. This is the first movie I have ever seen with TWELVE main characters.This movie is very harsh, dealing with racism in L.A., life in L.A., crimes that happen everyday, and the deaths that break the hearts of its residents. The Director and producers crammed all of that into one day, realistically. All of the characters where eventually connected with each other, and the way they were, was very shocking.Sandra Bullock is one of the main characters and in my opinion this is one of the best, if not the best, movies she has ever been a part of, and to top that off this is the hottest she's ever been.Don Cheadle is not my favorite actor but his role in this movie was not as annoying as I have seen, in others characters he has played, and again I also think this is one of his best roles, if not the best.Matt Dillon is the most likable rude, perverted, racist cop I have ever seen, he makes it clear early on that he is racist, yet you feel a sense of compasion because he feels bad afterwards. This is the first time I've ever seen any of his work, but I can say this guy is not bad, at all.Jennifer Esposito's role I'm finding hard to recall, but she is a very likable person and the girlfriend of Cheadle(In the movie).William Fichtner's role is some of his best work even though he has a really small part, although the only other work of his that I know of is his role in the ABC television show ""Invasion"", where he plays a very unlikeable sheriff.Brendan Fraser also has a small part in this film, a very different character which is a lot more serious than his role in ""Bedazzled""(A comedy). It's fairly good for a comedic-to-serious role transition.Terrence Howard is a very good actor in ""Crash"" he plays a black man who seems to be in a way in denial of who he is, he finds it very shameful and degrading to the black image when fellow blacks commit crimes. His role is powerful, and at times it might make you fell like reaching into the screen and slapping him.Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges is surprisingly a good actor. In the beginning he might make you believe that he is one person when he's really a stereotypical image of a black man from the eyes of those ""white folks"" who fall victim of his and Larenz Tate's rath's, but after it happens it is kind of hard to feel sorry for ""one"" of their victims, who might just be a bit bias against minorities.Thandie Newton's line of events and situations are astonishing and touching. Her role as well as every other cast members roles are a very big contribution to this movie, no matter how big or how small.Ryan Phillipe, this is the first role I've ever seen him in, his part just might be the most shocking or surprising of the film.Michael Peña is a very talented actor; his role along with his film daughter's just might be the most ""touching"" of the film. Together they are amazing. His daughter in the film is adorable and there are parts of their roles combined that make you feel a ""Heart Ache"" a good one, it's very moving, and I'm a very proud to share a last name with this talented man.""Crash"" just might make your emotions ""Crash"" because for sure; they'll be speeding throughout your veins, across the surface of your heart (maybe deeper), and if you can relate or identify with any of these characters your emotions will swim through your soul.

Hard To Swallow,"It's good emotional stuff at the time, but the very real weaknesses nag at you as soon as the film ends. It's a real fader. After a month you've forgotten all about it.Once there's some distance from the emotion, I have to say that it sucks. Issues are isolated and blown out of proportion just to give an immediate emotional intensity. There is a lack of reality, intelligence, craft and creativity about the whole thing. And I found the racist, sex abusing cop's back story of being a dutiful son and then being a dramatic hero somewhat hard to swallow - after the event. Yeah, sure, at the time it felt like there was some significance there, but on reflection you see that it was just a dramatic scene in a Hollywood movie. And any suggestion that even a racist can also be nice to his mom is not worth making, except by racists to excuse and justify racist behaviour.The confusions you feel at the time are the result of some blunt emotional exploitation by the movie makers. It's like a series of big expensive, well made adverts strung together, some saying vote conservative and some saying vote liberal. At the time the adverts seem to be saying something.

Nothing to write home about,"The script apparently had some promise but a series of poor casting decisions keep this movie from reaching its full potential.

It was nice to see Marina Sirtis again as well, and Brendan Fraser's hair looked great. Despite all odds, he and Sandra Bullock both managed very good performances, though their scenes were limited.

Otherwise, he is an out of control bigot, angry at the system for what it did to his father who practiced racial toleration and was victimized by reverse racism in his profession. Dillon has his moments in his emotional outbursts and could very well be walking down the aisle on March 5. On March 5, 2006 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences chose ""Crash"" as the year's best picture.

If only it had a bit more depth...,"This 2004 Best Picture Oscar winning crime drama from director Paul Haggis tells many tales about racism, crime, families, affairs and love in an intriguing if somewhat exaggerated film with a brilliant cast of actors.Starring Sandra Bullock (Speed) Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda) Thandie Newton (The pursuit of happiness) and Michael Pena, Crash has a credible look from the outside, and as viewers are given multiple stories to digest, it lives up to the star's reputations.The film justifies the crime genre by focusing strongly upon issues regarded in the media today, particularly racism. Discussed in numerous stories in the film, racism is portrayed negatively and very seriously, none more so than Ludicrous' character who rants about how badly black people are treated, just by what they wear and how they appear to other people. Though you can see the point, it does feel slightly exaggerated.The way it is talked about by other characters feels very serious and you can feel sorry for some, none more so than Pena's character who has to deal with a whole lot during his story, and his is the best to watch because in all honesty, his protagonist is by far the most intriguing and the one character in the film that was given the most depth and understanding. The scenes with him and his daughter are heart braking, absolute brilliant drama at its best, remarkable and the highlight of the entire film.The film doesn't feel as strong as it could have been. A few characters could have more depth and the link between them all doesn't feel that strong at the end either.However it focuses well on the issue in hand, there are great moments of drama involving Pena and Newton's character, Bullock should have been in the film more, it was well directed and despite it's faults, I couldn't tear my eyes away, a watchable and intriguing issue driven drama",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Thematically heavy-handed,"Crash is an excellent example of horizontal storytelling, for both what works and what doesn't. Horizontal storytelling is everything happening at the same time. Vertical, or linear, storytelling is what happens next. Horizontal storytelling works primarily by comparison. Vertical storytelling shows the development of one thing, usually a central character.Horizontal storytelling causes all kinds of problems, which is why it is very rare. First, there's so much cross-cutting between approximately equal events in time that narrative drive stops.Second, you have to present so many characters that you can't explore any of them in much depth.Third, you have to rely too much on coincidence to bring characters together and give the story some shape, some vertical development. Otherwise the horizontal spirals out to infinity.Fourth, you often can't find a way to end the story other than to just stop. When one story event doesn't follow necessarily from another, there is no 'right' final scene, just the last thing that happened in time.To deal with these problems, the first thing the horizontal storyteller has to do is come up with an organizing principle, an underlying unifier that gives a logic to the unfolding. Writers Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco use a subject, and this immediately causes problems of its own.The first problem these writers encounter by using a subject is that the one they choose, racism, is likely to blow up in their face. Any story that tries to talk about racism will appear to many in the audience to be racist. If the strategy is to show characters believing the stereotypes of the various races in order to reverse or upset them, the author may seem to believe the stereotypes himself.A second problem the writers encounter by using a social subject as their organizing principle is that the story feels heavy-handed from the opening scene. When you are writing an extremely horizontal story, you have to do many more scenes of racial set-up, so the first third at least of the movie is in grave danger of infuriating the audience into giving up.Crash shows all of these problems of the horizontal form at the beginning. But Haggis and Moresco know how to use the benefits of the form as well. For example, they know that the horizontal story, while running the risk of superficiality, allows them to set up a giant moral accounting system. Each character, with his unique moral flaw, gets his poetic justice through the help of every other character. This is cosmic, Twilight Zone accounting, like Vertigo, but on a much grander scale.With the thematic heavy-handedness in the beginning of the story, Crash's grand accounting program may feel a bit schematic. The more you push the horizontal, the more you stretch the skin and bones of the organic body to its breaking point, the more you show the contrivance, the mechanism, of the author underneath.But about a third of the way into this film, the benefits of the horizontal story form start to kick in. Much of the pleasure of the grand accounting comes in the pleasures of the comparisons, of who will show up to give a character his comeuppance. This is the pleasure of the grand story weave. It requires top plotting ability, and these writers have it.The story weave, in the form of reveals and reversals, is also what saves the film from being too morally top-heavy. Having done the difficult set-up work, the film can run a series of great flips: the car on fire, the little girl, the guy releasing the slaves, etc.Another benefit of the horizontal form is that you can set the firing pins to go off for all the characters about the same time, so you can give a succession of hard shots to the head and body of the audience. By the end of the film, these shots come with terrific intensity.There is one more bonus to the horizontal story, and it's a thematic one. This complex social weave is the story equivalent of a Breughel painting, for example, the large canvas of the village in winter where pockets of individuals and groups go about their daily affairs, largely unaware of each other, but as part of a diverse community where the hidden hand of mutual benefit is always working. In Crash, the characters are divided off from one another by their city and their cars. But in the rare moments of connection, these people, each with the same moral blind spot, show their essential humanity.FOR MORE REVIEWS please visit www.truby.com",,Anonymous,Crime
Heavy and dark but a positive dose on racial and social hatred..,"Crash (2004) :
Brief Review -Heavy and dark but a positive dose on racial and social hatred. Crash is a story of society varying cultural thinking and traditional mindset of people that brings some positivity for sure. Set in Los Angeles, Crash tells a story of several people with different cultural thoughts about other cultural people and that somehow is more about hatred than the kindness. But by the time film ends it reverses the mindset by giving an important message on humanity and sociality. There are multiple characters in the film with regional and cast diversity such as Black people, White People, Persian People, Arab and even Chinese people. The trick here of taking all the stories forward simultaneously set in different conditions, different place and then colliding each other logically works smoothly. Some people had to die, some are survived so you feel sad but it was part of the narrative and people shouldn't take it negatively. Director Paul Haggis took a gutsy script and delivered it accurately. He made all the actors act naturally. Despite so many characters and so many racial events, the film loses pace at some occasions which is reluctant. Apart from that you need a positive thinking throughout to understand what film want to say about humans and thier behaviour. Couple of incidents will make you emotional, some will leave you with a guilt and some will disappoint you but the overall impact still remains fantastic.

Makes an emotional point about humanity...,"This movie succeeds, not because of political ends... It's aim is not to say that America is full of racist and hardened people, it's aim is to point to the faults of human nature, and America just happens to be the backdrop. Racism has always existed and always will. The mistake is to focus on that. Racism is really just an excuse that humans use to mistreat each other. It happens in every country, on every continent, and in every society. No matter how much our schools or govt or whatever try to prevent it, it will always exist. There is no such thing as equality. The best we can hope for is just to get along the best we can. As long as each person holds on to humanity, then horrible things won't happen. Unfortunately, many people forgo humanity in favor of selfishness or whatever. This is the first film I've seen that brings it all home.

The benchmark for filmmaking,"Crash deservedly earned the Oscar for Best Picture, and it is not hard to see why: the intricate storyline, stellar characters, and complimentary soundtrack allows this film to effectively capture the inherent racism present in society, set across the sprawling backdrop of LA. Rarely can films make you feel as if the scenes depicted have enough realism to them, but Crash bridges the gap between comedy, drama and believable emotion.Casting in this film is exemplary; Michael Peña and Don Cheadle are the standouts, both giving lifetime performances representing minorities disadvantaged purely by their background. The former is the heart of the film's most emotional storyline, meriting a film in and of itself, a good-natured locksmith stereotyped as a gang member. Cheadle's character is more complex, a person torn between his loyalty to his job and preventing prejudices from altering his perception of others. A special (albeit surprising) mention must be given to Ludacris, a small-time crook who waxes lyrical of the injustices in society, whilst also stealing cars and making his own contentious decisions.Overall, Crash delivers twists unlike many other films can, and deservedly earns a rating as high as this.

The emperor has no clothes,"Decent enough film, but I do not understand all the adoration being heaped upon it. The acting was good. Scenes were well shot. But the screen play? Maybe my expectations were too high going in to it? You would have to have an IQ in the low 70's to miss the message. Subtle it is not. In fact, everything is SO obvious it's a bit cringe inducing. Racism does exist in America, but it is decidedly more subtle than it was in the 50's and 60's.This thing is so heavy handed and over the top with everything it made it a bit hard for me to watch. It serves up the complex issue of racism with all the finesse of a ""Brady Bunch"" or ""Leave it to Beaver"" episode - ham fisted morality is shoved down your throat ... and it made me gag. But I suppose it shouldn't be surprising, that in the age where Michael Moore and FOX News attract all kinds of viewers, people lap this up. In an unintended way, it's a sad commentary on American society that something so obvious and shallow has garnered such accolades.The script sounds like Haggis took a social studies report from his 10 year old daughter, polished it up and turned it into a movie. We get it. People are bad and good (except for Hispanic locksmiths). Haggis should have spent time watching ""Traffic"". The drug problem is equally complex, but Soderbergh didn't deal with it by using cardboard cutout characters and hackneyed dialogue.If after watching this movie you feel you've gleaned some sort of ""insight"" into racial problems in the US, I suggest you find a shovel, a friend and then proceed to have your friend whack you in the head with that shovel.

Not a Very Good Film,"Given the rave fan boy reviews I re-watched Crash thinking I needed to keep an 'open mind' about it. But it's even more pretentious on second viewing. Why the 'Academy' awarded this After School Special the BP Oscar over Brokeback Mountain is anyone's guess -- certainly not because it was a better film.Crash is contrived and predictable and its message about racism rings hollow. If this film were a dessert it would be whipped cream -- it has no substance. I couldn't empathise with any of the characters and I can't even remember their screen names two hours after having re-watched it. I will give props to Matt Dillon because I think he carried this overrated albatross on his shoulders.Crash is an average film with an aggressive marketing machine, nothing more, to all those out there pushing this dreck as the 'best film ever' -- all I can say is get a life.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Paul Haggis deals honestly with an aspect of human nature that we really would rather not acknowledge at all,"It is ironic that this ingenious film divides its viewers into two camps: those who are passionately devoted to it -- and those who are rabidly contemptuous of it. This is ironic, because Haggis' clear intention is to deliver some insight that might present some hope of bringing people together. Oh well -- that's the human animal, right? And the human animal is what Haggis is exploring here. I was distressed to find that so many people in Los Angeles took this film as a movie about THEM. It isn't. L.A. is an incredibly diverse place, ethnically speaking, and it has its very well-publicized problems with cultural and racial conflict. It therefore makes an ideal setting for a film about racism and prejudice and the darker recesses of the human soul.This film is clearly not a technical masterpiece; in fact, it has a number of obvious flaws in on-camera performance and technical execution -- the kinds of things that happen when you only get one or two ""takes"". When you hear its creator relate the story of the making of the film the reasons for this situation become quite evident. In spite of Paul Haggis' spectacular track record, every major studio turned this production down flat. It was simply too controversial for them. This left Haggis with a choice: abandon the project -- or go forward on a shoestring budget. It's a triumph, in my opinion, that Haggis attempted and succeeded at the latter. And its a tribute to the social consciousness of the major and minor stars who worked on this film for nothing (or next to nothing) that there are scenes in this film that will resonate with its audience for a long time.Long ago there was a Public Service spot that ran on TV for many, many years. It featured scenes of children of various ethnicities with a pious sing-song voice-over that went like this: ""You've got to be taught to hate and fear ... you've got to be carefully taught."" In those days, it was widely held that racism could be forever eradicated by simply bringing children up with an ""Equal Opportunity"" mindset.

"""Grand Canyon"" meets ""Short Cuts""  thought provoking button-pusher for the 21st Century.","CRASH (2005) **** Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Esposito, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard, Ludicrous, Larenz Tate, Keith David, Loretta Devine, William Fichtner, Michael Pena, Shaun Toub, Bahar Soomekh, Nona Gaye, Bruce Kirby, Tony Danza, Ashlyn Sanchez, Beverly Todd. (Dir: Paul Haggis)""Grand Canyon"" meets ""Short Cuts""  thought provoking button-pusher for the 21st Century.Paul Haggis , Oscar nominated for his screenplay adaptation for ""Million Dollar Baby"" this year and in his directorial debut proves a force to be reckoned with, with his provocative, hot button topic of racism running rampant in Los Angeles as a metaphor for the rest of the nation: a boiling pot potboiler.The common thread of good and bad people interlaced with class, social status and race relations come to a head with several vignettes of an atypical 24 hour period in LA where a too-bothered for a commitment or relationship police detective named Graham (Cheadle, who also produced) is straddling his affair with a fellow cop (the sexy Esposito), a Latina who has little patience for his indifference as they investigate a cop-related shooting wherein an undercover cop has killed another undercover cop in a car shooting which leads to a politically motivated fuse lit by the district attorney (Fraser) - who has been recently car-jacked with his high-strung bitchy wife (Bullock in a nice turn from her usual America's Sweetheart display) who can barely tolerate their Hispanic maid  attempting to avoid any disclosure of the embarrassing crime by rewarding a civil servant of color to win him votes.Meanwhile a bigoted cop (Dillon in one of his best performances) and his rookie partner (Phillippe, ditto) have just stopped a Navigator that matches the APB about the car-jacking which results in his harassing a buppie couple (the amazing Howard and Newton) who have been engaging in fellatio to make matters worse.In the mix are an Iranian shopkeeper (Toub), his daughter (the striking Soomekh), a Mexican locksmith (Pena), two black wannabe gangstas (rapper Ludicrous and Tate), a by-the-book black police captain (David) and a balls-out racist publicist (Fichtner).Haggis does a commendable skillful job with his tricky screenplay (co-written with Robert Moresco) and allows his fine ensemble cast free reign by allowing enough rope to twist and intertwine until the jigsaw puzzle begins to fall into place in how each little story relates to the other. His dialogue rings smart, true and all-too familiar with wit, irony and humanity ringing throughout like a clarion call to arms in its scathing, no punches held profile in how one human being can treat another without realizing they too are being profiled or worse misunderstood due to pre-conceived borderline racist beliefs and stereotypes. The most difficult is the good-hearted, well meaning but seen-it-all Dillon whose brimming with sarcasm encounter with a beaurocrat (Devine) when he is attempting to seek help for his very sick father (Kirby) and his barely concealed hatred spilling over with seemingly justifiable anger. It's a difficult role  a prick with good intentions  yet Dillon does so with a somewhat agile turn.The remainder of the cast is all equally good  Cheadle has some fine moments as anticipated with his stillness and disbelief; Phillippe as a green cop who thinks he can control situations beyond his grasp  particularly with his two encounters with Howard (easily one of the best working actors on screen today) a TV director whose light-skinned wife Newton also show her skills to be remarkably subtle and the heart-in-your-throat moment of an irate Toub facing Pena (who has a truly wonderful moment previously with his daughter, the adorable Sanchez, giving her an invisible cloak of safety that brings tears to the eyes) at his home over a grievous misunderstanding.Haggis has crafted a combination of what Lawrence Kasdan attempted to explain in ""Grand Canyon"" by a quasi-Altman ""Short Cuts' approach  mixing characters up in situations that are universal yet oddly alien to those he depicts experiencing. A truly damning indictment of America.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
In One Word Outstanding,"Perfect that's all what i can say..... I didn't like this type of movies in the beginning but after I watched it my whole way of thinking changed .

Despite that I don't live in L.A. or the U.S. but this movie really touched me Everything is very good in this movie director , actors everything and especially Ludicrous he was perfect I also like the tag line ""Moving with the speed of life we're bound to collide with each other"" but the Sex scene was really of no need at all the movie would've been better without it.

Best Film of 2005,"""Crash"" is easily the best film of 2005. Despite that, it is a very controversial film that has it detractors and some people really hate this film.The people who hate this film do so because they take it literally. Like all great works of literature, it is a parable for the the world we live in, not an accurate depiction. This is not a documentary. There is a multitude of characters who are all racist, victim, and hero at the same time. The snowing at the end represents that improbable things could happen at any time.The dialog is the crown jewel of the film and has more impact than explosions. The ensemble acting is first rate. Sandra Bullock only has a small roll, but gives the best performance of her career. Don Cheadle shows that he belongs in with the top tier of actors. The photography and cinematography is better than most. Only a couple of rock songs at the end of the film detract from an otherwise first rate production. The dialog is abrasive. The violence is sudden and shocking. People were gasping in the theater when I saw it. The film does not pay anyone any favors. It is sure to be offensive no matter what your skin color. It is an equal opportunity offender.""Crash"" is one of the very best films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Script,"This has some of the best writing I have ever seen. This movie goes to the heart of the race problem and show it in a way that we can all relate to and understand, but the best thing is the way the story interweaves the characters showing each for who he is and leaves all who see it affected and discussing it after having seen it. Everyone should take the time to see this movie and try to gain a better understanding of how others relate one to another. Beyond the script the acting is great! The filming of the movie is done in a very realistic and believable way so as to transport you right to the heart of the events. The emotion created in one scene in particular was so well done that my wife began balling and it was all I could do to not join her. Do not miss this one!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very good film-making and great acting but with a contrived script.,"Crash is a very engaging and original film that I think deserves much of the praise it has received. The acting is consistently great, the style is very effective and there are some very memorable moments. It's able to achieve a kind of raw power at times that puts many other dramatic films to shame. However, it has its flaws too and unfortunately they prevented me from enjoying the movie as much as I might have otherwise.In a way, the script is one of Crash's strengths. The dialogue is very natural and most of the characters are fleshed out quite well. Some very interesting ideas are explored, most of them related to racism but also some of a more general nature. However, I thought the script didn't hold up quite as well when taken as a whole.By the third or fourth scene, a pattern has already started to emerge. A few characters of various ethnic backgrounds are thrown into some kind of situation, take every remark they possibly can the wrong way and end up in a heated argument. This formula becomes repetitive and even predictable. Each character's actions end up feeling artificial - they have no sense of humour and they invariably end up taking things the wrong way. Although this makes for the most conflict, it ruins any deeper meaning the movie might have otherwise achieved. The abundance of coincidences does not help fix this problem.Once the script becomes predictable (almost to the point of being clichéd), it is difficult to care much for the characters. They are more like actors playing a series of (very) dramatic scenes than real people - I was constantly reminded that I was just watching a movie, not real peoples' lives. This destroys the movie's flow.One other comparatively minor flaw I felt Crash had was the occasionally distracting music. In particular the parts with the singing voice. The music by itself might be good but I thought it was just too obvious and dramatic for the movie. Plus, it literally drew attention to itself and took me out the film whenever it played.In summary, Crash is a series of well directed scenes with great acting and very good dialogue that cover a series of relevant and interesting issues. For the most part it is not at all pretentious which is often tricky to achieve. Considered as an entire film though, it comes across as very contrived and rather uninvolving by the end due to the script. Still, it's good and highly recommended for anyone and everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
You do know what happens when you assume?,"It's been only a few hours after watching an early Friday afternoon showing of ""Crash"" and I'm certain that I will be seeing this movie again. This movie sticks with me.With writing collaborator Bobby Moresco, co-writer/director Paul Haggis has managed to create a tight, challenging, and very fascinating view of race and bigotry and how people (in this case several residents of Los Angeles) are unable to or unwilling to view people as equals. The dialog is very raw and politically incorrect. When the characters are first introduced, it sounds like many of their censored buttons were turned off. Insult first, regret later.This format has been done before with varying results. (In my opinion, Robert Altman's ""Nashville"" is one of the best films with numerous characters. As of this posting, I have not seen ""Short Cuts"". I thought Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" was a mixed bag.) I'm interested in how Moresco and Haggis were able to create such complex characters when many of them are on screen for about 15-20 minutes or less? The entire cast gives performances that are worthy of several acting awards. From actors who have been reliable in a number of movies (Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton), to actors who gave their best performances in their careers (Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Terrence Howard). From the actors who make their mark in only a few scenes (Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner, Brendan Fraser, Tony Danza, Bruce Kirby, Beverly Todd, Keith David) to even someone I'd never expected to be than good (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges). I'll be disappointed if no one from the cast receives an Oscar nomination.As much as I was impressed by all of the story arcs, what touched me the most was the relationship between the locksmith and his daughter, beautifully played by Michael Pena and Ashlyn Sanchez. The conflict that threatens their lives provides a twist that was life-affirming.Just like life, ""Crash"" is alternately dramatic and comedic that resonated with me and I'm certain this movie will be talked about for many years. Congrats to everyone involved with the movie.Update (July 17, 2005):On watching ""Crash"" for the second time, I was still impressed with the pacing of the movie. I picked up several clues that I did not pick up on in first viewing the movie: the confrontation between the detective (Jennifer Esposito) and the other car crash victim at the beginning of the movie; in the gun shop, Dorri's (Bahar Soomekh) telling glance of the boxes of bullets on the shelf; Sgt. Ryan's (Matt Dillon) confrontation with the HMO employee (Loretta Devine) and her decision to let him speak after security comes into her office; the assistant (Nona Gaye) glancing at the DA (Brendan Fraser) while he was talking to his wife (Sandra Bullock) on the cell phone. With all of the scenes that were in-your-face, it was interesting to see the some of the scenes that might have seem insignificant but said a lot about the characters and their situations.I'm not surprised at the praise by most published critics. I'm pleasantly surprised that audiences have responded toward the movie. As of this update, ""Crash"" has earned over $50 Million and is ranked 95 on the IMDb's top 250 films. In perspective, ""Crash"" was released in the U.S. the same weekend that ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""House of Wax"". Even with its serious subject matter, ""Crash"" grossed more than both of its weekend movie competitors.I'm also not surprised at the positive and negative criticism of the film. On reading the reviews and the message boards on IMDb and reading reviews on other web sites, I noticed a number of people are expressing their feelings of a film on the web for the first time. This is not a movie that demands you to feel neutral at the end. Sure, the film is manipulative to shake viewers up. To some who think manipulation in movies is a negative, please explain why horror films are a hit?Some people believed that there were too many coincidences and that was one major reason why some people were not impressed. I believe the coincidences were there for a reason. Some situations do occur for a reason. Should there be an explanation on why things happen?I'm still impressed with the movie and I'm looking forward to buying the DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another Figgis Gem: Crash,"This is a second film by director Figgis that deals with the social complexities of LA. No one does it better. He takes the lives of a dozen people and connects the dots with stereotypes, class distinctions, race problems, parent-sibling problems, and even a few other minor social difficulties. He weaves these problems among the dozen or so people, similar to what he accomplished in American History X, also about social problems in a California city (Venice), without concentrating too much on any one individual character.
This ensemble-type effort has been done before in Hollywood by a handful of directors; some of them good; others bad. But it appears as if Figgis has it down to a science. His finished product is always polished, logical, and emotionally involving. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crash is about trash!,"If you are interested in seeing the usual stereotypes peddled to the extreme then this may be a good film for you. Otherwise it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of resolving the issues of all the characters - maybe I'm old-fashioned but I like to see characters at least find some resonance in their moral fibre by the end of the film, i.e. character arc. Was it me or did this film become 'jammed' full of bitter, angry, uncompromising,stubborn, narrowly-focused rugged individuals who only know that revenge and saving your own hide is the best solution of the times. Its very difficult to feel any compassion for these one-dimensional characters. I refuse to agree with this film's attempt to universally sell this idea that it's cathartic to scream, bitch, steal and generally hate the world when a stronger message could have been sent with this premise and with characters with bigger minds and fewer things to just 'say'.I found it universally verbose and stuck on the non-transcending solution of violence and remaining at the status-quo. The characters and the story did not 'move' me. I guess it did not meet my expectations and I find it quite surprising that it was rated so high. People who like this film probably aren't in touch with the real world - its not all that depressing, deprived and chaotic. This film felt like a grainy little piece of gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe.Overrated and completely uninspiring. Powerfully annoying.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Film searches deeply within,"It's been quiet some time since this movie came out. I saw it when it was first released in theatres. I'm back to comment on it, as it got some bashing for it's Oscar awards. Frankly, in the year 2005 - there weren't any top notch, note worthy films of mass appeal. There wasn't.I remember thinking: This movie will be overlooked. Theoretically, the award voters only remember movies from the last few months of a calendar year. I was surprised to see Crash was nominated - they hadn't forgotten it. I haven't forgotten that movie either. It's one of the rare times that a movie connects with an audience. It makes you: squirm, wince, look away like you've been slapped, slack jawed - the gamut of human emotions.People who blow off this movie can't relate to it, because their lives have been truly untouched. Untouched by, and naive of anything as traumatically experienced by the characters in this movie. The characters in this movie attempt this as well. To be insensitive to others' emotions and traumas. And the cause-and-effect they and others have on each other in the world. They portray realistic people trying to carry on in a cold unfeeling world.This world where people blow this movie off. They have not experienced what the characters have, nor know of anyone close to them that has. The world of soap bubbles, balloons, cars for birthdays, and occasionally family members that die of very old age.I wasn't a huge fan of Matt Dillon and his filmography of d-uh characters. Crash was the 12th movie I've seen him in. This is the first one that Dillon impressed me with. (The Flamingo Kid was enjoyable, and still makes me laugh, but I digress.) Matt Dillon was strikingly realistic in this movie. His character was beyond three dimensional. The entire cast was noteworthy, and it's difficult to pick just one outstanding actor in it. He was nominated for an Oscar in a supporting role. That's a puzzle to me. If you've seen the movie, it's an interwoven multi-story lined movie. There were no leads in this movie. It's that strong of a powerhouse cast.This movie kept me awake for much of the night afterwards. It was disturbingly realistic. I know people like those people. It was only the second movie I walked out of in my entire life. The first one was Mississippi Burning. That one, I left completely, and never saw it until it came out on video. With Crash, well I'm older now. With that, I left and paced the lobby during a particular scene. It was too much for me to watch. I cameback, and the person I went with filled me in on those five minutes.",,Anonymous,Crime
Nothing but the best from a Genius,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I went to see this flick, but being a huge Haggis fan, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. Boy oh boy was I right!

Expect to leave the theater profoundly inspired. I know I was.It is the true mark of a master when they can take as many characters, seemingly unrelated, and weave them all together in a breath taking, got you by the gut story.At a pivotal point in the flick, the theater I was in audibly gasped in shock, despair and yes horror. Not to give it away, but it is the moment you never want to experience, but can't look away from at the same time.

Tremendous film!,"I have watched this film only yesterday when I got the DVD with all the bonus, musical video and the interviews. And I must say that I loved this tremendous film with all my heart! I didn't expect it to be so great. Anyway, my expectations have been greatly rewarded. Everything is excellent in this movie - the play, the music by Marc Isham, the operator's work, the colors, the plot. The very idea is also very good - racism. We face it in Russia, we see it in the ISA, we come across it all around the world. Racism eats us like a rust eats the iron. And, what is especially great in this film, is the fact that those heroes who seem to be racists in the first place (like the policeman played by Matt Dillon) turn out to be kind, heroic people, and those who never seem to be any racists at all, are in fact the ones. The cameo appearances of Sandra Bullock and Brendan Frazer are second to none! Even though their roles are small, they play with such blood-chilling truthfulness that you don't hesitate to believe them. Excellent story is the one with two Afro-American brothers - one is a Cop, another is a criminal. The second one is shot by mistake and this tragedy shocks so terribly. The plot about the Iranian shop-keeper is another winner. The film is an absolute winner, an absolute master work, a true holder of all those awards and prizes.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Real People Collide in Crash,"Based on his screenplay with Robert Moresco, Paul Haggis makes what is essentially his feature film debut with a thoroughly involving drama of disparate characters in a series of seemingly unrelated events in and around Los AngelesOne evening culminates in a car accident being investigated by police and a grim discovery for one of the detectives. Flashback to the day before as a dozen characters deal with urban survival. A couple of idealistic, black youths carjack an upper class couple who turn out to be the district attorney and his shallow wife. A proud, Persian shop keeper and his wife struggle to keep their business open and safe. A locksmith, who is Hispanic, is also a loving, protective father to his precious five year old daughter. A repressed movie director and his combative wife are pulled over by an aggressive, angry cop and his younger, moral partner. These are people who are haunted by guilt and fear as they strive for some kind of happiness. As events unfold, each set of characters is affected by an apparently random act by another group which has long lasting consequences for all of them.To detail exactly what happens will spoil a delicate web of plot lines that are mutually supporting one another in almost operatic fashion. Haggis, who adapted the heartbreaking gem, ""Million Dollar Baby"" (and honed his writing skills on many a television series), has devised an intricate, multi-layered morality play on a grand scale. Borrowing liberally from the story structures of his contemporaries like Paul Thomas Anderson (""Magnolia"") and veterans like Robert Altman (""Nashville""), he masters the form with surprising ease and to the audience's edification. He does not dumb down the script but rather treats his audience with intelligence. The dialogue is on occasion wordy and blatant commentary while other times the words carry a bite and sting as they ring true to the human condition. Any edgier dialogue would start to become Tarantino like. Although there are several references to racial intolerance and conflict, these serve as more of a springboard to broader ideas and relationships.Haggis wisely avoids clichés thus keeping the events and actions fresh and original. When a scene looks like it will end expectedly, something different happens to change its direction in interesting ways. None of the characters is truly good or evil; instead they are full blooded characters who yearn for a better life while tarnished by their current affliction be it economic, physical, or emotional. Just when you think the film will go down a dark path with tragic results, it throws another wrinkle to keep you guessing and pleasantly surprise you. And when tragedy does strike, it happens in an unexpected, ironic way.Don Cheadle is part of a well cast group of emsemble players, many of whom reduced their payscales to take on what amounted to be supporting work. It doesn't hurt if the script is as strong and well conceived as this one. Cheadle is excellent as the detective who tries to help his mother and his often absent brother. Brandon Fraser and Sandra Bullock play the D.A. and his wife. Terrence Dashon Howard and Thandie Newton play a glamorous Hollywood couple who must confront racial and emotional issues. Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe are the policemen whose portrayals begin on opposite ends of the moral spectrum and wind up switching places. Special mention goes to Michael Pena as the locksmith.The city scenes are photographed with a gritty realism and the music, predominantly led by New Age composer Mark Isham, lends a dreamlike, aura to the film's mood. All the major story lines are followed through by movie's end with hardly a loose end. It is ironic that the film is reminiscent of a lesser, 1970's made-for television drama, ""Smashup on Interstate 5"".There are times early in the film that one thinks it will degenerate into a racially charged statement, but it never loses course. The roles both large and small seem more than sketches after awhile. You care about what happens to all of them, even the more criminal elements because they are real people. The film plays like a mosaic or puzzle of fragments and pieces that slowly but satisfyingly come together. Although there are more than a couple of coincidental events and incidents including car accidents that link many of the characters, the improbable happenings are easy to forgive since we are in the hands of a good storyteller. These chance encounters serve as a catalyst or storytelling device to propel the story further.Crash is an ambitious film with lofty goals that it attains with great frequency. Haggis should be commended for weaving an ambitious tapestry of lives and fate without resorting to easy, simplistic answers.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Do not miss it,"Before seeing this movie I had never heard of Paul Haggis. Now, if he puts his name to a movie as far as I'm concerned they won't need to advertise it. The plot revolves around the lives of separate groups of people living in Los Angeles whose paths cross in part because of car accidents. We start in the present day and the movie takes us back to show us how things came to be. There are many parallels between this movie and Amores Perros. However, unlike Amores Perros where there is no apparent point, Crash examines attitudes towards race and how it affects people's behavior. The characters are as varied as the sub-plots. There are cops and robbers, rich and poor, oppressors and oppressed, ""good"" and ""bad"", men and women from different races and walks of life.The magic is in the fact that you find yourself judging the characters by what they do in a scene, but as the movie progresses, you find there are no sinners, there are no saints, there are no neat little boxes you can fit people in to. The very act of judging and categorizing denies how just plain complicated life really is. You'll leave this movie feeling good about life and your fellow man.As someone who lives and works in LA I found the characters very believable. All the actors are wonderful and Sandra Bullock is specially so. This movie made me see her in a different light. A genuinely great actress with a deep side that you would never expect from all the trite trash she has been starring in. More movies like this one please Ms. Bullock.

Haggis finds multi plotting a tricky business,"""Multi plotting"", in which a group of often disparate characters with their own story lines meet and intermingle, has been a popular film format since at least ""Grand Hotel"" in 1932. Robert Altman, who was given a special Oscar in 2006 has used this technique to good effect in several of his movies, starting with ""Nashville"" (1976) and another recent successful exponent was Paul Thomas Anderson in ""Magnolia"". It's an effective technique but requires a lot of skill to make it work. It has a tendency to put an emotional distance between the audience and the characters, making it harder for viewers to identify with them, and one can finish up feeling one is just observing pond life through a microscope.In this film, writer/director Paul Haggis, a very experienced TV producer, gives us some well-rounded characters, such as Don Cheadle's amiable black detective, but others, if not cardboard cut-outs are rather flat, such as Sandra Bullock's angry housewife Jean, and her slimy District Attorney husband Rick (Brendan Fraser). Other characters are shameless exercises in audience manipulation, for example Matt Dillon's very well acted white racist LAPD operative who after behaving very badly towards a middle-class couple, saves the wife from a fiery death. Just to press the point home we also discover he is an attentive son to his ailing elderly father (and engaged in a battle over Dad's health insurance cover with an unsympathetic black bureaucrat).It was difficult to have much sympathy for the Iranian storeowner who was unable to recognise that he, and not the latino locksmith was responsible for making the store easier to burgle. Maybe we would understand him better if we knew, say, that he used to work for the Shah's secret police. There is plenty of tension when he confronts the locksmith with a gun, but once again our emotions are manipulated (via the locksmith's daughter).Again, the black car-jacking desperados are such obvious dickheads it is difficult to empathise with them also, but the story line is manipulated in such a way as to put them in a different light.It has to be said most of the acting is first-rate and the story lines are well handled, though there are some loose ends. It was only right at the end I realised that after the first scene (at the crash  no more than a fender bender) that the whole film is in flashback  frankly I thought that was too tricky. Oscar material? Really, no. I haven't seen ""Munich"" but ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Capote"" and ""Goodnight and Good Luck"" are all superior in their different ways. So how did it win? Well, more than half the academy live in the LA area and obviously thought the film told it how it is, or how it feels to be an Angelino. As an outsider though, I am at the other end of the microscope.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Everyone is a unlikable racist. And it's been a while since I saw a movie with this many, this annoying characters. Like 95% of them, I just wish they'd die. And everyone is a complete asshole.Crash only has one really good scene. But I have to admit though, that a couple of the not-so-good scenes did get to me a little. There's some emotional stuff here, and some of it works. A lot doesn't, but some works.Some of the dialog is just plain idiotic. It is so forced, nobody would react like these people do. Most of the major plot points could super easily have been avoided if the characters had talked to each other like normal people, and not in the stupid drama-movie-way that they do.I went into this expecting a solid drama, but once again I am disappointed by a so called ""good"" movie.

Too Intense For Young Children With Little Meaning,"Sandra Bullock & Tony Danza head an ensemble diversified cast in this movie set in Christmas time LA. Paul Hagis whose writing work runs the gamut from good in Million Dollar Baby to poor in Quantum Of Solace directs his 7th film here. He wrote the screenplay as well.While this is a good intense drama which tries to look realistically at racism in a modern diversified LA, it does get too melodically preachy towards the end of the film. It presents many views of racial hate but does not really get deep enough into its characters to show the real meaning from which the hate stems.The production obviously has some expense thrown into the film and the money shows. At least this is better than some of Hagis other work but when you look at the film as a whole, it is as inconsistent as his resume. Hagis worked on Flags of Our Fathers with Eastwood which is the weaker of the two films (Letters From Iwo Jima being the better other). Million Dollar Baby for all its good stuff, has too much card board in its main characters too.It appears Hagis work varies depending upon who he is working with. Here where he is on his own, the result is decidedly a mixed bag. There is a lot of drama & meat hung out here through the story lines, but the movie just sort of ends which in a way is like the real world but since there is obviously some contrived stuff here, that ending is not satisfactory for this film. The film dilutes it's main powerful racism message in an effort to be ""politcally correct"" which comes off as melancholy.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

I suppose this might have to do with the nature of the experience, the juxtaposition of the lives of the several challenged individuals, the involvement of the actors and possible non-involvement of some, and perhaps even the order in which scenes were filmed. While I enjoyed this film, I do not see in it the same power of statement that I saw in Boyz and the Hood, for example. I also see that some of it rings true and then much of it also rings false. Of course, there is always the big problem inherent in all motion pictures of using stereotypical behavior to send the big message, after all it is only a two hour or so experience and a lot has to be said, and stereotypes help us to GET IT?! quickly. That's a tough thing for a film intent on breaking down stereotypes to rely upon. If you think there's no stereotyping here, you'd better look at it again and pay close attention to the Asian portrayals, the temperamental Persian man, and Sandra Bullock and hubby. Oh, I almost forgot the gun shop owner, Hollywood's idea of every American male between LA and NY City. A very good, nearly great work, but not the best of the year. Of course that's purely ""in my opinion"", please do not take it personally. You should see this film regardless, and it is better than the other one it beat out.",,Anonymous,Crime

Crash revives the true meaning of cinematography and breathes new life into the essence of drama,"Crash convincingly surpasses all of the competition while reviving the true meaning of cinematography and breathes new life into the essence of drama.I have seen a plethora of critically acclaimed box office hits recently and so far 'Crash' is on a small list of movies that left me at the edge of my seat clutching the remote for dear life. How much more witty can the writers of that film get!! No special effects and grand sets! Just good old-fashioned acting. This movie addresses real issues that are very prevalent in society today and it shows us the irony of life. It reveals to us how we are all in some way intertwined and that life is a fragile thing in a fragile world and faith in God is the only firm solution. It exposes our prejudices(all of us, black, white, Asian, Latin...), prompting us to realize that none is no better than the other.

It makes full and complete sense why it won awards. Anyone bashing it likely needs to take a further look at themselves in the mirror and analyze their own journey with race and prejudice.10/10 on this one, it's well worth a watch, even now in 2024, since unfortunately there still exists quite a bit of racial issues that are prevalent even today.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Truest movie ever!,"This movie is amazing. It connects many people together and is centered on racial stereotypes in America. the races/ethnicities addressed are Black, White, Latino, Chinese, Persian etc. The film basically shows how one Crash can lead into several seemingly unrelated incidents meeting each other. There is no central character in the movie, however brilliant performances from each one of them. Matt Dillon plays a racist cop who in the end learns a valuable lesson, Luda-cris makes a breakthrough performance as an over-apprehensive black man, with a distaste for white people. Sandra Bullock, Tarrence Dashon Howard and Ryan Phillipe are also exceptional. You cannot understand the movie if you start watching it halfway, as connections to events or things said earlier have to be made. The movie leaves one with a weird feeling whatever race one may be.

Nashville for the 00s,"The comparison to Robert Altman is deliberate, and fans of Altman will find a lot to like here. Los Angeles is the canvas and we get to see it in cross-section: by race, class, gender, ethnicity, income. There is a lot of coincidence at work here to weave these diverse strands together, but in surprising ways. As they intertwine, we learn a lot about each individual strand: those we dislike at first are humanized, those we give easy sympathy to are frequently shown in a harsher light.The acting is uniformly excellent. Surprises include a loud-mouthed Ludicrous (Chris Bridges, Matt Dillon who has never been this good before, and Michael Pena in an understated role as a father trying to reassure his child. The always excellent Don Cheadle gives the movie its center, though he get no more screen time than the other main characters.There is humor here, too, the hard-edged, sometimes mean-spirited jokes you tell when you're not being PC.

Provocative,"This movie centres around race and racial issues which arise in the multicultural city of Los Angeles. Director/writer Paul Haggis aims to do this by interlinking several mini-stories...and does so brilliantly.The cast is superb, all turning in brilliant performances, including rapper Ludicrous who has shown he has a future in film. Perhaps the most powerful performance came from Ryan Phillippe, whose character personifies the message that Crash tries to get across; we are capable of anything, both in views and actions.Paul Haggis has shown that his transition from TV to film is more than successful, with Crash and his screenplay work on Million Dollar Baby occupying #68 and #67 respectively in IMDb's Top 250. In my personal opinion, I feel that this is close to, if not the best movie I have ever seen. I am not aware of the requirements of a film being considered for the Academy Awards (this is a 2004 film...should it have been considered at the 2004 Oscars?), but I think this film should receive mentions.It's unlikely that Best Actor/Actress will come up, mainly due to the nature of several stories and no one actor/actress predominating over the others.

Shock corridors,"Screenwriter Paul Haggis' Ameican directorial debut, ""Crash,"" is over-ambitious, but so is Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" and so is Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts,"" two films ""Crash"" resembles in being set in L.A. and in spinning out multiple story lines that it weaves together in a complex and thought-provoking way over the course of a few intense days of screen action.Haggis's ambition isn't limited to his involving us in a couple dozen characters. It's also seen in the way he tackles the topics of alienation and racism in American cities (or is it just L.A.?).Where ""Short Cuts"" was based on the quirky, specific short stories of Raymond Carver and ""Magnolia"" goes into rich emotional depth in exploring its main characters (even the shallow ones like Tom Cruise's Frank T.J. Mackey are devastatingly laid bare), Haggis's characters in ""Crash"" tend to be generic and two-dimensional.The two dimensions do, however, provide the rounding effect of contrast. The characters are both racists and victims of racism and most of them have some other major opposing aspect. The racist Officer Ryan -- Matt Dillon, for once using his Irishness in a blunt, unflattering way -- humiliates and abuses a well-off, accomplished black man and his wife, Cameron and Christine (Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton), but he tenderly cares for his ailing father at night, and later rescues a black woman in mortal danger. Graham (Don Cheadle), the bookend and stage manager of the movie, is quick to spot the racism of others, yet crudely stereotypes his Latina girlfriend. Another character is first pathetically self abasing, then later suicidally aggressive. Ryan's unwilling partner, Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillippe), gets reassigned to avoid the racism, but himself commits an act of racist violence. A young black man with corn rows named Anthony (Ludacris) chatters on perceptively with his pal Peter (Larenz Tate) about how they're stereotyped as ghetto toughs when they really look like UCLA students; but in fact they're car-jackers. And so on. However simplistically, the characters are all given dimensionality through having opposing characteristics. Even the endlessly bitchy wife Jean (Sandra Bullock) of D.A. Rick (Brendan Fraser) who seems without a single redeeming feature finally falls helplessly into the arms of her Latina housekeeper and thereby gains an air of humanity.None of this has the depth of ""Magnolia"" or the specificity of ""Short Cuts,"" but it has undeniable power. ""Crash"" is relentless in pouring out calamity after calamity and isn't much fun to watch. The racist clashes, the slurs, the name-calling, the hostility are in your face from the first scene, where Graham and his girlfriend Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are rear-ended on a highway by a car full of Asians and Ria and an Asian lady immediately get out and start yelling epithets at each other.Oddly, since he seems to be both a peacemaker and a cop, Graham does nothing to mitigate this disaster and merely wanders off to examine a crime or accident scene by the side of the road, which perhaps is what they're there for. From here the movie goes back over the events that led up to this moment.""Crash's"" stereotypes can be grating, particularly a mean Iranian man with a pathetic little convenience store who is bent on shooting somebody and calls everybody he meets up with a ""cheater."" He isn't any better than the prejudiced (and probably frightened) gun shop owner who calls him ""Osama"" and throws 9/11 in his face, unaware that an Iranian isn't an Arab.One of the most appealing characters is the Mexican-American repairman Daniel (Michael Peña) who's called in to fix the Iranian's door. He points out that the new lock won't provide any protection till the whole door is replaced, whereupon the shopkeeper calls him a ""cheater."" The Iranian's mistrust leads to his shop being broken into and trashed and when the insurers won't pay he tries to take out his revenge on the repairman. The resulting shock sequence has been condemned by viewers and critics for being tricky and exploitive. It is, but an earlier scene between Daniel and his little daughter is the movie's sweetest moment and the only time when a resonant metaphor is born.There are other good things. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton are fine together as the affluent black couple, even if their action seems pushed to the breaking point. Ludicrous and Larenz Tate have a good rhythm as the young, not-really-ghetto carjackers. In fact the black actors are more convincing and rich in their portrayals than the white ones. Maybe that's because they're the ones who know best what racism is all about. You can argue endlessly about whether Haggis's screenplay is too schematic or doctrinaire. He obviously is not the film-making talent Altman and Anderson are. But ""Crash"" is an original, striking piece of work nonetheless. It is provocative and causes extreme reactions, so people tend to say it's a masterpiece or pure junk, but the fact is that it's simply a good, but imperfect movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Contrived and propagandistic,"I love when Hollywood intentionally gives us a good contrivance. What else is it when you go see a movie like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Buckaroo Banzai?"" These are films which are made to be extreme works of fiction and, as viewers, it is part of the experience to suspend disbelief.Then, of course, there are films like ""Crash."" Films which are no less contrived, no less fictional, no less fantasy, yet dare us to suspend disbelief because they are meant to be perceived as some sort of Brechtian reality. As if a pastiche of LA; the very sediment of America as if it were reduced in some great crucible,is placed before us and we as audience, can participate in seeing (in almost a voyeuristic fashion) what REALLY GOES ON-- WHAT RACE RELATIONS IN America ARE REALLY ALL ABOUT.No, I am not some right wing nut. Far FAR from it. But this movie is so surreptitious in the manner in which it portrays pure fiction as flesh and blood fact. It is, as I stated in the title, almost propagandistic. It is a big, unforgiving lie! No, I do doubt nor do I deny racial tensions and significant racial problems in America. But with ""Crash"" we get to be force fed Paul Haggis' world-view and we are meant to be shocked and disturbed at the cruel, unfair world we live in. But unlike being force-fed most things (like, ironically, Haggis), ""Crash"" can subvert you, and slyly make you a believer in this creation-as-truth (which is as real as Disneyland).There is nothing new in his directorial style. It has been done before and more successfully in countless other films.But I am not a believer. I have not been brainwashed. This is an ultra-contrived, overly-crafted, stylized work of fiction. And, as such, it is not very good.I know many of you feel otherwise. But this is not the perspective of the black man, the Iranian man, the Korean women, etc. It is a white-man's dream of them. It's a film to be viewed from the comfortable suburbs, with a two-car garage and a hefty mortgage. It is from there that you can really feel the angst and oppression of those who are dispossessed. From that perspective you can be disturbed and see the hardness of this film. From there you can see it all really is true. Because what else is there in that environment to contradict the ""facts"" of the film?""Crash"" is a creative, formulaic, FICTIONAL film that stabs its ideology at the guilty white middle class who embraced it. Fiction presented as fact. One world view disguised as many.It's contrived.

"Not just a film, an experience...","There is nothing like this film. So far I've seen it 3 times and I will catch it one more time. It touches on sensitive racial themes and ignores that they are, in fact, sensitive.

The characters are rich and varied (even though a few are underdeveloped), and each one plays an essential part in the film. One of the most unique things about the film is the way it portrays people who do ruthless or detestable things as human beings, which tests the way we view these characters. You will never be able to look at a one-dimensional racist character in another movie in the same way again, because you'll find yourself wishing they were more fleshed out like in Crash. Paul Haggis is obviously a wonderful story teller, and I will be rushing to the store when Million Dollar Baby comes out, as well as this.

Crash almost tricks us into thinking it's a great film,"Crash Reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com Rating: 3 out of 4 It may sound silly, but Crash almost tricks us into thinking it's a great film. For me, it was good, but certainly not great. You see, it's an ensemble film that has a few great stories out of its many. Like a symphony that has a great violin line, but a mediocre cello. It wows us with one of its elements to cover up the others. And although the others aren't exactly bad, they just aren't up to par with the film's best.Sporting one of the most impressive casts this year, Crash tells nearly a dozen stories that explore the racial aspect of American society post-9/11. Encompassing all races and the stereotypes that follow them, Crash delves into the reasons racial crimes occur. It doesn't criminalize the acts, but gives them humanity, showing us why they occur and not simply condemning the people who commit them. Problem is, Crash sometimes turns into the film I just described above: an educational film fit for a high school Health class. For many of Crash's stories, Paul Haggis (Million Dollar Baby) fails to bring the characters past the racial crimes they're story into more of a lesson than an actual story. But for the two or three plot lines that do achieve this, the result is nothing short of an emotional powerhouse.Part of this problem can be attributed to the film's short running length. With the reel running under two hours, it's simply impossible to flesh out so many characters. One of my favorite ensemble films, Magnolia, was three hours long. But despite the long running length, I felt like I had read deep into each character and could weave each one into the story as a whole. Crash isn't quite long enough to do that. It allows for the development of some characters, but leaves many out to dry with their overly didactic stories. The characters become defined by their acts, not the other way around.That's not to say Crash is a poor film however. Which is why I say it almost tricks its audience into thinking it's a great film. Except for the script design, every other element of the film is of near-perfect quality. The acting in particular is a high point. I don't have to sing praise for the veterans like Thandie Newton, Brendan Fraser, Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, etc because you can already expect their performances to be as good as the script will allow them. The most surprising role, however, came from Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges, the mind behind some of the worst music on the radio today. Ironically, Bridges' (I'm NOT calling him Ludicrous) character is a rightist African American car jacker. He constantly pontificates the flaws of white America and its prolonged discrimination against the black man. In one of the better scenes of the movie (out of pure irony alone) Bridges states his distaste for rap music, commenting on how it's diverged from the roots it began with and deteriorated into material that further incriminates his race. Does this sort of music ring a bell with Ludicrous? I think so.Crash is the sort of film that becomes a masterpiece because of its ability to stay in our memory. History's shown us that if a film's quotable then it has a longer shelf life. But beyond quotability, can the film really hold itself up? In Crash's respect, it can. We may sometimes wonder if we're being lectured on racism by Hollywood, but then we're pulled deeper into one of the two or three stories that truly takes hold of us. And for those two or three stories, Crash is entirely worth it.-Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A remarkable debut,"Like Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" and Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"", Paul Haggis' remarkable film, (his first as director), tells several stories over a two day period in Los Angeles around Christmas time. Naturally all these stories turn out to have common threads running through them and all these people are in some way intrinsically linked. This is, perhaps, a little bit too schematic, (coincidence piles on coincidence in a fairly predictable fashion), yet Haggis still manages to hold our attention in an iron-clad grip; a couple of these coincidences providing some heart-stopping moments. This speaks volumes of Haggis' abilities as a good dramatist and for a first time director, juggling so many characters and story-lines is both ambitious and commendable, especially when he can pull it off with such aplomb.The obvious theme of the film is racism and had it been made, say, even five years ago may have concentrated solely on the relationships between blacks and whites and with it's LA setting, may have had a few token Mexicans thrown in. (There is a good joke in the film when Don Cheadle's character automatically assumes the white woman he is having sex with must be Mexican because she is from LA and not totally Causcasian). But post 9/11 Haggis throws in the Iraquai equation, too, not too mention some Chinese characters, (who are, perhaps, used too predictably for comic effect). And if the first half of the film is made up of one racist slur after another, the effect is not wasted. No matter how often we have encountered racism in the cinema in the past we still squirm uncomfortably when Matt Dillon's racist cop sexually assaults Thandie Newton during a search.But what distinguishes the film is not so much the cumulative, vitriolic effect of the hatred most of the characters seem to display for each other but Haggis' deep affection for these people and his belief in redemption. This is a film of happy endings for all but three of the characters. This may be wishful thinking on Haggis' part but it can also make dramatic sense when handled with the kind of authority that the writer/director shows here. (Though the fact that it's the three nicest characters who suffer the film's unhappy ending is a bit problematic. I wasn't quite sure what Haggis' point was in doing this).He also displays a remarkable way with actors. The performances are uniformly excellent, particularly from those cast members who are not 'stars' or that well-known. Sandra Bullock is excellent cast against type as something of a bitch, but her part is small while Brendan Fraser's part as her DA husband is smaller still. The really outstanding performances in the film come from Matt Dillon, displaying both an edge and a depth hitherto unhinted at, as the racist cop who saves the life of a black woman he had earlier assaulted, and from Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton as the rich black couple whose falling foul of Dillon's racism early in the film changes both their lives. (Howard has an extraordinary scene late in the film when, falling victim to a carjacker, he finally cracks, leading to one of the film's many moments of almost unbearable tension).These set-pieces, for that is what they are, may over-egg the film at times but Haggis handles them superbly and the overall effect is deeply moving. The film never achieves the dizzy heights of ""Magnolia"" but then Haggis is still finding his feet. Personally, I feel he has already joined that small group of directors whose next film I await with great anticipation.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Interesting study of races and the common misconceptions that rule our lives,"To start with, ""Crash"" is not your average movie with an amazing storyline.

Absoulte Masterpiece,"Paul Haggis seems to have just popped up all of the sudden, first with ""Million Dollar Baby"" and now with ""Crash"" which goes way beyond entertainment and offers some of the most interesting, compelling and realistic character's ever created.The story follows several different people in LA, all with different job, different social status, different dreams, different beliefs. Yet haggis was able to fine commonality in diversity and masterfully allowed these character's lives to collied in the course of only a couple of days.The character development in this film is better than pretty much any film I've ever seen. Most films try to create an allegory, or if not that they simply conform to formulaic design. They create character's that can do no wrong or can do no good. In this film all of the character's are shown as having a capacity for both, just as humanity has its flaws and virtues in reality as do the fictional character's created by Haggis. There are times when the man that is made to look like the good guy does something completely unforgivable and the schmuck does something completely selfless and noble. Speaking from experience, it is very hard to create this kind depth in any fictional being, its even harder to do it when you have that many principal character's.The dialog was very interesting and smart. I can imagine it would be very difficult to create the variation that was included in this film. He used several different vernacular's for the different character's based on there social status, level of education, occupation, etc. It is so realistic that it allows you to be drawn in from the very beginning and held to the end.I found the cinematography interesting. It isn't on the same level as John Mathison or Matthew Labique but it was still good to look at. It reminded me a little of the look of Steven Soderburg's ""Traffic"" minus the variation of color tints. It was a sort of grainy image which gave the film an interesting effect, very dark and gritty. I felt it fit the subject matter perfectly.I was absolutely amazed to find out that this film was shot on only seven million dollars. What Haggis was able to do with the minuscule budget that definitely would have inhibited them in regards on-location shooting, scheduling and other things. This film is proof that the bigger budget doesn't mean the better film.This is definitely recommended. It is a beautiful film. Completely original and unique. This is truly one of a kind.

A pretty blunt and (overly) earnest movie with fine acting,"The movie is basically a 6, maybe even a 5, but the acting really helps. Don Cheadle does a striking job, but of course we don't expect much less from him at this point. Also measuring up to expectations were Matt Dillon, Keith David and Tony Danza, though his part was small. Surprisingly good were Michael Pena, Ryan Philippe, and Ludicrous, who, looking back on all of this, might even be the sleeper of the cast.Unfortunately, outside of the acting this was just an obvious, unimaginative, clunky movie. It's late, I don't really feel like getting into it, so I'll let it suffice to say that if you're the kind of person who likes ambiguous fiction, if you prefer art that asks you questions, leaves you with frayed and stringy ends for you to decide what to do with, then this movie is not for you. It gives you all the answers loud and clear, sometimes in the form of a cell phone ringer and the text that accompanies it.But like I said, the acting is pretty great at times. Certainly it's worth a video rental just to see Cheadle, and if you combine Ludicrous and Matt Dillon, you might even find it worthwhile to see a matinée.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
not much here is really of any use to anyone.,"I heard so many great things about Crash. It was one of the best reviewed of the year. actually, I hadn't heard anything bad about it at all. Everyone I talked to loved it. This turned out to be a big mistake on ""everyone's"" part. (I hadn't dug deep enough yet to realize that were plenty of people out there besides ""everyone"" who didn't like it. but that's besides the point of my introduction.)I think the main problem I had with Crash was that it just wasn't believable, at all. A serious dramatic movie isn't worth crap if it isn't believable. If people really acted like they do in this film, LA would be in a state of war. I know there was the whole Rodney King thing in LA, but that got a LOT of attention. The events in Crash depict racism on a scale ridiculously close to that of the Rodney King incident. I'm never convinced at any point in the film that the events depicted really could happen. In fact, I was just in Los Angeles, and people of various ethnicities seemed to get along with each other just fine. sure, there's racism out there, but Crash is about as accurate on racism as Rambo is on war.All the dialogue is pretty horrible, too. Totally unconvincing. I couldn't imagine a single character being an actual person in real life. Crash had too many of those oh-so-dramatic scenes where every line is something flowery and deep, and if you actually heard some one say it in real life you would laugh your head off. (Examples- the scene with the gun with blanks, and with Don Cheadle and his mom.) Some scenes were actually moving, like the car wreck, as hard to believe as it was. but these scenes were overshadowed by all the bad scenes.In the first half of the movie, almost every character was portrayed as a stereotype. I think this was done on purpose... I don't know if the point of that was for them to overcome the stereotypes. Even if they do overcome them, you have an ugly, offensive, and extremely weak first half of the movie.I didn't like the pretentious and over-used idea of having all the stories interweave. It's been done a lot, but it's never been done this bad. In other movies, the fact that there are coincidences is used to make a point of some sort, but not in Crash. I think this is the main weakness of Crash. they went to all this trouble to put a bunch of chance meetings into this film, and what did it mean that these insane coincidences happened? Nothing. The end.There's a lot to like under the surface of Crash... sure, lots of characters overcoming their inner demons, and fun stuff like that. but almost nothing on the surface to like. And actually, I didn't really feel as if Crash had anything to say. (One of the impressions I had gotten from other people before I had seen it was that it had a lot to say.) What was the point? Did it really show us anything we don't already know? Was it trying to show us how harmful racism is? Wow, racism is harmful... Who knew. This film certainly didn't change any of my views. Honestly, I can't believe it has ""changed people's lives""- give me a break. In order for it to change your life, I think you would have to knowingly be a racist before you saw it, and seeing it made you change your ways.Despite all of these problems I had with Crash, I did find some good qualities in it. The music was good. I like Mark Isham. I had high hopes when the movie first started, because the credits had me mesmerized. The music really enhanced certain scenes of the film, too. And, I'll admit that a couple of scenes were moving, although perhaps not genuinely. There was even some pretty strong acting. Ludicrous and Don Cheadle were brilliant. Unfortunately, Crash was still a huge pile of crap. (hah, that's fun to say.) I'd find any John Woo movie to be more believable.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

A day in the lives  and deaths  of LA citizens...,"As Paul Newman said in Cool Hand Luke (1967), just before his character was killed off, ""What we've got here is failure to communicate...""You could say that is THE theme of this well-crafted drama of life in La-La Land. And, yet, as you follow the lives of six or seven disparate couples, and how many interact during the course of thirty-six hours, the writer/director, Paul Haggis, brings a true sense of what it means to communicate, for good and for evil, and how what is said doesn't always mean what is said. Human communication is complex, and all too often, too many factors get in the way to proper listening -- really listening to what somebody is trying to tell you...Aye, there's the rub, as the bard once said.So, there is no main story  there are many different vignettes, many of which directly crisscross  or crash into  each other, however fleetingly. And, as the viewer, you see just what happens when two or more people fail to understand the significance of what they see, what has happened, and what they think they know. The twists and turns are delicious (I'm not talking about driving, okay) and there are some surprise moments that just might take your breath away... (The whole narrative is way too episodic to convey in words, in a review such as this; I could write 5000 words on this film, but that would bore you.)So, that's another theme: nothing is ever as it seems. There's always something more, something that might be hidden, unknown, unrealized. Hence, the consequences of getting things wrong are all too well played out by the great cast: gritty in its realism, shocking in the results, and all too true to life...Of special mention is the stark contrast between the racist cop, John Ryan (Matt Dillon), and the new, idealistic recruit, Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillipe) as they work through their differences on the job. At first, it seems that Ryan has no redeeming qualities, so much so that the young Hansen manages to get reassigned, away from Ryan, after lodging a complaint about him for harassing a black couple. And yet, Ryan provides one of the most traumatically uplifting moments in the whole movie with a selfless  and hugely ironic  act of heroic bravery, while his ex-partner Hansen  flushed with his own self-importance  comes face to face with his own fundamental inadequacy, as a human being, in the worst possible way. But it's all just another day on the job...Some critics might say that too much of the narrative depended upon coincidence. But life is chaotic, the universe thrives on it at all levels, and we all know that strange coincidences have happened to each of us. You wouldn't believe some that have happened to me, driving around the city I live in. Or, maybe you would?Don Cheadle, as detective Graham Waters, is the one character that the camera follows the most. So, on that basis, I would say it's mostly about him, seeing as how the film starts and (almost) ends with him on the screen. In actual fact, however, Paul Haggis remains true to good narrative sense and starts and ends the film with similar events, in this case, a collision between two cars. These days, what better icon for a city is there, anyway?Haggis has written and directed a film that owes much to Robert Altman, I think. Those who know the latter's work would tend to see that influence here also. As I loved most of Altman's movies, I found this one just as satisfying, if perhaps a little more jerky at the cuts and scene changes. But, I'm not complaining: this is movie making at its best, with a haunting soundtrack, and if you haven't seen and heard it, then I'd urge you to do so.It's quite violent in parts, there are sex scenes, but all of it is in context; nothing in this narrative is gratuitous. It's how cities are -- it's how they are...",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best of the year so far.,"I was absolutely floored by this film!! The creativity and depth that the characters were portrayed impressed me the most. In this movie, nothing is as it appears to be originally. I found myself and the audience expecting a scene to proceed in one direction when all of a sudden it makes an abrupt turn in another. After reading all of the previous posts regarding this movie, I was equally impressed with the maturity, depth and intellect in which most of the viewers expressed their disagreements with the content of the movie. It actually gives me hope for the future when I see people constructively debating issues as touchy as racism in America.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Absorbs the viewer in a way few films do. ***** out of 5,"Crash is an intelligent, well acted, thought provoking film that will be cherished by film fans for years to come.The direction by newcomer Paul Haggis is breathtaking. I certainly look forward to any future projects he will be directing. The score by Mark Isham is quite moody, and slightly in the vein of something like 'Requiem for a Dream'.What's great about the film is that the drama here seems so very real. I think it's because the issues it addresses hit home quite well. Not since 'American History X' has the subject of racism been handled so very well in a film.And after seeing this and 'Hotel Rwanda' not too long ago, I can say Don Cheadle is one of todays greatest actors. Also, Brendan Fraser performed strongly in one of his rare dramatic roles. I also liked the cameo by the ultra cool Tony Danza.Don't miss this.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Smart film-making, weaker writing","Last year, the New York Times Magazine featured an article on how good television has surpassed good film-making. The smart shows with converging plot lines that make demands on their audience for active viewing are largely absent from movies, which still emphasize a more passive entertainment.Crash doesn't do that, and that's largely the reason for its glowing reception, in addition to its natural cachet for tackling a ""tough"" subject.But the dialog for the film is clumsy and overdone, implying that racism abounds only in overt forms. Quiet racism is just as insidious and much more common: for every scene where Matt Dillon brandishes open racism with his personnel officer, there are thousands more where both parties know that racism is what is driving the conversation, yet neither comes out to say it.As much as the film-making trusts its audience to put together pieces of different story lines, the dialog doesn't trust its audience at all. Not a single act of racism slides across the screen without a spotlight and flashing arrows.Keep track of the stories, but don't worry about the point of any given scene: you can't miss it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Simply Stunning,"f you loved Magnolia and/or Traffic, you will love Crash. It is a similar type of movie, wherein various seemingly unrelated people and vignettes merge during the course of the movie into a whole somehow greater than the sum parts.Crash shows Los Angeles in all its confusion and contradiction. Across the board there are no weak links in the acting. To note every actor would take too much space in these 'mini' reviews, yet not to mention at least several would be criminal.Ludicrous and Larenz Tate shine as young black carjackers who talk more about politics and civil rights rhetoric than their 'job', and see their own contradiction as playing to their racial stereotypes. On the other side of the law, Matt Dillon excels as a morally challenged police officer, who shows the best and worst of the LAPD, and is consumed by personal issues away from the job.Ryan Phillippe, in, I must admit, his first role I have seen since Cruel Intentions, plays a rookie cop trying to make a difference in the world, and plays the character extremely well. Sandra Bullock, in a role a million miles away from Congenialty, exquisitely expresses the fears and anger of post 9/11 white America, and Brendan Fraser is one of this reviewer's favourite actors, whether in serious roles or others.But if anyone can be considered a central character in this stunning ensemble cast, it is Don Cheadle. In this movie he plays a detective all too well aware of the racial politics in the department and City Hall, trying to do his job well, and having pressure from his mother to look out for his brother.Throw in a middle class black couple, who have a very bad experience with the police, leading to marital difficulties and wondering whether they will ever 'fit in'; an Iranian family victimised for being 'ragheads' and not knowing why the perpetrators have got Persians and Arabs mixed up; a Hispanic father just trying to provide for and look out for his family, and this is a searing view of the American melting pot.Very much an impact movie, and nowhere during the movie can you anticipate or predict what is going to happen next or how it will all end. Which makes the best sort of movie, doesn't it? Double, triple, quadruple thumbs up for this one...",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

It does touch on racism, and it does play non racist factors, but nothing that is offensive, or that makes you really think twice like American history X. The movie touches the subject and it is well done, the actors did great, but it isn't ""moveig"" it is just good/. Thats it.... and i am not a racist, it just wasn't as ""heart hitting"" as other movies, and i feel some other movies deserve the ratings more, but watch i, and you be the judge.

I am a super big critic myself when it comes to movies but this movie Crash will be in my top 5, I really want to say this is by far my favorite but its way too soon to choose. This movie has an incredible message, powerful connection. Listen to the message Don Chedale say in the very beginning and it will explain this movie much better Sandra Bullock plays a role I have never seen her play, and that was a first, Matt Dillon made me hate him and love him at the same time. Excellent, everybody go see Crash. It will keep you on the edge of your seat.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Picture... seemed like a good idea at the time.,"""Wow. This movie has guts and a brain to match with it. The tragedies that can be caused by even a slight sample of prejudice are showcased in full light, especially with Ryan Phillippe's cop in a nightmarish link to the characters' connections. Breakout performances can be found by Michael Pena (an actor I'll keep my eye on for the future), Terrence Howard (very good actor - can't wait to see Hustle & Flow), and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges (that's right, THAT Luda). No one in the cast dominates the screen more than Matt Dillon, who plays an extremely racist cop with a sick father and, in my favorite scene, must rescue a black woman he took advantage of earlier from certain death. My only complaint that keeps the movie from receiving that last half of a star is the fact that while this seems like it should be a fairly balanced script for the ensemble, some actors (like Brendan Fraser) played characters who didn't seem as pivotal to the plot and shined less. Also, to those of you playing ""Where's Danza?"" look here.""This is what I wrote when I first saw Crash, when it first came out on DVD. This was before its now infamous Oscar-win over Brokeback Mountain for Best Picture of 2005. At the time, I gave it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars (9 out of 10 here)........ I still think the film is slightly better than the pretty-yet-credit-greedy Brokeback Mountain (not the first homosexual romance film, folks!), but I see its win for Best Picture merely as a desperate attempt at ending racism once and for all - not a reward for an extraordinarily crafted film. Crash is a good film, Paul Haggis is a terrific writer, and the cast did what they could (As it turns out, my favorite scene, the only one that stands out to me, is Pena putting his daughter to bed), but its aura - its very being - is just not as lasting as anticipated.I don't blame the Academy at all for their choice; I was even on the same boat. How comfortable would it be to live in a world where we would no longer feel the need to remind each other that racism is an ugly thing? Of course it would feel fantastic! At the time, handing out one of the most established and prestigious prizes this country has to offer to a film like Crash felt like a brilliant, society-improving move. We Crash-lovers all thought that hopefully, giving Best Picture to Crash will end that constant obligation we all feel, and no more movies, books, TV shows, etc. about racism will ever have to be made again! This mark in history, this ""Oscar upset,"" when Jack Nicholson announces the winner, THIS will change everything, right?...Unfortunately no.To be blunt (and this is coming from an Oscar-holic), none of the Best Picture nominees were all that amazing. My favorite among them was Capote, but I realize it's not the most amazing of films...2005 was a year fueled by political frustration (Syriana, Munich, Good Night, and Good Luck., the Oscar telecast was even hosted by Jon Stewart!). I normally never side with the family-friendly genre, but through all that opinionated muck, I found my favorite film of 2005 to be March of the Penguins.

A Deserved Best Picture Oscar Winner,"My parents got this on DVD and to be honest I wasn't all that bothered about seeing it since it is considered like KRAMER VS KRAMER , TITANIC ,and a few others to be one of those movies that didn't deserve to have won the Oscar for best picture of its year . Seeing as I knew it also had the subtext that "" Racism is a terrible thing "" I didn't want to watch a movie that was going to wallop me over the head with a PC agenda and seeing as we're shown very early in the movie a couple of homeys spouting "" Why them white people hate us so much ? - Cos we got these motherf---in' guns "" and a racist cop with his bleeding heart liberal partner . I knew where all the characters would be heading But...This is not how the story plays out at all and if you go into the movie with the same sort of attitude I had then you will very pleasantly be surprised by this human drama and I won't ruin your enjoyment by giving away plot turns . Yes some of it is very contrived but it has to be in order for CRASH to work in much the same way as you have to suspend disbelief in a horror film for it to work such as a car breaking down outside the house of a mad axeman . Yes it might seem ridiculous that so and so should happen to attend a crash involving so and so or so and so's relative just happens to be so and so but that is not the point because it's the emotional plot turns that gives this movie its dramatic strengthThis is a well thought out , very well acted drama that deserved every Oscar it received . In fact I'm very disappointed Mark Isham's beautiful score didn't receive as much as a nomination . There's two scenes , one featuring a car crash and another featuring a body being found that has the best piece of music I have heard in a film score since FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and if anyone should feel disgusted at last years Oscar voters it should be Mr Isham not the producers of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Also mentioning how great the story telling is compared to other films. The greatest part of this film is how the characters interact with each other and some how learn something during the film.

"""You think you know who you are. You have no idea.""","Paul Haggis has proved that he is a great writer with his adaptation of F.X. O'Tooles works into ""Million Dollar Baby"", one of 2004's finest films. Now he proves that not only is he a great writer, but a great director as well, with ""Crash"". Like the 'tapestry' films of Robert Altman, ""Crash"" is a complex film, interweaving many different characters and stories to create a portrait of life in a big city.""Crash"" takes place in Los Angeles where racism and blind hatred affect everyone's lives, whether they be taking it or dishing it out. What ""Crash"" suggests, like Altman's ""Nashville"" and ""Short Cuts"", is that the problems the characters have derive from a lack of connections with each other. None of these characters take the time to meet each other,or learn about each other. All that matters is the color of their skin and how deep their wallet goes.For example, Sandra Bullock's Jean, the narcissistic wife of the DA. Jean finds it perfectly OK to turn and run from people of other ethnicities, and to treat them all like low-life thugs. She even suspects her Latino locksmith of being a gang member, and wholly believes that he will sell her keys to other gangs. If she had taken the time to meet him she would have known that Daniel is actually a family man and a model citizen. But she doesn't know him, and she doesn't care.Or, how about Matt Dillon's Ryan, a cop who pulls over a black couple and molests the wife, Christine, on the side of the road. Not because he hates them for being black, but because of his frustration in trying to deal with a black HMO agent just minutes earlier. Ryan's father is suffering from a urinary tract infection and can't sleep due to the pain. When he contacts the HMO to see if they'll cover pain medication, Ryan winds up talking to a black woman who tells him the medicine isn't covered. Ryan later visits her office and tells her there are at least five or six white men who should have her job and don't, thanks to affirmative action.There are many other stories and characters in ""Crash"", too many to cover in detail here. The black and Latino detectives/lovers with severe racial tension between them; the eloquent, pseudo-existentialist carjackers (my personal favorite characters); the Persian shop owners who are mistaken for Arabs and treated like terrorists; the Asian immigrant couple who wind up in two separate car accidents; the list goes on. There are so many diverse people to meet here, it can seem overwhelming. With so many characters, it is amazing that writer/director Haggis manages to give them all time to become three-dimensional characters in the film's 113 minute running time. What's more amazing is that he manages to tie up every story so well. By allowing the story lines to bleed into each other, Haggis makes the connections they so desperately need.The film's climax gives the audience a chance to see that every bad person can be good, and every good person can go wrong. It all depends on who they meet, and how they connect. It also reminds us that these characters will probably wind up the way they were before they crashed together, but they'll at least be wiser for what they experienced.It's been a long time since a film stood out and demanded attention like ""Crash"" does. ""Crash"" is a big, bold film that will grab you instantly and won't let go until it takes you on one long, complicated, and powerful journey through the mess we call life. With Oscar-caliber performances, a brilliant screenplay, and a master in the makings at the helm, ""Crash"" is a major contender for film of the year. This is a sure-fire best picture nominee in my book, and you can quote me on that.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Do not believe those negative reviews that claim that there are too many characters and that all interrelated stories are too hard to follow. It is simply not true.

Open your eyes people! This is without question one of the worst films ever made!,"This movie is bad. Just bad. In absolute terms, bad.The dialog jumps off the screen and slugs you in the face with its thoroughly artificial banter, and then defecates on your ability to detect even trace amounts of subtlety.Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be especially bad. I live in the city of Angels, I can attest to that. What is so terrible about the bigotry in Los Angeles is its insidious nature. It creeps at you with a knowing glance, or a swallowed word. Until just at the edge of a full on fist-fight, It almost never comes right out and says, ""why did he have to be black!""I can see quite clearly that the car-jackers are black, the detective's partner is hispanic, the DA is white. As long as there is film rolling through the projector, I can let the visuals, music and words take me to that conclusion without just telling me the conclusion. Characters emote, and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions.That is a partnership and trust between filmmaker and audience. That trust is raped by this movie.A good film pulls you in directions as an audience, and it steers you with cues to drive to a point.

"A great intelligent, must see movie","Crash is not a movie for everyone. If you want a Disney fairy tale with a Hollywood ending, do not watch this movie. If you want a mindless tale of action, or romance, or a comedy - this movie is not for you. If you can't bear tragedy and abuse on the screen, this movie above all will be a waste of your time and money. If you are looking for an intelligent movie with intriguing characters and an unforeseeable plot, you can not find a better movie in the 21st century.Crash is about several people living in Los Angeles that deal with emotional and practical problems. Yes, it is a vague description, but I did label this comment as a non-spoiler so that's as detailed as I can get. I will say this however. From the very start, the plot takes turns that are absolutely un-foreseen. Those of you who watch movies to impress your friends by figuring out the whole plot a third the way through - don't even try (you will be embarrassed). One of the best aspects of this movie is how unpredictable it is and how it breaks stereotypes . The characters are all three-dimensional, and are loved and hated. The writing is amazing and so is acting.Despite all the great components of the film listed above, it is not without it's own problems. First of all, I won't use any specific examples, but Crash is a tough movie to watch and you will feel bad for 90% of the 100 minute film. The movie for the most part is not entertaining, the stories within it are dark and miserable. You must also watch the movie with an open mind - any plot turns and events must be accepted no matter how unlikely they may seem.If you can keep an open mind and deal with the darkness, Crash will be mind-blowing. It will give you a view on people and life no other movie does. Truly, saying that Crash is a must-see movie is an understatement.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a brilliant movie,"I have just watched Crash, and I have to say I thought it was a brilliant movie. The acting is excellent, and I was pleasantly surprised by Matt Damon's performance, very strong. The viewer has to pay special attention to virtually every character in the film; they will all become important links in the chain later on.I would have to agree with other reviewers on the subject of the race card, it is played a lot throughout the film, but not to the point of dominating the whole thing. In fact, although the main characters are black, and the ""bad guys"" seem to be all white, it is more about fear and ignorance of class, as it is of colour.Crash has a cast that will not be household names in the UK, but many will have been spotted in minor roles in other movies. In much the same way as Hill Street Blues did when it first aired in the UK, the quality of the acting and the script, makes you care about these people, as the series Lost is doing here right now.I would advise first time watchers to take note of all that is happening around the characters, however small a role it appears they are playing. The movie is really split into two halves, in many ways a case of crime and redemption.In the first half we are introduced to the characters, many of which would seem to have little or no chance of ever crossing each others paths. We will love some and hate others, only to go through a complete sea change of emotions later on.The movie in its second phase, then develops characters that played seemingly insignificant roles, they now become a very different and more important ingredient in the climax to the film. To avoid spoiling the film for Crash ""virgins"" I will not comment too much on the plots. It is better to let the movie unravel for you and allow you to make your own judgement about the justification for their behaviour.In closing, I would recommend this film to just about everyone. Get a pizza in, a few beers and take the phone off the hook. Then, with an open mind, sit back and be entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Their PREJUDICES are leading to > MISUNDERSTANDING which leads to > CONFUSION and that leads to > FEAR and fear leads to > MISCONDUCT. I will end my comment with some lyrics from the soundtrack (last song) ""You thought you have all the answers / something happened see it coming / You can't stop it ... "" What happened? People are RE-discovering themselves: learn how to see beyond the appearances, learn to respect, they learn to act like human beings again, because there is a human being beyond every black, white or yellow ""cover"". We are different from animals cause we have judgment. In this movie characters are judging misled by the first impression, they forgot to be human.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A controversial Best Picture win but a deserved one nonetheless.,"""Munich"", ""Capote"", ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and the favorite ""Brokeback Mountain"" were all great and daring movies but they never challenged cinematic conventions the way Paul Haggis' passion-project did. His ""Crash"" defies tropes and genres not in a politically but also socially incorrect way, through interlocking stories all set in the canvas of a post-September 11 Los Angeles. I had said about Cassavetes' ""Faces"" that it felt like a slap in our faces, ""Crash"" doesn't just slap, it literally crashes reality into our faces.The title gives you the right idea by using the metaphor of the car, it is introduced by Don Cheadle's monologue about people needing a crash sometimes to get a sense of touch, to forget how remote they are one to another. This is the same L.A. Tom Cruise had just panned the same year in ""Collateral"", a town of cold selfishness where cars eventually play a pivotal role in the way they make various intrusion possible, not all of them are providential of course. Indeed, either for a carjacking, a ride, a police control or a rescue, every action has its consequences, some tragic, some inspiring, some driven by the best intentions yet causing unfortunate collateral damages, and vice versa.Collateral, that word again. Not every intrusion has a cause or serve a point, most of them are accidental yet they have an effect, and the way each effect seems to make some statement about our humanity is a credit to the triumphant intelligence of Haggis' script. And since I don't want to spoil the film, I will only focus on one character, Matt Dillon as a LAPD officer. This is a man whose establishing moment consists on humiliating a black couple (Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton) during a control. In any lesser movie, such a despicable character would get a Karmic revenge. ""Crash"" ironically makes him the most human. It all works by contrast, most characters dodge prejudices or racism while having them printed in their subconscious, Dillon's character doesn't cheat with his views.And that's ""Crash"" power, it dares to challenge our perceptions of the ugliest symptoms of prejudice by showing us how deeply rooted they are in reality and experience, it's not beautiful but at least it's real. A rich white woman (Sandra Bullock) acts scared when crossing the path of two black kids on the pavement, what happens next actually proves her right and she even uses it as an ""I told you"" argument to her husband (Brendan Fraser). Yet one of the carjackers is clearly not as ethically challenged as his partner and in the end, he's hitchhiked by Dillon's rookie police partner (Ryan Philippe) who was shocked by his colleagues' behavior and asked for a new assignment. What emerges from that encounter serves a painful but valuable lesson to anyone who believes his conscience is cleaner than everyone else's.Indeed, ""Crash"" isn't about feelings, intentions or motives but plain actions, and reactions that translate themselves into action, and car crashes are the right metaphors for these revealing moments in our lives when we stop being trapped by our inhibitions. Consequently, so many brutal things happen that we might miss the little touches. Take the locksmith (Michael Pena), he's mistaken for a thug by both the rich white woman and the Iranian man who was insulted by a gun store owner who must have taken for an Arab. Yet Pena plays the least troublemaking character in the film, but even he isn't immune to danger or violent misunderstanding.The film isn't all dark and gritty and there a a few guardian angels here and there, which is appropriate in Los Angeles, but so many devilish vibes poison relationships between people who have so much in common. The Persian man is obviously worn-down by all the prejudice he might have suffered from and the irony is that it made him more unstable and threatening. Another irony is that some black characters use racism as an excuse to act no better than the oppressors they accuse. The film is full of ironies where people become attackers in the name of victimhood. And that did remind me of another urban drama classic.In a way, ""Crash"" plays out like a ""Do The Right Thing"" for the 2000s, with people doing the thing they think is right, allowing tragedy to burst out the most random and anticlimactic moments. In fact, it's not about doing the right or the bad thing, but the fact that some people we know to be good can commit reprehensible acts, and then you have Dillon's character first depicted as a hateful cop first but then a caring son to his ill father and a hero, this speaks a thousand words, and dig a thousand truths, many of them quite inconvenient for our mentalities.Yes, today, we live in a world or a culture of plain victimization, it's all about white vs. minorities, women vs. men etc. and the problem with ""Crash"" is that it was set at a time where there was no smart phone, where most of these things wouldn't happen without someone immediately denouncing it, which is good in theory but who knows how disastrous the consequences can be when everything is shown in a binary black-or-white way. No need to get further; if there ever is one thing ""Crash"" shows is that the accused ones can be victims and victims aren't always innocent.We all have public faces and backgrounds, some aspects of us are known, others are not, but we also don't know the real content of our characters until we're confronted to the most extreme situations like crashes or similar car encounters. ""Crash"" is mostly about people learning about themselves, to be better. Today's world is too binary and obtuse, even accusing ""Crash"" of being manipulative, and while I'm wondering how we could take so many step back, I'll always consider the film a humanistic masterpiece",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nothing light about this film,"First time director Paul Haggis takes on the powerful subject of race relations in his film ""Crash"", set over the course of 36 hours in Los Angeles. Featuring a large and exceptional ensemble cast, the characters in ""Crash"" all have something to do with one another, even if the familiarity is slight, and most of them have serious racial prejudice issues. Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) is the uptight wife of Los Angeles D.A. Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser), who become victims of a car jacking. The perpetrators, Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate) are habitual criminals who, when they aren't stealing cars for profit, are waxing philosophic on the state of discrimination for African-Americans, though generally it is Anthony who is expounding while Peter negates some of his theories. Sgt. Ryan (Matt Dillon) is on the LAPD and quickly establishes his opinions on race when he pulls over African-American television director Cameron (Terrence Dashon Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton) and proceeds to feel her up, much to the horror of his partner, Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillippe). Det. Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are lovers who have to deal with their differences as well as the family baggage carried by Waters. Iranian-immigrant, Farhad (Shaun Toub) has to deal with break-ins at this small store, his sole bread and butter, as well as race-related attacks, while his daughter Dorri (Bahar Soomekh), who is more Americanized, tries to keep him hinged while struggling with the racism herself. Finally, there is Daniel (Michael Pena), a locksmith who looks like a gang member, but is actually the most peaceful and ""nice"" one of the bunch. He is struggling with keeping his family safe, particularly his young daughter, after having lived in a neighborhood in which a stray bullet ripped through her bedroom.Obviously, the cast list is huge as is the scope of the story, but the bottom line is that everyone is brought together by a series of events that causes each of them to either have their lives physically changed, or causes them to reexamine themselves. Racial prejudice are the two main words to describe the theme of this film, and no race is left untouched by Haggis. I think that this film toes a very narrow line between heavy-handedness and abject relevancy, but the script is so damn good that it is more the latter than the former. I heard a review of this film by Henry Rollins who said that it was a really good film, but that ""he knew all of this already, so he didn't learn anything new"". I agree with this to some extent; anyone who is not racially prejudiced could conceivably find the film a little much at times, as I did. However, Haggis' writing is fantastic and thorough. There are few, if any loose ends, and any kind of ""redemption"" of any of the characters isn't handled in a cheesy manner befitting an old-time radio show or something. (""I know I was wrong, but dagnabbit, I see the light now!"") Nothing like that. Everything that happens has been solidly established and is very believable.The cast is, quite simply, brilliant. There were people whose acting I didn't have a prior opinion of just because of lack of exposure, who made me sit up and take notice, (Ludacris, Howard) there were actors who are always good that continued to showcase their talent, (Cheadle, Fraser) and there were actors who I really don't like at all who surprised me with their range (Bullock, Phillippe). Haggis' direction is stylish and a little grainy, but it is clear that he is more of a writer than a director; this is not a slam on his directorial style, but the film's style was subtle and more befitting of showcasing the script and action. Haggis, the writer of the Oscar-winning film ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not going to win any honors for being a writer of upbeat films, but his films, while usually pretty heavy and a little depressing are not of the same caliber of pain as say, the work of Todd Solondz. I definitely would recommend this film because I think it is an important societal commentary, I just suggest that the viewer give the film a chance before declaring it to be too heavy or preachy, because I think you may be pleased with the final result. 7/10 --Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Polarising,"This is either the best film of the 2000s or the worst - critics can't decide and neither can I. On one hand, it has an emotional exploration of the interconnection between people and the harm that racism can do. I can agree that the film has a unique perspective on the lives of strangers and the impacts of our choices. On the other, it's over-the-top and maudlin. I can agree that the racism is so exaggerated that it becomes comedic, and the emotional tone is equivalent to the trite chainmails that circulated around the time. Overall, still, it did have an impact on me and others so I think I will give it credit.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good But Limited Perspectives,"Racism is the black spot on the sun that is America. Every human society has its problems. Ours, IMHO the most vibrant and craftily constructed one, is no exception either. Racism and xenophobia, the unattractive side of our humanity, isn't the most popular subject, but everyone of us has to deal with it at one point. Being an immigrant myself, albeit with WASP-Canadian ancestry, I must admit in the past I had stood on both sides of the fence when it comes to alienation. Back in my home country Canada, I was openly against the borderless immigration-refugee act that liberals promoted. Toronto, the largest city in Ontario, is a city where minority IS the MAJORITY. The dynamics among ethnic groups are quite different here down in the states...racism takes different forms, a more internalized one where violence and conflicts often erupts between the minority group themselves. What's my point? Open immigration is NOT the conduit that leads to tolerance levels. In the case of Toronto, it excerbates the race relations. I hope the newly elected Conservatives would do something about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Ludicrous was a horrible actor in this film, and the reason why I gave the film a 9. It was strange that all he talked about was racism, which I don't believe that anyone is that freaking racist....seriously. Matt D. was, once again, the star of this film. I was sitting on my couch actually thinking he was a prick for the role he played. Then when you think that you can't hate him anymore....sorry I'm not going to spoil it for you.

Thought-Provoking Drama with a Powerful Story...,"I had no idea what this movie was when I first rented it. I had never heard of it. I didn't know who was in it or even what it was about. I just knew that, when I worked at Blockbuster Video, everyone was asking for it when it came out. So, I decided to see what all the hype was about. After I had finished the movie, I was impressed. I thought it definitely lived up to all the talk I had heard. It had a terrific cast with a story that never slowed down. It provided a strong, emotional look at the racism running rampant. We are reminded of how everything we do affects the lives of those around us. One of the aspects I loved about this film was that it inspired thought after the credits began to roll.This movie follows an ensemble cast and has multiple small story lines weaving through it. Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito play detectives investigating the murder of a black LAPD officer who was shot by a white colleague. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton play a couple whose lives are changed after they are pulled over by the police and things go wrong. Brendan Fraser is a DA who, with his wife (Sandra Bullock), is carjacked by Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges and Larenz Tate. This is only a sampling of the stories involved; each one colliding together in a 24 period.Paul Haggis did a great job with his movie. Each of the case does a spectacular job. I enjoyed watching actors/actresses working roles I had never pictured them in, namely Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser. I wasn't used to seeing them in such serious roles and it was cool to witness the range of their abilities. Ludicrous really surprised me with how well he did in this movie. With so little acting experience, he really seemed to put 100% into his role and did well. There really weren't any weak spots in this film's casting and it would take forever to mention how well they each did.There seem to be a lot of people who really don't like this movie, but I fail to see why. Each of the stories is developed enough to enjoy, despite having so many in one film. The acting is great and the flow of the story keeps from boring its audience. It's emotionally powerful (my wife STILL cries when watching it) and it sends an important message. As I said before, this movie also shows how much people effect each other in their daily lives. This is definitely a 'love it or hate it' movie and I think it's worth giving it a shot to find out where you stand.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
I Like The Title,"CRASH **** The economical and cultural diversity in a Los Angelos setting, showcasing the reality of it's existence worldwide, is taken to potent levels in Paul Haggis's Oscar-winning monument.

It comprises of a couple of the most heart-wrenching, emotional scenes of cinema I have ever witnessed to be honest, and that is partly why I recommend you watch it. Pay attention to all of the story's tidbits, because the story becomes progressively more interesting and stimulating as they are reintegrated. Definitely worth looking into.",,Anonymous,Crime
"A good, dark drama","Crash is basically a film that pretends to be more important than it really is, and that's the one big flaw that hindered my enjoyment of it. It really is a very well made drama, and an impressive directorial debut from Haggis, who obviously learned a lot from his collaborative work with Clint Eastwood  Crash is nearly as dark and gritty as anything the master had done. A cast of second rate Hollywood stars and B-list character actors  which includes Matt Dillon (who hadn't had a truly impressive dramatic role in more than a decade), Don Cheadle (who made his breakthrough the very same year with Hotel Rwanda), Brandon Frasier and Sandra Bullock among many others works surprisingly well together, and the film is a strong and professionally made drama with some very good dialog and excellent atmospheric cinematography.Crash is good, but it doesn't have what it takes to be truly great, and I wouldn't take anyone calling it one of the most important films of the year very seriously. The Altman-ish mish-mash of characters whose separate stories interact in surprising ways has become overtly fashionable in Hollywood in recent years, and sometimes it seems to me like the main objective is to avoid the nuisance of developing interesting individual characters; in fact, not one character in Crash  including Cheadle's and Dillon's, both of whom give undeniably remarkable performances  is interesting enough to be considered a main character, and I found myself completely detached from all of them. The film tries to get across a message about the racial tension in America  and some of the images and stories are definitely shocking, moving and effective, but the message is ultimately vague, and it often seems like a pale and weak imitation of Spike Lee. At any rate it never at any moment manages to be half as powerful and potent as anything Spike had made.Crash is definitely a good drama that's worth your time, but it's not one of the best or most interesting films of the year. At its best it's as good as the weakest of Clint Eastwood's films  and if you've watched his films then you know that's high praise. Don't believe the hype; Crash is a very good film but it's no news. If you hated Magnolia, 21 Grams or anything of that genre then you're not likely to get that much out of Crash either.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Picture: I Don't Know,"This is a kind of intense view of racism and all its implications. What starts out as a car accident leads us into a dramatic portrayal of the worst in many of us.

I don't think this was anywhere near the best movie of the year, and the Oscar came as quite a surprise.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good but not perfect.,"I must say that I'm a bit surprised by so many people and critics giving this movie such rave reviews. Although it's a good movie it has some major flaws in the script and in it's characters. First of all it's hard to believe that so many coincidental events and meetings ever could occur in such a big city as LA. It's as if the message of the movie (Everyone is a racist and a jerk, but even racists and jerks have good sides and people who seem to be good and who are not prejudice can do terrible things and so on..) was more important than making the movie and it's characters believable. Then I find it a bit annoying with all the comments about race in the movie. Some of the dialog about the race-issue is for me as a swede hard to find believable.The good thing with the movie is that it's a good story.

So it needs a lot to stand out, but a ludicrously contrived plot and ludicrously contrived characters put paid to that. Least convincing are two black friends who talk in loud passionate political debate (one militant, one reasoned), before pulling out guns on white passers-by. What, in God's name, is THAT all about?

Isolation & Prejudice,"This movie about people (meaning you and me) is brilliantly structured. The difficult task of blending multiple stories into a convincing whole without any trace of artificiality or exaggerated sentimentality is an admirable achievement.Life as it is with the increasing tendency of present-day man to isolate himself and hide behind prejudices towards others as a form of survival in a mad, mad world. Not a moralizing or judgemental approach as to what we are as human beings but an illustration of the complex aspects of our nature and how easily good can turn to bad and vice versa. Our narrow-minded outlook on the world around us and how easily we debase individuals by defining them as belonging to an inferior class or race is the main theme on which the movie is based. The issue however is not that simple and the most important aspect of this movie is that it sees things as they really are: our urban environment and our personal experiences with people in general do not encourage real confidence in our fellow man. There remains however a glimmer of hope and the message ""Crash"" conveys is that by gaining insight into the fact that our attitudes in general are based more on the unforeseen and casual incidents we experience in everyday life than on our so-called deep convictions, we could (possibly) become better people.A lot of reviews consider the movie weak due to its radical and therefore limited analysis of racism in general and that it focuses too often on a form of cheap emotional content.

However, I found it annoying how almost every character had a monologue about racism a la verbal diarrhea. Kind of like those cola product placements. During such moments they often would be accompanied by politically correct mellow dramatic gasps of disbelief from appalled middle aged females in the audience.

Occasionally misses but hits hard and keeps running,"A snapshot of anger and intolerance in modern-day LA, Crash follows a group of apparently disparate characters whose lives intertwine over 24 traumatic hours. It's an impressive directorial debut from Million Dollar Baby scribe Paul Haggis. But as intelligent, provocative and marvellously acted as it undoubtedly is, Crash still relies on a string of clichés, contrivances and coincidences to hammer its message home.That message is: rich or poor, law-enforcing or law-breaking, hard-working or work-shirking  one way or another, everyone's a racist... but we all have a shot at redemption.With Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton and Don Cheadle in the mix, this was always going to be worth a look. And being a film about preconceptions, the film benefits from some interesting casting, with Sandra Bullock playing against type as a disaffected wife, Tony Danza as a sly TV producer and 'Ludacris' Bridges as a car-jacker with a chip on his shoulder about everything - including rap music. But even here, Haggis sometimes takes the obvious route by giving the most unsavoury-looking guy - Michael Pena's Latino locksmith  the purest disposition.Plot-wise and thematically, Crash veers from the predictable to the inspired.

Every human being has a story behind the surface,"My beef with film in general is that the media tends to depict minor characters as more or less pre-programmed. I always thought that even the minor characters still have a life of their own, and to have them on the screen for a few seconds is somehow not doing them justice; that is to say, I wished a movie would flesh out the characters more, allowing us to see their complex life past a brief encounter with the ""main"" characters.Having watched ""Crash,"" I realize it's a real wish-come-true for me. Not that it's the first time a network of events has connected strangers to each other in a film, but it does so well in bringing the characters to life. The story explores racial issues with understanding, not with judgment (this quality is similar to the critically acclaimed ""Do the Right Thing""). The major characters explored range from hypocrites and spoiled brats to misinformed immigrants, none of which ultimately lacks compassion, but they are also not immune from ignorance, selfishness, and making mistakes, which lead to their suffering as well as others' suffering. Characters develop gradually as the plot progresses, reinforcing the VERY IMPORTANT notion that human beings are complex creatures that cannot be understood by first impression. Characters will surprise us as we learn more about them. For example, just when we think we know all about a cop who demonstrates contempt for a minority group (which would probably be the typical one-dimensional character in a less respectable work), we learn that his father was pro-minority and had worked diligently alongside that minority group for 30 years before losing his job due to affirmative action adversely impacting his father, a white male. Do we have the right to condemn this cop for being bitter towards a group who contributed to his father's misfortune? The same cop, with unconditional bravery, later saves a Black woman whom he had sexually harassed before. What was racing through his mind when he put his life aside, racing against time to pull her out of a crashed car that could explode any minute?This film isn't simply about redemption either; people don't necessarily get rewarded when they achieve something worthwhile (which is sad but realistic). It's trying to tell us HOW different racial groups struggle to fit in the melting pot known as America, and WHY their interactions create barriers with each other. No solution is proposed, as no artist could replace a problem as intense as racial bitterness in a universe surrounded by ignorance and self-interest, and recognizing and reducing these unhealthy qualities is probably the purpose of creating and distributing this film. The only suggestive gesture by the filmmaker is several scenes of slightly stylized lighting and editing to reflect spirituality or enlightenment, a sign that perhaps these qualities can transform people into appreciating diversity.With the modern world supposedly bringing diverse people closer, ""Crash"" is a gem that depicts racial struggle as an inevitable course, and this inevitability is reinforced by the ending scene of an accident easily resulting in racist name calling, especially when the racist in this scene has been a victim of racism previously. Perhaps the biggest reward for me comes from the fact that there is no main character, and whether locksmith or district attorney of the largest city in the west coast, they are afforded equal characterization. Therefore we have the rare opportunity to look into the lives of passers-by beyond their introduction to understand how they fit in this highly complex melting pot by a network of events--events that may be unpleasant and yet valuable lessons.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great acting overall in a striking story,"I saw Third Person (2013) before this one. Paul Haggis really is good in creating such intricate web of stories combined into one big story. But compared to Third Person (2013), the grand theme in this movie is much more serious and engaging. the movie also concludes nicely for all the characters, mainly turning their long established mindsets upside down and forcing them to acknowledge the reality of an unfair world by doing something that is paradoxical to their principles. The acting job in overall is a great job. With a list of first tier actors and actresses, this makes it even better. The greater thing is that there is equal share of focus and screen-time for each significant characters. For me, Ludicrous' performance is the one which shined out the most within the circumstances.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A powerful look into the world of racism,"I saw Crash around two years ago, and I liked it, but never got the hype. I rewatched it, and got this film into a deeper level. It is a film that manipulates the audience with music and over-dramatic scenes, but isn't that the way this world is? I have dealt with a lot of issues regarding racism, since I do live in Los Angeles. The mixture of all these different races does cause tension, and the way the film portrayed it was incredibly realistic. At first glance, it really seems like a melodramatic, overblown film, but it was ultimately very powerful, especially in particular scenes. The film does have flaws, but it also makes a lot of points about race stereotypes and it has some very complicated and flawed characters. The cast is great, although there are a few weak spots. The standouts had to be Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton. The two had the best scenes in the film, and both acted in such passion and force, I can see why Dillon was nominated for the Oscar, but why wasn't Newton? Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Terrence Howard, and Ryan Phillippe were all great, but Sandra Bullock also impressed me a lot. Her bad reputation is not deserved. Yes, she does pick a lot of bad roles, but when given the right material, she can really shine. Here, she proves she can really act (also notably, she is being considered a frontrunner for the 2010 Oscar for Leading Actress against Meryl Streep). If Bullock picked more challenging roles like this, she would have a better reputation.Overall, Crash does have flaws, but it also has some incredibly powerful scenes that make it memorable, and a film that has a lot of ambition. While I do think Brokeback Mountain should have won that Oscar for Best Picture, Crash's bad reputation is really not deserved to the extent that it is.",,Anonymous,Crime
Excellence,"This film is extremely underrated. And to have won best picture and be underrated is a hard feat to accomplish. The overall cinematography is very good, and the way it brings emotion out of anyone should be something that people marvel at. This is the type of powerful movie that everyone should be forced to watch at some point in their life. The Screen play is excellent as Paul Haggis does a great job of tying all these people's lives together. Somehow, the script was able to grab incredible performances from every character, even the amateurs like rapper Ludicrous. It is pure power the way it sends your emotions on a frenzy, from being stunned by the racial tension, to the couple humorous scenes. Matt Dillon's performance is solid, and Terrance Howard and Don Cheadle give their usual excellent performance.

A Masterpiece & One That Will Live On Forever,"I have seen this movie 3 times now and every time was like the first time again.It really is as close to perfect as movies get.The film is set in LA. There is no better place to set a movie it's so beautiful and simply amazing it's almost like a character in the film.The film explores Racism , Stereotypes and the everyday difficulties faced by people not only in Los Angeles but everywhere in America and beyond.There are so many things that i love about this film i could write pages which is what i fear i might do.None of the actors involved are what anyone would class as even ""good"" actors. You've got Sandra Bullock , Brendan Fraser , Matt Dilon and rapper (lucadris) to name just a few. First thing that enters your head hopeless right?. That's exactly what i thought i was wrong.Every actor/actress in this film stepped it up. They all break free from there ""stereotypes"" and provide outstanding performances. It is almost like watching a miracle a movie that maybe should never have been that good actually taking on perfection. The actors involved gave it everything. The roles that most of them have been waiting there whole career to be given they just didn't know it. Some die hard Roles they would later go on to nail. You'll never look at people like Matt Dilon for example the same again. ""That idiot out of there's something about Mary right?"" this guy earned a whole new level of respect from me in his Oscar worthy portrayal of an LAPD officer with an extremely racist view.The films has some of the most powerful scenes ever used in a film. At times i watched in absolute awe at what was happening on screen and the effect really doesn't wear off over time.The message this film carry's is what it's all about. You pick up on new stuff with every watch.People's racial views are put to the test , things change , people realise , people lose , people win , people find peace.But in the end we are all the same we are all human we all contradict and we all criticise.The film shows that we all care for one another it just sometimes takes tragedy to bring us as close together as we should be.It shows how all of this affects life in good and bad ways in LA. But as before it also says a lot about the world outside of LA.with a perfectly used soundtrack including Bird York's ""In The Deep"" and a surprising appearance from the Stereophonics with ""Maybe Tomorrow"". , which help make what are in my opinion are two of the greatest scenes in the history of movies.There is so much to this film that you really have to see it for yourself.It's like i said before ""Perfection"" and it's a movie experience that will never leave you.""One Of The Greatest Movies Ever Made""10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Why do I prefer Crash ?,"When you were in a movie if you gave completely to it. At that time, I can bet you are willing to see and like them. When we are touched by a movie, we'll have a feeling that the scripts including a word, a sentence are unforgettable.I've been watched ""Crash"" for 3 times, and ""Brokenback Mountain"" for once. At first, I watched ""Brokenback Mountain"", and then a friend give me a advice to take a look on ""Crash"". I didn't get the main idea of ""Brokenback Mountain"", maybe I'm in China, and I'm not a gay, but I didn't have any problems on those things.""Crash"" is a regular story, but it's sophisticated. It has taken place in 90s, many people don't know each other before, but they get together with and showed some racial problems, corruption and other social matters in US.There are many scenes in this movie that make me feel warmed and remembered. Let's say some of them: Scene 1st: the locksmith came home and go over his little girl whether is sleeping, but the girl scared under the bed because she heard a bang like a gun made. So her dad try to comfort her and make a white lie to tell. At last, the little girl came back on her bed. I am touched with conversations between the father and his girl. Scene 2nd: the black director was missing in his car, two boys came closer and with guns. They shouted him to get off the car, their one word ""nigger"" annoyed the director, and they got a fight. When they are fighting, the polices found them and chased them for a moment. Finally, the director try to prove his bold (even we called his ""dignity"") because his wife was humiliated by a white police. At that urgent moment, another white police who has met him before explained and ended a coming fire battle. I was touched by their conversations, and a kind of complex mood in the black director. Scene 3rd: the black officer found his brother's dead, his mom knew it as well. At hospital, they had a difficult talk, a sad mother blamed a busy son, I was touched by their words. Scene 4th: near the end, the young black has save a lot of Asians, and then he backed the car, he appeared a slight smile, I was touched by his smile.In the fact, this movie has brought more scenes like this, I hope my review can drive you to watch.Thank you for reading.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very good movie despite the hate,"Globally this is a very good film. It touches on one very important topic as much as racism, even all ""types"" of people are represented in the film. Also, many stories of different people intertwine and influence each other. It is life and something that is very real. In addition, the film shows us many situations and how practically things are never black and white, which is also very realistic. A great script holds attention while watching. Of the flaws I would point out too many characters, nor did I manage to remember them all because some were very short in the film, nor could I develop an emotional connection with everyone for the reason mentioned. I don't understand the hate around this movie. Yes, it won an Oscar, but I also watched worse Oscar-winning films, but this is by no means a bad film per se. It may have a warmish ending that didn't impress me, but overall this is a quality film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A  triumph for Haggis,"This is a movie which has nothing in common with the controversial 1996 Cronenberg work of the same title. Instead it can be compared with ""Grand Canyon"" and ""Magnolia"" in that all three films feature a series of interlocking stories in a California setting. Here Paul Haggis - who wrote the rightly acclaimed ""Million Dollar Baby"" - makes his directorial debut with a film which he also conceived and co-wrote by presenting a set of linked lives in Los Angeles over a two-day period. The is a city in which estranged and fearful people crash into one another both physically and metaphorically.So far, so relatively familiar. What really distinguishes this work, however, is the complex and controversial theme of race. The so-called American melting pot is shown to be a boiling cauldron of multiple tensions and prejudices, whether it is the Iranian shopkeeper who despises the Mexican locksmith or it is the girlfriend of the black policeman who objects to him calling her Mexican, when her parents are from Puerto Rica and El Salvador, to the same woman who mocks an aggressive Chinese woman for her poor pronunciation of English. This is a complicated world in which a good cop can find himself committing a terrible act, while his racist colleague can discover himself behaving heroically with the last person who would expect or want that.Of course, the plotting is contrived, but the whole of cinema is contrived which is what distinguishes storytelling from straight documentary. This is an intelligent and compelling narrative which constantly demands attention and, once it is all over, provokes much thought. We are shown that the world is not colour-coded and we need to take the time and trouble to understand who people really are. The ensemble acting by a host of capable performers is a delight, whether it is Sandra Bullock appearing against type as an angry and prejudiced housewife, Matt Dillon as a racist but brave policeman, Don Cheadle as a detective trying to balance the conflicting pressures of career and family, or Thandie Newton who wants her husband to be braver in standing against racial injustice, or the many other strong supporting roles.",,Anonymous,Crime
A must-see film that is sometimes hard to watch,"This movie is disturbing and dark. You could call it a horror film, but it's based on how our society (American) exists in too many places today.Blind anger. Anger without thought. What it does. How it affects others. It's scary how people treat each other in this movie. And yet, I can see it all happening in the ""real"" reality (not what is called ""reality"" on TV.)Don Cheadle is soft, hard, caring, and very conflicted. His character is caught up in events he cannot control. Sandra Bullock plays out of character - a woman who is just angry and scared. No one seems to notice enough to care.Shaun Toub plays an Persian who appears to distrust and hate anyone who is outside of his family. He has blind rages. He doesn't see others as real. They are just in his way.The other characters are played just as real, and the situations are believable. And they took me to places I didn't want to go.Every day, I see people wandering around in their heads - that is, they are too busy thinking about what happened yesterday, or the performance review meeting they have with their boss next week, or the fight he or she had with his/her spouse this morning. Too many people living somewhere other than the moment. Not seeing what (or who) is around them. Not letting those people in.When something happens to break their concentration, many of these people react with anger or disinterest. Polite gestures by others go unnoticed - no response (""thank you"") for someone holding a door open, or for someone opening a hole in traffic.What kind of interruption is necessary for these people to come into the moment and recognize that there are other people around them with needs, desires, dreams, and many of the same issues that you or I have to deal with? To see them as people, and to treat them with respect and courtesy?As I said, this movie can be hard to watch. Go see it. Then go out and be that ""interruption"" in people's lives. Bring them into the moment, even if it is just to say ""Hello"" and and make eye contact. Let them know that you recognize them as a fellow human being, not really any different than you or me. Maybe if enough people do that, we can turn things around on this planet.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Thought provoking and very in-your-face!,"You have to be prepared to watch a film like this. Unless you have no emotions, no real sense of self, and you have been isolated from popular culture. Please keep in mind that this is a young person's point of view. I came away from this film thinking two things: 1) that we as human beings are all racists in some way or form no matter if we admit it or not. 2) Art imitates life and vice versa. I am not disputing the fact that this is an excellent piece of work by Director Paul Haggis, it's just that I was not prepared for the harrowing saga that is the movie Crash. It does not pretend, it doesn't not solve anything, it does not point fingers, you look at it and you can see yourself in it, no matter what age, race, religion you are, unless you're a new born baby. It is an American film, or at least most identifiably American. The values in this film are those that we have been taught, and those that we have grabbed and assimilated along the way. The saddest part of this film, to me is that it seems to be saying that we as human beings and citizens of this earth concern ourselves mostly with the trivial things in life, and that in itself is our own downfall.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"it isn't great, still it is quite good","""Crash"" isn't the great movie many people make it out to be; it probably doesn't deserve it's spot in the top 250. It's in many ways formulaic, it's manipulative in parts, sentimental in others, and very unsubtle. So the gushing reviews one finds of it are unwarranted. On the other hand the hatchet jobs many critics and would be critics give it are equally if not more unjustified. This isn't a trite little exercise in manipulation and cheap, fake uplift like ""American Beauty"" or ""Life is Beautiful;"" this movie's heart is in the right place and it does have something important to say. Beyond that the way there's much to be said for the way the characters are drawn. With the exception of Brendan Fraser's slimy, one dimensional prosecutor none of the characters are truly good or evil (too bad about Fraser, he's an underrated actor and deserved a bit more to work with); like most human beings they're a complex mix of both. The way the movie plays with our expectations by casting a character as a villain or a hero and then turning those expectations on their head is quite admirable and unsettling, as the fact we sympathize with and even admire such flawed characters forces us to look at aspects of ourselves we might not like too much. And the fact that the people we had pegged as villains often go on to act nobly, makes us see and acknowledge the humanity of people we dislike, which is certainly a good thing for any movie to accomplish (not to be trite, but it's a mark of truly humanist cinema that it humanizes). Still the movie isn't perfect; the situations Haggis uses to engineer these turn arounds in our expectations are far-fetched and more than a bit artificial. Also, while the characters are believable and compellingly drawn, their actions sometimes seem forced and artificial- not in the sense that they act in unbelievable ways, but they act in the ways they do rather too quickly. Haggis also adds to the air of artifice by being just a bit too slick as an author; things are set up just a bit too neatly in a good many cases. Not that artifice is in itself bad, but it shouldn't show itself as such. Finally, the sheer number of characters means that they're not quite as developed as one would like. Still most of ""Crash's"" faults are the result of noble ambitions it doesn't fully achieve, and a flawed movie that aims at something great is a far better thing than a perfectly crafted mediocrity.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Well Acted, albeit a Messy, Underwhelming Story,","Crash is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a terrific cast. The main part of this movie that made it worth the watch have to be the actors, they all play very real, convincing characters, there's not a single weak performance here, and I'm surprised more of them weren't Oscar nominated. It is lacking when it comes to a compelling story, which is clearly what this movie wanted to be, but because we are following so many different characters it becomes hard to feel for any as they are all underdeveloped, there's not a single character who's potential felt fully used. As far as Best Picture winners go, it lacks originality, there's not a single story that we haven't seen in another movie, or a character that feels fresh, it's too dedicated to being realistic that it forgets to offer something exciting or different for its audience. I certainly don't think Crash deserved a Best Picture Academy Award as its too flawed, but it's a very well acted drama, certainly worth the watch if you ever see it on television or Netflix.Following the events of a car crash, we follow a group of characters in their interconnected lives.Best Performance: Terrence Howard",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

best movie collage out there,"Not many collage movies make it big, but this one is a well deserved effort. I cannot even think of any other collage movies besides What's Cooking, which may be a cool movie for a cultural related class or organization only, but very plain other than that.Based in LA, this movie displays a controversial array of racial slurs and phrases. Using LA locations was more expensive for the production studio than many other locations they could've opted for, but instead they wanted to give a feel of a possibly icky side of LA itself. They don't overharp on how the movie is based in LA as the sequence of events could happen anywhere in an infinite number of possibilities. But there is something about how they chose the location that makes it seem all so real. Maybe you have to have lived near LA to appreciate the choices of the locations and how hard it was to shoot and keep the locations on hold.I think the actors and actresses were well chosen. There's not one bad actor or actresses. Even the child in the movie with the cloak line is great! There are too many examples to point out, but I will try to mention a few that come to mind. Danza is very subtle with his character's Fred's subtlety to the racism in his intonation. Cameron's understanding that he has no choice but to fake his pleasure and accept Fred's superficial niceness to complete the show is so perfect. Dillon is an f'in scary, racist cop who gets away with his attitude as people don't want to end up having the LA cops pinned down on them in particular. Phillippe, who plays ""good"" cop officer Hanson, ends up in a situation where it becomes twisted and very questionable. As viewers, we wonder if Officer Hanson should report what he did to others and why he did it, or if he should just destroy the evidence. Since the cops in the plot line will not try to give Hanson a ""fair and equal trial,"" you can guess what decision he makes and how much talking from the viewers there will be from just that. There are some twisted coincidences that were obviously placed in there to make the collage juicier and interesting.The scene where a kid is ""shot"" is interesting because at first I thought she was wearing an ""impenetrable vest"" but then I noticed later on that the bullets used are blanks. They show the box really quickly, so if you miss those few seconds, you might not notice that small detail.When the Persian father has trouble with Daniel, the locksmith, it brings an interesting question of what would a person might do if they need a door fixed and it's the middle of the night. Does he stay there all night and then finally try to get in touch with someone during the day? Probably. The situation is also questionable because the locksmith already put the lock on, but still wanted to charge the guy even though the lock could not be put on.It's arguments like these you can continue having.

Crash (2004),"Incredibly gripping and massively entertaining, Crash may not know how to handle its social commentary quite as well as it thinks it does, but still proves to be a very important landmark in film. The film is very well acted, although there is no actor or actress that stands out more than the other. It almost feels like the films actors were given a challenge to play their heart out as best as possible while playing the most unlikable characters. The film is very emotionally gripping, and surprisingly was able to move me to tears at one point. It's incredibly well paced, and fairly handled, which is rather impressive considering its massive cast and vast array of storylines and character arcs. My biggest problem with the film, is that it seems far too heavy handed on its own issues, forcing the viewers to shove certain themes, harsh messages, and politically incorrect situations down their throats as if to say, here you go, deal with this. It just doesn't feel realistic, nor does it feel like it fits in the whole scheme of things, and just feels like a large weirdly handled way to show how racism is dealt with in this year of society. Nevertheless, Crash is able to be a very entertaining and gripping emotional thriller. It's issues lie in the things that it is trying to prove, and its yelling of them, despite not truly understanding what it is trying to say in the first place. It is well acted, cleverly paced, and contains a surprisingly decent soundtrack, and a large amount of emotion- of which is most appreciated and works the most well in the films complete run. Crash isn't perfect by far, but it is a very impressive and very unique picture, that deserves a watch if you get the chance.

Am I the only one who thought this movie was pedestrian and vulgar?,"The user comments praising this movie as ""complex"" and ""masterful"" made me laugh out loud. ""Crash"" is to Spike Lee's magnum opus ""Do the Right Thing"" what ground beef is to fillet mignon.The problems start with casting. Sandra Bullock as an over the top racist? Give me a break. She is America's sweetheart and so well known as just that that it is impossible to buy her opening racist tirade as well as everything else that follows. It only gets worse from there.Though Matt Dillon does his best to convince us he is also an over the top ""nigger hater"", his performance is earnest but misses the mark by miles. Don Cheadle only adds to the ridiculous ""Everyone hates everyone else because of their ethnicity"" tone of this farce. Not one character in this entire film rings true. Not one!

Truly one of the best movies of all time.  Everybody needs to see it.,"This movie was possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen. I will own it when it comes out simply for the ability to spread its message to people who have not seen it. When people ask me what it's about, I give a one word answer. Racism. Plain and simple, that's what it's about. We follow several different character stories, from a Persian family, a high class black family, 2 policemen, a detective, a DA and his wife, 2 young black adults, and a Hispanic man with his family. No character, save for the Hispanic man(possibly the best acting in the movie) is without flaw. This movie is brutally honest and shows the truth of our American society. It educates everybody that white people are not the only racist group in America. Racism takes form in all cultures, classes, and races. I have never seen better acting from any of these individuals, especially Thandie Newton and Sandra Bullock. Don Cheadle is right up there with his role in Hotel Rwanda. Ludicrous is surprisingly brilliant as a self righteous racist black man. I cannot name a single bad thing about this movie. It is heavy, but it really needs to be in order to be effective. There are some small comic reliefs to break up the tension, which are tuned and timed perfectly. I cannot express enough how worthwhile this movie is. High schools should show this movie to their students(unfortunately w/ permission slips due to it's R rating from nudity and language).",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant,"I am a man of few words, and I don't usually air my opinions, but after reading the previous review by alfredom2000....I did not believe that such a delicate subject could be handled with this much perfection. This is without doubt one of the best films I have ever seen.The story is a great reflection of how people think, nobody likes to believe that they have preconceptions of other races or creeds but this film makes you open your eyes to the fact that we all, unavoidably do just that.""I'm not racist, I am a Mexican who lives in Mexico"" Sorry to quote you alfredo2000, but does the above statement automatically clear you of having any racist tendencies  I think you missed the whole point of the film.As for stereotypical characters, people are stereotypes! Within film making this can be exploitative and demeaning if handled badly, however to tell a story with such a sensitive premise as Crash I believe that the characterisation was completely necessary to the storyline.Whether we like it or not, we all have misinformed views of people and cultures that are different to our own and this film reflects that beautifully.By the way, I am not Mexican and I do not live in Mexico. Am I a racist?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Beautiful and Richly Layered Character Study from the Screenwriter of 'Million Dollar Baby',"""We're Losing Touch."" That's one of the very first lines spoken in the new great film by Paul Haggis. It is spoken by Don Cheadle's police detective, Graham, after a head injury resulting from a car crash caused by an overly eccentric Chinese lady. He's babbling all this random stuff, but it's not so random. That line is pretty much the whole basis for 'Crash'. We as a society are losing touch of each other. We don't care about each other anymore, and the day and age of chivalry has died in 2005. When we see someone in need or down on their luck we just turn the other way. We aren't involved with each other and we've become so callous and self-absorbed. We are torn apart the the racism, prejudices and differences of each other, that we almost don't even care anymore. 'Crash' takes that idea and spins a handful of interesting and beautifully layered vignettes that take place in the slums of Los Angeles during the course of two days.The two days the film is set over follows eight different situations all eventually interlocking with each other. The first situation is about two detectives, Graham (Don Cheadle - Hotel Rwanda) and Ria (Jennifer Esposito) investigating the murder of a could-be dirty cop, and Graham helping his heroin-addicted mother find her hoodlum son. The second situation follows two L.A.P.D. police officers, Ryan (Matt Dillon - Drugstore Cowboy) and Hansen (Ryan Phillippe - The Way of the Gun), Ryan struggling with his dying father while Hansen struggles with having Ryan as a partner. The third situation follows a rich black television producer, Cameron (Terence Howard - Hart's War) and his wife, Christine (Thandie Newton - The Truth About Charlie) who try to keep their marriage together after an upsetting run in with two police officers. The fourth situation follows a wealthy and smug D.A., Rick (Brendan Fraser - The Mummy) and his self-centered pedantic wife, Jean (Sandra Bullock - Miss Congeniality) and how they deal with life and the political hardships that follow Rick after he's assaulted and car-jacked by two black street thugs. The fifth situation follows the two black street thugs/car-jackers, Anthony (Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges - 2 Fast 2 Furious) and Peter (Larenz Tate - Dead Presidents) as they roam the streets of L.A. in the newly stolen SUV. The sixth story follows a lower-class Hispanic locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pena - TV's The Shield), who's trying to make ends meet while supporting his wife and daughter. The seventh story follows a Chinese-American couple in the ghettos of L.A., while the eighth story is centered around Islamic citizens, Farhad (Shaun Toub) the owner of a pawnshop and his emergency room doctor daughter, Dorri (Bahar Soomekh) as they try to get through life without being discriminated against. It's a very complex plot, but that's not an insult, it's actually a compliment. These days, it's good to see a film that actually requires you to think and examine life, then some mindless action lackluster of a film starring Britney Spears or Jennifer Lopez. 'Crash' is a unique opportunity to see a though-provoking and heart-wrenching suspense tale that you can learn a lot from.'Crash' has some wonderful qualities to it. The acting of the film is spectacular with stand-out performances. Sandra Bullock actually turns in a good performance as the nasty housewife (for the very few screen time she has). Don Cheadle is absolutely brilliant in his role as a conflicted L.A.P.D. police detective, following his startling turn in last year's Oscar contender 'Hotel Rwanda'. Matt Dillon turns in one of the best performances of the film, as the bigoted and emotionally scared police officer, and I can't remember Dillon turning in a finer performance since 1989's 'Drugstore Cowboy'. Jennifer Esposito is good as Cheadle's partner, while Brendan Fraser is kind of so-so as the District Attorney of Los Angeles. For me, he wasn't very believable in that role. Terrence Dashon Howard turns in a very powerful performance, while Ludicrous does an actually all-right job with acting (I was a bit skeptical because he is a rapper, not an actor). Thandie Newton was amazing in perhaps the best acting performance of the entire film, and Ryan Phillippe and Larenz Tate played their roles with staunch authenticity and passion for the craft of acting. The newcomer, Michael Pena (who can be seen every Tuesday as the latest cast member of 'The Shield') does a surprisingly fabulous job, along with Shaun Toub. The film also contains bit parts played by Loretta Devine (Boston Public), Keith David (Barbershop), William Fichtner (Black Hawk Down) and most notably Tony Danza in a thirty second part. Paul Haggis does a phenomenal job writing along with directing. Haggis provides a script so rich and elaborate in that it keeps you deeply focused for the entire runtime of the film. His directing is exquisite and impressive, but not too flashy or pretentious. The only real flaws that are present in 'Crash' are that it is somewhat unbelievable or confusing at times. Like I said, you really have to pay close attention to detail while watching the film. It isn't one of those movies where you can take a trip to the restroom in the middle of it, come back, and ask the person sitting next to you, ""What did I miss?"". Because in those few minutes you spent in the bathroom, you most likely missed a plot revelation or new set-up. A lot of people will be turned off with how involving 'Crash' is, but for the few who truly appreciate the art of film, it will be like a dream come true. I enjoyed almost everything the picture had to offer, but I couldn't help but feel the ending was a bit inadequate of what the whole film was seemingly heating up for. In conclusion, I highly recommend 'Crash' even though it's ending was rather disappointing. Grade: A-MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #124",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This could have been a high-school film project,"The first part of this film seemed to me oddly written, not enough depth and too much poke in the eye racism, something a 15 years old would write in a film class in order to raise awareness about racism. I can see the appeal for the American people, i doubt films that are so upfront about racism is rare and this is one of its allure. I think it does a good job to show how everyone is in on this racism scheme, from the politician to the guy on street to the policeman.

Inspires a Strong Reaction In All of Us,"I saw this film months ago and am now compelled to throw in my two cents after its Best Picture win at the '05 Oscars. There seems to be a LOT of negative buzz at this picture's win...a lot of criticism... Oh well...What people seem to have a problem with here is that all of these characters give voice to what many of us supposedly only THINK...Good Heavens, we'd never actually SPEAK the racist remarks so prevalent throughout this film would we?. But this IS in fact a film...It IS a vehicle where characters can in fact become representative and ""iconistic""...Matt Dillon's cop, The Persian store-owner, the D.A.'s wife and so on...these are all representative of larger bases-of many many people in our diverse set of cultures. The film gives voice to many fears and frustrations in our thoughts that drive societies in negative ways. When this is accepted, then Crash's writing becomes brilliant. The story clicks and moves, with many surprising tie-ins and amazing twists and at least one tear-jerk scene involving a small child. Nothing is what it seems, yet much of what we see on the surface is seemingly common-place. The ensemble cast is directed masterfully; the acting is strong - the stories all stand on their own. This is in fact a passionate work with much more to say than just ""Racism is hugely present in American Society."" As a 20 year veteran of Law Enforcement in Los Angeles, I was moved by and could relate to the many complexities in this film! Congratulations on the Best Picture Oscar!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too many one-dimensional rude people and too many events happening at once,"""Crash"" tries to make a point that racism is fully alive and well from all colors in America by showcasing a bunch of one-dimensional rude people and contrively making their fate inter-related. This movie does not hold up well in 2004 due to the forced racist dialogue, and it especially does not hold up at all now in 2022 due to the forced racist dialogue. Awarding this movie the Best Picture Oscar I suppose is the early attempt by Hollywood to appear woke in 2005. The anger portrayed here seems exaggerated. What is everyone so uptight about all of the time? The year 2005 is a dream compared to now, as it is a time before the ubiquity of social media, the iPhone, Obama and Trump presidencies, etc. At any rate, I give ""Crash"" 6 stars for the star-studded cast and the decent acting from almost everyone, however the contrived storylines and one-dimensional characters just do not cut it for this movie to be good enough to be recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The title may suggest an action movie, but it refers more to the lonely thud of hitting rock bottom in a city that doesn't care.","It's a shame that people don't line up around the block for films like this... films with a talented ensemble cast that deal with real issues, real people and real conflict. There's nothing fake about films like these... nothing escapist... it is just a slice of life story that hits home in palpable ways.I suppose the easy way to classify ""Crash"" is by calling it a more commercial version of ""Magnolia"", ""Grand Canyon"" or ""Short Cuts"".It is far shorter than any of those obvious comparisons and it is less ""artsy"". In other words, ""Crash"" is less concerned with impressive film-making and more concerned with efficient storytelling.The downside to imitation is that the film feels slightly ""done already""... it needs an extra hook to keep us riveted. ""Crash"" uses racial stereotyping and tension as a means to an emotional end.Like those other films, Los Angeles is the setting. I've lived in L.A. and can testify that it is the lonliest city in the world. You never really feel like you make any true connections with people in that city. All those that were born there have moved away, and all those who live there now are temporarily relocated from other cities. No one seems to call Los Angeles their real home.The opening lines of the film, muttered by the fabulous Don Cheadle, capture that essence entirely.I won't recount the many plot threads that this film traverses. But in true Altman / PT Anderson fashion, the stories are all interconnected via family or coincidence.There are some truly remarkable performances in ""Crash"" despite the fact that no one really gets the bulk of the screen time.Cheadle stands out and is quickly becoming one of our finest American actors. Jennifer Esposito delivers a fiery and powerful turn here. Even small roles by Sandra Bullock, Ryan Phillippe, Brendan Fraser & William Fichtner deserve merit. Matt Dillon, Ludicrous, the sublime Thandie Newton, Michael Pena and Terrence Dashon Howard all deliver brilliantly. It is a great ensemble performance that will be remembered at next year's SAG awards.The main issue I had with this film was its use of coincidence. It just seemed all too forced in this film that is otherwise based in very serious reality. I felt a little manipulated by some crafty screen writing. I didn't buy the plausibility of many of the situations.I still recommend the film to any and all art house fans... but even with its desire to be more commercial than its predecessors, I don't think too many Star Wars fanatics will be giving up their place in line to watch this one. Those of you with Vin Diesel posters in your bedroom should steer well clear of ""Crash""!

"Simplistic, not Oscar-worthy","This might be an unpopular review but I really don't see how this was worth an Oscar back in the day. This film is told from the POV of various character vignettes and tries to tackle the issue of racism in America. In doing so with so many different characters from various cultural backgrounds, I feel like it was in a rush to make its point. In doing so, I feel it ultimately fails in its objective. Sure there were some great performances with an excellent all star cast. And the script tried its best given what it was setting up to do. Sometimes it's best to focus on one story

"Do yourself a favor, rent the original by Cronenberg","Crash is overwrought, over-thought and over-baked. A great example of how to make a pompous and self-important film with a message. Haggis tries too hard to make his point and overreaches in just about every category of the film. It feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer to the skull. Sure, race relations affect everyone and there's a great deal of ambiguity to the issue, but the universe of 'Crash' operates to suggest that we are all victims to our own perceptions on race. It's a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad nauseum and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes. I found the outcomes of the characters unsurprising and forced and the film took forever to sputter out and die. The fact that this film is in the top 50 movies on IMDb is a testament to the public's willingness to get suckered by Hollywood malarkey.Indeed, if you want the real ""Crash,"" go check out the one by David Cronenberg: dark, twisted and original. This film plays as preachy, tiresome, and masochistic.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Missed the touch,"Greetings again from the darkness. Within the first 5 minutes, I was shifting in my seat and realized the dialog was making me extremely uncomfortable. My first reaction was that writer/director Paul Haggis (writer of ""Million Dollar Baby"", TV's ""L.A. Law"" ""Thirtysomething"" and ""Walker, Texas Ranger"") was using simple shock value to manipulate the audience on the topic of racism. The words and scenarios were almost cartoonish. As the movie went on, I realized this was very much an expose on the stereotypes and paranoia we all carry. Bigotry and intolerance and fear are widespread. Of course, very few of us wear it on our sleeves or are as indignant about it as most of the characters in the film, but Haggis is right in that this is not a subtle topic. Bust it open and examine it and MAYBE something good will happen.The cast is huge and talented. Sandra Bullock, shaking off her ""Miss Congeniality"" persona, does great work in her limited screen time as the eternally angry princess who has refused to reflect. Don Cheadle turns in another of his sterling roles as the moralistic protector of all things good, only this time he has some demons of his own. Matt Dillon, in her first good performance since ""Drugstore Cowboy"", is terrific and steals most every scene. His character is the most complex, hated, misunderstood tough guy you have seen in awhile. The rest of the cast is filled out wonderfully by Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard (Gossie in ""Ray""), Larenz Tate (Quincy Jones in ""Ray""), Tony Danza, Keith David, Ryan Phillipe and Thandie Newton. Ludicrous deserves special mention for stepping up and playing the absolute most extreme racist (with a touch of humor) since Peter Boyle in ""Monster's Ball"".There will be many comparisons to PT Anderson's great film ""Magnolia"" due to the overlapping story lines and criss-crossing of characters and I feel the spiritualism of the film can also be related to Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon"".",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Melting Pot on Fire.,"Outstanding allegory on our society and the views (both subtle and apparent) that we may have on others of varying racial and ethnic backgrounds. Over a two-day period in present-day Los Angeles, a whole cast of vivid characters clash and crash into one another in an emotionally draining sparring match of wits, words and explosive outcomes. Police officer Matt Dillon and new partner Ryan Phillippe do not see eye-to-eye when it comes to law enforcement practices. Dillon's blatant racism toward African Americans immediately makes him an unsympathetic character who seems to be reeling due to the fact that he is unable to find suitable health care for his ailing father. A high class African-American television director (the always outstanding Terrence Howard) and his socialite wife (Thandie Newton) find constant struggles due to the fact that they do have the finer things in life and are part of a societal racial minority---something that many others just cannot comprehend or understand. A district attorney (Brendan Fraser) has political problems on top of political problems as his blatantly terrified wife (Sandra Bullock's finest turn) becomes a jumbled bundle of nerves after they are carjacked by two hilariously informed African-American thieves (Larenz Tate and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) who obviously have their fair share of philosophical meanderings. A Mexican-American locksmith (Michael Pena) tries to provide comfort and solace to his young wife and daughter as he attempts to give them better lives than what he has had. A Persian immigrant (Shaun Toub) who is near a breaking point after the latest robbery of his convenient store also gets thrown into the dizzying mix. His adult daughter (Bahar Soomekh) tries to be the calming influence in his turbulent life. And of course we have two police detectives/lovers (Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito) who try to make sense of senseless happenings, while having trouble themselves in their personal relationship. Paul Haggis' demoralizingly real and complex screenplay is revolutionary and his direction is subtly strong as he takes a backseat behind the camera and lets his actors run to the bank with the multi-layered script. Highly intelligent and thought-provoking in its ""this is happening right now"" approach, ""Crash"" literally runs over its audience with strong cinematic executions and conclusions. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Crime
"A good watch, but definitely NOT tops!","Maybe I have lost my heart for films that tackle controversial issues, but this didn't seem that far off base from any other one I've seen.Okay, let's break it down. Everyone is a racist. There, that just about does it.Obviously, this is a bit of a rash way to describe the entire film, and I mean it with a grain of salt. The fact is that all of us have some sort of prejudice to some other group of people (regardless of what the definitive characteristic of that group may be; IE - they like to butter their toast on the other side than I do).This movie tackles the fact that in many cases of intelligent society, the reasons for this prejudice is due to life experience as opposed to learned ignorance. In other words, seemingly consistent activity (or at least 'seemingly consistent' according to statistics) of any particular sect of society has lead to a label whereby that activity is expected before rational judgment can be made. Sometimes, the rational judgment comes too late.The writer of this screenplay does a good job of explaining this and getting it across. This is why I cannot completely downplay this film. However, it seems like this intention is all that is successfully put forth for the first two-thirds of the film.The script seems more like someone had some great speeches he/she wanted to read to some people. Well, since some person reading speeches doesn't appeal to the masses, it's easier to convert the speeches into a screenplay and make some money off of the message.Now, with this, it is understandable why the characters' racism is so 'in-you-face' for the majority of the movie. We did not get to grow up with each character, nor do we know why they think the way they think. The only way to successfully get an audience to accept a personality in a short period of time is to shove it down their throats.The final third of the movie aggressively tries to complete each story, and does so in a fairly acceptable fashion. Almost every question is answered, lives are changed, and messages come full circle. For this purpose, I will give this movie a 7 out of 10. It functions as a message, explains that there are different reason why people fall prey to such activity, and defines how single incidents and accidents can alter one's entire life perception. But, it is a far cry from a perfect 10, much less do I think it deserves the company of IMDb's top 250.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Expect the Unexpected.,"Perhaps not since the days of D.W. Griffith has Hollywood tackled the theme of Intolerence as effectively as in ""Crash"". Set in Los Angeles the film covers 48 hours in the lives of a number of apparently unrelated people, who in unexpected ways meet and in doing so alter their lives for ever (much in the manner of a Robert Altman picture). The smouldering racial tension of a big city with a mix of ethic races, is the underlying theme as these characters interact. This is a strong though complicated drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat, as the characters collide in the most unexpected ways, nothing is as it seems, even the apparent miracle. Sharp clever dialogue reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction"" and fine acting cameos lift this production well above average. Notably Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, but the entire cast is remarkable. Its exceedingly well written and confidently brought to the screen, fine cinematography, and editing. My only slight niggle was the music, which in the cinema I saw the movie was too loud and distracting. This the first film of the Director Paul Haggis, also the writer, and he is a man to watch in future. He should go far.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
racism comes in many colors,"This is a great film that's marred by its absurd amount of contrived moral ""incidents"" in its finale. one or two of these would have been enough to hammer the message home. I desperately tried not to be cynical but towards the end i was loosing the battle. Having said that is an amazing film with a great cast and stand out performances particularly from Tandie Newton. And she is English too! Sandra bullock also gives an against type performance which adds to the power of her character. I recommend seeing this film and leaving all cynicism at the door. If you can do that you will enjoy this film. It will hit you hard at times but that is what any good film should do. But if you can't come with an open mind read below! Though it aims to turn stereotypical views on racism on their head i feel it nearly achieves this too well in creating a group of people who seem to be obsessed with race and the issues that surround a multicultural society. It seems any time we catch a glimpse of them they are making some kind of racial observation and you feel at times they have nothing better to do with their lives. Obviously this film has an agenda and thus we need to be exposed to its themes and issues but there is such thing as overkill. It works the ""mixed up morals"" theme also. Particularly with the two ""hoods"" Anthony and his friend. Anthony has a extreme devotion to his racial roots while his friend, though willing to kill, keeps a saints relic in his pocket. Yet its the actors that save this film from becoming a new age ""moral of the story"" tale and that is saying a lot; that they manage to bring it above this. Ultimately i can sum up my gripes by saying i wondered what i should feel with Damon's Character. He's a good cop who looks after his ailing father yet brutally molests woman while on the beat. I felt this was verging on arrogant by the writer in his aim to create such a conflicting character. Film offers great power in unleashing the imagination but this seems to smack of a character solely created to get a reaction, to fit a ""cool"" idea that the writer came up with.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
This is an important movie that highlights the effects of the systemic realities of racial and ethnic stereotyping and micro-aggressions.,"Don Cheadle leads an all-star casts of characters who wrestle with the day-to-day realities of racial and ethnic tensions in Los Angeles. Scripted as a series of interwoven vignettes, the movie masterfully captures the nuances of the struggle for identity as a theme that transcends racial and ethnic boundaries. The movie underlines the racial structural problems that are woven into the fabric of American society. Each character is portrayed as both flawed and virtuous. Cheadle's character, an LAPD detective must wrestle with his own identity as he rises in his career often at the expense of those whom he loves. Terrence Dashon Howard (brilliant as usual), plays Cameron, an African-American television executive. Cameron is a classic example of Du Bois' dual consciousness of the black middle class. Sandra Bullock (Jean) finds true friendship outside of her suburban social circles; while Matt Dillon, (Officer Ryan) is both a racist and a hero. Such is the theme of the movie; we are all heroes and villains, good and bad, right and wrong. We live in a tension between possibilities.

Disappointing,"One thing's for sure - this is not of the calibre of an Anderson or Altman, despite the director's obvious frames of reference.The plot development was telegraphed for all to see, and the rather cynical attempts at wringing the emotions while tying up the loose ends of the various strands made it feel like a daytime soap (written by someone who feels he should be doing something more 'worthy').Every character seems to have reached an epiphany by the final reel, despite the wildly variant moralities on display. Maybe this is the most interesting aspect of the film, but sometimes it is better to make a stance and take a view rather than let it blow in the wind as this director seems to prefer.Although one may read the premise of 'Crash' as being relating to racism (in all it's forms), in the end the ambiguity on offer lets it down badly and 'soft-soaps' the issues - when a more confrontational view may be more useful and relevant in highlighting the world we all live in.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Worst movie of the year. Please, do not waste your time.","Crash is supposed to be a film about racism in Los Angeles. But in fact, it's just a bunch of coincidences between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world. Who the hell is going to believe that? There are unrealistic situations, one after the other. On the other hand, this film pretends to show racism between Asians, Iranians, Latinos, Blacks, and Whites. But the big error relies on a pre-establish racism coming from the writer. Mainly because the White characters in this movie are usually portrait as people with a better social-economical status than the rest of the other races. Iranians are poor, just like the Asians. And Latinos, as always, are portrait as Housekeepers, police officers, or with a very low profile job like a locksmith. Jesus!!! Don't you guys think it's about time to change these stereotypes? Same with blacks, portrait as gang members, with the exception of a Black TV Director, who was the only fresh character for me. This movie sucks so hard, that makes me so disappointed about the kind of cinema coming out from Hollywood these days. Always with stereotype characters. No realism whatsoever. Nothing to identify with. It's simply a big waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show Latinos, Koreans, Iranians, and blacks, from a different perspective.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

For the most part like real life,"This is a very hard movie to sit through especially for African Americans. So much of it makes you mad, then you get sad. There were only a few things that didn't ring true for me, but judging by the world today I guess you can never predict what human beings will do. It was nice to see the supposed bad guys do something good, but it wasn't as comfortable to see the good guy not take responsibility for doing something bad. My husband and I were the only African Americans in the theater when we saw this movie and we laughed a lot while the rest of the theater was silent. But at the end I kept waiting for something Hollywood to happen and it didn't; then I remembered this is suppose to be like real life, nothing Hollywood happens in real life.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
crash raises issues in blatant way,"I thought crash was a very well done film, but overly exaggerated the issues and racial tension present. I agree that there are significant issues regarding race that are troubling this nation, but some of the scenes of crash were not too believable. To clarify, people do not usually openly verbally attack others with racial slurs and tirades for relatively no reason, and the fact that all these people and their stories are interconnected is too much for me. Yes there are racist people but all of them reaching a breaking point at the same time culminating in a climactic ending is too much of a stretch. Overall it was another clever writing scheme that involved a dozen characters who through seemingly unrelated events come together in the end and their stories piece together nicely for cinema. I don't know about everyone else, but i am getting kind of tired of these kind of movies. Best picture... I don't think so.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A piece of reality...,"This movie is just great... Deserved much more than an Oscar. It goes deep in reality and show us some big problems of life and how they grew up to what they are. It's just shocking to see a part of our day-by-day in front of ours eyes, nude and fresh, and realize that the world is what it is because of lack of communication, love and compassion. It show us that small things can change everything and that we all humans are related in a way or another. The plot is fantastic! This is not a movie for entertainment, this is a movie to touch our lives and makes us have a second thought about our valors and how we have been carrying on in this, long and short at the same time, journey.

the BEST movie of the year,"Crash is the best movie of the year! i was blown away. It has a great story, great acting and good writing. The essentials of a good movie. I loved the interlocking stories. It reminded me of Magnolia. Which is my favorite movie. It tackles racism the way a movie should. It shows us the clichés of all the different races. How hurtful and ugly humans can be. The movie also has hope as it shows how characters and situations can change our thoughts and actions towards others.I'm not a big fan of musicians taking to the big screen but Ludicrous pulls it off. Matt Dillon is very good as a racist cop. This is Sandra Bullock's best performance, though she has a small role. So don't go out and expect her to be in the bulk of the movie. Her Agent did her well by landing her a role of substance for a change. Don Cheadle is great as always. His partner Jennifer Esposito has her best role as well. Damn she's hot!

great film,"This was the best film made in the last 5+ years. A good movie keeps you thinking after you have seen it. It has been 2 weeks since I have seen it, and I am still mulling it over in my feeble brain. Yes, it tackles tough issues, but it does not preach. I was left feeling rather empty. The realization that one's prejudices are so far reaching was rather over-whelming, but in a good way. I think that we take our prejudices for granted - that we are supposed to think a certain way. This makes us want to re-assess our judgments and our beliefs. So while one may say it is a depressing movie, I disagree- it is an uplifting movie based in reality",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The acting was fine and the actors chosen for the roles were fine as well. I just didn't understand how one character related to another, how any of the events related to each other and how they were relevant to the movie, and I surely didn't get the purpose of this movie itself. It required more analyzing and thinking than I like to do when I watch a movie as a leisure activity.

OKAY.,It doesn't just touch on overt racism but how our personal struggles can affect our interactions and representations of how we see people. We can unconsciously become prejudice unintentionally.

Excellent movie but predictable,"This movie is a mirror of racism in the US. The acting is excellent, the racism is a reality and no one should miss this film. What is missing is what makes a movie great instead of good. We know from the first 15 minutes that it's about racism and the rest of the movie shows excellent examples of how racist America is but that is the problem. Since we know that the movie is going to give us unabashed racism and does, then anyone seeing the film should know what each scene is going to depict before the scene is shown. Nonetheless, even though the movie is totally predictable, it is not shallow or thin, in fact it's thick and fat with reality. Don't let the fact that every racist cliché you're ever heard interfere with the high quality of acting and the seriousness of this film. It is worth seeing for two reasons, superb acting and a chance for each of us to see a little of ourselves. Al Goodin",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A brilliant ensemble cast in a brilliant film,"A riveting and explosive drama, Crash is a simply terrific film. Exploring issues of race in a brilliant manner the film manages to be thought-provoking and eye-opening and yet still entertaining and thoroughly engrossing. Crash follows a widely disparate cast of characters in Los Angeles where people's prejudices and assumptions color the way they see others and ultimately impact their own destiny. We follow over a dozen central characters and explore the ways in which the fates of these people, seemingly with no connection to one another, all become intertwined. It's a tangled web and a fascinating one to explore.If one actor had to be singled out as the star of the picture it would be Don Cheadle as a black cop being pulled in many different directions. His family, his superiors and his Latina female partner, who he also happens to be sleeping with, all want something different from him and the plot can be said to revolve around him. Cheadle gives a terrific performance but there are many other actors doing excellent work portraying varied characters, each of whom have their own unique and well-developed story. Particularly noteworthy are Matt Dillon as a racist cop, Terrence Howard as a successful black television director, Michael Pena as a Hispanic locksmith who is also a loving father and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges as a young man who has chosen a rather interesting career path. In somewhat lesser roles the likes of Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Esposito, Thandie Newton, Ryan Philippe and Larenz Tate all do fine work. There are other less-familiar faces who also turn in very good performances. Perhaps the only casting misstep is Brendan Fraser as the Los Angeles district attorney. Fraser really isn't plausible in the role, not having the appropriate sense of seriousness and experience required. But his screen time is mercifully short, not nearly enough to detract from all the terrific performances around him.Cross-cutting between characters, following so many different stories that all tie in to one another somehow, Crash is a thrilling ride. It is full of suspense, has many, many moments of great drama and sheer terror, and all along is filled with raw, genuine, honest, in-your-face emotion. It is certainly a movie with a message yet you do not feel as if you are being preached to. The story is simply laid out there for you to see for yourself the consequences which prejudices and false assumptions can have. It is a brilliantly conceived story which is performed wonderfully by a superb cast. One cannot ask for much more than that.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Recommendable Film,"I'm actually surprised that many gave Crash a negative comment. I have recently seen this film and for me, Crash was a great one. It has well made movie with multiple characters who all play a part in racism,discrimination, and stereotype. Crash informs people about these issues that actually take place today in many different countries. The film also teaches a lesson about being open minded and to understand people regarding their race and ethnicity. It has a sense of drawing one into the film because of the many different emotions it creates as the film goes on, from anger, to sadness, and also relief. What I really enjoyed most about this film is the many surprises it has, you don't know what to expect. Being able to relate to the situations and actually connect to the characters of the film is another factor why I enjoyed and would definitely recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Interesting to see scenes of life through the eyes of LA,"I thought it was a film intended to move towards a big climax which it did, so in that way it was a good allegory for the human experience in the modern world-people are always racing towards something or away from something-but nobody is stationary for very long, and things are always peaking and then falling back again. I liked the characters even though I didn't always agree with them. There is a contradiction in the celebration of the human experience in todays cinema in that we embrace the complexities and new experiences of the modern world but at the same time the happenstance of the modern melange can create very real and sometimes stomach turning problems. I think LA is probably unique in that is is such a car culture contrasted against other cities in North America. Car culture is much like 'cargo culture' where life imitates the life before it, not always representing the meanings of what was, so clearly. In the film people search for meaning in a world that threatens to crush them out of existence in the blink of an eye. Is it the pursuit of order in chaos that drives us on?, is a question asked by the film. Mostly we are just swept from place to situation by events we can no longer control, is what I think the answer is.It's nice to think we are in control of things, but things mostly just control us. Good work, maybe tries to deal with too many situations at once.",,Anonymous,Crime
It deals with the unspoken turmoil of various racial groups that still goes on today in society but which is unsaid,"Crash done by the same director of Magnolia involves the same mangling of sub plots that tie them all together at the end. It is not as artistic as Magnolia, but teaches an imperative moral story. Crash is almost like American Beauty as well. Although it pertains to racism. The characters deal with different scenarios between someone of another ethnic decree, and sheds a light on their stereotypical biasness that come out and feed into the racist perception, which has plagued our nation for the last 100 years. At the end of the movie the characters realize that their unspoken/spoken racist perceptions consequently, negatively effected them physically and mental as well as others. The characters soon do a u-turn such as Matt Dillion's character in the movie, where he risks his own life to save the Aftrican American woman stuck in a car, which earlier in the movie he sexually violates in front of her boyfriend, who was of the same ethnicity to show his racist views. This definitely moves the audience and makes you rethink of our own racist views and how deep they go and affect others.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

By that I mean that the events in the movie slap you in the face, and the fingerprints don't go away too quickly. The casting and the way the stories mingle together were composed wonderfully.

Good Oscar Film on Stereotypes and Race.,"""Crash"" is a movie that involves the lives of different people during a period of two days in Los Angeles: a police detective (Don Cheadle) with a mother high on drugs and a younger brother who makes a habit of stealing cars. He and his pal rob a district attorney (Brendan Fraser and and his wife (Sandra Bullock). In addition, this movie also deals with a veteran cop (Matt Dhillon), who cares for his ailing father and who disgusts his younger partner (Ryan Phillippe) by molesting a woman (Thandie Newton) during a traffic stop; and a Persian-immigrant father who buys a gun to protect his shop which involves a Hispanic-American locksmith and his young daughter.This is a powerful movie that displays how racism and stereotypes affect human lives. What we see in this movie is misinterpretation, prejudgment, heroic acts, retribution, hatred and forgiveness. We also see both good and bad acts in this movie, like when the cop John Ryan (Dhillon) molested Christine Thayer (Thandie Newton) during a traffic stop, but ends up being the one who saves her from a car accident. This is my favorite scene in the movie, which combines the acts of forgiveness, irony and heroism. Another notable scene is when Jean Calbot (Bullock), after being robbed, vents that if she complains to society about her being robbed by two Black men, she would be considered racist because she is White. This is true in parts of society today, as the subject of race is misinterpreted in many ways.Another touching scene is when the locksmith was being shielded by his young daughter from a bullet. Turns out, she survives the incident, even though it appears she has been shot. It depicts that even in the hardest and grimmest times in society, miracles exist.Overall, a very powerful and dramatic movie full of character development and depth. The only downside is that the movie lacks some comic relief. But, it is certainly worthy of its Oscar win.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"It is not the definitive film nor will it provoke reflection: Prejudice, racism, ignorance, injustice: everything is present, and in a way that is as painful as it is true","Starting his narrative with a traffic accident (which will form an elegant rhyme with its outcome), Haggis gradually introduces us to an immense gallery of characters who represent different types understood by society: at one point, for example, we see the neurotic woman played by Sandra Bullock insinuating that the locksmith in her house might be a gang member, and we see that the guy was (justifiably) insulted. However, the film doesn't just look at him superficially - and when he leaves, we accompany him to his residence and meet his family. Thus, throughout its almost two hours of projection, we ended up getting to know more than two dozen remarkable characters who, thanks to the talent of their interpreters, the direction (and script) of Haggis and the editing of Hughes Winborne, become equally important to the viewer.Incidentally, the first feature that draws attention in the universe conceived by Haggis is the ethnic and social diversity of the characters portrayed - a fundamental detail for the filmmaker to be able to draw a complex panel on intolerance and prejudice in North American society, which faces a veritable civil ""cold war"" in which everyone fights everyone else: whites fear blacks, who despise orientals, who offend Persians, who dislike Latinos, who hate whites, who also dislike Arabs, and so on. When a white policeman kills a black policeman in an exchange of fire without witnesses, the prosecutor is tempted to declare that the second was an innocent victim in order not to be accused of prejudice by the press - even if there is evidence that the policeman killed it was corrupt. What's wrong with this picture? Simple: the words ""white"" and ""black"" shouldn't make the slightest difference when analyzing the situation.Unfortunately, prejudices of all forms are part of life in society; we fear those who are ""different"", ignoring that, in reality, we are all the same and that these ""differences"" are superficial characteristics, such as the concentration of melanin in the skin or the belief in a slightly different God. And what's worse: as we are conditioned from childhood to recognize these differences (even if with the salutary aim of ignoring them), fighting this conditioning becomes a constant and complex battle: in a moment, we can make a speech passionate fight against stereotypes and racism, and the next minute we're crossing the street to avoid a ""suspicious"" looking black guy. Even a constant victim of prejudice can manifest her own aversions without realizing the sad irony that this represents: in Crash, for example, the articulate Shaniqua Johnson (Devine), who is black, is outraged by the treatment she receives from the police officer Ryan, lived by Matt Dillon, but the first thing he says when confronting an Asian man who has crashed his car is: ""Don't talk to me unless you can speak ""American"" In this sense, when analyzing the different types of intolerance.However, Paul Haggis' film does not only discuss prejudice, but also one of its causes (and, simultaneously, consequences): the absurd violence that threatens everyone today. At one point, Sandra Bullock's character vents: ""I feel angry all the time"" - and of course she feels this way: how can we maintain serenity living in a society in which our children, instead of fearing the ""bogeyman"", are afraid of stray bullets and rapists? As a matter of fact, in this aspect the film may not be seen with much sympathy by those who defend the sale of firearms in the country, since, without preaching (the script avoids this posture from beginning to end), it illustrates the potential for tragedy represented by a gun: the film has two particularly tense sequences in which one or more characters face the barrel of a gun. Simply put, ""Crash"" boils the issue down to its basics: It's not about whether or not you support gun legalization; the mere existence of these objects is reprehensible, since they are created with the sole purpose of injuring or taking someone's life. (Has anyone heard of a decorative Magnum?).In reality, ""Crash"" is more than a study in prejudice and violence; it is, above all, a sensitive insight into human nature. Thanks to the series of stories that intersect, we can see how someone who is seen as a ""villain"" in one minute can emerge, in the next instant, as a person worthy of respect and admiration. In this sense, Matt Dillon's policeman is emblematic: after subjecting Thandie Newton's character to an absurd humiliation, it is precisely he who demonstrates a wonderful detachment in trying to save her - and the look of incomprehension she gives him is absolutely perfect: ""How can this man be capable of such contradictory attitudes?"", she seems to think. And the answer is simple and complex at the same time: he is human and, as such, contradictory par excellence. (By the way, there is another look in the film - this time, of a dead man - which is impressive for its richness of content, as he seems to stare with absolute disapproval at the face of the person beside him). Therefore, the viewer must learn a lesson: depending on the moment, we are all prejudiced, victims of a system that suffocates us, vulnerable almost all the time, acting as lovable or hateful people as our day progresses.In ""Crash"", Paul Haggis speaks of Los Angeles, placing us in the United States, but the discussion is wide and could be debated in any other capitalist metropolis around the planet. An example of our duality is in the character Shaniqua Johnson (Loreta Devine), a black woman who is the victim of racism by a police officer, but in a later scene, she crashes the car with an Asian man and mistreats him in a xenophobic posture. By working on the complexity of human beings and the automaticity of stereotypes, the film appears as a mirror of our everyday lives. What to say when Sandra Bullock's character judges a locksmith because of her tattoos and clothes, but in the previous scene, she was assaulted by two black men who judged her prejudiced, precisely because she squeezed her husband's hand harder when the boys passed by on the way out of a restaurant? She may be rich and spoiled, but isn't that what the media sells? What appears in the graphics of television news and headlines on a daily basis? Who should we fear?The way in which each of these destinations comes together reveals a keen awareness of the whole, skillfully building a message superior to each of the separate narrative lines. Intelligent and insightful, the director manages to escape the easy cliché, giving them life and verisimilitude, even with few individual moments. Don Cheadle's character makes the comment that sets the tone of the entire film: ""in Los Angeles everyone is so busy that we don't meet, we bump into each other. And each bump like this causes an explosion that is difficult to repair afterwards"".""Crash"" is like that, intense, violent and suffering. The actors give themselves unreservedly to their roles, and the ensemble offers us something unique and valuable. This work also opposes our own preconceptions as spectators, taking us out of a previously comfortable situation and taking us into the action. Since the conflicts experienced on screen are common to all, however insignificant they may appear at first, the connection is established. And once there is identification, the strength of the message is even stronger. Every little storyline in Crash: Ultimate is rich enough to warrant a movie in its own right. But Haggis, in putting them together, does more, exploring them wisely and convincingly. Here we have a panel, sometimes generic, but never superficial, of a cauldron of possibilities that boils in climatic, irreversible and overwhelming moments. Prejudice, racism, ignorance, injustice: everything is present, and in a way that is as painful as it is true. Perhaps it is not so revolutionary as a cinema, but its relevance lies in the message it carries. And that's why it deserves not only to be checked out, but also understood and assimilated.This production is capable of leading the viewer to reflect on who we are, what we do, or why we act in such inconsequential ways. By the way, who am I to label something a ""masterpiece"" or say what is inconsequential? By giving a label to anything, I will inevitably be exposed to criticism or praise, and so will follow the basket of this alienated society in which we live. ""Crash"" is not the definitive film nor will it provoke deep reflection on the subject. Its intention is to be a true portrait of a society that sells itself as modern, but which, at the same time, reveals itself to be archaic by failing to solve one of the most serious problems of human coexistence.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Crash,"Crash, is about the lives of several people who deal with racism in some way shape or form in their everyday lives. Crash, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good original music and good cinematography. There were many things I liked about Crash, and then some things I did not like about it. The film deals with racism and that is the main theme of the movie but the director focuses on it so much that after awhile it feels like he is trying to teach a lesson on it and makes us his students watching an educational film on racism. I thought it went a little overboard and after awhile it felt like the movie was nothing more than a film trying to show us what is right and what is wrong and how miserable these people are because of it. The film also gives us a moral ending that maybe we will be all better if we change our ways and are not racist. The film also felt like sometimes it wanted to shock us with these racist characters and situations just for the sake of shocking us and make the world a better place and get it's morals across but at the end the film doesn't have much to say other than do this because it is right and don't do that because it is wrong. And near the end of the movie I felt like the director was trying so hard to make us care about these characters and identify with them that it almost got a little sappy. It's like he wanted us to cry or feel depressed just to get this message across but it doesn't work. At least for me it didn't. The film is also jumbled and doesn't deal with having so many characters in one film too well and during the second half of the movie it started to get slower and felt like it dragged at times. The film started out good and it has some good scenes and is interesting for the most part and has good performances but ultimately I found the movie too preachy about it's message and the film is so concerned with it's message that it does little else with the film. I still enjoyed the film enough with it's performances and involving first half but because of this relentless preaching and the jumbled plot of the film I don't think it is the masterpiece critics are making it out to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent Movie,"If you haven't seen this film, you should. If you already have then I'm sure you were emotionally ROCKED the same way I was during the ""Really good cloak"" scene. I responded to Michael Peña's anguish in this scene. It spoke to me. It's the naive sweetness of a child. It is instant horrible anguish that any man with a small daughter can understand.It's absolutely the most staggering moment that I've experienced from any film.Overall the movie is outstanding. It evoked strong emotional responses from me such as anger, anguish, bewilderment, elation, happiness, and relief. This isn't mindless entertainment that the majority of movies tend to be.

Quite good,"I'm currently watching all Best Picture nominees/winners. Crash won in 2004.The film follows unrelated characters going through their day-to-day lives in LA. How they are connected to each other is shown later in the movie.Crash isn't very subtle and shows themes of racism in LA, which can be hard to watch. Crash isn't subtle, in fact majority of the dialogues consist of characters discussing/talking about racism. This makes the dialogues rather contrived and often times unconvincing/unrealistic.The acting is good. No one particularly stood out for me but yeah, they're all pretty good. Crash features unlikeable characters, in fact most of them are despicable. But the film also shows that they are also all like us: human. The film also shows that anyone, no matter the skin color, can be racists. One of the character's redemption arch is particularly noteworthy and it's a powerful scene. There are also quite other few scenes that invoke strong emotions, particularly anger at times.Cinematography and the score aren't particularly noteworthy for me. I also don't know how it won Best Editing, I'm not a fan of it, at least for me anyway.Did Crash deserve to win the Best Picture? No. Is it a bad movie? No. It's a pretty good movie, but not close to Best Picture-worthy.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent Moral Theme; Enlightening,"Some of us can not see past our prejudice, through to the heart of our fellow man. My statement seems trite; but this movie is definitely not trite. For many it will be an eye opener. This movie helps the viewer experience the love in the lives of people of different ethnicity other than ones own. The movie helps us see how complex and insidious prejudice is and how it is profoundly embedded in the nation's character. Perhaps more importantly the movie shows how prejudice can cause deadly harm, harm based on maddening irrationality. Is this irrationality to continue forever? Our we never to get past our nation's shame? Is Los Angeles or is the nation headed for a crash?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Interesting, unique film","When all the hype revolving around ""Crash"" finally settled down, I thought it best if I finally rent the DVD to see for myself what this award-winning film is about. A lot of people had said it was very good, and being set in a post-9/11 environment intrigued me. However, while it was a very, very good film, it didn't quite grab me. I understand that it was probably supposed to leave a strange cold-feeling inside you after watching it, but I guess I just wasn't prepared for it.""Crash"" is intense to say the least, and I'm not talking about the large cast and multiple story lines running alongside each other, but the overall narrative of the film is at times hard to take in at times. It definitely helps watching this if you know a bit about why various races do not like each other for whatever reasons they have. The content of the film is filled with offensive language, drug use, violence of almost every sort imaginable, and so on, and at times, makes for a very sad and depressing film.That is lifted however thanks to the outstanding cast. Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, Don Cheadle, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Espsito, Ludicrous, Brendan Fraser, Michael Pena and Terrance Howard are all stand out in their leading roles, but in particular Dillon, Phillippe, Newton and Pena. The spectacular Nona Gaye has a small role as the assistant to Brendan Fraser's character, Loretta Devine is as usual great in her small role, Daniel Dae Kim and Tony Danza make small appearances, as does the graceful Marina Sirtis (Deanna Troi from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation), and although the character she played seemed far too old for her, it is great to see Sirtis acting still, and that she hasn't lost any of her compassion.Overall, a interesting, unique film, that (I'll admit) at times was lost on me, but it makes for a very thought-provoking film and the cast are all terrific.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Grossly overrated,"Given this film's incredible reviews I was expecting something truly exceptional. It certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue, and a fine cast in place. A series of Robert Altman-style interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes. I found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly, it collapses like a pack of cards. A series of ludicrous coincidences and right-on messages stack up until I'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about. Paul Haggis has tackled the subject of race in LA, and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest. Given that most of the Academy voters live in LA and have experienced racism to some extent, this film is sure to have an impact on them. That means the Oscar for Best Picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie. Let's hope it is the latter, because Brokeback Mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""A Great Ensemble Cast Delivers""","Several stories interweave during two days in Los Angeles involving a collection of inter-related characters. A black police detective with a drugged out mother and a thieving younger brother, two car thieves who are constantly theorizing on society and race, the distracted district attorney and his irritated and pampered wife, a racist veteran cop (caring for a sick father at home) who disgusts his more idealistic younger partner, a successful black Hollywood director and his wife who must deal with racist cop, a Persian-immigrant father who buys a gun to protect his shop, a Hispanic locksmith and his young daughter who is afraid of bullets, and more.Paul Haggis won an Oscar for his work on the Best Picture winner ""Million Dollar Baby"". While ""Baby"" itself doesn't deserve the praise that it is given, the writing did. Here Haggis gives us another piece of work that will have some in tears and others filled with rage at the morals of society.Crash's core theme is that of racism and how it is destroying today's society. Crash tries to get the point across that this prejudice is destroying our ways of communication with each other. The film uses L.A. as it's setting to show us that virtually anyone and everyone can be racist. Which is where Crash faults. Although the film does deal with this theme, about 95% of the characters are racist and uses almost every stereotype to showcase the problems in society.With those two missteps aside, Crash is a film that delivers everything that is promises to. Brilliant writing, good directing and a cast ensemble that gives us great performances. Paul Haggis wrote characters that had problems and he knew exactly how to present them to us and how to deal with them. Many directors who write the material have a hard time trying to abstract the material to screen. David S. Goyer failed at this with Blade Trinity, but here Haggis has enough experience to know what he wants from his actors and in what direction he wants to take them.Out of all the performances in this picture the select few that would stand out would be the racist cop, played by Matt Dillion. The successful black director, played by Terrance Howard and the racist wife of the district attorney played by Sandra Bullock. Dillion shows that his character is an egotistical selfish prick, but in the end, we end of not hating him, but feeling sorrow for him. He has the trouble of taking care of a sick father and finally puts the life of an individual before the colour of their skin. Terrance Howard gives a performance that is just as good as his portrayal of a pimp in Hustle and Flow. Howard is able to convey so much emotion through his eyes. Finally Bullock plays a character that is radically different from anything that she has done before and is able to convince us of her fear and hate towards those that are of a different race.Crash delivers lots of moments of tension and fear for the lives of the characters. I was glued to the screen when the little girl put her ""invisbile cape"" to the test. All the characters effect the lives of each other whether they know it or not and it all fits together perfectly well. Crash is one of the few movies this year to give us a powerful message.With a talent writer behind the pen and knowing what he wants in this film, he is able to give us a great film. Along with one of the best cast ensembles to grace the screen since the likes of True Romance. Crash gives us a movie that will make us cry, laugh and feel anger towards. Not many movies these days are able to do this, but Crash makes it work beautifully.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Know who you are and you have no idea,"Know who you are and you do not have a clue ""Crash"" is a film that, in my opinion, is surrounded by controversy for some (including me included) is a great movie, for others nothing more than a pamphlet and easy moralizing. In my opinion deserved the Oscar it won.Well we have a large number of stories carried out by persons of any race, class, ethnicity, etc ... and every one of these characters face in their own skin racism, one way or another. These stories are spun well and have a great asset to you and they are incredibly realistic, you think that might happen in reality, those characters and the situations you can find on the street, is one of the most positive aspects of film credibility.The dialogs of the film are excellent, where pearls are released as you know who you are and you do not have any idea ""some of these dialogs expel anger, dissatisfaction, hatred ... the characters (with a great soundtrack) really hard and emotional, but although abused terms like black, Chinese... Yet the script is excellent. It looks perfect to get people where they can, both as good as in evil, with the sole aim to survive in a city like LA where it is impossible not to clash.If we add a unique script, direction and effective interpretations about as powerful as the entire cast, which must be highlighted to Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle (both are always perfect) Sandra Bullock and Ryan Phillippe (surprising) and Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard, the result is a great film, realistic, emotional, sincere and credible, even though in its final part the director and screenwriter who tend towards an end is probably not adequate.

"well-done, but beats you into a corner with its ""message""","Bearing no relation to the David Cronenberg film of the same name, Paul Haggis's ""Crash"" is a button-pushing film that shoves race discrimination in the viewer's face in a way that is both admirable and off-putting. When dealing with such issues, filmmakers tend to shroud themselves in a protective cloak that makes them invincible from negative criticism, as those who criticize, without careful justification, can be painted as being as racist as the characters in the movie. My central objection comes in the form of the sledgehammer subtlety with which the issue is presentednot that it doesn't deserve addressing in such a waythat causes the film to reek of ""Oscar consideration,"" and thus removing some of its authenticity. Thematically, the extensive ensemble cast linked by scenes of racism that change their perceptions (a DA and his wife are carjacked at gunpoint; an Iraqi store owner is robbed; a black director releases his pent-up fury after witnessing his wife being molested by a corrupt cop; a detective investigates the murder of a young black man; a rookie policeman is hardened by two notable racial encounters), and the stories and the resulting fatal ironies that occur are well-done, with spectacular performances all around (Matt Dillon as a racist cop; Ludicrous as a paranoid petty criminal; Sandra Bullock as the DA's wife). Unlike 2003's ""21 Grams,"" which also presented moral and emotional quandaries with the intent of telling a story from three equally-explored viewpoints, ""Crash"" is more prone to contrivance (that cop's demeanor really shifted drastically), especially when put against the gimmicky framework of a single ""day in the life,"" which leads to plot developments that seem forced and inauthentic. Still, almost in spite of its overwhelming good intentions, ""Crash"" is compelling, unpredictable, and well-performed. It will provoke discussion and linger in your mind, which is an achievement in and of itself.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amazing Film,"This is such a great film I do not understand why ts so unlikable if you put attention to how much effort went into this. It is just amazing.They way the story is told is great, the actors are great but what I love the most is the symbolism of the crosses used throughout the film, the way the cinematographer works. The camera is always shooting into the light so we get the feel that we are in Los Angeles. In Los Angeles we are always squinting. There is also the scene with Shaun Toub and Michael Pena behind them are reindeer. This shows how it is Christmas time, there are other examples of this throughout the film. Christmas is supposed to be about love and affection and the total opposite thing is going on. It so great how it is done. There is a shot in this scene where Ashlyn Sanchez walks out the door to save Pena at that moment where the door is opened there is a cross. Which took me a while to see when I saw that I was speechless just amazing. Another shot which I found amazing when when Shaun Toub was standing there all by himself.

Well....,"Like Titanic before it, Best Picture-winning Crash has become a punching bag for movie snobs. While about as subtle as a series of left jabs from Hilary Swank, Paul Haggis's ensemble race drama is a watchable effort with some fine acting and a few truly moving moments.I think Crash's biggest problem is that it tries too hard, often sacrificing believable dialogue and characters for the clever, preachy and faux-profound varieties. Aside from a few miscasts (Encino Man as the L.A. district attorney?), the actors are able to rise above the overly...scripty script. Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard give standout performances.But my favorite characters, the films least clichéd, are the Hispanic locksmith and his daughter. My favorite scene in the film is probably the only one not centered around race: the one in which he comes home late from work and gives her an invincibility cloak that will protect her from neighborhood gunfire. It's a tender moment amidst the heavyhandedness.Is there much about Crash that is hard-hitting, bold or over-the-top thought-provoking? In 2005, not really.But I still liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I kept watching it because I'm a teacher and wanted to be able to discuss the film with my students in the broader context of how pop culture deals with racism.

Not only does it expose important issues of our society today, it does it in a way the doesn't preach and isn't cheesy. The emotion that is shown by the actors in this movie is phenomenal - people like Brendan Fraser and Sandra bullock who have not necessarily been in the most serious of movies (props to Brendan for With Honors and School Ties), they do a masterful job of making you believe they are who they are portraying. I think the best acting portrayals in the movie were the male parts played by Terrence Howard (who is becoming a powerhouse) and Matt Dillon (who played the role so perfectly I hated him while watching but still understood his frustrations). Movies like this bring issues to light that are often taboo and more often are portrayed as lectures to our society that turn people off and don't have any lasting effect.

"A Mesmerizing, Hard-Hitting, Drama About Racial Relations","7 May 2005. Easily and by the far the best movie in the first third of 2005, this likely to be awarded nominated racial drama scores high in the emotional punch in the soul department. The high tension and the heightened anger, frustration, and heated racial hatred are on fast forward throughout this movie. This is a no-holds barred movie with the language fast and loose, the women hot and heavy with their screaming and yelling and the men barely able to hold in their rage at the cruelty of the human condition. At the same time there is tenderness and humanity, the twists and curvatures turn back on themselves as the characters begin to relate to one another in unexpected ways not always with the best of results. Crash in probably on the best movies of the year, along with an unassuming but complementary score form Mark Isham (The Cooler). Sandra Bullock, Brandan Fraser, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe as well as the rest of the cast all gave outstanding performances. The only over-reaching, extreme moments are at the beginning as the feminine overdrive seems to be stuck on high as two of the female leads seem to represent the worse in women that we've all come to stereotype. There is also one subplot that seems to be underdeveloped that distractingly leaves lingering questions slowing the movie just a tad in several spots.

A Bold Exploration of Racism,"Crash (2004) has some weaknesses, such as one-dimensional characters that lack depth, which can make it challenging for viewers to connect emotionally.

Review about the movie Crash,"The movie Crash shows in different stories about Indians, Mexicans and also Blacks the various kinds of racism not just minorities all over the world are contending with. In this film also the Blacks condemn the Whites. Sometimes it seems Paul Haggisdidn't know how to combine the various story lines and so the links seem a little bit artificial. Nevertheless the movie conveys the feelings of the characters in a very good way. So everyone is able to understand the motives the Iranian shopkeeper has and that he wants to revenge on the person who caused his misfortune. Such moments, when somebody is thinking about his life(and the way it goes), are underlined by emotional music. This music is also meant to inspire the viewers to think about similar situations in their lives and about the way they reacted. Another important aspect 'Crash' pays attention to is that just a single moment is enough to change your whole life and your personality. Good people become evil and vice versa. All in all Ipersonally like the movie 'Crash', especially its critics of society and the distance between people.",,Anonymous,Crime

Very surprised that this is a real contender for an Academy Award - there are more deserving films out there..I think that if it does win anything it's purely because of the hype and advertising it is getting and not because it is a truly deserving film.

OK, I would say Cheadle is really coming on as a major actor, but it's the content that is the focus here. One can see these dark-sided things almost everyday in the police and lawyer shows on TV and besides the newspapers are full of this stuff as well.We get to see dark slices of life of various characters. Yes, the characters do save themselves, but this is not to say this will always happen in real life. However I am not sure the Rookie cop saves himself.So even though the production is good I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It is not a ""must see.""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crash delivers,"the movie crash explores in depth themes about how we perceive others in society, racism to name a few. It also explores the interrelationships between the characters very effectively This was backed by terrific performances by Jennifer Esposito, Thandie Newton, Sandra Bullock, Terrence Howard, Brendan Fraser, Don Cheadle, Micheal Pena, Chris ""Ludicris"" Bridges, Loretta Devine, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe and Larenz Tate.The music in this film was very effective and also captured the mood of this film very well.Overall, I recommend this movie to anybody.

"Good ""everything connects and acts have consequences"" movie","Unfortunately, I've seen several movies like this in the last year and, even if I liked the film, I do think that too much is too much. I accept that having to have the same characters in every scene forces the screenwriter to think a bit and that having the same actors in all the scenes reduces the costs of the movie dramatically, but I shouldn't suffer from it! :)OK, on the more serious side, this is a good movie. Some of the scenes are hilarious and it is not overly dramatic, as most of the movies of this type are. However, I feel they pushed the interconnectivity a little too far. I mean, the same people meet over and over again ... in L.A. That's statistically improbable.Also, not being an American, it is hard for me to judge how real the film is. Is the racism such a big problem there? Does it affect every level of society as the movie showed? Are Iranians really not Arab? :) OK, joking here. Conclusion: watch it, it is worth it, but don't expect too much.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Despicable,"""Crash"" is not the best picture of the year; the Academy got it wrong, which wouldn't be the first time. If you're reading this and have not seen the film ""Crash"" I suggest you stop reading and watch the film so that you, the home viewer, can formulate your own opinion about the film prior to reading this entry. OK now, everybody else ready? Here we go: First and foremost this film is about 12 separate people in present day Los Angeles and their trials and tribulations during a 36-hour period. Though they all have never met before, each will eventually ""crash"" into one another and learn a valuable lesson about life. The overall moral of the film is not to stereotype others and end all racist connotations. So how does the film go about conveying this message? BY MAKING ALL 12 CHARACTERS IN THE FILM A RACIAL STEREOTYPE AND HAVING EACH CHARACTER STEREOTYPE ALL THE OTHER 11 CHARACTERS IN THE FILM!! WHAT KIND OF OXYMORONIC CRAP IS THAT?! This film wants to break down all stereotypes by making everyone in it a stereotype without any explanation of what, why, or how. Does this make any sense at all? None of the characters are decent people in the film (except for one, the Mexican!) due to their negative traits and negative actions. Plus the fact that there are 12 separate stories means the audience member can never understand the rhyme nor reason to each character's traits (which is easy, lazy, despicable writing to say the least). The viewer has no way to empathize with any of the characters in the film. So then why should the audience member give a damn about anything happening on screen? On top of that, there are some technical reasons why this film isn't the best picture of the year, most of which you can read on the ""Goofs"" section of IMDb. Oh, and it won for best editing as well. Way to go Academy! All in all this is a poor film, lazily written, poorly produced, and conveying a message that the messengers themselves don't understand due to the stereotypes that they represent.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best movies in recent memory.,"""Crash"", Paul Haggis' birth-child, (from ""Million Dollar Baby"" fame) is a brilliantly written and directed masterpiece. This movie centers around around 5 or 6 main characters, and how a car crash brings these seemingly random people together. They each learn ""a lesson"" in the process, and the lesson usually has something to do with racism. This is one of those movies that makes you think, and in a good way. The way it is presented is not forced, or that you HAVE to believe what the writer believes, (A.K.A. Michael Moore movies), but it does it in a non-threatening way. People have compared this to ""Magnolia"", which makes sense, but there's a little more sense of realism in this movie. What also impresses me is the actors. Brendan Frasier, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, and LUDARCIS are all in this movie, and they aren't actors you'd expect to be in a serious film. But, they are all amazing. Hats off to them for trying something different. To sum things up, go see this movie. Now.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Social Consciousness Awaken without Annoying Didactic Lesson,"The movie attempts to tackle a deep and profound topic. Surprisingly, it pulls it off. Crash is not merely a movie with a good cast. It is a movie with an amazing plot that happens to have a wonderful cast. Bullock, as always, is amazing. Although her role is small compared to her recent films, she manages to make her performance worth noting.The lead characters of the movie, however, are Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon. They both deliver amazing performances. Ludicrous surprises the world by showing he is not merely a rapper, but an actor, and a pretty good one at that. Ryan Phillipe is also delivers a great performance. But enough about the acting and more about the movie:Don Cheadle's character sums up the plot in his first line of the movie, which goes something like: in L.A. people don't really interact, everyone lives their own life without realizing those around them. That is why sometimes we have to crash just so we realize that we are alive.The movie then travels through a labyrinth of a series of plots that at one point or another all connect to each other. Each character is prejudice in some way or another. One minute you are enraged by a character's words and actions and the next you sympathize with him/her and understand why it is they act the way they do. After realizing that they are partially justified for their prejudism, you are left wondering who's side to take in every argument.The movie also tackles the idea of fate and free will. Do the characters really have free will or are their actions solely a product of what life has forced them to experience? Most importantly, the movie brings about all these questions and issues without sounding preachy. You do not feel you are being fed some propaganda. You are merely a spectator in an amazing roller coaster ride that does not attempt to answer the big questions. It simply presents them and leaves people to do what most do not want to: think.And so you leave the theater thinking: is this movie in line for an Oscar? It should be.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Holy Crap! - See This Movie.,"It's disturbing, gripping and manages to be tender too. My hat is off to Paul Haggis. In this movie he has done it all and very well at that. I should I guessed quality from the writer of the brilliant screenplay ""Million Dollar Baby"". He has assembled great performances from an excellent cast. We see different sides of the same story. The cast delivered strong performances. And I loved seeing this diverse group of actors. They were really on the money. This isn't like any other performance I've seen Sandra Bullock do. Simiply put go see this movie. It's worth your time. I loved the ride through this complex film. I will see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
I loved this movie,"I really enjoyed the movie Crash because of the reality of the film. It was also set up very differently from the majority of films, which usually just contain a single plot. This movie had various plots all going on at one time, which really made the film unique. I enjoy watching movies that allow me to feel emotion, it was able to bring out more than one emotion, which I personally feel is why this movie was so popular when it first came out in theaters. It shows the crime and reality that takes place in Los Angeles, rather than the Hollywood, glamorous life that many people believe the entire city is made up of. Overall, I really enjoyed Crash and think that it is well worth watching!",,Anonymous,Crime
Inspiring,"When I first heard of Crash, the first thought of mine was 'Oh great another political feel good movie skating over the real issues of society'. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a truly mesmerising and inspiring film, showing the troubling issue of racism still found in our society at the moment, portrayed through the lives of various strong and diverse characters. I won't say a lot as there are not enough words to reflect how deep and astonishing this movie is. What stuck out for me the most was the truly outstanding performances from each and every actor included in this film, which is a rare sight. In particular, appearances from actors such as Thandie newton, Ryan Phillipe and Don Cheadle really made me believe whole heartedly what message the film was trying to get across to the public. Furthermore, the emotional, hard hitting story line made me acknowledge the true conflicts of our world, and more than once I was overwhelmed with tears. I may sound sensitive. I may sound cheesy. But I will always remember how Crash forced me to unlock emotions I never knew I had. It deserved the best picture Oscar, and a hell of a lot more. If you want to see a worth while exhilarating, emotive film (with some raunchy love scenes to boot), I recommend this classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Among the best screenplays since Pulp Fiction, and one of the most, and more importantly best racially charged films since American History X.

A harsh look at people.,"Crash really goes deep to tackle the race issues.A thing that has plagued humanity.A thing that keeps driving men with power to manipulate those who are different and keep them under their foot.Even if it focuses only on a handful of characters,from which only some are actually widely discriminated,its issues are still universal.As it begins with a murder having taken place,and into the investigation,A character asks himself why we keep colliding with one another,even if we never come close to each other.As the story progresses,it becomes an urban drama with a murder mystery left to be solved.Lives of a group of people with different background comes colliding with each other resulting in consequences,surprises and redemption.In the following 36 hours,their lives will change and they will somewhat question their actions.A Persian store owner and his daughter who have problem with a Mexican locksmith fixing locks.A housewife and her DA husband's continuing quarrels over having mistrust in people who are not white, working for them.Two black carjackers,one who completely despises white people and pervasively accuses white people for everything.A black TV director who is accused by his wife of being a wimp and a coward towards a cop sexually and racially harassing both of them.A police detective investigating a crime and having problems with his partner who also is his lover and his personal life.A rookie cop who is put along with an experienced officer working for 13 years,who also have trouble taking care of his father, to learn from,who harasses non-white people.These men and women will learn why they are so intolerant to each other and find redemption within one another.Upon my first viewing,I was left sorely disappointed.You see,I really show deep respect to films that tackle racial discrimination with sensitivity.With Paul Haggis writing and making his debut,that further got me interested.But it wasn't what I expected.It does delves into those issues,but somehow it feels an unfocused attempt.Yes,it doesn't approach its racial issues in a straightforward manner.It rather includes a murder mystery into the whole story,but that's where the problem begins.It can't decide which does it want to be.An urban,mystery crime drama or a race drama.And it gets all jumbled and convoluted.And its direct speeches from the characters makes it look cheap,as any young filmmaker can pull that cheap trick off.It somehow steps into the obvious.As it takes a non-conventional take to its subject,it slowly enters to that obviousness.I would expect something more unconventional from Haggis.Despite its honest attempt and sensitively handled subject,it somehow lacks something.Something effective is missing.It somehow doesn't know how to end the whole film.It can't make up its mind.It remains ambiguous.It sometimes appears too preachy and corny and weak.The stories are uneven.And sometimes there are way too many coincidences.But having said that,I still regard this among the most thoughtful and important films in the Cinema world.One that every person must see.Its uncomfortable and hard look on race relations makes it impossible for you to look away.You are forced to view what we have become from what we once were.Where man once was of the same color/race,of the same species,and living on one continent and land,before separating into various continents and various colors and races,has now become so different from their own kind that we start questioning ourselves.What is going on?What's wrong with us?Why do we hate each other so much?Why does color or our background makes such a difference.Why all this hatred?Misunderstanding each other due to our different languages,given us by the ones who created us in this confusing world,is another thing.But misunderstanding each other even when we are able to understand each other,because we are different is something else.Like all films that tackle with really thought provoking issues,this film also leaves us with no answer,but just forces us to look at our ever-changing world from a distance and see what's happening.It ends with a notion that if we try to tolerate one another,if we just try hard enough,there might be a possibility that we may coexist even if we remain treating each other the way we have been,there might just be some hope.This film is not entirely or not even remotely successful to what it was trying to convey.But it comes close to stimulate our receptors to send signals to our head to come to our senses.But giving this film the best picture award over BrokeBack Mountain,I think that was unjustified.The film boosts fantastic score,and a melodious and beautifully written original track,IN THE DEEP.Impressive cinematography.The films main strength is in its ensemble performances.Every actor gives full justice to his/her character.In particular,Thandie Newton and Terrance Howard.Matt Dillon is really convincing as an enraged,anger filled cop.His nomination was well deserving.But I was surprised how Thandie Newton didn't get her nomination,when she gave a really deep performance.Howard was already great in Hustle and Flow,but here he shows his versatility.Ludicrous is really amusing and really makes you laugh at his character whenever he starts accusing white people.And Michael Pena also really shines.The entire cast does a fantastic job.You simply can't look at a single performance to sum it up.It's an ensemble piece and the credit should go to each and every actor.The reflective emotional moments are really well executed.Paul Haggis' first feature is a superb debut.He handles everything really well.His script is a strong point.The flaws in the script are clearly visible but the performances hides them well.But Haggis' screenplay should be given credit for approaching the subject in a different way.A well done effort.So,Crash may be another undeserving Best Picture like Chicago.But it certainly needs to be watched.7.5__B+__***1/2",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wanna be and professional critics need to get over themselves,"I think too many of us are missing the forest for the trees (or are trying to audition for film critic of the year--maybe both). The movie confronted humanity without apologies or excuses, and that was the beauty of it. It was very unhollywood-like and I am very happy it was produced. The technical aspects of the movie should have been secondary to the story. Trying to cover a broad sample of the American backdrop to tell the stories together in a meaningful way is a challenge. I don't think the time-line was intended to be taken literally. It jumped forward and backward as needed to cover the events that were pertinent to the story Haggis wanted to tell. There was no spare time to have casual conversations, long character development and still keep the pace of the story.It's a set of trade-offs: develop the characters vs. tell a sharp story, spoon-feed vs. let the audience fill in the blanks,etc. You can't have everything in 2 hours or less. Under those constraints I think the technical and stylistic effort was pretty good.For me personally, as a 30 something, successful, middle class African American man born and raised in southern California, I felt Don Cheadle's and Terrance Howard's characters in my soul. It was the kind of acting, in a major motion picture, from African American men that I have been waiting for for most of my adult life. I had tears in my eyes and the only other movie that I've seen in 20 years that had that kind of effect on me was Pay It Forward (despite the over-exposure and over-acting of that kid Haley Osment). Two movies in 20 Years--Platoon didn't do it, Grand Canyon didn't do it, Ray didn't do it (but it came close), Man on Fire didn't do it. None of the Indie even came close. Maybe it was the first time that I felt the characters. Maybe for some of you other posters this was the first time you had to try to identify with a complex 3 dimensional that didn't look like you or seem to live your life. Me? It stuck to me long after I left the theater. In fact, I took my wife back to see it on Mother's day. I called my Mother and Father on the way to the theater and they were out...at the movie theater watching the movie. They loved it by the way...And they are almost 70.And oh yeah! Please don't try to tear me down as uninformed (though I am sure you will, judging from some of the other posts)...I have two Master of Science Degrees (Computer Science and Information Security) as does my father (Computer Science and MBA).

Intense and Good,"Synopsis: A Brentwood housewife and her DA husband. A Persian store owner. Two cops who are also lovers. An African-American television director and his wife. Two carjackers. A Mexican locksmith. A rookie cop. A middle aged Korean couple. They all live in Los Angeles. And during the next 36 hours, they will all collide.This movie was a very emotional 2 hour ride. A look at the affects of racial tensions in our perfect land of opportunity, Crash is confrontational, though not radical. It teases us with what might happen and what could happen but then cushions the blow with light humor. Sadly, the issues raised in the film, specifically racial intolerance are perpetuated by the things we laugh at....and the laughter kept the film moving.It was very dramatic. Unpredictably dramatic. I think every actor in the film read the script and said, ""This is my Academy Award!"" They all brought the drama! Seasoned actress Sandra Bullock played completely against type which was refreshing. Rapper Chris Bridges (aka Ludicrous) did an excellent job for only his second film. And the UFC is not a fan of acting rappers. I love Don Cheadle and his portrayal of the jilted good son was exceptionally moving. Actually, the whole movie was moving. Now where it moves you, I can't say. Some may reflect quietly, others may move to the exit . If you don't prefer intense dramas...go see something else.We all look at people we don't know or don't understand and draw conclusions, some bad some good. This movie did a very good job of demonstrating how destructive that aspect of human nature can be. And yet, how inevitable it is. One of the things that I think makes a good movie is how much you think about it after and how much you talk about it. Crash will give thinking people plenty to discuss.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Every scene in the movie made me think, that does happen, we do think like that and the saying ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" made all the sense in the world to me now it's wrong to judge others. I highly recommend this movie. I heard that the first actors selected for the movie, after reading the script did't want to do it.

The movie was thought provoking leaving viewers in complete aw as the twisted web of events rolled into one striking picture. I would recommend it for anyone, any age, and any nationality.

Chaos theory in the real world,"Crash is one of those films that you will have to watch more than once. Not because it is complicated in the way that the Usual Suspects or LA Confidential are but because you will miss the minutae.The film deals with racial prejudice in LA. I cannot believe, from a UK perspective, that it is quite as overt in real life as is portrayed in the film. It blows away the wide held view amongst the liberal-left that racism is only one way: white on black. In the film everyone is racist and abusive to anyone from a different race or skin colour.Racism is a basic human reaction. Its the dog hates the cat, cat hates the mouse of the human world. You are different from me. Maybe you are a threat to me. You have been given more advantages than I have because of your racial background. Result is I dislike/hate you.This is the basis of the film which moves quickly although in reality nothing much happens.

Thankfully he didn't.There are no nice guys in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crash,"Hated by many on the principle that it somehow stole the Academy Award for Best Picture from Brokeback Mountain, I consider it the best of the nominees that year.Further dismissed by some as an ""after school special"" as if a film with a social conscience that presents itself in a mainstream, mass-market fashion is a bad thing, Crash certainly doesn't win any points for originality but it's solidly entertaining throughout, it rarely sinks into melodrama, and is a frequently very powerful portrait of a society rotting from the disease of racism.It does tend to overplay the ""Everyone's at least a little bit racist"" card and could have benefited from a lot more subtlety - it's occasionally very heavy-handed and obvious in making its sometimes dubious points - but I don't see anything in the film resembling a stereotype and that's a rare thing for a film of this kind. The ill-judged early comic relief scenes with the two carjackers are unfortunate and don't sit well with the generally sombre tone, but at least they're entertaining in their own right.",,Anonymous,Crime
Beautiful movie,"Crash is one of the best films of 2005. In my view, it is not so much a racial film as it is a picture of a cosmopolitan city with all the problems associated with them including crime, corruption, alienation and racism. We see a number of different people - some blatantly racist, like Matt Dillon. Others are the victim of racism - like Terence Howard and Thandie Newton as his wife. Others, like the Iranian store-owner, just happen to be victims of their own limited communication skills.There are various ways this film can be read and a number of messages implied from the various sub-plots. At the end they all preach tolerance and humanity if we are to lead civilised lives as part of a diverse community.What makes this film superb is the calibre of acting. There are a number of known faces all giving solid performance. There is no single star. Its very much an ensemble piece with nicely fleshed out characterisations and plots which intertwine neatly in the end to show how everything is related.

"Fresh and captivating, but contrived and goes nowhere with its theme","I went into the movie with high expectations given its IMDb rating. However, the movie seemed to be satisfied skipping along the surface of its theme of racism without ever exploring it. It simply demonstrated a sequence of contrived events putting racist characters face to face with other racist characters. It did that masterfully, but there was no coherent message in it all. Some characters undergo VERY cheesy epiphanies, the rest though stay pretty much exactly the same. Sandra Bullock's role in the movie was so pathetically one-dimensional it's a wonder it wasn't cut.

Crash it does...,"There is a real tragedy about this film. No, I'm not talking about the issue of racism in America (or anywhere) which this film feebly tries to address, but rather how a good idea for a movie and an impressive cast were wasted on this overcooked turkey.This film veers into overkill within the first few lines (Don Cheadle's hideously contrived little monologue about LA) and just keeps going. Haggis has taken the most delicate and sensitive subject in the New American consciousness and slapped his audience across the face with it for two hours. If Haggis had engraved the word ""racism"" onto a five inch nail and hammered it into my skull, it would've been more subtle and less painful than sitting through this film. If it weren't bad enough that he puts his characters in some highly implausible situations (some of which are handled very well from a technical perspective, I must admit) throughout the film, it certainly nails the coffin of believable film-making shut that every single person in this movie is racist to the point where they don't seem to talk about anything else. Every character here seems to have the same dilemma – that their life is wrought with racism and prejudice – but the reasons behind this are never explored. All the characters here are ""connected"" in such a contrived way, one has to wonder if any thought went into it. Beyond this, we are given no reason to try and like or relate to anybody we're introduced to, and the dialogue is so relentlessly obvious and didactic that it almost sounds like it came out of a high school improvised-drama class. Take note, Mr Haggis, we are not as stupid as you seem to think we are.Because of this, every character soon becomes entirely two dimensional as their prejudice/anger/misery is spelled out for us in almost monosyllabic terms. Presumably the point, not that it could be missed, is that we are all a little racist. Haggis aims to show us this by having all of his characters talk more shamelessly about their views than even the most bigoted people I have ever known. What this film seems utterly devoid of is subtlety. It is subtlety which would have made the story much more realistic, powerful, significant and enjoyable to those of us with more than sub-human emotional intelligence and, by extension, much less insulting to that same fraction of the audience.The casting is superb and the acting is good (though far from being anybody's best work), but even a group of actors as fine as this couldn't have grounded such fantastically over-the-top characters. Mark Isham's horribly contrived Zimmeresque score does nothing to detract from the brazen theatrics of Haggis' direction either.In short, this is a grossly overrated, almost child-like fable of urban discontent that aims far higher than it ever reaches and is nowhere near as clever or important as it thinks it is. It would have been far more interesting and far more validating if there was any interest here in trying to understand the cause of racism, but that's not Haggis' agenda. Presumably, the point of this tripe was to highlight something that should need no highlighting to (white, middle class) people who are basically ignorant about it or consider it a myth perpetrated by overtly liberal media or minorities who have a chip of their shoulder.In other words, this is a movie made BY white people who have no realistic concept of what racism means from the other side (and why should they?) FOR white people who have no realistic concept of what racism means from the other side. If you are one of those people (and you probably don't know it if you are), you might enjoy this pretentious, self indulgent, steaming pile. If you have a modicum of common sense, a hint of social consciousness or the capacity to think for yourself in any way, you're better off looking for a copy of 'White Dog', 'Nothing But a Man', 'Shadows', 'Do The Right Thing' or any number of superior films that address the issue of racism with far more taste, intelligence and subtlety.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

Wonderful Movie,"I must say i thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish, with no real desire to see it. The big name cast was wonderful in their own self, the music was subtle and perfect. The movie reminded me quite a lot of Traffic (another great film)..all the characters where portrayed with precise acting. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.Every story was compelling through the film and i enjoyed all the acting done to keep my attention. Matt Dillon was excellent in his role as the bitter racist cop, but showed his compassion and heroism in true form. Sandra Bullock was also in a different form then we are all used to seeing as the angry housewife and realizing her inner self. Highly appreciated film!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best movie ever created on the subject of racism,"**************************** ""Crash"" is the first movie created to depict the many complex sides of racism, rather than just the side of being the victim. Unlike most movies that focus on one character in a particular situation, ""Crash"" comprises of a network of people who are all victims of racism, yet at the same time, a source of racism as well. More importantly, humanistic side of each character is shown. They are all human beings just struggling to get by and provide for the ones they love. This movie is done beautifully and a must see.

Possibly The Best Movie I've Ever Seen!,"I was just completely BLOWN AWAY by this filmin fact, it very well may be the best movie I have EVER seen! ""Crash"" written and directed by Canadian Paul Haggis (who certainly deserves an Oscar for his screenplay!) stars a brilliant ensemble cast of superb performances by Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Terrence Howard and Larenz Tate among others. I read somewhere that Oprah said if you only see one movie this year, make sure it's this one so I went tonight with a friend and we both agreed that it was absolutely and stunningly close to perfection. It's a movie about how the lives of a several different strangers intersect through a series of events over a couple of days in Los Angeles. It's about how we are all racists (or at the very least strongly judgmental of others) in some way or another and yet what makes us all the same is our humanity and how a split second can change your life forever. The tag line for it is ""live your life at the point of impact"" and I'm telling you when you watch this movie you'll feel like you've been severely impacted afterward. It drove me through every emotion imaginable and those emotions manifested themselves physically in my body while I was watching it. As we were leaving the theater, awestruck, I had tingles on the top of my head. I can't remember the last time, if ever, I've seen a movie that moved me in such a profound way. This movie will stay with me for days, I'm sure. It's a must have for any serious movie collector and if you haven't already seen it, I can't recommend a better movie at this time.",,Anonymous,Crime
A Tale on the Convulsion of the Preconception,"It is a well strong film, speaks only on preconception, a species of tale on the preconception in a metropolis. I say tale, because it is impossible to believe that all those situations would only happen only in one day, with those people. They are coincidences excessively, but that they become the well interesting film if facing as one tale. To the times he is well confused also, but it has excellent performances and it makes to think on some important subjects, without dividing the personages between heroes and outlaws. A film with as many tragic situations, could easily fail, with an excess of moral manipulation, or if it denied humanity to all its personages. But it is exactly in the lack of conceived judgments daily pay, and in the honest form with that it faces all the types of people, who ""Crash"" have its bigger triumph.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best..,"Let me begin by saying I was hesitant at first to see this flick. I am very glad that I did. This movie is one of the best I have ever seen, it had the ability to invoke strong feelings within me throughout. There were parts when I sat mouth agape with my hand over my mouth! This movie contained various themes including: what goes around comes around, bad things happen to good people (& vice versa), the good & evil within each human, and many more. I have no idea how this was all perfectly encompassed in one movie, but it was well done.The movie basically displays the fact that everyone is somehow, in someway connected. This is shown through the various, interwoven plot lines of the different characters.The cast and acting is excellent, with a ton of noticeable faces (I didn't know all of their names). The interwoven plots add extra suspense and a very clever twist. 10 out of 10 for me, I though it was inspiring! Warning though, this is not for the weak!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Fine Film That Explores Racism In Society. Filled With Implausible Coincidences.,"This is a thought-provoking film that makes the viewer consider his or her own prejudices and past behaviors. Naturally, this type of experience will be uncomfortable for some people. Many reviewers here on IMDB have stated that 'Crash' (2004) is heavy handed and manipulative, and, it is probably both of those things. However, it's only a movie - if you don't like it, turn it off. The point of the film was to make us consider society and our relation to other people. In this case, I am willing to accept the writer/director (Paul Haggis) leading us to to a specific emotional place within ourselves.I enjoyed the cinematography and Los Angeles location shooting, but they could have made a more visually appealing film. Los Angeles is a very visual city, but there were few real landscape shots of the actual city and streets. Haggis dropped the ball on that one.I'm not deducting points for anything on this film, but I do have one complaint - The actual premise is not revealed until the last 20 minutes of the film, and, it's implausible. There are probably many cities in the world where 20 strangers would find themselves all so interconnected to one another. But, not in Los Angeles. The extreme self-interest, income disparity, and well-segregated neighborhoods make these type of coincidences and connections impossible in that specific town.Overall, this is a good film that won best picture in a weak year of nominees. It's a film everyone should see once, but no one has ever called 'Crash' (2004) their favorite film.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"Brilliant in every, single way","Well, isn't this quite the movie. Uh-huhevery year, in my opinion, a movie is released that is made just perfectly. Made perfectlymeaning all of the acting, all of the writing, all of the directing, the music, the cinematography, the editing, the plot, story, all that, is just perfect. Last year that movie was ""Collateral"". The year before that it was ""In America"". This year, it is Paul Haggis' ""Crash"".The film tells the stories of ten or so different people whose lives intersect over a forty-eight hour period, between two car accidents in LA. There's Detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and his partner-girlfriend Ria (Jennifer Esposito) investigating the seemingly accidental shooting of a black cop, DA Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his neurotic wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), a TV director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton), two cops  one racist (Matt Dillon), one gallant (Ryan Phillippe); an Iranian convenience store owner (Shaun Toub); two college-aged black men (Ludicrous and Larenz Tate) and the innocent, victimized locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena).Some of them have connections with others when the movie begins, but by the end they'll all more or less be connected by the prejudices and judgments that they store in their hearts over years of ignored ignorance. As the most interesting character in the movie puts it: ""You think you know who you are? You have no idea""by the end of the film, all of the main characters are at least starting to learn who they are.How? Well, to give away even the smallest detail may spoil the experience, but let's just say that a lot of the characters meet through accidents, crashes if you will. A lot depends on coincidence, a lot on behavior, and a lot on prejudice. But everyone learns.Ensemble movies like this are done a lot, I guess, but it always feels fresh and new when they're done so well, like with 1999's ""Magnolia"". This movie is clearer and more bearable than ""Magnolia"", which was a masterpiece in itself. It just so perfectly captures human nature  none of the characters are completely innocent, and none are one hundred percent guilty, either. This is shown perfectly in the characters of the two cops, through developments that I will not give away, but I will say that they are both brilliantly emotional and suspenseful.And yes, the movie is suspenseful. It shouldn't be one of those ""boring dramas"" that action-and-stupid-comedy buffs seem to avoid. This is a movie that could draw anyone in, because everybody can find a piece of their soul somewhere in it.Its qualities stretch far beyond themethis is an ensemble piece, an ensemble of talent. Writer director Paul Haggis has been around since the early nineties I guess, but with this so soon after his Oscar-nominated script for ""Million Dollar Baby"", I'm seeing him as a new talent. And he's good. If he plays his cards right he'll be able to ride the Hollywood horse in the way Spielberg and Tarantino are doing it right now.And the acting  oh, the acting! It's superb, it's marvelous, every actor knows the soul of their character, and plays it excellently (even Ludicrous, who might just have an acting career ahead of him, unlike a lot of his rapper peers). Now everyone was good, make no mistake, but let me point out a few who were justextraordinary. Matt Dillon ranks in at number one, as the fierce, racist cop, who we hate from the start, but come to understand by the end. Sure, when he explains the roots of his prejudices, we roll our eyes, but imagine walking in his shoes? And he has a scene that will be remembered. And there's Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton as the black married couple, who each face prejudice on their own and together, and seeing them interact we thinkyes, this is a marriage. I knew Newton was great, but Howard is a bit of a surprise herea good surprise, he's more talented than I might've thought at first, and this is his performance. An Oscar, I say! Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Pena, Shaun Toub, Brendan Fraser, William Fitchner, Keith David, Tony Danza and Sandra Bullock all pop up in a few scenes or more, and they each leave a great impression. People like Tony Danza and Sandra Bullock seemed like a lost cause, but they do have talentthey've just been hiding it for a while. It's expertly displayed here.Basically, I can't think of a single reason for anyone of a mature age not to see this movie. It's greatone of the year's best.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Spoilers The movie crash takes place in Los Angeles; this drama was written and produced by Paul Higgins.,"The movie crash takes place in Los Angeles; this drama was written and produced by Paul Higgins. This movie is about racism, conflict and the ability to change. This movie was inspired by a real incident when Paul got his porch stolen. The characters in this film made many mistakes toward each other in which affected them in the end. The main characters of this film are Sandra Bullock as Jean, Matt Dillon as officer John Ryan, Ludicrous as Anthony, Brendan Frasier as Rick, and Thandie Newton as Christine. Each of these characters played a major role in this film.Jean, an upper class, middle aged white women, was having dinner with her husband Rick. When they were heading to their car, they got car jacked by two black men (Anthony and Peter) by gun. When she returned home a Mexican was changing their locks and she insisted on them being changed again in the morning because ""He was going to sell them to his homies"" . Rick told her that she was over reacting and insisted she go to bed. Come to find out later, he was a family man and had no relations with any sort of gangs. After the carjacking she really started showing her racist tendencies. When she slips and falls down the stairs no one would answer the phone, she then realized that her only true friend was a minority.Officer John Ryan works for the LAPD, he notices a car that looked like the one jacked previously. His partner informs him that the plates don't match but John notices two black people were driving and proceeds to pull them over. He makes them get out of the car and while searching the man's wife Christine he molests her. He gives the couple the option to apologize for their ""wrong doing"" or go for a ride in the police car. Christine's husband apologizes and Ryan sends them off with a warning.Christine is very upset with her husband for humiliating her and they get into a fight. She tries to make amends with him and he just under minds her. After leaving upset she gets into a horrid accident where she was stuck in her seat belt and the car is leaking gas. The only officer on scene is John Ryan, Christine then makes the decision to let Chris touch her and cut off the seat belt in which he saves her live.The way this film was shot kept everything flowing very well. It starts with each character as an individual and ends with how every individual affected one another by their actions. I have only really ever seen two racist movies, Crash and American History X. These films are related in many ways. I think these types of movies show how people can actually change their perspective on life but it usually involves life threatening acts. But it is always good to know that people can change for the better. I enjoyed watching these movies because of the emotional affect that it brings.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Like Getting Beat Over the Head?,"Gees..here we go again.. I am sick of these 'review proof' movies that touch on every brutal stereotype and dark unwarranted corner of human nature... so much so that to tell the truth about it the reviewer may seem insensitive or unfeeling. Moronic plot development, terrible script, unreal situations, no suspension of disbelief, and a dramatic overplay of cruelty. No redeeming value except for some great acting by Farhad and the locksmith guy...I felt like flicking out Ludicrous' eyes out and see if he could still fly around, he was so annoying. Cinematography was excellent. Way overly preachy, yet it tried to hide behind a good-and-oh-so-confusing-evil twin makeup in each half baked character.

Crash Touches,"Few movies are thought provoking. Paul Haggis's ""Crash"" is conscience provoking. In the opening scene of ""Crash"" Don Cheadle as Detective Graham says, ""In L.A. nobody touches you."" Director Paul Haggis and co-writer Robert Moresco touch and inspire in their stark and uncompromising story of bigotry, racism, and prejudice. Haggis and Moresco illustrate through the chaos of colliding characters the prejudice that exists in all of us. Prejudice is not really good or bad, rather it just doesn't work. Haggis and Moresco also celebrate the possibility of the best in peoplethe part that is noble, courageous, selfless, and forgiving. In his directorial debut, Paul Haggis is bold and brilliant. The cast which includes Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Terrance Howard, Brendan Fraser, Thandie Newton, and Ryan Phillipe is impeccable.With its intertwining narrative threads ""Crash"" is truly the director's medium. Haggis is uncompromising in his portrait of prejudice in both broad and subtle strokes. The effect is powerful. Two young black men, Anthony (Ludacis) and Peter (Larenz Tate), carjack the Navigator owned by district attorney Rick (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock). Following a lead on the stolen Navigator, police officers Ryan (Matt Dillon) and Hanson (Ryan Phillipe) stop Navigator driver Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his beautiful wife Christine (Thandie Newton) for really no good reason. Ryan crosses the line and literally violates Christine in front of an impotent Cameron. Persian store owner Farhad (Shaun Toub) and his daughter Shereen are labeled Arab by a gun store owner when they purchase a handgun to protect Farhad's store. Hispanic locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena) is dismissed by an angry Farhad, when Daniel recommends that he repair the store door, because the replaced locks only are insufficient. Graham (Cheadle) and his partner and lover Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are investigating a the shooting of an undercover cop. Graham is also taking care of his ailing mother, and has a brother who is career liability.The surprise and power of ""Crash"" is in the story unfolding. This is intended not to give anything way. Haggis eloquently and poignantly reveals that all is not what it seemspointing to our own prejudgment. The beauty of ""Crash"" is that we the audience gets to walk in ""another's shoes"". Sandra Bullock is amazing and compelling as the seemingly unsympathetic rich bigoted wife Jean. Her Jean has a realization: ""I am angry all the time and I don't know why."" The catharsis for her is that she is the reason she is so alone. Matt Dillon is electrifying as Officer Ryan, who is both an enforcer of stereotypes and a man capable of great courage and compassion. Don Cheadle is a commanding presence. His Graham is caught in a racially black and white world, where decisions are gray. Cheadle has this quiet strength of will and profound humanity as he makes things work with Ria (Esposito), his mother, and his life. No one gets out unscathed. No one is the villain. Everyone is humanthe great paradox. Shakespeare said of Man, ""the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?"" ""Crash"" depicts our individual prejudices, and also our innate nobility and capacity for compassion. Through ""Crash"" Haggis seems to say that it comes down to choice. ""Crash"" is an absolutely powerful movie that lives with you well beyond the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Those expecting lots of action won't get much from Crash, but the movie still has it's fair share of chase scenes/ carjacking/ shooting.

very well done,"This was one of the most powerful movies I have seen in a long time. It basically explores the prejudices just about everyone has and has a message-no one is immune. It starts off with a car accident involving two people of different ethnic backgrounds, then shifts to two black guys complaining to each other that they did not get sufficient service in a restaurant due to their skin color and then carjack Sandra Bullock's car, and then proceeds from there, never letting up and pickup up steam as it examines each character's various fears and prejudices. One such example of where no one is immune is when Ryan Philippe's character complains to his superior that his partner (Matt Dillon) is a racist, and then later finds himself in a racial situation which he handles the wrong way. Dillon's character also contradicts himself when he pulls over a black couple for no reason and feels up the wife during the interrogation. Later, he has to rescue her from a burning car. A Persian man who owns a shop also goes after a Hispanic locksmith who tries to fix his door after his store is vandalized and tries to blame him for it, leading to near-tragic circumstances.No character is underdeveloped in this brilliant movie. I found myself thinking about my own life and reevaluating my values after watching it. I think it deserved the Oscar for best picture.*** 1/2 out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Beauty collision,"I just had a delectable visual and mental treat from Paul Haggis. Crash, which opened in theaters on Thursaday, is a well-crafted story. From the opening scene of a car collision, the film unfolds to weave several stories to form an intricate web of inter-related events involving the beautifully drawn characters. The basis of the story might have been racial discrimination and stereotyping but beneath this surface, it's really an emotionally-charged collision of unearthed feelings, contradictive thoughts and the emotional freedom that people sometimes deny themselves by refusing to confront reality. There's a couple of heart wrenching scenes in the film too.Although most of the actors have minimal screen time due to the various stories, the acting is consummate. Don Cheadle is shaping to be a great character actor as his display of emotions is so intense that you feel him. Ludicrous, the rapper (whose music I couldn't care less), also shows promise in his big screen debut.For me, I identify most with Sandra Bullock's character, a heavily repressed and unhappy socialite who was robbed at gunpoint with her husband (Brendan Fraser). When her character said, ""I am upset but it's not because of the carjack. I wake up feeling like this every morning. I am angry but I don't know why."" And when she falls off the stairs shortly after, only to arrive at the realization of the people and things that matter most.I am deeply surprised by how well the little stories intertwine so flawlessly to present a thought-provoking film. Certainly one of my three favorite movies of 2005 following Closer and Sommersturm (Summer Storm). I urge everyone to see Paul Haggis' Crash and experience 2 hours of feeling again.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"All of these terrific parts do not, however, add up to a great movie.","Haggis was nominated for an Oscar this year for writing Million Dollar Baby, but he considers EZ Streets - one of the best, if short-lived, TV crime shows ever - his greatest achievement.
So, if you're Haggis, you've written your share of gun scenes, and you're wealthy. One night, as you're leaving your local video store with your wife, two thieves steal your Porsche at gunpoint.
This happened in the 1990s, and Haggis still hasn't gotten over it. It could've hardened his heart. Instead, he wondered about the lives of those young men and about larger issues of crime, intolerance, social isolation, racial stereotyping, intertwined fates and the frustrated anger that simmers beneath the surface in every large city. Then he sat down to write.
Crash, the film that resulted, isn't the indulgent piece of therapy you might expect. It's an ambitious and often wonderful movie, an expansive look at urban life - the fractious, noisy whole of it - filled with witty, biting and insightful writing. Not only that, but it's also well-acted, with an all-star cast, and Haggis directs with fluidity and flare.

Crash...your head into a wall after seeing this. You'll feel better.,"Wow...what a load of...My husband, to my shame, purchased the DVD based on the hype and all the Oscar hoopla. I read a few reviews before hand, and was wary. Still, I really wanted to like this movie. As I watched it, it became really hard to do.I tried on a cinematic, technical level, looking for great camera work, settings, lighting...nope, nothing impressed me. I tried to like it for its proposed ""edgy"" dialog, and its ""daring"", ""noble"", ""eye-opening"" coverage of racism. None of that came across in the movie. It was written almost from the perspective of someone who hasn't experienced tense situations, let alone racism.Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, and Terrance Howard did the best they could with their roles. However, ANYONE could have played any of the characters, and it would have been the same movie.The music was forgettable. The story is mostly an urban folk tale, but there is no urban-styled music. The music is too clean.Overall, the movie was mostly a ""C"" movie, not at all worthy of the awards it received. There is maybe only one truly intense scene...but it is really a cliché in disguise. Just like the rest of the film.If you have to, absolutely have to watch this, rent it. Or wait for Crash: The Musical.As an aside: The jacket of the DVD has a picture of Jennifer Esposito on the back...SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY. Her character was non-existent, accept for seeing her under Don Cheadle for two seconds.

"Breathtaking, horrifying, and yet probably the best film of the year!","In Hollywood, they should just look outside their walls and gates for a good story. They don't have to travel very far. The story of Crash is complicated to describe but it is an ensemble piece with an excellent cast like Matt Dillon who plays the racist cop with sick father at home fighting with an African American HMO representative for coverage. He takes his anger out on a successful African American couple. Thandie Newton is unrecognizable and believable as the light skinned wife of a successful television director who gets felt up by Dillon's character and humiliated but in the end, there is something called redemption that these characters seek and need to prove that they are not the cruel, heartless, caricatures of society. Matt Dillon's character is a veteran Los Angeles Police Detective but a racist filled with anger and hatred. I hope he is not overlooked for his performance in this film. By the end of it, I wanted more and I saw this film on an airplane screen but I was glued to every word and scene. Brendan Fraser is miscast as the Los Angeles District Attorney. He is just too young. I love William Fichtner who has been around for years and finally getting noticed. Sandra Bullock is wonderfully complicated as Brendan's wife. They both survive a carjacking and are distrustful. The Persian man who loses his place of business because of a break-in and vandalism is also heartbreaking but you end up liking him and feeling sorry for him in the end but who suddenly has hope for the future despite losing everything to hatred. This film is a lot about hatred, prejudice, racism, sexism, and it is also about redemption of the characters. Don Cheadle is also wonderful in his role. I hope the Oscars don't forget about them one bit. It's the film that is worth watching again and again. You want more when it's over and you wonder why Hollywood doesn't make films about life in Los Angeles. Finally, the Oscars votes came in and Crash won. The controversy over the other film is ridiculous and the most absurd. This film was not meant to win an Oscar for best film. It was the little film that could. When Haggis directed it, he was not thinking about how many awards this would win for him but the message of optimism in a pessimistic society. I'm glad Crash won over the other film. Roger Ebert named this film of the year in his annual top ten. The other film came in 5. In my opinion, I think the Academy was right in selecting this film. Yes, this film has just as much controversy as the other film does. I won't name it because it's not worth mentioning.

Characters include a black detective looking for his brother, two car thieves always discussing racism in society, a racist cop with a sick father and his idealistic partner, a black director and his wife, a Persian immigrant shopkeeper and a Hispanic locksmith.Comment: Paul Haggis struck gold with Million Dollar Baby's adapted script and has done it again with Crash. What's better is that he's directed it himself. Crash doesn't actually narrate a story but takes a slice out of time in LA. The opening narrative about impersonal life in LA and the depiction of prejudices and preconceived notions of characters built on their own biased experiences form the foundation of the movie. The slow pace of enhances the intensity of the movie and helps audience get closer to the characters.Crash has many good moments and good dialogues. Notable ones include the Locksmith's little girl and the cloak, the second brush between Officer Ryan, a racist cop played by Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton. Lots of Good and Bad sides of people are depicted. What sets Crash apart is that it gives insights into how and why of the Good and Bad which is not a common occurrence in movies. Despite all the intensity, you wouldn't want to hate any character in the movie. Crash is recommended for those who love intense movies. So, take some time out to catch up with a slice of time from LA.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Let me get a few things straight for you beginners out there,"Before you all knowing pillow biters jump on the ""Brokeback should have won"" bandwagon, let me spell a few things out...1. Crash is a metaphor. NO THERE WAS NOT A PHYSICAL CRASH IN THIS MOVIE. Sure there were collisions, conflicts of interests if you will. Take for instance Matt Dillon's character vying for the affection of Mary Jane Watson with his best friend. It didn't work out-WHATEVER.2. Yes, there was drug use. LOTS OF DRUG USE. But you know what...grow up. There was a message here. THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES CRASHED TOGETHER BECAUSE OF HOW F*CKED THEY GOT.3. Racism is real, folks whether you like it or not. And obviously Matt Dillon likes it a lot. Whether or not this is a reflection of his quality of character in real life can't be determined with the evidence provided. If I had to guess I would say maybe.4. There is a second meaning to Crash. Dillon's character CRASHED out of rhythm when he realized the affect his behavior had on others. GET OVER IT FOLKS, THIS KIND OF STUFF HAPPENS...PEOPLE CHANGE.If that summary isn't sufficient, I don't know what is. Tasteful, provocative, gritty...Crash came at the audience in more ways than it could handle and certainly changed my perspective.",,Anonymous,Crime
Oscar makes expectations higher,"The film is about ordinary people and important people's daily lives and strange coincidences between them, it's pure life actually and there's almost nothing which is not natural, (sorry, except the extreme behaviors of the iranian daddy), i watched the film in one gulp and did not get annoyed except the last 15 minutes which is too slow and predictable (same feeling like ""no country for old men""), for me the music is so poor that it is one of the reasons for me why i did not give more than 7, its a good film, but music never supports the scenes and especially the final scenes are accompanied with a very simple random-radio song... and i think Oscar is a little bit too heavy, the film has not any action and almost all the scenes are in the same frequency, some poor music background and same kind of conversations, anyway, its a good film and worths watching once, probably you wouldn't want to watch it the second time as it does not have any hit scenes, or touchy quotes...or music.. watch it too see how ordinary life might be so complex around us...it'S pure life, but to see life on TV whereas you have the real one, is somewhat boring isn't it ?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Challenging, abrupt, brilliant","Last night we saw ""Crash,"" a film written/directed by Paul Haggis that stars Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and a bunch of other household names. It's an intricate story of seven primary character plots woven together through a series of destructive and life-altering events (think: Robert Altman), set against the din of LA nightlife and sprawl (think: ""Collateral""). Using the scene of a car accident from high above on an LA freeway, Haggis thrusts the film's crash metaphor on us from the get-go, and uses his subplots to make a powerful statement about 21st century racism.Maybe the best thing about Crash isn't its social commentary, but instead the experience of absorbing it. Most movies I've seen about modern bigotry have made their case through purely black and white (think: absolute) characters - halos earnestly hovering about the victims and horns stubbornly fixed atop the perpetrators. And yes, it's usually the white guy conveyed as the brute.Not the case in Haggis' LA. Each character in Crash exposes something dark about themselves and not one emerges the hero. There isn't really a true-to-form protagonist. Not Cheadle, the LAPD detective or his partner and girlfriend (Jennifer Esposito), not the defiled Thandie Newton or her husband (Terrance Dashon Howard, who delivered a spectacular performance as dressed up, conked, adherent sitcom director), not the feeble Bullock or the hypocritical Ludicrous, and certainly not Dillon. In fact, all are the bad guys along the way. And also the good guys.And thus the experience of Crash: there are no free rides. Haggis pushes you around the whole time with the ebb and flow of goodness and badness emanating from each character. He destroys any chance of taking sides, and challenges the notion of ""sides"" to begin with. In doing so, he transmogrifies the shell of political correctness that usually governs films on the topic.It's a masterpiece. Thicken your skin and go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
There Is Nothing New Here,"Some of the acting is pretty good, but the intent of the film seems a bit loose. If the intent is to show we all have prejudice, it succeeds on some level. If the intent is to show we all are capable of good and bad, it doesn't quite make it. If the intent is to show that all races in megacultural societies try, it's not realistic. What it doesn't show is that people operate most comfortably in their own culture with like people. This is not necessarily racially motivated--more, financially/socially. This is a truth. The dialogue is a bit stereotypic;it is someone else's version of how we speak. Again, mostly it is socially/economically oriented. The wealthy people are afraid of being robbed; the poor people feel abused and used. As long as America and like countries follow fascistic and republican tracks, this will never change. It is basically a have/have not society where people rarely cross over social barriers except through notoriety or fame. The rest of us are slotted by birth, family, education, etc. The lie is that America works. It is just another version of pre-revolutionary France. In order to be president of anything, you must have the backing and it is financial. You must cooperate with industry. Industry and banks run the nation. Politicians, Hollywood, and Madison Ave. are advertising puppets. It is about conformity.The rest of us have to deal with the anger and disappointment in the streets. The rich take cabs and have doormen. You are not immune unless you have a house in Dubai. What else have we got but who we are and what else to do than blame each other for our problems? I have to live with crazies, hoods and sickos in a city trying to lure wealthy Euros while it lets its infrastructure fall apart. I take the subway with messed up teens and street people who want to push anyone around because it makes their impotence less real. How do you fix that? I wait in long lines for everything and pay more than suburbanites for it. How do you fix that? I tolerate as best I can foreigners who ignorantly think they can impose their culture on ours because those who come here have money. This, after all, is the America they've been told has to tolerate everything and protect everyone! This is impossible. America is impossible.

Intense movie,"This has to be Sandra Bullock's finest movie. This movie marks her transition from a comic actress playing fluffy roles, to a serious actress whose performance must command respect. And this is why this movie is so great - the surprising performances. Tony Danza and Matt Dillon are wonderful in their portrayals of characters that are complex and not mere two-dimensional facsimiles of human beings. The Matt Dillon character is especially indicative of the intensity of this movie. Dillon plays an angry, bitter police officer who, despite his racist behavior and remarks, performs heroically and in the process redeems himself. For this movie is about people relating to other people on the basis of stereotypical beliefs that ultimately have no basis in fact. But the highpoint of the movie is Sandra Bullock's surprisingly compelling performance. Her character is so terrified and angry, and feeling so isolated and vulnerable, that she sinks to a depth of despair that is seemingly irreversible, yet she too survives, thus conveying a sense of hope and making this movie a powerful work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Amazing, Breathtaking, Bravo","This movie was powerfully insightful as well as a remarkable piece of cinematography. I know that everyone has prejudices that they do or do not acknowledge, but this film elucidated many of my own that I hadn't realized. I cried, my brother (who is a marine) cried, my husband and daughter cried. We laughed, we screamed, we held our breath in suspense. I viewed people differently after watching this film and I will never be the same because of it. I enjoyed its balanced portrayal of different races. How we are not good or bad, we just simply ""are"". I also marveled at how the vignette approach so intricately documented the impact that each of us have on other people we may have never met. I cannot spoil this film for others, because to do as such would be to rob others of a powerfully emotional experience. There should be many movies like this.

"Good acting, plausible assumption, implausible situations","Like some others, I did not see this film until it won the best picture award. Having been a Brokeback Mountain partisan myself I wanted to see what all the controversy was about. I rented Crash from the video store,watched it and didn't particularly like it. Then it came to my local theater (post Oscar hype I suppose) and I went to see it again. It certainly gains on a big screen, and I was better able to follow the interweaving story lines. It came up in my estimation.I thought the acting was uniformly very good, Matt Dillon in particular whose performance was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. Trouble was all the actors were working with characters that, while real, were overdrawn almost to the point of caricature and stereotype--the saintly locksmith, the spinning pol, the ""oreo"" TV producer, and the mother whose ""baby"" is a major felon to name a few.The film's theme is racism and the unfortunate truth that it is in us all. So far so good. Most people I think are also aware that good and bad exists in all of us. But this film delivered the message with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It may have been the filmmaker's goal but was not particularly to my taste.I also found the plot situations somewhat implausible and contrived, particularly the subplot concerning officers Ryan and Hansen. Ryan molests a woman in one scene and rescues her in the next? Hansen witnesses the molestation, later saves the woman's husband from being shot, and subsequently kills another character by mistake? The final scene between the Iranian shopkeeper and the locksmith smacked too much of deus ex machina. And I also left the theater wondering how Officer Hansen was ever going to explain the torching of his car.Despite all I've said here, I think that if you mute the preaching, suspend belief about some implausible situations, and enjoy the acting that this film is a good one though not a great one. As for its best picture nod, I disagree--I'm still a Brokeback Mountain partisan.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Nutshell Review: Crash,"Crash explores racial bigotry and racial stereotypes, and is the equivalent of what Traffic did on the exploration of drugs. Given the strong ensemble cast and character actors like Don Cheadle, Brendan Fraser, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe and Sandra Bullock et al, this movie contains many subplots skillfully juxtaposed into one narrative by director/writer Paul Haggis.We start off with an apparent random murder in a deserted part of Los Angeles, and from the start, racial disharmony rears its ugly head, and does so throughout. Whether be it White-Black, Black-Asian, White-Asian, White-Hispanic, Black-Hispanic, Hispanic-Arab, its off the cuff comments made by characters are starkly honest and probably expresses deeply rooted, prejudiced human emotions, and our preconceived notions of others, like if you're tattooed, you belong to a gang, if you're white and rich, you'll get mobbed by the black folks.We're brought back 24 hours prior to the discovery of the body, and this is where the tight narrative takes control in managing different subplots, yet keeping the audience thoroughly engaged with each. You have a white couple experiencing a carjack, 2 black boys in the hood (one of them played by Ludicrous) and their adventures, 2 LAPD detectives who have more than a working relationship, the story of 2 beat officers on opposite sides of a situation, a couple and their misadventure with the beat officers, a locksmith and his daughter amidst a gritty, harsh environment, and an Arab family. Relationships between characters are also key, as they provide a probable insight into the motivations of each character.Told in 2 acts, the first sets up the premise and explores a little of the current situation each character encounters, and touches a bit on their backstory. In the second act, this is where the amalgam and intersection of their lives come into play. And this really brings to light what six degrees of separation really mean.I'll stick my neck out and state that the narrative has NO flaws! Awesome! The twists come so fast, you're still in awe when you're exposed to the next revelation, and the next, until we come full circle. None of the characters are who they really are, as the narrative goes on, you start to wonder, if Mr Good Guy is really that Good, and if Mr Bad Guy is really that Bad. All characters have closet skeletons, even the minor ones, be it whether exposing their true characters through conversations, or actions, or leaving it to the audience to judge for themselves.It's amazing how the depth of each character, and for so many of them, are touched upon in the same movie. At some point, you hate someone for their prejudiced views or actions, and yet at another point, you pity the same person based upon the situation they're in. Or you might think that perhaps someone has demonstrated moderate thinking, but you'll be surprised still at the same person's subconscious harbouring of stereotypes. Most characters are shady, and this shadiness of character is present, be it if your social status or skin colour. All the actors did a commendable job in fleshing the multi-faceted roles they each play.The soundtrack contains an excellent selection of songs, but my favourite has to be ""Maybe Tomorrow"" by Stereophonics, played during the ending. Arnold Schwarzeneggar also had an appearance, on a photograph as the Governor of California, which I felt was a nice contemporary touch.This is highly recommended, please do not miss this, as it goes into my records as a possible contender for Movie of the Year, with its excellent foray into exploring human emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A movie which sets out to explore the interconnectedness of human relationships.,"This is a compelling movie where the cast of characters maneuver like dodgem cars as the story lines bring them into direct impact with one another. Set in Los Angeles, the multi-ethnicity of the characters and the associated stereotypes challenge viewers to grapple with provocative comments about how power is exercised and negotiated in a social environment where there is no black and white, only shades of gray. Heroes turn into villains and vice versa as viewers are challenged to take sides, then eat humble pie. Don Cheadle and Matt Dillion deliver thoughtful performances, while Sandra Bullock appears a little out of her comfort zone playing a character who is hostile towards a world that leaves her afraid to walk down the street at night. Perhaps the movie can be criticised for biting off more than it can chew. There is overt dialogue which pontificates about certain aspects of ethnicity and social justice. This leaves the audience with a feeling of 'so what'. Despite this, the movie is well worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Coincidences make the edgy film consistent and dramatic and enable Crash to cover the serious subject ""Racism"" from many facets and levels. It rates A.","The film ""Crash"" is more like an apocalypse. It might be subtitled as racists' redemption, more actually, human's redemption. Hapless and underestimated as the blacks might are, prejudice and racism exists in every culture, without mentioning in the USA, the melting pot of different cultures. In such a white-dominated society, any other races are vulnerable. According to the law of the jungle, these minorities must work twice harder than their white counterparts to get recognized.Mistrust comes from misunderstanding, rooted prejudice from thinking in stereotype. Should we lay the blame on the whites for our embarrassing situation? A passage from John William, author of "" Enough"" throws a silver lining. ""Who will tell you that if you want to get a job you have to stay in school and spend more money on education than on disposable consumer goods? who are willing to stand tall and say that any black man who wants to be a success has to speak proper English? Isn't that obvious? It would be a bonus if anyone dared to say to teenagers hungering for authentic black identity that dressing like a convict, whose pants are hanging off his ass because the jail prison guards took away his belt, is not the way to rise up and be a success."" Anthony is very self-conscious about his role as a black thief. He complains that the blacks aren't well treated in cafes and even black waitresses are snobs. He harangues that the whites are oppressors and swears to rob the whites only. He takes a white woman's suspicious glances and wariness as the racism and an insult to him. His anger is obvious. Subconsciously, he tries to change, but goes to the other extreme by robbing, a way he thinks that can demonstrate the African-Americans are not the weak, only to end up in being devalued and embarrassing his own race. It's quite out of date to think oneself a victim and defend negative and dysfunctional behavior.The race relationships are more labyrinthine than the L.A. streets. There are Koreans, Hispanics apart from Afro-Americans and the locals. They crash into each other. Those collisions are logical steps to an understanding of each other.People in this film are multi dimensional. The L.A. cop Ryan is a good son. After being rejected by a supervisor of African origin to find a better doctor for his father, he takes it out on a black couple. He pulls over their SUV, humiliates the husband, Cameron, and sexually abuses the wife, Christine. He is a bigoted racist. When it comes to the car accident scene where the director decides to go soft before it gets too downbeat, he takes his life and saves Christine, trapped in an upside-down car. He is a nameless hero.Coincidences make the edgy film consistent and dramatic and enable Crash to cover the serious subject ""Racism"" from many facets and levels. It rates A.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Crashed in the Right Spot,"Racism, that's always been a problem in America. Its no more a secret, every body knows it and Crash makes sure it brings out the exact feel and the mood of the situation. It does not over play it neither it is under played. The screenplay is perfect it has a brilliance in it to stand out and even though i have not seen the rest of the film that's was in contention for the Oscar i feel this deserve one and go with the jury. It has a big star-cast in it starting from Sandra Bullock to Arnold(in a photo), everybody is apt in their role the casting is perfect.Matt Dillon who was nominated for Supporting Actor, even though his performance is too good in the film i don't think he deserves a nomination. His role was so short in the movie that you don't even feel he is there in the movie, this is not for his character alone but every other character in the movie is treated the same way. Some scenes are very intense in the movie that even you are not part of the system you feel the pain and specially the scene when the Persian guy shoots the little girl.The film moves smoothly from the title to the credit, the shifting of one shot/scene to the other is really well handled. The editor might deserve it for his work but still i have not seen the others to conclude but his work is neat. The question if this film deserves an Oscar, well i think the jury might have gone with the issue that has been dealt in the film rather than the box office collection, which is a good thing and will be leading to the making of more meaning full film.

I'm not sure what I saw...,"I'm going to say this right out: I did not watch the full show, but I felt I saw enough (which was roughly half). And oh no, it was not the language that was a huge turn-off (which it didn't have that much of compared to many others). It was that there were too many random dealings going on. I didn't even reach the point I decided to stop watching where I had a bit of trouble remembering what happened in one of the first scenes. Furthermore, I could not see that there was any real plot going on, as there were not many connections between the characters. The other major problem I saw was with characterization. I don't know if the characters were supposed to seem true-to-life or what, but a majority of them do nothing for one but inspire irritation.To sum up, I did see some good in this movie (well, what I did see anyway), but too many things bring it down.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Haggis produces something that makes us aware; that tells us to open our eyes. Intriguing and often quite powerful.,"Until very recently, this film held a high spot on my own personal top 50 films; that is until I re-watched it and it fell a few dozen places. But let that not fool you, for Crash is still a well made and in depth look at life, race, racism in society and that element of fate that binds us all; wherever we live. When you deal with films that tackle race and racism, it's always good to make your first port of call information on the writer. From what we know, Paul Haggis is a white Canadian and yet he includes characters in his film who are of the Asian, African-American and Hispanic decent. I would not say he does all of them justice but one theme that lies within Crash is, in fact, stereotyping and how we perceive someone of another race on first glance.I think when I saw this at the cinema two years ago; I came out thinking I'd seen something that was brilliant. Two years of maturity towards other races and having met many more people, some of which are not of my own white, Caucasian; the film does not seem as spell-binding and amazing as I first thought although the scene in which one character's little girl 'saves' him form a bullet still pulled at the emotional strings; a little harder this time around for some reason  maybe because I watched it alone this time, who knows. But anyway, Crash remains a smart and somewhat deep film. The idea at its core is 'how do we see people around us of different descent?' A very early scene has Anthony (Ludacris) comment, out loud, on his distaste for Jean Cabot (Bullock) as she displays defensive body language upon seeing two black people walking down the road together. It is all about first impressions and how we perceive other people. The twist or the sting in the tail is, of course, that what follows is a carjacking of said persons.But Haggis does not make the error of making a point and then counteracting it. Later on, a Persian (not Arab, they want you to know) shopkeeper gets extremely hostile toward Daniel (Peña), a Mexican locksmith, but only does so through his own lack of ability to speak the language native to the country he is a citizen of (English in America). Similarly; when Jean and her husband Rick (Fraser) get home from the carjacking, Jean has similar antagonistic feelings toward Daniel because she has just suffered at the hand of rejecting her instincts for another ethnic group: she isn't going to make the same mistake and goes with her hunch by insulting Daniel who she believes will pass on their keys to his burglar 'amigos' after changing the locks. We find out a scene later than Daniel is a loving and caring father with a wife and kid; one of whom it would seem has suspended his own dreams in order to move out of a rough neighbourhood after a stray bullet crashed through his daughter's bedroom. This perception Jean has is wrong; she was correct in thinking Anthony and his buddy were hostile but grossly incorrect in Daniel - this is the theme; perception.Crash is set over the Christmas period; a time of year difficult for most people given the reunion with families (some of which people will not like) and everything is very busy and highly strung. This creates the perfect backdrop for Crash and its issues. Likewise, staying with the initial perception theme; police officer John Ryan (Dillon) is a racist and a bigot when he is faced with extreme situations or times of testosterone rush: the phone conversation with Shaniqua and the frisking of the other black woman are examples of this; I mention this because our usual perception of white cops may be that they are law abiding and upstanding  something Ryan's partner Tom Hansen (Phillippe) certainly embodies although the denouement in his life occurs when the obnoxious, hitchhiking African American he is giving a lift to later on acts suspiciously when he reaches into his pocket; what follows is nothing short of typical, for a number of reasons that would spoil the film if I went into them.I think an important scene in the film that embodies the films themes is the one in the TV studio; the director comes down from the gallery and states that a character didn't say the line 'black' enough. Such a situation highlights, once again, the difficultness we have of coming to terms with stereotypes and what's what. If the African American did not say the line like he did then maybe that's not how he speaks after all; likewise, who wrote the script within the script? A white man? A black man? We'll never know, and we'll never know if he imagined black people to talk like that. Needless to say, the director that comes down is white and he says it to a black floor director. Crash itself may have be written by a white Canadian but it does show at points; the Korean characters of Mr and Mrs. Ho aren't well written and there are some needless arguments spawned by race; a black character and someone Hispanic argue over what should have been said over a phone call and it seems all a bit silly but there you go. In the end, no one has really 'won'. Detective Waters has found his brother; John Ryan's father is still very sick; the Cambodians that are found are let loose into the streets of hate and racism without any aid at all and people still shunt one another in their cars. It may not be a pretty film but it's often powerful, often interesting and makes you think about those of different race around you.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Excellent look at racism, assumptions, and prejudice","Paul Haggis has done an amazing job writing and directing ""Crash,"" which gives the viewer a glimpse into the lives of several people and shows the effect of racism, making assumptions about people based on stereotyping, and how prejudice has invaded all of our lives.Haggis' film style reminded me a little of Robert Altman's films and a little of ""Magnolia."" Granted, the subject is racism, so the stories all involve it, giving one the impression that every single person in America is prejudiced 24/7. And maybe we are!Maybe it's so deep-seated sometimes that we're prejudiced without even realizing it and make decisions based on these prejudices every day. Haggis asks us to examine ourselves while we're examining this microcosm of people.There is some wonderful acting in ""Crash"" - that of Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, who is particularly powerful, Matt Dillon in a performance that should take his career in a new direction, Terrence Howard, Don Cheadle, Ludicrous, Brendan Fraser et al. - all first rate.The gun show salesman who calls a store owner ""Osama,""; the store owner who accuses a locksmith of trying to cheat him; a DA's wife who is convinced this same locksmith will copy her keys and come back later to rob her; the policeman with problems at home who acts horribly toward a black man and his wife and then becomes a hero; making fun of the way someone talks; being disrespectful of your Hispanic housekeeper who is probably your only friend - rage, rage, and more rage.When Haggis shows us the full human being in many of these cases, stripped of their race, profession, color, accent, wealth or poverty - all they are is people - angry, vulnerable, afraid, and hard-working.""Crash"" is a provocative film with many riveting sections - both scenes involving Newton and Dillon are astounding - and the encounter at the locksmith's home has one of the most frightening moments you'll ever experience.In the end, you're left with the realization that we're all the same, and by making assumptions about one another, we put up walls, we spoil what could be a decent situation.

Push the little daisies (and make them come up),"I thought I'd add some lyrics by the band Ween to the review as I've never been to America, let alone L.A.The film is all about mistakes. Mistakes that someone living in a British community reading newspapers and watching television news know will not burden their lives through laws which they are not governed by, most directly, gun control. Or dreams of living as large as America, and making errors of judgement from thinking on such grandiose scales which is where the racial tension inherent in this movie could well be derived from.What the movie does is show a big city interacting on a very small scale from the police department to television producers and petty criminals on the wrong side of the fence and pick their lives apart only to fake a reformation of the jigsaw puzzle at the end.In many ways the Stella cast reminds me of a group of conniving union delegates who know they have done wrong and commissioned somebody to write a movie that doesn't hide this fact, and quite the opposite, implores you to join them. Bums on seats? No, more go out and buy a Matt Dillon shaped dildo and sit on it the night before your first period starts.What the film can't hide from the back of my mind is the tragic occurrences witnessed recently in the US, not the ones that happen daily; things for which someone is to blame and no matter how hard I try, watching this movie brings to mind but one answer: blame America.

Written and directed by Paul Haggis - he, of ""Million Dollar Baby"" fame - this is film of the angst, desperation, hope, prejudice, and misery that comes with modern life. It is _very_ well written, _very_ well directed, _very_ well acted and it is also a harsh thing to watch. The situations depicted in the film make you squirm as they are so real and so familiar. No one in this film is an unblemished hero yet neither is anyone a beyond the pale villain. The plot twists and character turns keep you guessing and are right on the edge.The actors chosen were spot on and some were very surprising to see as their current star status would have otherwise dictated larger roles. Yet at the same time none of them seemed placed in those roles out of any cameo or ""walk-on"" effect.As a white guy who often gets up into LA and who recognizes a lot of the backgrounds shown in this film I can very much relate the type of angst which floats around up there. The various cultures; black, white, Latino, Asian, Arab, etc., do _not_ mix well but, due to the nature of modern urban life, always wind up mixing anyway. While Los Angeles does not come off too well in this film, it could easily be set in almost any modern American city and it is more of a testament about how we live than any damnation of the City of Angels.This film was very watchable and it does cut right through you. I recommend it highly.Madoc",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Even our prejudices comes a full circle.,"Even our prejudices comes a full circle. As Matt Dillon says in the movie ""You think you know who you are... You have no idea!"" Give it time, stay open and you can become what you hate or turn into what inspires you.... We are all so closed in our lives. Our reactions to everything outside so prejudiced, hardened and vitriolic, that to see that we are all the same - that we are all hurt and burned by the same thing, that we are all moved and healed by the same touch, that we are all indeed brothers and sisters - we really need a jolt/a deeper wound/an unkinder cut/a leap of faith or a turn for heroism !.. We need to crash into one another to become one again! The opening quotes, paraphrased, I think sums up the whole theme of the movie for me - ""It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you... Here, nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch SO MUCH, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something."" That being said, I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a great movie. It provides very thin and topical suggestions of the racism and prejudices in modern-day society. This is not a cerebral achievement or for that matter a deeply intellectual movie. Intermingled plots in tenuous circumstances make whatever changes of heart/guard/faith that the characters undergo seem at times circumstantial, rather than something that was deeply provoking and meaningful to their lives. But then again, I think this movie aims to be what it is  A warm message of oneness, a gentle warning against our prejudices- and perhaps nothing more. I don't know if it is really Oscar-worthy. But it's worth a while to watch it and there is definitely something you can take back home with you.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I watched the wrong Crash,Ugh I wanted to see the strange crash about people that get turned on by car wrecks. This was a good cast so I left it on. I wish it was a movie that concentrated on racism without the running commentary by the characters about race. Everyone in this movie was trying to justify there actions and racism.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Message: Racism is a complex issue...,"I can't say that upon viewing Crash I was of a completely open mind. I had read criticism, both positive and negative with it, and the movie had won the Oscar for Best Picture. I can say, though, that I was ready to expect it to either be very good, good, or not so good. It was not so good, but with elements that were both good and very good.Crash is the kind of idea that can go sour or work. It is a Magnolia-esquire series of interplaying vignettes, of which the primary focus and theme is racism. It can work, if the director chose to, while focusing on racism, allow a human story to be the main focus and transcending feature. Honestly, racism isn't that interesting on its own, as a constant focus.However, the movie makes the cardinal flaw of keeping to racism a constant focus with the human story in the background, at least in terms of the way it feels. The characters talk, and they show affection but with a few exceptions (which make up some of the most memorable quiet scenes), their words almost always are about racism in some direct or indirect way. Such as, most blatantly, the articulate gangbanger, who can't help but always philosophize on racial issues. This however was interesting, purely in a pop-conversation way, with the real problem being that the vast majority of the other characters, talk about race in a similar way (based on their context) only not in a Tarantino-like jaunt. The movie is filmed like a character drama of true human context, and so we don't want to see race being the purpose of every conversation, particularly those of more human characters like a Black TV Writer and Assistant DA, who just talk about a singular issue in virtually every single situation they are in.This is the greatest flaw of the film, but it is not the only significant one. The film is too short, and characters, especially interesting ones like the complex and bigoted cop or the caring father of a locksmith (the one major character who almost completely avoids the issue of race and thus has the best scenes), come off as either underdeveloped or under-seen because we love them so much. This is expounded because the movie relies on coda scenes to wrap up the stories, and a few them, simply do not work. The characters are too underdeveloped for these to have an impact. The final third of the movie also seems to comprised entirely of this, so it gets tiresome, when it feels like the movie just had an ""end movie on this note"" scene literally 10 times prior to the current scene that also feels like an ""end movie on this note"" scene.However, there is good in the movie. The film, although it can be tiresome and its structural flaws are apparent, never really becomes painful or devoid of entertainment. There are enough interesting elements and good scenes to make the movie a decent viewing experience, however not a particularly worthwhile, satisfying, or greatly entertaining one.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

will blow you away!!,"Crash is without a doubt one of the greatest movies this year.Director Paul Haggis was very brave to make this movie revealing an obvious problem in the u.s that people would rather leave alone.This movie deals with the collision of races in one incident that causes people to prejudge by the stereotypes that society has set for them .This movie is so true that it will scare you and makes you think what the world has come to that we have to prejudge people by their colour or culture before we know them and why people will probably never get along.But at the end of the day we all realise that all these things aside we are all people inside with thoughts, choices and the ability to judge right from wrong.Really go watch this movie if you love movies and don't believe people who say its overrated as most of them haven't seen it,don't give it a chance or they are very annoyed that Brokeback Mountain didn't win best picture although i think it was also a masterpiece it came down to the academy which awarded this the coveted award, brokeback mountain is superior but this is still amazing.10/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Crash proves us wrong.This movie, with an entirely different structure, is the other face of the sugary ""Pay it forward"". The same way as our good actions improve other people's lives, even beyond the first level of relation, ""Crash"" shows us how discrimination and prejudice surface and flourish in distress situations, and how they then start a snowball, or rather a random ""snooker ball"" effect, hitting, hurting and destroying people's lives on its course, and setting off new situations.It also shows how conceit leads and fosters isolation and self-deceit, and how love heals.This movie made me lay awake for hours thinking.

The movie others wished they were.,"This movie put together the lives of people and how they were linked without it seeming contrived a single bit. The acting was excellent. Their were good guys and bad guys, and you could see everything from their prospective. It didn't rely on gore as most Quentin Tarantino films. Even Sandra Bullock's acting was perfect for this film and perhaps it is because she was playing a character much closer to herself. I have found her performances in other films with those cute romantic films to be phony and forced. Her interviews come off as being very careful and guarded. The move grabs your attention from the start, even though the opening credits and credits music make you think this is going to be an odd film.",,Anonymous,Crime
Heart of Controversy,"I will admit, Crash is a very emotional movie. It depicts the lives of strangers and how we're all so connected yet distant from our neighbours. Racism is at the centre of this movie, and prejudice seems to cause countless problems in everyone's lives in one way or another. There's constant battles between doing good or bad and overall, this film is definitely entertaining both on a superficial and mental level.Although Crash was a very interesting movie, I felt the amount of drama was overdone and it almost seemed artificial at instances. Don't get me wrong; there certainly were moments of genuine panic and relief. But at specific moments, I could easily distinguish the storyline as fabricated when I really shouldn't have been able to, and this reduced its otherwise strong relatability.The acting in this film was excellent. Performances from actors like Michael Peña and Matt Dillon really pulled this film together and were by far some of my favourite scenes. The perfect settings and contrast between different lives really give this movie an edge and is the reason I, among many others, truly enjoyed this film from beginning to end.I definitely think the racial themes addressed in this film were very revealing--though arguably a little plastic--and helped relate this movie with modern times. I am glad I watched this film since it shows the stark disparities between two individuals, and it highlights the numerous parallels as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Have you ever seen a movie that can *actually* move you?,"I skipped out on Crash all throughout 2005. I saw a trailer or two, picked up a opinion from a few friends, and conveniently moved it to the back of my mind: before I had saw it, I already had decided that I would not like ""Crash"". Last week I caved in. After reading praise after praise (and, conversely, bashing after bashing), I decided that I must decide if ""Crash"" was for me. During the opening credits and the first couple scenes, I sat there, in front of my television, almost waiting to be impressed. I scoffed at the extremely unrealistic coincidences, laughed at the petty jokes and was almost disappointed in that my initial opinion, that I would not like ""Crash"", had come true. By the end of the movie, I was in utter shock. Have you ever seen a movie that can *actually* move you? When was the last time You cried during a movie? When had you ever found a film that stopped your life, and said, ""wait a second, they're right. They're right. We need to change""? ""Crash"" is a knockout, a thriller that will aim right for your heart. I was emotionally ripped apart by ""Crash"", it is a brilliant tapestry of film making and an outstanding example of Movies at their Finest. Forget people who haven't seen the movie and are already bashing it; forget those who call it ""corny"", ""fake"", and an ""atrocity"". Go see ""Crash"". Develop your own opinion of the movie.

Thoughtful and Exhilarating !,"Will Crash get people to change their attitudes towards others? Doubtful, but it certainly makes you realize that our attitudes are often based on circumstances and few of us are perfect...or all-bad for that matter.I'm reminded of a line by Andy Garcia's John Bubber in Hero. He said, ""We're all heroes, if you catch us at the right moment."" Too expand upon it, ""We all make tragic mistakes and judgments"" when you catch us at the wrong moment.In Crash, these moments are captured for a racially and economically diverse array of characters over a 48 hour period. We see people shine and we see them brought low. None of the characters are exempt from their darker side, save a locksmith and his little girl. What makes them special? Could it be a faith in God that keeps them both physically and spiritually safe? This is just one of the questions that Crash presents us with to ponder.The multi-scenario plot works well. Not since Pulp Fiction have I been so simultaneously upset at having the camera leave one story and overjoyed at having it return to another one with whose characters I have become so deeply involved with in a short period of time.Director Haggis' first time effort is skillful and captivating. The cast contains several top-name stars who are well complemented by a group of lesser known performers, all who dig deep to deliver multi-layered performances.Some have decried the amount of coincidences that bring the many characters together. Pay no attention. Crash is smart smart movie-making that is literary, funny, serious, and visually stunning. And that my friends is definitely not a coincidence.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"I'm not entirely buying into it, but...","Thirty minutes into 'Crash', I was slightly put off and irritated. And at the time Don Cheadle's character insulted his girlfriend/partner's culture, I was about ready to stop viewing. The film's premise seemed to me outdated, outlandish, and just a bit naïve.But I stayed. And I stayed primarily by accepting this film not as an indictment of America, nor as a primer on race relations in California, but as a movie about jerks  plain and simple. White, black, yellow, and brown jerks (well, maybe not brown - I can't remember any egregiously bad behaviour from that group)  all of them flawed, and all of them human. And by staying, I was able to actually say I found the film entertaining to watch, with several well thought out points to make. Moreover, I thought all the actors were realistic, and the story never dragged.While several of the vignettes are pretty coincidental (you might say contrived)  the Matt Dillon/Thandie Newton one in particular  by and large the randomness of the characters' relationships works well. Paul Haggis, the writer and director of the film, does an excellent job of keeping the dialogue realistic, and the scene setup logical. And the music not only complements each scene well, but is evocatively apropos as well.While I don't find its overall argument (which I think is 'you have no idea who you are, but you are racist') truthful, the movie did make you think. Also, unlike most movies today, this film is not forgotten two hrs after you leave the theater (or return the DVD in this case).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An Extraorindary Motion Picture Experience,"CRASH was a breathtaking and undeniably powerful motion picture that moved some, angered others, and has probably caused more impassioned debate than any film of the last 10 years. This Oscar winner for Best Picture is an unsettling, imaginative, and quietly accurate examination at the very touchy subject of race relations and how, in some very subtle ways, we really haven't made much progress in this area since the 1960's. This film rattled cages everywhere because it shined a light on behaviors in this country that we want to believe don't exist but have really just been quietly shoved in the closet and almost out of sight. This film angered a lot of people because it's unflattering to us and shows a side of us that we would rather believe doesn't exist but I defy anyone who sees this extraordinary film not to find one character or event that they can relate to, have seen something similar occur, or know someone in their own lives who is like a character in this film. Many have criticized this film for conveying the ugliness of prejudice and bigotry with a sledgehammer but I disagree. Paul Haggis' superb Oscar winning screenplay weaves a tapestry of story and character that never punches you in the face. Instead it haunts your conscious with its powerfully quiet indictment of our own inner demons that we had forgotten about. This film traces 24 hours in the lives of several disparate characters in downtown Los Angeles where the separate events these people experience shed a different light on this still highly sensitive issue. The cast is uniformly superb...Don Cheadle plays a police detective whose investigation into a dirty cop's death finds him in a position of compromising an investigation through reverse discrimination while dealing with a drug-addicted mother, a hoodlum younger brother and a latino partner/girlfriend (Eva Mendes). Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges does a star-making a turn as an intelligent LA thug who loves to blast white Los Angeles for the deplorable way they treat black people while carjacking a political candidate and his wife, played by Brendon Frasier and Sondra Bullock. Bullock is surprisingly effective in a very unsympathetic role. Terrence Howard is brilliant as black TV producer who is humiliated during a traffic stop involving a bigoted cop (Matt Dillon, Best Supporting Actor Nominee)going a little too far with his girlfriend (Thandie Newton)has him questioning his manhood and taking the law into his own hands when Bridges also tries to carjack him, not to mention a reconnection between Dillon and Newton that provides one of the film's most powerful moments. Mention should also be made of Ryan Phillippe as a sympathetic cop who finds out he's not as liberal as he thought and Larenz Tate as Bridges' running partner. And don't miss the ""Magic Cloak"" scene...one of the single most moving scenes in the history of cinema. It's not fun, it's not flattering, and it's not easy to watch, but CRASH is an important and beautifully crafted look at an armpit of our society which we would like to think no longer exists.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Flawed but strong handling of a relevant topic,"First things first: I think the Academy made a mistake naming Crash the best picture of 2005. Not that I didn't like the movie: it just so happens that it has a few defects that make it less Oscar-worthy than fellow nominee (and strongest contender until the ceremony actually took place) Brokeback Mountain. That said, the movie deals with a serious issue in a bold way, and therefore deserves to be seen.Written and directed by Paul Haggis, who also penned the beautiful Million Dollar Baby, Crash shares its title with David Croneneberg's 1996 shocker, but contains none of the latter's sex-and-death imagery or themes. Instead, Haggis' work covers 36 hours of L.A. life, with various, totally different people who ""crash"" into each other. They have nothing in common, except for the fact that in a way they're all racists. These people include a black cop (Don Cheadle), his ""Mexican"" mistress (Jennifer Esposito), a DA (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (a surprising, serious, angry turn from Sandra Bullock), a shopkeeper from Iran, a thief (Ludicrous) and his pal, and others. Their problems range from Esposito making fun of a Chinese woman's accent but at the same time shunning whoever mocks her descent to Fraser finding it difficult to honor an Arabic law enforcer named Saddam (okay, maybe he's got a point there), though no one is as troubled as officer Ryan (the justly Oscar-nommed Matt Dillon), a man so unpleasant even his partner (Ryan Phillippe) feels uncomfortable working with him. The worst part is, Ryan's aware of this problem, but doesn't seem to care that much about it (""You don't like me, that's fine. I'm a pr*ck.""). Still, he proves everyone can change when he saves a colored woman (Thandie Newton), whom he was molesting earlier on in front of her husband (Terrence Howard), from the film's central accident.Crash has excellent, gripping performances (Dillon, Bullock and Howard shine above all), and that's what really keeps the movie together, especially in the epilogue where the script's weaknesses begin to emerge: as talented as he is, Haggis' decision to end his directorial debut with a string of coincidences is a partial disappointment. The bigger problem, however, is Ludicrous' character: with his erudite thoughts and philosophical reflections, he is just too artificial for a movie that aims to depict a realistic day in American citizens' lives.Aside from these flaws, though, Crash is a good, thought-provoking picture. Maybe not Best Picture of 2005, but interesting anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Excellent, powerful, thought provoking, unique","This movie is unlike any other movie I've seen and probably that'll be true for most viewers.There are approximately 9 important couple relationships (husband-wife, child-parent, working partners, etc.) somewhat explored as they interact with each other as well as many others. Our appreciation of these couple relationships is deepened by seeing the variety of forms they can take. E.g., a child protecting a parent (or vice-versa) is presented in several iterations and the contrasts between them deepens the impact of each (probably implicitly, without even our awareness that the film is doing that). They come from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds -- black, oriental, Latino, white, Middle Eastern, etc.The lives of these various people collide in accidental but natural and seemingly inevitable ways. In each collision people make quick judgments about each other often based on racial or ethnic stereotypes, especially when people are fearful or hurt. It's part of the power of this film that as viewers we find ourselves doing the same thing, too. Another power is that it demonstrates people are far more complex than putting a person in the box of a stereotype allows.Although all the accidental encounters between these couples COULD seem contrived, everything flows realistically, naturally -- including all the dialog. The casting is great; the acting superb. The snippets presented of the lives of these 17 or so people are interwoven to form an overarching, coherent, powerful narrative.This is not a movie that will change many lives, especially among those who treasure holding their ethnic biases. It will appeal most to those who grieve that we all so easily form and hold such stereotypes.Rated ""R"" for some natural, adult emotional language and a sexual scene. AFTER you view the movie, your appreciation will be furthered by visiting the IMDb message board and reading the discussion on this film there.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wow....,"I read the script before the movie came out. I found it to be very tight, yet had clichés that bugged me, but there were a lot of touching moments. Then I saw the film.If this film is not a catalyst for thought provoking conversations, then we have really, truly, lost our humanity. This is truly adult entertainment, and I am very impressed with all the actors involved, especially Ludicrous. I really respected what he brought to the screen, so maybe people shouldn't be so hard on Hip Hop artists turning to acting. Terrence Howard was riveting, as was the actor who played Daniel Perez with such compassion. It was nice to see Thandie Newton acting in a relationship with a black character. I never see her paired up with black male actors in screen ""relationships"". Ryan Phillipe and Matt Dillon were great..like I said, all the actors brought their ""A"" game to the table. The only bad part of the film is Sandra Bullock's character. She has a ""Driving Miss Daisy"" moment with her character where she tells the Mexican housekeeper that she's her ""only Friend"" when all through the movie she talks to the woman and treats her like sh*t, and there is no reaction from the housekeeper, not even a reaction shot! That rang very false and is one of the weakest links in the script and movie.Paul Haggis and Don Cheadle (one of the producers of the film!) should be very proud of the work. I was. It gives me hope.

Redepmtion is possible,"There have been a lot of multi-plot line movies in recent years, such as Magnolia and Traffic, not to mention Life is a Dog. Normally I find these disappointing.Crash is something different, something beyond all these. It tells a number of linked stories essentially involving racism.Each little story is told so efficiently and profoundly that any one could have been worked into a full story.Some characters will be redeemed, others will miss the chance for redemption, and some will fall, but there is also hope because of mood of redemption in this movie. The cold and the snow is a metaphor for this. When it cold enough it can snow and that changes the mood of everything.The interlinking does seem over contrived, the attempts at humour are pathetic and some of this analysis of people and characterisation is a little off.

Not bad,"There are some movies which cause people just looking themselves again and again, then change their point of view to the life. Certainly, Crash is one of them. Even the beginning of the movie seems boring, it is not the final idea you had at the end. The point which cinematographer tries to transfuse to viewers is to understand communication problems and their unavoidable results. Watching the movie from this respect could be better. When it comes to details; personally I evaluate this movie considering its purpose and how it is useful for those who watching it. After people watch the film, which point the viewers will consider and want to change in their life I mean. If it is acceptable that this movie contributes people to solve some problems with their communication styles, that is my belief by the way, it is OK watching that and then to suggest others. Otherwise watching that film or the ones like that will be useless. To sum up, I suggest watching that movie for those who added it to their watch-list or just searched to see what kind of film is this, but to understand the aim of movie and then watching it will be better of course.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An amazing statement on racism in North America.,"Crash tells many different stories. It involves many different people. However, all of their lives are inadvertently linked together through one accident. All of the people involved also happen to be prejudiced toward another race in one way or another. This movie just made me feel really rotten about how racist some people can be. I felt particularly bad for the Spanish locksmith that Sandra Bullock's character thinks is a gang member, and then we see him arrive home and discover he is a struggling single father.What I liked even more about this movie was that it really makes you think. Besides the racism, it has another message, and that is you can look at any fender bender anywhere in the world, and the people involved all have their stories, and it all connects. There are so many subtle moments in the film that when you see them, you don't think anything of them, but when you see the ending, it all comes rushing back.The acting in the movie is really good. This is probably one of Sandra Bullock's best roles, and it is definitely Matt Dillon's best role. Paul Haggis is an awesome writer and director, and I can't wait to see what else he comes up with. This is truly a great movie that deserves whatever Oscar's it wins.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Dramatic, but confusing too.","There are some really good scenes, and some great lines. But I had trouble trying to follow who was who, and what was going on. It is hard to say what the movie is about. Maybe a line from a voice-over helps, something like ""People here don't talk to each, they crash into each other and then talk""? There are lots of crashes, mostly attitude-attitude as well as physical.There is a nose-tail car incident very early on which is repeated at the very end. It is perhaps supposed to sum up the whole idea? Then there is the good-cop/bad-cop display. The bad cop gropes a woman and then saves her life from a car flip. The good cop can't cope with the bad cop and tries to get transferred, but runs up against ingrained issues at the precinct and later makes a bad, bad mistake, the consequences of which are not explored.How many main actors are there?

A Celebration of Los Angeles,"I tried to ignore the voice in my head not to rent it. I had heard from multiple sources that ""Crash"" was the worst film to ever win Best Picture--worse than even ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" back in 1952. Yet it had won Best Picture, which must mean something. I fished out my rental card.Minutes into the start of the film, I knew what I was in for: a narcissistic celebration of the city where the film takes place--LA. No, not the LA of reality, where human beings transcend stereotypes and live in a three dimensional world of development and originality. Fact is, LA really has no ""reality."" Norman Mailer once wrote that the city, America's grandest suburb, appears to have been built by some self-perpetuating television studio.Like the city itself, ""Crash"" is a made-for-TV spectacle filled with character archetypes, gun-crazed hysterics, and clangy car wrecks. It is an accurate depiction of the psychic space many Angelinos are proud to call home--the stupefying, stifling world of television.Defenders argued that ""Crash"" has one 'fresh' element: it at least acknowledges the fact that we live in this stereotypical, flat world. Yet ""Crash"" does not rebel against this world--it perpetuates it. Instead of challenging its own moviescape, ""Crash"" keeps indulging us with more car bangs, more flat archetypes, more cheap, overt racism. Look out, Fox TV.In March 2006, on behalf of a society increasingly defined by such pulp, the celebrity class paid its dues: it awarded best picture to this shrill, depressing film. ""We are all racists"" they said, in an attempt to mask their glossy pulp with banal condescension. This film is a great step toward making their generality a reality.Some critics lamented that Crash's Oscar victory spelled the end of the Academy's ""relevance."" Hardly. The win heralds a new era at the Academy. The Oscars, once a serious, national ceremony celebrating the art of individual expression, has fully succumbed to the televised suburbs. The narcissistic celebrities of LA no doubt toasted their win with martinis. Meanwhile, a nation that used to be known for its individuality, intelligence, and love, continues to lose.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
THE Movie,"This movie is the smartest, wittiest, grittiest, most emotional movie I have ever seen bar none (and as a Film Studies student I've seen a s**tload of movies). The way Paul Haggis has portrayed the characters in this movie rooted deeply into my subconscious and dragged out some skeletons that I had been blind towards for a long, long time. As we go on living we are desensitised to matters such as prejudice and animosity and only through exaggerating and blowing things out of proportion on the scale that 'Crash' does can some of us truly realise the extent of our own generalisations. Sure the film had flaws but if you focus on the big picture, this is an absolute gem.The acting in this film is amazing and the contrast between the characters is fantastic (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges can act!?!). A roller-coaster ride of emotion, the characters really drive home the seriousness of their situations and pull you into their world of fear, anger, love and hatred (amongst other things) in such a way that you can almost feel guilty yourself.A contemporary look on society today, not only in Los Angeles but in the entire world, this film is a must-see for anyone and everyone.P.S. I should point out I have not seen Magnolia. I hear this film is very similar. I'd love to hear other people's viewpoints on this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crash - A Movement (Not Just a Movie),"Modern movies are often criticized for allegedly depriving their audiences of the ability to think abstractly and providing shallow entertainment in the form of colorful moving pictures. Fortunately, writer and director Paul Haggis, has come a long way in redeeming the reputation of modern cinema, and perhaps even humanity as a whole, in his most recently released film, Crash.To provide a most basic synopsis, Crash is a compilation of the stories of various individuals, whose lives, in one way or another, collide and become irreversibly intermingled. In all cases, the major distinguishing factor between these people is their race and ethnicity. From the very opening of the film, stereotypes and prejudices that are kept locked in our minds or else inserted into the kind of jokes that are only told in a dark whisper, are blatantly exposed.It is one thing to simply reject certain stereotypes, but it is an altogether different, braver and more honest thing to admit their existence. Unlike many other films and forms of artwork that focus on pointing out the fallacies in common stereotypes, Crash accepts that many stereotypes are not groundless. The two dangerous looking black men whom we meet in the beginning of the movie really do pull out guns and rob a car, and the rich white couple that is instantly pegged as being snobby and racist, really does live up to our cynical expectations. Although many of the film's stories also attempt to show how misleading a stereotype can be, its most powerful and moving moments were those that explained the mind set of the people who fit so neatly into our society's clichés. The movie attempts to answer questions such as ""How did we become this way?"" and most importantly ""What can we do to change?"" Thought-provoking, heart-twisting messages aside, Crash also succeeds in keeping the audience thoroughly entertained. It is the kind of film that is best watched with a large audience because the chorus of gasps and shrieks that accompany many a scene provide a very intense experience. Although the characters are not entirely fleshed-out, since we keep jumping from story to story, we eventually (if not instantly) empathize with all of them, and experience each violently powerful emotion. The only major flaw that Haggis's film is at times guilty of is having monologues that sound a bit too much like soliloquies and dialogue that sounds too much like the morals that come at the end of a fable. Though most of the dialogue had a very realistic tone, and each character was a distinct individual, there were some points in the movie in which the character's voices became muffled by the voice of the author. Haggis was able to perfectly show rather than tell the moral of his story, and yet he chose to tell it explicitly some more even after we knew exactly what he was saying. Nonetheless, this slight break from authenticity by no means destroyed the overall strength of Crash. Perhaps it was worth it to sacrifice a purely realistic tone for a hard-hitting film that left a lasting impression on its audience.It is interesting to note that the audience, just as the cast of the movie, was extremely diverse, but the reactions of the audience members were very similar. Each one of us was able to relate to the story on some level, and sitting side by side, realizing that we were all feeling very close to the same thing, was yet another deeply stirring aspect of the entire experience. For all of the reasons mentioned above, I recommend that you see this movie. For the reason mentioned here last, I urge you to go see Crash while it is still playing in theaters.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Contrived?,"The film certainly deserves a lot of credit for being poignant, direct, and yet very simple. This movie deserved Best Picture because above all else, it was the most thought-provoking, probably correct in philosophy, and necessary to be seen. However, this film was CERTAINLY contrived, and that was its biggest flaw. The events needed to be more tightly woven into the story itself. To say that the film was NOT contrived would be just naive. But yes, a 9 is deserving. If they airlifted this film in multiple languages over certain areas in strife (obviously with access to a DVD player etc.), it would definitely be great for humanity and alter people's beliefs of humans, their motivations, circumstances, etc. Yeah, that sounds ridiculous, but I believe in it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Truly magic. The best way film has been used as a medium for a long time.,"I have seen hundreds among hundreds of films, but never before has my heart beaten against my chest so hard, nor my hands shaken so nervously as when I was privileged enough to view this film. Never before has film been used so effectively to communicate to an audience, a point that is globally understood, but seldom discussed, and rarely debated due to taboo and political correctness.Crash addresses such an important part of human society in 21st century. Post 9/11, long since multiculturalism has been accepted into the mesh of our societies, it speaks a thousand languages with one clear message; humans are racially intolerant. It doesn't say 'they are intolerant by default' or 'humans have always been and will always be intolerant', but it attempts to ask why we have gotten this way. We are falling apart, but above all; there is hope. People have the ability to change, and to embrace cultures contrary to their own.A poetically filmed piece of cinema complemented by a magical soundtrack by Mark Isham, this film should be viewed by everyone and anyone. If you live and breathe in any kind of modern society, this film is relevant to you.All of the actors in this film perform a solid and well-executed performance. The only gripe I would have is that Brendan Fraser has been miscast in this film. Someone like Denis Quaid or Dylan McDermott would have fit the role much more convincingly in my opinion.Easily in my top 3.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Brilliant Script, Surprising Performances, Unforgettable Moments","I remember watching the TV commercials for ""Crash"" when the movie was still in theaters. The commercials emphasized Sandra Bullock, America's sweetheart, as a foul mouthed, mean spirited, rich, rigid, racist white woman, and Ludicrous as a witty, charismatic, black carjacker.""Oh, no,"" I thought, ""just what we need. More Hollywood Limousine Liberal one-dimensional pablum about how we should just all get along. Another 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'"" A funny thing happened, though. Many acquaintances, from a variety of backgrounds, approached me to urge me to see the film. They were moved by this movie in a way that I haven't seen people be moved by a movie in years.Then, when ""Crash"" won the Academy Award for best picture, I thought, okay, I need to see this, even if just as a cultural artifact.Boy, was I surprised. ""Crash"" was nothing like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" except in that it has a great cast.The script is sharp and fast and literate. Characters manage to say memorable things without sounding artificial (for the most part.) I miss Joe Mankiewicz. I miss great scripts. ""Crash"" is a treat for fans of language.The cast is just, plain, unbelievably fine. Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Tony Danza -- who would have guessed that these stars could have done the kind of intensely moving work that they do here? Matt Dillon gave a performance, and created a character, that I will simply never forget.Don Cheadle, Ludicrous, and Loretta Devine are also great, but not as surprising, because they don't play against type. The actors playing a Persian shop keeper and his daughter, a locksmith ... Each performance is stunning, perfect, moving.Terrence Howard ... what can I say? I'm running out of words. Terrence Howard was exquisitely moving.Ryan Phillipe. Keith David.Just, standing on my chair, applauding. This movie gave me a whole new appreciation of acting as a profession.""Crash"" consists of one stunning moment after another that wrenches both with its realness and its artistic merit. I've lived some of those moments: a father reassures his daughter with a tale of a protective cloak; a woman embraces someone whom she suddenly recognizes as a friend; a man says he doesn't want to apologize any more; a son tries to help his ill father.Most movies would be lucky to create one such scene.Some have argued that the movie is contrived. To those folks I'll report: movies *are* contrived. See, Matt Dillon is not actually a police officer ...I didn't find one moment of ""Crash"" to be unbelievable. We've all had moments of coincidence that defied chance. That's why the word ""synchronicity"" exists.Others objected that the movie is preachy. I've really got to wonder about the lives of the folks who found this movie preachy. I live in a very multicultural, multiracial world. Events like those in ""Crash"" happen in the world I inhabit. Unlikely allies do form. People do sell out. Deals are cut. Rescues are made, and lives are lost. How is depicting these realities on screen ""preachy""? I'm wary of overuse of words like ""preachy"" and ""manipulative"" in film reviews. They tend to be used by people who like movies shot through gauze in the South of France where the only thing that happens is that Charlotte Rampling gazes off soulfully into the distance.I think many, too, had a problem with what is on screen in ""Crash."" The white supremacist bad guy everyone is primed to hate is revealed to be a complex human being. Blacks are not depicted as blameless; some steal, are rude, and make racist comments. I think that that bit of reality will disturb some movie goers.Some argued that the movie ends too neatly. I didn't see any neat ending. In the end, there is life, and there is death, and mere chance separates the two. The final sounds in the movie are a new racial confrontation beginning.The film's sheer artistry, and its soundtrack, make all the horror it exposes bearable. This movie left me exhilarated. If we can produce movies like this, maybe we can learn to all just get along.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too many flaws,"This movie is a very interesting story about how people's lives intertwine with each other at some point, and how these collisions with each other affect one another's point of views or morals. There is a good amount of foreshadowing and symbolism throughout the film, but the editing is so far gone that there is so much left to want. There are no transitions between scenes with dialogue to cue a response from someone else, or fade-in/fade-outs to show dramatic reactions. There are even some scenes that feel like they were just thrown in so that they could seem like they wanted to ""make people think."" If you watch closely, the close-ups and overheads are very jagged and feel forced, and it makes the viewing experience that much less enjoyable.The storyline is top notch, but it felt like there were too many characters. If there were maybe 4 less characters, or combined the characters somehow, it would have been better. In the end, I didn't remember anyone's name at all. The creation of main characters is usually done skillfully so that their names are repeated over and over so that the viewers don't forget them. This story had very impactful scenes, but when discussing this with peers or others, it was very hard having a conversation saying ""the woman who was molested by the cop"" or ""the black receptionist lady."" The amount of symbolism and foreshadowing is commendable for this story. If this had been more skillfully displayed for everyone, I would have thought much higher of this movie.I gave it a 7 out of 10 because I enjoyed the story very much, even to the point where I did think about it for a few days after the movie, but the editing was far too rough and amateur to deserve higher.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An examination of fear and bigotry from multiple perspectives ensues.,"An angry housewife and her successful District Attorney husband. A Persian store owner. Two police detectives (a black male and a Puerto Rican female) with a complex relationship. A black television director and his wife. A Mexican locksmith with a young daughter. Two car-jackers. A rookie cop. A jaded cop who's seen so much on the force that he's lost his way. A middle-aged Korean couple...They're all part of the racial diversity that colors Los Angeles. They're all searching for answers, they're all moving forward, they're all coming together, they're all falling apart, and in the next 36 hours they will all collide.JOHNNY'S TAKE""You think you know who you are? You have no idea.""Those words, spoken by Matt Dillon to Ryan Phillippe, are probably the most poignant of the movie. Not only do some of the characters not know who they are, but the audience doesn't even know. Crash does an ingenious job of forcing the viewer to confront his own prejudices by presenting us with characters and causing us to develop our perception of them, but then as the layers are stripped away, we start to realize that perspective can change. We all have our prejudices whether we want to admit it or not, and one or two actions will immediately shape our opinion of these characters. But do those actions completely define the character?Suspected reprehensible characters are slowly revealed to have a little more depth to them than we initially expect. Matt Dillon is painted as a bigoted, sexist cop. His early actions are indeed reprehensible, but we soon realize there's more to him than our first impression. The years have torn away at him as he's had to take care of his ailing father without being able to get adequate medical care. There's a reason he's turned so bitter, and when his humanity is put to the test, in one of the most powerful scenes in the movie, will he realize the hope that is within him? Nobody is beyond redemption.Then there's Ludakris (who does a surprisingly good job) who wants to blame everything on racism. He's so blinded by hate that he blames poor service at a restaurant on racism despite the fact that his waitress was black. When his friend (Tate) points this out, Ludakris argues that she has been manufactured by white people to believe in the stereotype that black people don't tip. He's a street thug whose idea of nobility is stealing only from white people. His reasoning? Stealing from other black people is just a sign of cowardice towards whites. Of course, that so-called ""nobility"" is later put to the test. Is he beyond redemption? Or is there hope?You'll also learn that nobody's halo shines too brightly. Just when you're starting to feel sorry for a character that appears to be a victim, you'll soon see they're just as capable of breaking the IL' Golden Rule as those who have wronged them. If you're going to accept the idea that nobody is beyond redemption, then you have to accept that nobody is beyond reproach either.You think you know who you are? You have no idea. At least not until your character and humanity are put to the test. Holding onto a set of ideals and dreams is admirable, but actually living out those ideals and dreams is what defines you. True character is displayed through actions. And reactions. We're all searching for answers, we're all moving forward, we're all coming together, we're all falling apart, and our paths may one day collide. Whatever the circumstances may be, the way we act and react to that collison is what's important.THE GISTCrash is a strongly-written, strongly-acted, emotionally-gripping, thought-provoking movie that never gets as preachy as you may fear. I could add a few more hyphenated words, but I think you get the point. Some of the stereotypes are exaggerated for effect, but this is a movie that combines just the right amount of humor with some very tense drama to force us to take a close look at how we view others. Is it really fair to blame everything on racism? Sometimes we may unfairly assess a person's character based on his or her appearance, but is that borne of prejudice or is it just a matter of being overly cautious in a world where it's hard to trust those you don't know? Actions speak loudly, but so do our reactions.This is probably a little too heavy for younger audiences and a little too dark for anybody who just wants to escape from the world for a couple of hours, but for those of you who want a bit of dramatic storytelling then Crash serves up one of this year's best.Rating: 4.25 (out of 5)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tough subject to get right; this film did,"Crash let us know right away that it was not going to be an easy film to watch, with the characters essentially fighting each other in racial struggles sometimes to the death. The racial struggle is still inconclusive in America, and probably in the entire world, and we still don't know for sure how it will turn out. Will we survive it? Crash tried to give us a hint of hope that we may.Crash tried to show that even though some might fear or even hate others for being different than them, we still need each other often in order to deal with life's many issues and problems. That should be the lesson...we do need each other, and emergencies like those shown in the film are the great equalizers...we are all in the same need in those situations, no matter who helps us, and we should be very grateful to those who do help us no matter what their color.Don Cheadle is rapidly becoming a star who takes over a film from other actors, even though most did a good job, especially Matt Dillon, Terrance Howard, and even Sandra Bullock who really surprised me with her ability. Cheadle was again wonderful as he usually is, and was very soulful as a world-weary cop with a junkie mom and criminal brother riding on his overburdened shoulders.Matt Dillon's tough/gentle cop character showed the realistic changes a person can make when thrown into conflicting situations evoking the opposite emotions of anger and compassion...one time he was an angry brute bent on cruelty, the next time a gentle and compassionate rescuer of the same person he earlier brutalized. And he was a loving son too. Just like all the rest of us can be in different life situations.Terrance D. Howard, who has a great face and looks a lot like a black Benicio del Toro, was a standout. He was an Oreo entertainment exec hot shot in the early going and he wimped out shamefully in a tough racial situation involving his wife and a white cop, but his character came through later with some real backbone when he felt pushed hard enough to take a stand against perceived racial profiling and persecution by the police.Stereotypes are with us because, as shown in this film, a lot of them are based on truths or half-truths, but are just plain wrong when applied to individuals. Crash showed well how wrong all races can be by pigeon-holing others into convenient niches that fit their own built-in prejudices. Sometimes it even killed them.Great night shots of LA and wonderful film technicals throughout, using very clever cutaways that seamlessly melded one scene's end into the start of a totally different scene. Very slick and effective. The only false stretch for me was that it is realistically an impossibility for all the different characters in the film to run into each other so often in 12 million-people strong L.A. That just couldn't happen, but it made for a very interesting and fantastic drama, if not always a totally realistic one.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Powerful, Hard Hitting Drama About Racial Stereotypes","In Paul Haggis's feature directorial debut, Crash, several different characters walk the streets of Los Angeles, their minds already made up of the different ethnicities that surround them. Because of these stereotypes, not one character is able to clearly see the people that stand before them. And it is in that universal characteristic that makes Crash such a wonderful film.There is no better place to exhibit the loneliness, pain, and fear in America better than Los Angeles, which is a melting plot of different cultures within a twenty mile radius. Watching a film such as this questions your own views on how you see people of different races, as well as surprises you at how quick we are to judge someone who is not like ourselves. No on exhibits this finer than Sandra Bullock's character, Jean, who is only too quick to judge a Latino locksmith as a gang member. Jean is so blinded by these racial stereotypes that she makes, she does not even realize her actions till the end of the film, where she comes to realize her Latino housemaid knows her better than her supposed white friends.The Latino locksmith, as it turns out, is the furthest thing from a gang member. He is a family man, with a wife and angelic little daughter to whom he tells a sweet story about an invisible and impenetrable cloak that renders her impervious to all harm. That little story comes back into play when a Persian immigrant, whose store was broken into and ransacked, tries to take vengeance on the locksmith by threatening him. What ensues is one of the most climatic and heart pounding scenes I have seen on film in quite some time.Yet this is simply skimming the surface at the amount of character development and characters that are involved in this film. We have Don Cheadle as a detective who is having an affair with his Latino partner, Matt Dillon is a somewhat corrupt cop who performs an inappropriate search on a light skinned African American woman that comes back to haunt him. Ludicrous is a man who car jacks white people's cars and sells them to a car garage, all the while preaching about how white people give the ""black man"" a bad name when he is giving the ""black man"" a bad name himself. So much is packed into only 100 minutes that I only wish that these characters had more room to breathe with their intertwining stories.There is amazing use of score throughout. A score that hauntingly fits that chaos and tragedy that fill this picture. THe music alone may very well bring you to tears, it is that moving and in perfect synchrony during a car crash scene where Matt Dillon rescues a woman trapped in her car. This is what thematic score is supposed to e: symbolic to the characters on screen.Crash is a powerful and moving film that is not to be missed. Paul Haggis has debuted with a hard hitting drama that will hopefully be remembered come awards season in 2006. I can only wait to see what this remarkable screenwriter and director has in store next.Highly Recommended",,Anonymous,Crime
A succession of coincidential events which culminate superbly..,"My once modest respect for Paul Haggis has profoundly elevated due to his alarmingly integral and vividly realistic perception of the real world as it is. Crash explicitly illustrates the high racial tensions, class distinctions and general prejudice which is often overlooked in contemporary society. Although the plot is arguably unoriginal, the entire cast pitch in their best efforts to convey Paul Haggis' screenplay in the most dramatic, sympathetic and genuine way possible.Crash consists of different sagas of people who are of various classes, races and cultures all sprouting from the viewpoints of six to eight people. The beauty of Crash is that there is no one protagonist, no actor who displays better histrionic capability than another, no redundant scene which compels you to push the fast forward button; everything falls into place, and like several puzzle pieces all finely clicked together, Crash illustrates incidents in the real world.From the heart thumping scenes of molestation based on the grounds of racial profiling, to a bigot cop's redemption, to the persistent diatribes of of an affluent white man's wife, to the immoral actions of two unstable black men, the medley of emotions one feels during and after the play are ineffably intense.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Outstanding, but so what?","I'd be lying if I said that I didn't thoroughly enjoy this film, but I would also be lying if I said I learned anything from it. The makers of the picture, want us to think that we're stupid, and that we never knew that on a sub conscience level, that we are all racist. Guess what? We're not all racist.The movie circles around several different lives, who come from all different backgrounds; black, white, Persian, Mexican and others. All living in Los Angeles, the film shows the struggles and hardships and persecutions that these people go through in their daily lives. Taking place in the span of 24 hours, the film does do an excellent job of telling a story that is quite moving, and at times very intense.I thought everyone involved in the film was excellent, especially Saundra Bullock, who was my personal favorite, alongside Ryan Phillipe, who both did outstanding jobs. Not that the rest of the cast, shouldn't be noted on their work.The problem I had with the film was that they make it seem like all of America is racist, when in reality Americans have no conception of what racism is. We are so politically correct these days, that even if someone looks at you funny on the street, people automatically think it's because you're black? That makes no sense. They try to prove this point in the film. I disagreed with almost the whole film. Although it does shed light on a few interesting topics, that are more than likely true, it still felt like an advertisement, more than a film.However, I do appreciate the storyline, the direction, acting and cinematography.

I say deja vu because it smacks of Magnolia, Short Cuts, Pulp Fiction and many other superior ensemble pieces.

I also don't appreciate a movie that wag's it's finger in my face, yeah, i get it, it's about race and inter-connection and all of that, but the film was way too obvious.

In Socal we're all 'crashing'.........,"This is a unique time in the history of L.A. We find ourselves roiling and 'crashing' in a stew pot of people very different from ourselves.

This movie makes you sit up and open your eyes wide. The film follows seven groups of people from varying racial and socio-economic backgrounds as their lives become intertwined through a series of violent events: car crashes, armed robbery, the aftermath of robbery, police brutality and assault. The events are terrifyingly believable. Director Paul Haggis demands and gets superbly honest performances from the entire cast. Although the film unapologetically declares racial prejudice and its consequences as its most obvious theme, its discussion of this horrifying problem is subtly nuanced, and at its heart the film discovers genuine remorse and compassion. ""Crash"" is equally gritty and sensitive without indulging in anger, despair, or sentimentality. It is profoundly heart-breaking and also profoundly, but not stupidly, optimistic.

The critics prove the movies point,"I absolutely loved this film, but I cannot believe the huge amount of criticism it's been receiving lately. When I look at the recent reviews here on IMDb a lot of the negative ones state that in this movies the dialogues are contrived, the events are unbelievable and even that the people are offensive in their racism.Off course the dialogue is contrived, as well as that the situations have to be ""out of the ordinary."" It's the only way to provoke a reaction, thus in the end enabling the characters to redeem themselves. If Haggis would've sticked to realism and every day dialogue, how would he have been able to make a thought provoking movie about, not people being racists, but human nature and how it's influenced by our surroundings. Which brings me to the topic of racism. It's not a movie about racism IMO, racism is just a necessary emotional conduit to make it possible for such a wide variety of characters in a diverse place as L.A. to react to one another. The alternative would have been 2 or 3 people displaying a variety of emotions, he chose this way because it's such a powerful one and, although people here apparently disagree, still a really common one.The funny thing is that by showing your criticism in the way that you are, by reacting emotionally to this movie, (almost every critic gave this movie 1 or 2 *s, which is preposterous,) you are in fact doing the exact same thing that the characters in the movie are doing, not acting logical and contriving things to make a point. I think the director has it spot on when it comes to character development and the human reactionIn my opinion this was a brilliant movie, though in the beginning the personal views were pretty forced, but I expect great things to come if Haggis keeps making films.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
STRONG racial drama,"Story about two days in the life of various characters in LA. There's a rich couple (Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser) who have their car stolen by two black men. There's Don Cheadle playing a police detective with partner Jennifer Esposito--he has a junkie mother and a criminal brother. Matt Dillon plays a VERY racist cop with horrified partner Ryan Phillippe. Loretta Devine plays a black health insurance worker who has to deal with Dillon. A middle Eastern couple has their store looted by a gang who think they're Arabs. Terence Howard plays a man whose wife is sexually (sort of) assaulted by Dillon--who did it because he's black. There's also a Latino repairman mixed in this. These stories all start up apart and slowly converge together by the end.The movie is strong--the dialogue pulls no punches and ethic slurs are commonly used BUT it is necessary for the the integrity of the story. The movie is (of course) anti-racist and anti-gun--the NRA must HATE this movie. With the sole exception of Fraser the cast is great. Everybody explodes--especially Bullock (in a GREAT scene), Dillon, Phillippe and Howard. I only give this a 9 because, towards the end, the plotting becomes clumsy and there are way too many unlikely situations. Still worth catching.Now--as for the Oscar controversy saying that this stole the Oscar from ""Brokeback Mountain"". Not really. (For the record, I'm a gay man). ""Brokeback"" was long, slow, boring and depressing. Also some Academy members said (AFTER the awards) that they hadn't seen ""Brokeback"" and had no intention of watching a gay love story. Also ""Crash"" was simply a better movie. Still I don't think it deserved an Academy Award for Best Picture--it's not THAT good. But it didn't steal it from ""Brokeback"".",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The greatest competitor of Brokeback Mountain deserved its Oscar for Best Picture.,"Like every year, 5 strong Oscar nominees for Best Picture of the Oscars of 2006: Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Crash, Good Night and Good Luck and Munich. Although they both are terrific movies, Capote and Good Night and Good Luck had too strong contestants to win the Oscar for best Picture. They had great stories but the stories of the other 3 nominees are still stronger. But they deserved to be nominated of course, and Philip Seymour Hoffman earned his Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The nominees for that Oscar were alright, although I'd rather seen Eric Bana nominated for Munich instead of Heath Ledger for Brokeback Mountain. But that's just my opinion.So there were 3 movies left to be Best Picture: Brokeback Mountain, Crash and Munich. Although Munich is an incredible and terrific movie by all means, it couldn't measure up to Brokeback Mountain and Crash because of their interesting and exceptional stories. Sometimes fiction beats reality and history when it deals with an amazing subject. And this year we have that situation.So actually the greatest 'battle' was between Brokeback Mountain and Crash. And the reason why Crash won, is because the concept of racism is still more intriguing than homosexuality. 'Love is a force of nature' was the strong tag-line of Brokeback Mountain, and although the movie is as good as it can be, the masterpiece of Paul Haggis took over. Crash deals with such a fascinating subject. The collision of a group of people who are facing racism and who are in some way connected to each other. Each story of every man or woman in that film is as intriguing as the concept of the whole movie itself. And the cast is absolutely great. They all have supporting roles, and every role is just as good as the other ones. Matt Dillon did great and deserved to be nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Maybe Sandra Bullock deserved to be nominated too, but apparently she had too little votes to be in the top 5. I'm pretty sure they considered her to be nominated though. And of course the rest of the cast is fabulous: Brendan Fraser, Michael Peña, Ryan Phillippe, Terrence Howard,  very well done.Crash also delivers a big scale message about racism, and I actually felt different after seeing the movie. Not that I am a racist, I definitely am not, but it gets to you anyway. I hope a lot of people have already seen this movie and a lot of people will see it. It will always be remembered as the greatest film of 2005-2006.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Crash,"Crash Directed and written by by Paul Haggis (Million dollar baby)screenplay writer Released in May of 2005 Starring Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle and Thandie Newton.There are many films that leave the viewer ""awe-inspired"", humbled and speechless and Crash is one of them. Directed and written by Paul Haggis, this heart-wrenching drama was released in May of 2005, starring many familiar faces; from America's sweetheart Sandra Bullock to the all-serious Don Cheadle, along with the modern faces of Ryan Philippe and Matt Dillon, there is a wide variety of talent exposed in this irresistible film.Sandra Bullock, as Jean Cabot, shows us an emotional journey to find love, peace and comfort within herself as an ordinary housewife. Don Cheadle reveals his talent in the role as detective Graham Waters residing in LA. Next, Matt Dillon as an over-zealous cop-officer Ryan-is easily angered throughout the film and releases his aggressions through racial profiling while at work. Ryan Phillippe is Officer Ryan's rookie sidekick that disapproves of Officer Ryan's approach, however, is obligated to support him. Throughout the film, the various groups of individuals are so caught up in ""living at the speed of life, they are all bound to collide with each other"" (lions Gate, 2005). The truth in this statement is painful.This film depicts the lives of a group of different individuals, living in LA that are bound to collide. The film follows the lives of these various groups of individuals, all merely existing in their different lives, when in a single night they all become connected in a major car crash. As we follow the lives of all of these individuals, many suggested and implied themes are revealed: racism followed by the needs of human nature and never-ending hope. Jean longs for peace, to let go of her personally misunderstood anger as a housewife while Officer Ryan relentlessly cares for his sick father and Detective Waters lives jadedly. As the intensity of every-day speed of life builds, the yearning of all the individuals in this film is related by human nature. The yearning for fulfillment, love, acceptance and hope.Academy award winner and screenplay writer of ""Million Dollar Baby"", Paul Haggis has developed the film Crash in a direct way that allows the characters in this film to be understood directly with bold intensity throughout the drama. The lighting and sound effects are incredibly dramatic and effortlessly draw you into the reality of the film. The actors' talent demonstrates raw emotions on a scale that every viewer can identify with-human nature.Any and every viewer of this film can identify themselves on different levels with the themes of throughout film. The theme of human nature in this film relates to that in the film ""American Beauty"" when Lester gives in to his needs derived from simple human nature. Viewers can identify with the numerous elements of human nature, relentless hope and everlasting humbling from this film. The longing for love, touch, fulfillment hope-(whether good or evil)-lies within us all.

A movie that shows the unfortunate cruelty among the world and the harmful results that come from it,"Crash is a movie directed by Paul Haggis about a handful of different characters all with a similar struggle that connects them to one another. The movie jumps from one story to another, not tying in how they are all connected until the end. Each character in the movie faces the issue of how to not only live among, but treat different racial and ethnic groups. Ryan Phillippe plays Officer Tom Hansen who attempts to fight the racial separation in the city of Los Angeles and more specifically his partner Officer John Ryan, played by Matt Dillon. Don Cheadle plays Det. Graham Waters, Terrence Howard plays Cameron Thayer, and Sandra Bullock plays Jean Cabbot. The acting is well done in the movie, Crash. The viewer is left feeling an emotional tie to each character. Whether the viewer is feeling hatred, hurt, or sorrow, each actor is able to tap into the emotions of the viewers. This movie is similar to Gran Torino. Both have themes that deal with the fight of racism and prejudice. In both movies, the characters don't know how to deal with the characters of other races. Then, as the movie goes, the characters come to realize that their race and heritage don't define them as people. The movie, Crash, uses different camera angles to intensify the film. The camera zooms in on character's reactions and certain important scenes. During intense action scenes the camera angle is farther away to give the audience a clear view. Then, when the characters are reacting to the recent occurrence, hurtful slur, or sad scene, the camera zooms in close. Also, the lighting is important. Some scenes are dark and relate to the dark attitudes the characters have towards one another. Many scenes are set during the night. The surrounding is dark, but the characters features are lit up to intensify their reactions and feelings. The lighting makes the viewer feel the darkness of the theme. The movie is all about the struggle of the different cultures living together in peace. It shows the hardships some of the characters face because of their race, religion, or heritage. Crash gives a brutally honest idea of how cruel people can be to one another. The ignorance and lack or compassion the different groups of people have towards one another in this movie is a big theme. This leads some characters to be cruel and hurt others. The movie proves time and time again that the stereotypes and ideas one group has towards another is generally wrong. Without the terrible assumptions and hurtful behavior the characters have towards one another, all of the accidents and tragedies could be avoided.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Provocative, with great performances.  And Tony Danza!","» This film was not realistic. There were too many coincidences, and the characters talked about racial issues more often and more explicitly than is plausible (in my experience).» For part of the film, this lack of realism disturbed me. But eventually I decided that the filmmakers had done this on purpose, and then I was able to focus on the aspects of the film that I liked. First, every actor in the movie delivered an excellent performance. Second, I enjoyed seeing so many different characters presented with multiple dimensions. Third, I liked how the movie subtly developed themes about gender and class even as it explicitly -- and obsessively -- hammered on racial matters. And finally, I appreciated the way the movie avoided any clear message, instead leaving it to the viewer to sort out the issues that the characters deal with during the film.» I did consider some parts of the film weak. In particular, there seemed to be moments when a character's emotions would change for no apparent reason. (I blame the script for this, not the actors.)

CRASH - Review by Siane Daley,"CRASHStarring: Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton, Sandra Bullock, Terence Howard, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Brendan Fraser Certificate: 15 Release Date: August/September 2005 Reviewer: Siane DaleySeveral stories interweave during two days in Los Angeles involving a collection of inter-related characters who explore racism from every imaginable angle. Their disparate worlds collide in a car crash, which unites these characters, and is the catalyst for confronting their own racial prejudice.Don Cheadle plays black police detective, Graham, who witnesses street-level violence afflicting young black men resulting from a racist society which has left them marginalised. Graham understands their plight; behind closed doors he cares for his sick mother left distraught by his wayward-younger brother, Peter (Larenz Tate), who has left home to pursue a life of crime. Cheadle's performance is outstanding, as he deals with a difficult family and professional life, with the silent-yet-dignified screen presence that he is known for.Thandie Newton plays Christine, the mixed-race wife of a wealthy television director, who is far removed from life on the streets of downtown LA. Film-maker Paul Haggis wrote this role specifically with Thandie in mind, and her performance doesn't disappoint. Particularly harrowing is the scene with husband Cameron (Terence Howard) after she has been sexually-molested by Officer Ryan during a stop and search. Cameron is forced to watch, left powerless by a police-gun aimed at his head.Officer Ryan, (Matt Dillon), plays the part of an ignorant racist, whose dialogue is peppered with stereotypes about people of colour. However, his remarks disguise a brutalised, complex-character who manages to elicit the audience's sympathy during the course of the film. In contrast, colleague Officer Hansen (Ryan Phillipe) is naïve and racially-'liberal'. He pays the price for this when his underlying racial-fear gets the better of him, with tragic consequences.This film is a 'crash' course (excuse the pun) in racism that is very relevant to today's post-September 11th society. The pace of the film is slow at times (particularly in the second half) and often labours the 'racism' point. However, the film's strength is that it doesn't criticise or judge, instead, the audience takes the same emotional journey as the characters as we are also forced to examine our own racial prejudices vicariously.Written by: Siane Daley",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

2005's Biggest Disappointment.,"Crash is a film that is trying much too hard to try and show a part of society that is already painfully obvious. Stop and think... you are in the middle of a public place and someone shouts ""HEY! RACISM EXISTS! AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO A THING ABOUT IT!"" Now imagine how you would feel? What is such an exclamation worth if there is no resolve offered with it? Crash is a collection, for the most part, of absurdly shallow stories with overly clichéd characters.With the exception of the moving performance delivered by Michael Pena, the acting is significantly flawed and irritating. Most importantly, is the complete lack of depth and progression of the majority of the cast. The words ""cliche"" and ""redundant"" can not be used enough to describe the racial representations in Crash.The White's (Bullock, Dillon, and Fraser) are incredibly dull, phobic, uneducated and stereotypically shown as the ""we are the dominant race,"" because of course Crash would not be much of a movie without a ""bad guy.""Next, we have the African Americans, which is an almost embarrassing and degrading representation. We have a ""social intellect"" who as he steals cars, continues on his ""the white man is keeping the black man down"" rants. The blacks also have the over the edge ""black pride"" role of Thandie Newton. While breaking the law and then crying a string of ""this is because i'm black"" proclamations, you can't help but wonder WHY this character was put in this movie, did Paul Haggis WANT us to dislike the blacks in Crash?The thing i can't understand the most about Crash, is the acclaim that Terrence Howard received for his role. After the blatant ignorance of his wife Newton's character, Howard makes a split from her and carries on the majority of the film conflicted about himself as a man, an African American and a husband. This was the only shot Crash really had at character development, and it failed. Newton's character evolves NONE from start to finish in Crash, and Terrence's character, with whatever revelation he quietly achieves in his own mind, is never shared with the audience, thus making his return to Newton at the end a total waste of whatever change we thought he was building up to.Another huge disappointment of Crash was the complete irrelevance of the supporting cast (Cheadle, Esposito, Phillippe). There is not a scene involving these characters that furthers the story or enhances the film in any way without just adding to the ever accumulating pile of redundancy. If the complete failure of character structure and advancing plot is not enough to be making you want to hit the stop button, then perhaps the complete lack of innovative camera work is. From the opening scene to the closing credits, Crash fails to deliver anything innovative to film, technique, or the ever pressing battle on racism.Do we as a society have a serious problem with racism? Yes. Are we as a society aware of this? Yes. Do we need a film that presents no resolution nor challenges the idea of racism to try and drive the point home? Most certainly not. I was thoroughly irritated and disappointed with this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

A high 8.,"This movie is constant drama, and almost poetic in a way with how certain events unfold. By the end, I found myself wishing that it was longer so that I could experience more from it and from all of the characters and arcs that they chose to include. While it was made almost 20 years ago, it still highlights how prevalent racial divisions are in America even today, not only between whites and minorities but among minorities.

Racial prejudice,"The gem of this film is the dialogue. All characters speak their own languages so naturally, you won't find a single moment that they are actors talking out of a script.This is a film about racial tension in America, and more specifically, in the LA area. It's about prejudice against races other than one's own. In order to make all these happen in a less than two hour movie, serendipity has to be the norm to gather white, black, latino, Asian, mideastern all together in a story during a 36 hours period. So it might not make any sense when all these characters always run into each other, but you would not have time to question that during the film, because you will be completely captured by racial conflicts and the emotion they provoked. Will you get offended? Probably so. Will you find some traits of yourself in those characters? More than likely.None of those characters in the film are perfect, and more or less they are prejudicial against others. I think that most people in real life are this way. Some people are more this way than others. Some people are more reluctant to admit than others. Some people act upon those prejudices more than others. That's the reality in our society and that's why I like this film because it doesn't cover up the feelings of those characters with political correctness, and the film let those characters speak their minds. Sometimes, it's a shocking to hear the truth.",,Anonymous,Crime
Social Construction,"How could someone be born into a multicultural society and still see only what the naked eye lets you? There are no words to describe this kind of hatred; there are no words to explain this injustice. This interesting point is brought before the world, and the world is deceived with the inevitability of the fact that everyone has their justification. The justification that everyone has to pursue because there is no other choice, this justification would be death. The movie ""Crash"" written by Mark Lewison; acts as a mirror into the minds and hearts of everyday people. This movie lets us view who we (humanity), really are; and we are detestable and an undeserved people.The setting is a Los Angeles involving characters that are inter-related to each other without even realizing this. There in the big city live these people with their opinions about everyone else except for themselves. These characters seem to have everyone else figured out, but what about their own lives? What about the configuring and bewildering issues that dwell in their own homes? There are at least seven situations involved in this story line and every one of these situations there is someone that is judging someone else for their construed information about their personal ethnic heritage. These problems are the key factor in this movie, to overcome and understand the real meaning of abhorrence of another person's race. To find out what it really means to be a person of the underlined text, and that is hope. Hope for the next person to come along and pick up where we left off at; and that place is understanding. To understand another people that are not from your own, traditionally we may call that wisdom.To my understanding, as I watched this movie that was portrayed by brave characters, I see how humanity is reacting who we really are. As for the human race, we may have been one of those characters in that movie; we maybe under motivated and uncultivated too much for our own good.

Provocative psychological drama,"Peoples of differing ethnicities and social-economic levels 'crash' into each other in Los Angeles over a day or so at Christmas time. These people include:A white cop who's angry over the downside of affirmative action and so abuses his authority (Matt Dillon); his young white partner who objects to the abuse and actively tries to counteract it (Ryan Phillipe); a black TV director who feels emasculated over the racism he experiences and ultimately blows up (Terrence Howard); his light-skinned wife who doesn't know when to shutteth up (Thandie Newton); an Hispanic locksmith (Michael Peña) and his young daughter with an 'impenetrable invisible cloak'; a Persian shopkeeper who needs a scapegoat after his store is horribly vandalized, not to mention his daughter and wife; two black car thieves (Ludacris and Larenz Tate), the latter the younger brother of a detective, Graham (Don Cheadle); Graham's beautiful partner and girlfriend, Ria (Jennifer Esposito), and her mother, a maid to the District Attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Sandra Bullock); an Asian man who's hospitalized and his frantic wife racing to see whether he's alive or dead.""Crash"" is reminiscent of another L.A. drama, the 1991 masterpiece ""Grand Canyon,"" but has enough nuances to stand on its own. For one thing, ""Crash"" is even more serious and dark.This is an involved story with several interwoven story lines; it ain't no mindless popcorn 'blockbuster.' A casual viewing won't cut it. It's not that kind of picture. Most of the negative criticisms about the film are by people who didn't watch closely and then lambaste it with criticisms that aren't even legitimate.For one thing, the film is about more than racism; it's about stereotypes, hypocrites, abuse of power, the capacity for good or bad in every human soul, second chances, passive correction and shame, self-sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness, the last straw, manhood & emasculation, giving someone a break, true friendship, misunderstandings, favoritism and more.*** SPOILER ALERT ***Not every character is racist as some critics insist. Brendan Fraser's character never shows any racism and the only reason his wife (Bullock) blows up with racially-charged statements concerning the locksmith is because she just got robbed and shoved to the pavement at gunpoint by two young black guys. How would you or I react after such an experience? Also, the cop partner of Matt Dillon's character never displays racism in the truest sense; why else would he radically come to the defense of the director who has a fit or pick up a young black male hitchhiking? (What happens later is a misunderstanding not real racism). What about the detectives Graham & Ria and Ria's housemaid mother? (Yes, Graham makes one derogatory statement about Hispanics, but that's it; he's hardly racist). These are all main characters.Then there's the criticism that all the protagonists are ""essentially one-dimensional racial stereotypes."" This is completely untrue. Graham and Ria (black and Latino) are successful detectives; Cameron is a successful black TV director; and the Hispanic locksmith is a family-oriented working man, not a criminal or gangbanger. Yes, there are some people who fit the stereotypes, like the two young black male thieves and the racist/abusive white cop, but one of the thieves becomes shamed for his lifestyle & hypocrisy and the racist cop is willing to risk his life for a woman of color, thus redeeming himself (from the guilt he felt over abusing his power the night before), besides his white partner is anything but a white racist who abuses his authority.One critic criticized the film with this multiple-choice question: ""You are involved in a car accident on a busy street. The other driver is Asian. Do you: (a) Wait for the police to arrive and see if the other driver is okay; (b) Exchange insurance information with the other driver; (c) Scream and yell, ""damn chinks don't know how to drive!""""If you picked 'c' you'd love Crash.""This car-crash scenario DOES take place in the story, but he's leaving out some important details: A woman & man are rear-ended by an Asian lady. Why don't they call the cops? Because they ARE cops and there are other cops on the scene. Why does the lady detective talk back to the Asian woman? Because the latter is having a fit and throwing racial slurs at her. This is WHY she talks back to the Asian woman, not to mention she's a cop and therefore in a position of authority. Why does the Asian woman have a fit anyway? Because she's rushing to the hospital to see if her husband's alive. So, you see, the witty little multiple-choice question doesn't actually fit the reality of the film.*** END SPOILER ***Another criticism is that the racism in the story is not subtle like it is in real life. Well, haven't you ever seen anyone blow up like in the movie? I have. In a city as big as L.A. how many such blow ups happen over any 36-hour period?There's a lot of raw emotion and hard-to-watch scenes, but there are undeniable glimpses of love, hope, redemption and forgiveness as well. If you're in the mood for a well-made psychological drama with numerous insights to the human condition, don't miss out.The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE: A",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Strong, but not overbearing look at the racial tinderbox that is L.A.","Crash follows a recent pattern of movies that combine various strands of stories across the social stratus combined by an incident or some loose strand, in this case some car crashes. Each section of L.A.'s vast community is examined from the rich politician and his wife, the Iranian shopkeeper, the Latin family trying to escape labelling of being gangster and down to the oriental white van man.Interesting as it is, the stories aren't overbearing but as ever due to the many strands in the film they never seem to be able to fully examine the stories enough. Nevertheless, the general stories take twists and turns to keep your interest going and in this very difficult time of increased racial awareness it is a very relevant movie which is worth viewing. Likely will be positively noted in the Oscars, although i don't think that it is as good as that, but Matt Dillon will likely be given a positive nod for his portrayal of a bitter policeman for whom to there is more than meets the eye.Good intelligent cinema in a year of daft US nonsense, but nothing incredible although worth a visit to the cinema for.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
MOST Overrated Film of the Year,"I hate to spoil the lovefest for CRASH but I have seen it twice and I don't understand how this is rated any higher than just mediocre. SPOILERS!!! I think I might have liked it a little better if Roger (Payola) Ebert had not called it the Best Picture of the Year. There is no question that CRASH had a few good moments but those can't compensate for the utter nonsense that contaminates this Grand Canyon-Magnolia rip off. First of all--I live in L.A. I find it hard to believe that writer/director Paul Haggis has ever been here. THere are race problems but it's not the only thing we think about 24/7. How convenient that all of Haggis' unconvincing characters do. I can't remember so many repulsive people in one film. The silly drunk wife who emasculates her husband because he didn't take a bullet to defend her honor when Matt Dillon fondles her was such a contrived nauseating character. What did she expect her husband to do? She didn't love the guy so their subsequent kiss & makeup was nauseating too. And Sandra Bullock needs to let her pathetic, shrinking career just slither away. Don't try drama sweetie. You stink. As for the blanks in the gun and the subsequent events. Give me a break!!!! The persian man shot a child in the back and he's home spouting gibberish about how his angel saved him. The SAINTLY locksmith had every reason to kill that man on the spot. But like MILLION DOLLAR BABY (another Haggis disaster), there are no consequences for people's criminal activity. Clint pulls the plug on Hillary and there's no investigation. He's free to open a diner while Morgan Freeman drones on with his insipid narration. Hillary is clocked in the head by a criminal act but no one gets in any trouble. But back to CRAP, I mean CRASH. How did Paul Haggis pitch this garbage? ""Let's make a movie about L.A. and its isolated population where everyone talks about race problems in a preachy unrealistic manner to each other and at each other. And everyone that appears to be a bad guy, will do something good. And everyone that appears to be a good guy will do something bad except the Hispanic locksmith--he's a virtual SAINT who just stares out the window. I could go on about the nonsense when the cops pull over the film director who is at the end of his rope because of the aforementioned fondling and a Tony Danza confrontation. Haggis knows nothing about the LAPD. That guy was a threatening menace and he would have likely been shot on the spot. And the idea that the other guy is hiding in the passenger seat with his gun is beyond laughable. Our cops would never let anyone leave like that without at least looking in the car--for their own safety.

No one is good or bad,"From the moment I heard of this film, I knew I had to see it. I could hardly wait. Luckily, I didn't have to wait for long; now, two days later, I got to watch it. I must say, as high expectations as I had for the film, I am still thoroughly impressed and very short of in awe. The film offers no escape from the real world; look elsewhere if that is what you seek. It doesn't force it upon us, either; It rather shows us realism as it is. No cynicism, no ideology. Merely an unbiased look at the world of prejudice. The hate, the fear, the mistrust... and more importantly, what it leads to. We are introduced to these people, people of all ""races""(ridiculous idea, really, that of races; and quite outdated) and religions, we connect with them and understand them... and then we see them being prejudiced against or them prejudice against others... or both. And we understand. The effects of prejudice. That no one is good or bad; everyone just... is. Everyone does what they believe is right, regardless of persuasion, religion and nationality. The film plays like a TV-series, meaning it changes scene back and forth between all of these characters, which works very much to the film's benefit. The plot is amazing, it develops marvelously and it keeps your interest throughout. The pacing is perfect, I wasn't bored for a second. The cinematography is beautiful. The dialog is real. The acting is astounding, with many of the actors playing against their usual character. There was no performance that I felt was the least bit flawed or poor. This is the first film that has truly 'gotten' to me for a while... well, at least in the two-going-on-three weeks since I watched The Story of Us, and even that doesn't compare in quality(though it may in emotional impact). It shows excellently how much of an impact(and how negative and vicious it is) prejudices have; there's a scene where two characters of different races interact; one is caught in a death-trap and the other attempts to rescue her. And the frightening and disturbing thing is... she's more afraid of him than of the possibility of her imminent death. The film contains much foreboding... many plot developments may at first seem predictable, but most, if not all, will still surprise you. The only thing keeping this from a perfect rating, the one thing that brought it a little down for me is that Asians just don't seem to get the attention that all other nationalities get here; there are people from the Middle East, there are Latinos, there Black people and many, many white... but there are only two or so Asian characters, and they are the only truly stereotypical and thin characters. That derives from the greatness of the rest of the film, which is a grand example of film-making and story-telling. Maybe the film should have been longer, maybe some other characters should have been cut... I don't know. Another, somewhat minor, but still important complaint; the film talks down to its audience a bit too much; it's as if director/writer Paul Haggis expects the viewers to possess no sense of logic. Things are explained in unnecessary detail. These two things bring the film that one step back, prevents it from being completely perfect. Too bad. It was pretty darn close. I recommend this to anyone and everyone... just make sure to be prepared for an unpleasant look at reality... rather than an escape from it. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Relevant and entertaining,"The movie is much better than the trailer. Although this movie has a heavy theme and is thought provoking , there are many funny and even whimsical moments scattered throughout. I was afraid that the movie would be a lecture about racism. But I don't think it was. It's an honest look at how ill will towards others hurts others but also haunts yourself and those closest to you.I don't think this movie tried to make me feel ashamed of racism in America. What it did for me instead is made me feel what its like when kindness and fairness overcome racism. I cared about every single character in this movie. No one is completely bad or ""evil."" I don't want to give this movie away or sound completely sappy, but in a nutshell this movie conveyed to me that it feels so much better to hug a human being of any race, rather than fight with them.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Rather too blatant,"Yes this is a good film but at the same time paints a rather basic picture, it contains just about every race that would live in Los Angeles, black, white, Chinese, Hispanic and Arabic(portrayed as Persian in this film) and states basically that they all hate each other. The redemption of the film is that it is saved by a few great scenes involving Matt Dillon an Thandie Newton and the Persian guy and the Hispanic Guy(if you've seen the film you'll know who i mean), these scenes alone drag this film up above ordinary and make it worth seeing.The one thing that does slightly annoy me with this is that it so obviously owes a lot to magnolia whi9ch is a much better ensemble piece than this is and yet receives a lot less recognition, if you enjoy this then you'll be blown away by the sheer power of magnolia, which by the way Tom Cruise deserved some kind of award for!To summarise, while this is undoubtedly a good film, it is inferiorto other ensemble pieces (Magnolia,Boogie Nights and Pulp Fiction to name a few) this is still a worthy watch, but having seen Magnolia can only leave a sour taste in your mouth for the under appreciation that film received compared to this.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Crash""? I was ""wrecked!""","Ever the haughty intellectual, I was amazed how easily ""Crash"" played with my emotions.

I almost missed seeing ""Crash"" after being irked and disappointed by the scenery-chewing Sean Penn in ""Mystic River."" I foolishly feared ""Crash"" would suffer from similar Oscar greed.

Crash is a pretty crazy story,"Several stories interweave during two days in Los Angeles involving a collection of inter-related characters, a police detective with a drugged out mother and a thieving younger brother, two car thieves who are constantly theorizing on society and race, the white district attorney and his irritated and pampered wife, a racist white veteran cop who disgusts his more idealistic younger partner, a successful Hollywood director and his wife who must deal with the racist cop, a Persian-immigrant father who buys a gun to protect his shop, a Hispanic locksmith and his young daughter who is afraid of bullets. The movie shows that people are born with good hearts, but they grow up and learn prejudices. Which, in turn bring out bigotry and racial stereotypes. The setting in Los Angeles, a city with a cultural mix of every nationality. The story begins when several people are involved in a multi-car accident. From that point, you are taken back to the day before the crash, seeing the lives of several characters, and the problems each encounters during that day. An LAPD cop (Matt Dillon) is trying to get medical help for his father, but he is having problems with a black HMO clerk who won't give his father permission to see another doctor. He in turn takes out his frustration on a black couple during a traffic stop. A socialite (Sandra Bullock) and District Attorney (Brandon Fraser) are carjacked at gunpoint by two black teenagers. Sandra takes out her anger on a Mexican locksmith who is changing the door locks to their home. Later that night, the locksmith is again robbed of his dignity by a Persian store-owner. Many of the characters switch from being bad-person-to-hero in ways. Farhad (The Persian) thinks Daniel (The Mexican) looted his store, so he grabs his gun and goes to Daniel's house. He threatens to shoot Daniel and Daniel's daughter runs outside to protect him because she has the invisible cape. She jumps into Daniel's arms and Farhad shoots her. It turns out that the bullets were blanks and the family goes inside and Farhad is left to think what he did. Peter and Anthony (Ludacris) try jacking Cameron's truck. Peter is left behind as Cameron and Anthony speed off. They are cornered by police. Cameron is finally fed up with the prejudice he sees and steps outside and tries to get shot. Officer Hanson recognizes Cameron and orders the officers to put down their guns and forces Cameron back into the truck. Cameron drops Anthony off. Peter tries to get a lift later and Officer Hanson picks him up. As they're driving, Peter notices the statue of St. Christopher that he carries along at starts to laugh. Thinking that Peter is laughing at him, Officer Hanson orders him out. As Peter goes to grab the statue, Hanson thinks it's a gun and shoots Peter. He sees what he was really reaching for and freaks out. He dumps his body at the side of the road and burns the car. We end with the beginning, where Det. Waters investigates the crime scene. We find out that in fact Peter was his brother. Anthony ends up riding the bus but gets out when he sees the Chinaman's truck, keys still in the lock. When he takes it to the chop shop, they find out there's a bunch of Asian immigrants in the back. Georgie offers 500 apiece for the immigrants and the money is excepted.

Shockingly bad and formulaic,"A truly awful, moronic, super-PC, formulaic Spike-Lee-Robert-Altman wannabe. The other one-star writers have already summed it up well, bless their hearts for saving me from all the 10-star crazies on this one.I quote ""Sugarspheres"": ""It was indeed thought-provoking--all throughout the movie, I kept wondering how in the world can such a horribly pretentious, unrealistic movie get so many raves? One review, which I wholeheartedly agree with, comes from Peter Debruge of the Miami Herald. He writes 'Contrived, obvious and overstated, Crash is basically just one white man's righteous attempt to make other white people feel as if they've confronted the problem of racism head-on.'

"Some brilliant moments in ""Crash""","Prior to seeing ""Crash"" I had read a great deal about it and was, truth be told, expecting the worst and sincerely hoping for the best. Overall, I got the latter. I think it's very, very good with some absolutely brilliant moments in the film, and it is clear that Paul Haggis is one of the most talented people working in Hollywood now. Although I am not a big fan of all the interconnectedness of the film's characters (you can only rely on this scheme for so long, in my book anyway) and don't appreciate being strung along in a few of the sequences, Paul has elicited from his cast some of the most heart-breaking, poignant scenes captured on film in a long, long time. Thandie Newton's rescue scene is one. Matt Dillon's father's crying in the bathroom is another. And the filming of the invisible cloak scene early in the film is absolutely perfect. And much to my delight, Sandra Bullock is able to portray an unlikeable character and capture the frustrations of a control freak who realizes that she no longer has control over so many of the happenings and people around her. Hopefully she will stick to her word and ditch the romantic comedies going forward! And of course, the issues of race relations in America are the mainstay of the film. If nothing else, you and your friends will have plenty of topics to discuss as Haggis seems to have succeeded in covering just about every racial stereotype in America today.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Should've done way better at the box office,"I can't believe this masterpiece only made 9 million this week at the box office. I guess most people prefer to see crap like House of Wax over this. Anyway on to the movie. I thought this movie was one of the deepest, and most compelling dramas in a long time. The movie explores the struggles of different people of different racial groups and backgrounds in a single day in Los Angeles. The movie highlights especially all the prejudices that these several groups have against one another and the way some members of a particular race are viewed by members of another race. This movie, although somewhat offensive to some viewers, rings very true to a lot of us and dares to explore the prejudices that are present in almost every average American today, but the movie also shows us that although most everyday people might be prejudiced or a bit racist to some extent, in the end we're all humans and in the end the human compassion and heart overcomes racial prejudice. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges does a very impressive job in this movie and shows he takes acting seriously and that he is very dedicated. The rest of the cast is excellent, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard, Larenz Tate, Ryan Phillipe, Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser to name the familiar faces do a superb job in this film. The virtually unknown actors like Michael Peña (Latino locksmith) Shaun Toub (Persian store owner) and Bahar Soomekh (Persian Store owner's daughter) do an excellent job as well.

"Remarkable take on the clash of cultures in L.A,","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Crash was a surprise winner of the Best Picture Oscar for 2006. It's a message movie and the Academy obviously liked the message. The message is that racial intolerance is untenable if you really stop to think about it and see people from some point of view other than your own.What makes this work is a brilliant conception and adroit direction by John Haggis, a believable script by Haggis and Robert Moresco, and fine film editing by Hughes Winborne. All three won Oscars. They were able to preach, as it were, without preaching. By putting people in positions of racial and ethnic irony, they show us that racial prejudice is absurd. We see events that could happen to anyone regardless of race or ethnicity. We also see that supposed stereotypical behavior that we may hold against another race or ethnic group is sometimes exactly what we do themselves. The movie points to the truth that everybody is prejudice in one way or another.The story itself is about several people whose lives accidentally come together (""crash"") in the ethnically and racially diverse, sprawling City of the Angels. There are two young black guys who could pass for UCLA students (they think since they're in the Westwood area) who hijack the SUV of an LA politico, Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) as he and his wife Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) are driving home. There's a double irony here because one of the guys is complaining that people are afraid of them because they're black in a white neighborhood even as they move toward the hijacking! Later we meet the mother of one of the black guys whose brother Graham (Don Cheadle) is an LAPD detective who tells his mother he's bedding a white woman, Ria (Jennifer Esposito) who he thinks is Mexican, oblivious of the fact that her parents are from Puerto Rico and El Salvador! There's quite a bit of this ironic confusion about race and ethnicity in the movie, the point being people tend to see others as stereotypes of skin color and language without really being aware of who that person is as an individual. A Persian shopkeeper is thought of as Arab. Hindus are thought to be Muslim. Thais are Chinese. Ignorance is the basis of racial and ethnic prejudice, is part of Haggis's message. And he's right.One of the most beautiful sequences in the movie begins when Shereen (Marina Sirtis) buys some bullets in a gunshop for her father, the Persian shopkeeper. (Pay attention to those bullets!) Later we see Daniel (Michael Pena) talking to his daughter Lara (Ashlyn Sanchez) who is hiding under her bed because she is afraid of the bullets that used to go off in her old neighborhood. Daniel gives her his invisible, impenetrable cloak to wear to protect her, taking it off and putting it around her. Later when the Persian shopkeeper comes hunting Daniel because he thinks Daniel tore up his store, Lara runs to protect her dad who no longer has the impenetrable cloak! I won't tell you want happens. You have got to see the sequence yourself.Matt Dillon plays a racially prejudice cop who could pass for a young and less sophisticated real life ex-LAPD Det. Mark Fuhrman of O. J. Simpson trial infamy. He is the central character in another interesting sequence beginning with his groping shakedown of a black man's wife.The stories meld together in a way that reflects how Los Angeles is a cultural melting pot--or is it a salad bowl? The stories that intertwine bring out the underlining preconceptions and prejudices of the people of that salad bowl (or melting pot) in a way that is more effective than a dissertation or documentary might be. Yes, there is some contrivance, but I think it's fair to write that off as poetic license.Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is that although it won the Best Picture Oscar it only cost about $6-million to make. It's one of the most original films I've seen in quite a while and one of the most effective.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overrated But Is A Really Good Film,"This movie base on racial discrimination and probably the thing that made it so famous since people not normally talk about it either to see it on the big screen.Ask me if the movie is overrated, i would said yes.

The movie is very intense and it sure does have a great flow in the story from the beginning till the end. Though i was kind of surprise of how much recognition all the actors get, after all i barely see much of any character e.g. Matt Dillion got nominated as best supporting actor for 15 min of portraying the bad cop?Anyway this is definitely the film that one should watch for the story reason, not because of it has won Oscar or any other thing.

Racism beyond reasonable coincidences,"This movie might be the original inspiration for other monstrous ones like ""Margaret""(2011) and ""Incendiary"" (2008) which I just saw not long ago. But at least it stood out for its originality as well as the subject.I do think ""Brokeback Mountain"" should have won Oscar best picture that year. The reason was it really touched my heart. This one could resonate with me. However, I would say it was overly done in some degrees. It's a hard subject to portray affectingly and effectively. The director successfully comprehended that by applying uncanny coincidences which were cleverly plotted.Although the soap opera like scenarios proceeded throughout the whole movie. I do think the director employed them to carry out his sober messages and suited this short attention spam generation also. Even some shallow emotional subplots already carried calamities from the beginning of the movie. The dramatized storyline might be needed for this movie hence I am not sure it could be done without.We are sharing the world with various ethnic groups of people. We might not meet or even have personal contacts with them. However, at least we could learn to understand and care about others.

CRASH: an essay on race relations? No.  A great movie?  Yes.,"Odds are that I am neither the first nor the second nor the third person to recommend to you the movie Crash, the directorial debut by Million Dollar Baby writer Paul Haggis, who also co-wrote the compelling script.Thus far, Crash is easily the best film of the year, which isn't saying much given its competition is Meet the Fockers and Monster in Law (when did in-laws become the new terrorists?). Similar to one of my favorite films Magnolia, this movie is a cross-cutting ensemble movie that interweaves the lives of different people in LA, colliding through serendipity, coincidence, or bad luck.Given the diverse cast of characters that range the spectrum from hoodlums to politicians, I thought Haggis' script was the star of the film, as the diverse array of characters were all credible and convincing. I sensed that the entire theater (I saw the film with a mostly black audience in Oakland) was familiar with everyone on the screen. The writing, of course, was aided by the bomb cast, of which Terrence Howard, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, and yes, Ludicrous stood out.That said, I disagree with those touting this film as a brilliant essay on intolerance, stereotypes, and the American melting pot. I'm not sure this film says much on the nature of race relations, other than ""everyone's a little bit racist,"" to borrow a line from Avenue Q.I thought the film was, quite simply, a great story. All the critics, on the other hand, seem to be engaging in a cinematic circle jerk in a frenzied quest to avoid the cracker and find deeper meaning in the fact that all the rainbow coalition of characters (except for the Chicano/Latino ones) are flawed.For example, David Denby of the New Yorker writes that Crash is about:... the rage and foolishness produced by intolerance, the mutual abrasions of white, black, Latino, Middle Eastern, and Asian citizens in an urban pot in which nothing melts. ... Apart from a few brave scenes in Spike Lee's work, 'Crash' is the first movie I know of to acknowledge not only that the intolerant are also human but, further, that something like white fear of black street crime, or black fear of white cops, isn't always irrational.What? I'm guessing opium is what you'll find in this critic's pipe, although David Denby is Caucasian, not Asian, which means that he's a better driver than me and less likely to crash. Now please donate to the United Negro College Fund.To make a long story short, Crash is a long collection of short stories that is simply the best entertainment that six dollars, using a senior citizen discount, can buy without involving donkeys and dynamite.But if you're looking for a thesis on race relations, you're better off watching something else.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Would have liked it better if it were twice as long...,"Crash takes on a number of important issues, though none that are particularly new to the screen. Though it attempts to deal with race in America in a provocative, original way, I left feeling like I barely new the characters in the film. This movie reminds me of a dramatic version of Love Actually - so many people, so little time. With half the characters I feel I would have gotten to know them better and enjoyed the picture more. The plots are interwoven in such a way that it really feels like you're watching a movie. A more realistic portrayal might have included more finely drawn personalities and fewer interconnected elements. Overall, an ambitious attempt at creating race dialogue that falls a bit short.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not so deep,"I admire Paul Haggis's intentions in making ""Crash""--I'm sure he honestly believed his movie provided penetrating insights into urban American race relations. I understand that he wanted to show how people's lives can intersect in fascinating ways, how sometimes it takes a great shock in order to jolt us out of our patterns of thinking and reveal our common humanity. Unfortunately, the methods he uses to get this message across are rarely subtle and never as profound as he thinks they are.The problem is that ""Crash"" never goes any deeper than pointing out that everyone has the potential to be both a racist and a caring human being. Rarely does it suggest why its characters automatically revert to racist thinking whenever they are stressed or angry. Only Matt Dillon's character is given some motivation: he has a monologue describing his hatred of affirmative action. But we never learn why most of the other characters are so quick to hurl racial slurs at one another--or, for that matter, why the Mexican locksmith is the only character in the film who is not racist, despite living in a community full of bigots.I've written ""Matt Dillon's character"" or ""the Mexican locksmith"", rather than using the characters' given names, because those names are so unimportant in the script. (For the record, they are ""Officer Ryan"" and ""Daniel,"" respectively.) The characters are blatant types, with a few surface contradictions but little real insight into how race and ethnicity has affected their lives. I would love to know how Don Cheadle's character ended up a successful detective, while his brother is a criminal. Or what prompted the Persian storekeeper to buy a gun in the first place. We learn how the privileged white Jean (Sandra Bullock) feels about her Latina maid--but how does the maid feel about her employer?""Crash"" is also poorly structured and directed. For me, the best moment in the film is when Officer Ryan rescues Christine (Thandie Newton) from her car: the situation is so emotionally charged, and the direction so simple and powerful, that it works in spite of itself. But this scene, which ought to be the climax of the movie, instead comes about an hour into it. And the impact of a later scene, which could be equally powerful if handled correctly (it involves Daniel, his young daughter, and a man with a gun), is counteracted by Haggis's decision to demonstrate to us that this is an emotional moment, rather than letting us figure it out for ourselves. He goes overboard with ponderous music, slow-motion, and shots of agonized, crying faces. When he later employs the same music and slow motion as Jean falls down her staircase, the effect is so anticlimactic, it's laughable. Haggis also seems not to know how to end the movie: he takes too long tying up the various plot-threads, and strains too hard for a sense of redemption and hope.Despite these flaws, ""Crash"" did keep me continually engaged, even if some of the story lines required me to suspend my disbelief to an absurd degree. The large cast of actors do the best they can with Haggis's superficial script, and the Los Angeles landscapes are nicely filmed in a palette of ambers and blues.Racism is an issue that society (and the movies) still often refuses to discuss. It's a pity, then, that when a movie about racism does get made, it's as shallow as ""Crash."" Although individual scenes are effective, individual lines are witty, and some of the questions raised are provocative, the overall effect is unsatisfying.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Great Melting Not,"Paul Haggis brilliantly exposes the inner thoughts of many Americans to the light of day in this exceptional film. A dozen Angelinos and 24 hours serve as his instruments; the seedier side of urbia his canvass. The failed American idea of blending the world's cultures into one, is deftly replaced by Mr. Haggis with a blending of diverse ideas into one American.The ""man against himself"" conflicts, wonderfully portrayed by Matt Dillon, Sandra Bulloch, Terrence Howard and Ryan Phillippe, are center stage and framed by the more traditional ""man against man"" challenges of characters expertly brought to life by Don Cheadle, Shaun Toub, Thandie Newton and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges. Mr Toub's character (Farhad) is also the catalyst for the most heart-wrenching moments of the film.If Mr. Haggis's ""day job"" wasn't writing (Crash, Million Dollar Baby, EZ Streets) I would urge him to give it up for directing. Pacing, performances and positioning of this caliber are normally the eyemarks of only the very best of the best.Entering the theatre I expected, at best, an Altmanesque experience of quantity over quality.

Stunning Comeback,"About half-way through, I was ready to walk out. It seemed like this movie was going nowhere that we hadn't already been. Typical ""pick on the police"" Hollywood garbage - portraying the bad guys as the good guys and vice-versa.Then, the movie changed and we saw the reasons why the seemingly flawed characters, whose actions in the first half of the play were completely unflattering, behaved as they did. We were also provided moments when the earlier unflattering (and sometimes downright evil) behavior, was rendered meaningless because of newly introduced circumstances that truly tugged at my conscience and gave me a feeling of exultation at the inner workings of coincidence. In fact, it left me a feeling that there are no coincidences, that only God could intervene with new circumstances that provided the characters in the film with the second chances that could redeem their lives and give new hope to each. In the end, my heart was extremely moved to sympathy for some of the characters whom earlier I tended to condemn, and vice-versa.I would have rated the it a 10, except for the fact that the movie still portrayed the LAPD as an overall evil and corrupt organization (an undeserved charge), and because of the excessive use of profane language (which, though realistic, is quite unnecessary).",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too bad Spike Lee didn't make this film; it's the script he needed,"'Crash' is the movie Spike Lee should have made, but didn't. But Spike shouldn't feel defeated. Haggis is unusually gifted. He's up there with the best of them, and this is only his first directorial stint. What false notes there are in this movie make very little difference. The expression is eloquent and sharp as a scapel. But beware, this movie's points about racism and human nature are as powerful as any religious, political or academic ones you've ever heard. And since most people 'can't take the truth' to borrow a famous tag line, that's a problem. But if you can take in this particularly incisive version of the truth, there's no question you'd be better off if you did.A terrific movie and I can't wait to see his next.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

OK look at race relations,"In CRASH, Canadian-born director Paul Haggis takes us on a whirlwind tour of race relations in L.A., where people from many nations collide every day. He examines how we view each other and how our lives intersect through a series of vignettes, and after awhile the film began resembling MAGNOLIA in its structure and plot; it even includes a slightly miraculous act of nature, although nothing as dramatic as raining frogs. Alas, there is no Tom Cruise on hand to anchor this episodic film. The best we get in CRASH is Matt Dillon as an anguished cop with an ailing father and Don Cheadle as a detective with a missing brother and drug-addicted mother. Both are very good, but neither has the star power to provide the focus of the film; this is strictly an ensemble piece, using a mix of known and unknown actors in key roles. It is sort of fun to watch the normally wholesome Sandra Bullock as D.A. Brendan Fraser's wife getting all potty mouthed and bigoted after she is carjacked by a couple of street blacks. An initially almost unrecognizable Ryan Phillipe plays Dillon's squad car partner, and ends up being the most tragic figure of them all.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very Good,"""Crash"" was quite a pleasant surprise. This movie, no matter what your view on racism, will keep you interested all the way through. This movie is more than just a ""Don't be a racist"" movie. It shows the two sides of people and the two sides of that topic as well. While its true the kid with the baggy jeans MIGHT try and steal your purse, he also MIGHT be studying to be a surgeon and save your life one day. I am not sure if that is what the director was going for but that is the message that I got out of this movie. This movie is for open-minded good humored people. If you take the racism topic too seriously some of the dialogue will make you angry. No one race is safe in this one. Only downfall to this movie in my eyes was that the characters might have been just a little bit exaggerated. Every time someone says ""hi"" a racial argument came up. Great movie all the way through and its beautiful to see how all the parts and characters of the movie come together in the end. Go see this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
And I went on down that road,"Good people seem bad in the beginning and vice versa. Matt Dillon probably plays the most touching character among all the touchings that you witness.

It is also a study on human nature, but from the bad side. This movie in my mind is a heavy weight. The character development helps you understand why the characters change, and why they do some of the things they do. You may need some-time after the movie to relax and bring in what you saw. GO with a friend or someone you can talk to after the movie so that you can fully understand why the characters did what they did. Go and see right away.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Still Entertaining... Aside from the Dialogue,"All in all, I actually enjoyed the film for what it was: it thrilling. Not to say it was a thriller, but there are points in which are incredibly intense and entertaining, and I'd say a watch is worth it for that.Obviously, the film has some major flaws: just by reading the script, one could say that the film is a little full of itself. Maybe a lot.The film begins with Don Cheadle talking off like it's poetry night, when in actually he's a detective in LA. A normal dude, right? ""All this meddlin' glass...""That's to say that in the least, the dialogue takes itself too seriously, trying too hard to make a point. The stronger points of the film are when the characters aren't saying anything.The actions and the subject of racism in the film work to the extent of it's viewer's capability of taking these in stride. When I first watch the movie, I went in totally cold - it was more than a decade it was made and I had no idea what it was about.The first couple of minutes, I got it. Racism is bad. Job done - but they keep dragging it out when I think it handled the subject best when it was just the characters living their lives with their worries, discomforts, and obstacles. This film is incredibly contrived.Yet, I can't help but recommend it for some viewers, at least those who can stand/look past the cheesy dialogue and heavy-handed message - there are parts worth watching for, at least for when I saw it. I love the soundtrack, the actors are great, and the action is actually pretty good, too.I don't recommend referring to any trailers. Most of the ones I've seen only give too much away.

"Do the Right Thing, this ain't","This movie has a good message: Don't be racist. But stop with the fawning already. This movie is worse than awful.

That's bad, right?The same point could have been made by developing just one of these story lines into something intelligent. But, no, we need umpteen story lines involving separate incidents of Rodney-King-level racial injustice, happening over no more than a few days, among a small handful of characters. And if that's not ridiculous enough, these characters cross paths all the while.I know, I know -it's a movie. Okay, then, In the Heat of the Night, A Soldier's Story, Driving Miss Daisy, American History X, To Kill a Mockingbird, Bamboozled, Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, and the episode of Star Trek with the half-black/half-white faces are all infinitely better efforts delivering the same message without clubbing you in the head and force feeding you morality.Crash ??

Not gonna waste you're time..,"I could write pages about how great Crash was, I seriously could. But I'm not gonna' waste your time. Here's a basic summary of Crash, in my opinion.Crash is about so many things that we face every day. Our constant battles against racism, our battered family relationships, our lost sense of hope, the constant resort to violence that harms more innocent than guilty; but most of all, the realization of our errors, and taking steps, whether they be large or small, towards fixing them.After watching this movie my views on racism didn't change, I've always seen racism as immoral; and I didn't decide to go all out against guns (although I am). When I finished watching Crash, I was forced to look at my own errors, seeing that like everyone, I have quite a few. But I'm still hopefull, because I'm working to change those errors now, and I know that if I can, others can too. This movie restores hope for the hopeless.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Don't rush to judgement,"If you haven't yet seen 'Crash', please do. Not because it won an Oscar for Best Picture but because it's one of those rare films that will leave you thinking about it long after the credits have rolled.'Crash' opens with a somewhat-dazed passenger inside a car contemplating human interaction in Los Angeles: ""In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.""His partner, Ria, quickly dismisses his ramblings as a side-effect of the car crash that they have just survived. But should she be so quick to come to that conclusion? A few seconds later, she steps out of the car and engages in a confrontation with the woman driver who had rear-ended them; her angry & offensive outburst is certainly not going to help the situation...This sets the tone for the film - a social commentary that shows how many of us are quick to jump to conclusions (often using existing prejudices or stereotypes as fuel the fire), shows how we often don't consider - or care - how our choice of actions and words are perceived by others, and the consequences that may follow as a result.'Crash' is a powerful, complex and clever film that presents its story in a somewhat unique manner. We ride along with an ensemble cast of close to 20 central characters of varying ethnicities, whose lives accidentally overlap over the course of the 2 days that we are privy to.Is the scenario 'realistic'? Probably not - but that's not the point.The film is not perfect, but its few flaws should not detract from the overall experience. There are moments of truth, moments of humour, moments that may shock you, moments that will touch you, and moments that will surprise you. And, there are also many moments that will appear all-too-obvious. That's kinda of the point though - we 'stereotype' things because we've seen it all before. Sometimes we're right, and sometimes we're wrong - but the important thing to realize is that if we rush to judgement, there may be consequences..Many people say that 'Crash' is a film /about/ racism due to the character's conflicts which all revolve around race. Viewers who can look beyond 'race' and keep an open mind throughout and who consider how things might have turned out differently had the characters attitudes and/or actions been different - will likely enjoy the film. Viewers who jump to conclusions within the first 20 minutes - will not. And that's a shame, because it is precisely those people who are apt to jump to conclusions who could likely learn the most from 'Crash'.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

An American Triumph,"Paul Haggis's ""Crash"" is a triumph of a movie, and it is not without obstacles. It has a mundane plot and dialog that lacks subtly. Yet the superb acting and multitude of provocative questions the film asks its audience to ponder is nothing short of remarkable as it is remarkably important. The cast is exhilarating, particularly Sandra Bullock as a snooty house wife, Matt Dillon as a racist police cop, and especially Thandie Newton as a distraught lady caught in between having to conform to the subtle nature of racism in contemporary LA and the racism Dillon's character inflicts upon her. ""Crash"" won the Academy Award for Best Picture and I was happy it did so. Unlike ""Brokeback Mountain,"" another great film, ""Crash"" has a redeeming ending and gives the characters a new sense of definition for their life.

CRASH is a ""well intentioned"" film and I suspect the IMDb reader base that is praising it does so because of the script's attempts to try and reveal that there is more beneath the surface of human's apparent prejudice. Unfortunately, as a critic for the New York Times explained it, this film shows that there is only the absolute opposite. The characters in this film have no subtlety and no range of human emotions. There isn't a single real character in this movie, only contrivances that are constructed around a writer's technical skill at creating unsupported ironic events (as we see so many times when the introductory actions of a character become their opposite). The movie, basically, has neither a sense or reality nor a skillful sense of artifice. It is, ultimately, a mess with good production values. While I would normally just dismiss it and not write a comment, I am somewhat frightened by the number of rave reviews that this film is receiving in IMDb. I can't understand this. All I can assume is that the general audience is subject to such garbage that anything with a little bit of reversal in the characters comes as a shocking delight that is worthy of praise.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crash Is A Hit,"There seems to be a lot backlash against Crash. It may not have been the most deserving Best Picture winner, but I still think it's a very good film. It tells an interesting story with solid writing, acting, cinematography, and editing. For starters, the screenplay is structurally very good. Paul Haggis does a great job of connecting the stories resulting in powerful, dramatic payoffs for each character. Some scenes are gut-wrenching with emotion which moved me to tears. Matt Dillon rescuing Thandie Newton from the car wreckage and Michael Pena's little girl jumping into his arms as the gun goes off are the two most memorable scenes in the movie. The score is haunting with Bird York's In the Deep single being a beautiful addition. Most of the actors do very well. Dillon, Newton, Pena, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard and Sandra Bullock stand out. The rest are debatable. Brendan Fraser's performance, in particular, is wooden at best.

"A Los Angeles 'Wire' - good, but slightly over-rated","'Crash' annoyed me to start from because it took the title of another film to remember by David Cronnenberg. It succeeds to be a different and interesting film however, so from now on we will need to say this 'Crash' or that 'Crash'.The film is built as a puzzle of loosely coupled stories, around the theme of the attitude of common people in their approach to people belonging to other communities, in the multi-racial Los Angeles of today. The mix technique is interesting, although if you carefully analyze it we have already seen it used in other films, one good example being the excellent HBO series 'The Wire'. Each of the individual stories has a moral theme, based on how initial judgment and race-based stereotyping can prove to be wrong - in the eyes of the characters, but also of the viewers.It's an interesting movie, although neither the script is that original, nor the racial theme approach is that crisply approached. It god very good critical feedback, maybe slightly better than it really deserves. At some points I had the feeling of manipulation, especially when world music was brought to help and channel feelings in the more pathetic scenes. Still, the overall sensation is of a well constructed puzzle, like life itself, or if you want like the diversified society it describes.One final remark, the whole cast is very good, but Matt Dillon is the best in the role of a racist cop, who proves to be much more complex and very different from what the spectator may originally think.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Moving and thought-provoking.,"The writer of Million Dollar Baby, Paul Haggis returns with this arguably the best film of the last half a decade. Crash is a stunning and powerful depiction of modern day life in Los Angeles under the racist LAPD judicial system. The narrative follows several characters from different racial backgrounds as their lives intertwine and the prejudices each one holds for other races are rocked to their very foundations.The conflicts encountered by the various characters reflect many of the issues that affect our society today such as a white police officer stopping a black man and his wife for 'DWB' ('driving while black'). Crash takes a long, hard look at the white authoritarian members of society and their racism but also looks at it from the point of view of those who are victims of such racism. The result pulls the audience through a cathartic journey that will leave all who see it with the opportunity to give racism a serious thought.The acting, especially from the film's central characters never ceases to amaze as the audience bears witness to some stunning performances, especially Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon. Crash gave its actors the opportunity to really show off their considerable talent, which many of them did.The music in Crash contributes a great deal to its overall effect. With few exceptions, the score is mellow but powerful and serves to give each scene the strength to convey that part of the story.Featuring a star-studded cast including Don Cheadle, Brendan Frasier, Sandra Bullock, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges and Matt Dillon, Crash is a complex and riveting tale of a group of individuals that face colossal changes and choices that will put their strength to the test. Crash has won many awards recently including piping Brokeback Mountain for the Oscar for 'Best Film'. This film is not overrated and is arguably the best film to be released for a long time. Akin in many respects to '21 Grams' and 'Magnolia' the complexity of the characters and story will hold the audience to the screen for two hours of cinematic brilliance.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Despite that, the drama is solid, the acting is superb, and the movie's intentions are noble. Probably a film worth seeing.Set up a little like Pulp Fiction, with shorter scenes, Crash intertwines the lives of various people living in the darker parts of Los Angeles. Among them: a racist but dedicated cop, a middle eastern shop keeper on the verge of bankruptcy, a pair of street thieves, and a young couple going through marriage trouble, after receiving police abuse one night.Crash is not a movie to fall in love with, but it is a respectable motion picture that is able to make do with what it has.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I see Crash as a distinct supplement of what everyday people have to endure through common prejudice issues. The movie really depicts these common issues really well, thoroughly, and harshly. It is a very, very true movie, and whoever sees this picture, will endure into it, as much as I have because we all fall short into this discrimination, but we should never disgrace ourselves to it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""In L.A. nobody touches you."" ~Graham","Crash, co-written and directed by Paul Higgis (Million Dollar Baby) is anything but forgettable. Overflowing with speech that reeks of social realism and a plot that shines with creativity, Crash seamlessly carries multiple narratives which follow the clashing lives of various races of people in L.A. The plot is intriguing in its complexity as an endless cycle of racist vengeance unfolds. With no concern for its appropriateness or political correctness, the film fearlessly heats racial issues to a boil. Even with an ensemble cast ,saturated with talent, Crash lacks definitive heroes, victories, triumphs or failures. Co-writers Higgis and Bobby Moresco somehow manage to depict realistic, predictable characters in a completely unpredictable series of events.The film is set into motion when Peter (Terrence Howard) and the smart-mouth, prone to preaching Anthony (played by Ludicrous) execute a car-jacking on the L.A. District Attorney and his wife (Fraser and Bullock). Having had their sense of security jarred, they decide to have their locks changed by Hispanic locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pena), who also replaces the lock of Arabic shop-owner, Farhad, who buys a gun to help cope with the post 9/11 racism with which he is burdened. The plot's depth unravels itself amongst Asian immigrants, politicians, corrupt police officers, and even a film director (Terrence Howard), as Crash lays out its gritty social commentary on the detachment between the races in Los Angeles. The sharp speech of the characters is brash and intentionally offensive while serving its purpose of thought-provocation. For example, there is Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon), a corrupt white policeman who molests the wife of the black film director, Cameron, who's wife, Christine, castigates him for not being ""black enough"" to fight for his wife's honor. Cameron, in turn, releases his frustrations on Anthony during an ensuing car-jacking which is stopped by Officer Ryan's young partner on the force, Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillipe). Yet, the tangled prejudices of all the characters emerge in a beautiful conclusion.""We just kept digging at the truth, and we just didn't care what it sounded like. And, we knew it was ugly"" states co-writer Bobby Moresco. ""And then, we just didn't allow ourselves to be put off by the ugliness of it. Racism is nothing if not ugly. And no one's going to pay any attention to the storytelling if you try to get around that."" The inappropriateness of which Moresco speaks manifests itself via the lucid acting of the film's breakthroughs. Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges defies the stereotypical rapper turned actor whose range is limited to an on screen version of himself. Ludicrous exhibits a spark of true acting talent, spitting out lines which denounce the even the pop-rap that made him famous-- ""the music of the oppressor"" as his character, Anthony, puts it. Meanwhile, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, and Don Cheadle all display exactly why they're big-time Hollywood talents.The economic screenplay cleverly weaves in and out of many intense confrontations while also finding time for comical one-liners and softer emotional moments (scored beautifully by Mark Isham). As it does so, the story allows us to receive and understand the prejudice-producing outlooks and anger by which the film and its characters are fuelled. It is in this aspect that Crash is amazing in its ability to transcend the streets of L.A. The fearless racial conflicts portrayed in this film are bound to conjure self-reflection as Crash boldly explores the dangerous places where most films dare not journey. There are many moments when the film could end, but it continues to push further in it's mind-blowing climax, adding spontaneity to its profoundness. Crash surpasses pure entertainment and becomes an important social critique when not a beautiful reflective work of art. You will leave this film ruminating over it's scenes, pondering your place in the feuds depicted on screen, and as Officer Ryan puts it, ""you think you know who you are. You have no idea.""",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
an amazing view of ordinary life,". Crash is a big surprise!!! Simply, in my point-of-view, one of the best movies of 2005. At first, you may think that it's just a pile of different stories mixed mindlessly, but every character deliver a strong, deep message that become clearer when their stories ""crash"" into other in ordinary situations. And these situations are so well-performed by the actors that you fell like witnessing real life. Camera work also help this feeling, as if the camera was itself a character, reacting to the emotions of every person in this movie. You'll stay a long time remembering and thinking about this movie. Simply don't miss it !",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Talks about a lot, but doesn't say anything at all.","On the positive side, this movie has heart and good intentions, which is more than can be said of most. However any resonance or authenticity is lost in screenplay gimmickry, preachiness and manipulative direction. It's efforts to ""say"" something are simplistic at best. The movie tries to pack in somany issues that all it can do is scratch the surface, hence it is a shallow film populated by one-note characters behaving in mostly unbelievable ways.There are no quiet moments in the film; it has all the subtly of a dump-truck. Everything is so exaggerated and sensationalized there is no room for imagination and one is left, at the end, with nothing more to think about. The movie does all the thinking for its audience, which personally I find rather insulting.Also it is hard not to think of ""Magnolia"" when watching this film. ""Crash"" is also a film about an ensemble of characters interconnected by tragic and amazing events over one day in LA. ""Crash"" is derivative at best when compared. I also find it really confusing that Paul Haggis gave his film the same title of another contemporary American (well Canadian really) film, though certainly not widely seen, nonetheless with a very distinctive reputation.I understand the popularity of the film and all its awards and nominations: people love gimmicky movies. The gimmick in ""Crash"" is the interconnected characters storyline. You've seen it done before in much more original and seamless ways. This movie pushes the envelope to extraordinary limits of ""suspension of disbelief"" to pull off this trick. It is audacious certainly. Some may find it magical; I found it appalling - a storytelling technique standing in for meaning. Hollywood loves this tactic. You could say it is even the very foundation of the Hollywood Narrative. Like political discussions, though tiresome, they keep even the most intelligent minds coming back for more.In terms of performances, honestly only Terence Howard and Ludicrous (of all people) actually stood out for me. Brendan Fraser continues his reputation as the most inept and laughable actor in American film - how is it possible that someone with so little talent can be cast in ... anything? His agent must be the devil. Most of the performances are so one-note it's hard to be involved with them. Some are even one-scene. William Fichtner - who is he supposed to be? Why isn't this just a scene between Don Cheadle and the DA? Then you could have lost Brendan Fraser, replaced him with William Fichtner, AND this pivotal scene would have actually made sense.In terms of direction, I can't believe anyone respects this kind of heavy-handed, unfocused work. The use of slo-mo in this film is so gratuitous and unskilled ... I couldn't believe it honestly. Paul Haggis is at the bottom of my list. And he has music playing beneath almost every shot of the film - a sure sign of a lack of confidence behind the camera. Mark Isham's synth-heavy score is pretty cool for a while until the wailing female vocal comes in and it becomes a parody of itself. It sounds like the same wailing woman you've heard in 30 other movies. Then the film ends with two of the worst songs I have heard in a major motion picture. For a movie about diversity, these songs come straight from the collection of a middle-aged white guy who keeps the dial on the easy listening station. Lame, lame stuff.Nothing amazes me anymore when it comes to the popular tastes of movie-goers, but I am disappointed. If you like your emotions manipulated instead of engaged, and storytelling gimmicks instead of authentic characters, this one's for you. If you appreciate any kind of subtlety in a film, I would not recommend this.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
fabulous essay on race in America,"Crash (Paul Haggis, 2004) Having missed it when it came out, I saw this film recently on DVD and rated it highly. It's been deservedly nominated for an Oscar but in a year featuring gay cowpokes and authors, I doubt it has too much of a chance. It covers a two day period, unravelling the intertwined back stories of a number of people involved in an L.A. traffic accident. These comprise: a black police detective with druggy mother; two black car thieves constantly discussing racism; a District Attorney and his wife; a white cop with a sick father; a successful Hollywood black director and his wife; and a Persian shop-owner desperately concerned with the safety of his business and his family.The theme is racism and a bleak vision of the US it provides. In the UK we are well aware of racism but our experience never begins to compare with that of our American cousins. We see in the film how race permeates every aspect of society, contaminating like a disease, spreading fear and paranoia; framing the lives of the poor and freighting the nightmares of the rich. The racist white cop, trying to help his father, becomes infuriated by the unresponsive health service bureaucracy, staffed by poor blacks. He takes it out on the director's beautiful wife whom he more or less molests after stopping their car and shamefully intimidating them. But there are no crude stereotypes; later on, at the scene of the accident, the cop acts heroically to save the life of the same woman.Paranoia is freely on display; one of the car thieves suggests buses have big windows so that the poor blacks who use them can be clearly seen and humiliated. The shop-owner encounters extreme hostility on account of his Middle Eastern provenance; he changes the locks on his shop but does not trust the locksmith who says he needs a new door. Consequently his shop is burgled and trashed with racist comments scrawled on the wall. He takes a gun to seek reparation from the locksmith whom he holds responsible. Each story is dependent on the others in some complex fashion but the messages are subtle, oblique, not broadcast via the customary Hollywood megaphone. The acting is top notch throughout, but with only a few major stars- Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock and Don Cheadle who also produces the film. It's a bleak but intelligent and riveting vision of how, despite its success at being a multicultural melting pot, racism has entered into the very DNA of the USA and will continue to play havoc for as long as the country exists.

"Not just about racism, but rather life story","I just watched this movie again and I still absolutely love it. What brought me to see it in the first place is the music theme from ""a really good cloak"" scene which is maybe of the most powerful scenes in movie history.The story itself is maybe to broad but the way all characters fit together is awesome. That's how it works in a real life when you think about it. You feel like all the things happen to you, but actually it's about all these individual worlds crashing together to produce whatever you think life is.Acting is great, directing also, and I adore ""cloak scene"" music.

A work of cinematic genius.,"According to Newton's Third Law of Motion, ""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."" In ""Crash,"" the energy is conserved while we see lives of the characters either created or destroyed by events. Through exploration of tense racial and political subjects, ""Crash"" grips onto audiences with vignettes of superior drama.During this year's Academy Awards, ""Crash"" took an unexpected victory for the ""Best Picture"" award over the expected winner ""Brokeback Mountain."" After watching ""Crash,"" however, it became clear why this film is highly acclaimed.We are introduced to several characters all in some ways are connected to each other over a 36-hour time frame occurring in Los Angeles. The movie portrays the variety of struggles between African-Americans and the LAPD, the paranoia and prejudice of Hispanics and Muslims, and the dark and bright sides of crime. In the end, all characters collide, and they are changed forever.The genius in ""Crash"" not only lies in the plot, but also in the themes and messages lodged inside. The obvious issue is racism: minorities are targets of white men and sometimes of one another. The movie explores the tensions rooted in hardships and misunderstandings. For example, Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) reveals his troubles are due to his ill father and their struggle to support themselves. Although not a ""liberal"" message, the movie downplays affirmative action and states that policy will harm minorities and only human intuition can help save discrimination. Several other ""liberal"" criticisms prevail such as Medicare reform, feminism, and immigration.The characters in Crash are astounding. Especially fascinating is the rapper Ludicrous, who recently gained limelight acting in major films (""Hustle & Flow""The characters Terrence Howard have played beat up Ludicrous in both movies). His character, Anthony, is morally questionable yet he devises astute philosophies of life. In addition, the movie revives several diminishing actors such as Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock. Even the minor characters such as the fussy Asian woman were well-articulated, bringing ""Crash"" a high level of credibility.But I gave the film a 9/10 rating because some of the content didn't connect well while some characters disappear after their climax and rarely resurface until a shot of him/her in the end. However, ""Crash"" is a well-merited film that is definitely worth watching or keeping. Since most of the political messages are strong, conservatives might be repulsed by these sensitive subjects.

i enjoyed the movie....,"I think it was a very good movie, whether or not people agree with the way it was made or the issue it focused on is another thing. The movie whether it is predictable or boring still evokes out of people emotions that many may not be willing to accept. It showed that stereotypes are not only believed by whites but by every culture about another culture. While many may think that just because they do not see racism first hand or right in their face, it is there on a subconscious level and some face it everyday and some may face it periodically. The movie showed it just exactly how some people today feel. It is not as though Hollywood executives were just coming up with this stuff. It is what regular people think.

Simplicity (my English teacher told me) is rarely simple. I'm a movie fan and have seen plenty, so can sense predictability within seconds of a movie. I don't think this film is remotely predictable.

How often we let the past experiences, stories etc. affect our future behavior. How we all have this so called notions about people: be it color of skin or religion or geography etc. But what this beautiful director unfolds in the movie is that this very concept of prejudging people is the cause that bad people still remain bad.The director has masterfully portrayed how the prejudices can be wrong and how people whom we fear/hate/ try to stay away from, can go out of their ways to help us.

This movie HAS a POINT,"No man is completely good or bad. Though, one can generally incline to one of those sides.Sometimes our reactions to situations (are provoked) depend on our previous/recent experiences (maybe too recent). Every man is capable of doing noble as bad things, though it's not a 50% - 50% thing (thank God). We should try, as much as we can, to open some kind of ""umbrella"" (take precautions) when we see that some kind of a ""storm"" is coming our way. If we are just careful enough we should be able to notice (most of the times) same changes (""clouds coming"") and trigger our ""security alarm"". For most of the cases that is: run like hell from everybody else until the ""storm"" passes... eventually, the shiny sun is above the clouds and always comes after the rain  and that's a very comforting certainty. In this case we see the same people with different ""weather conditions"" inside them - reacting differently to various situations.We see that when our ""sky"" is blue and shiny just before the certain situation => we are capable to see things more clearly, altruistically and are (beautifully) capable of doing the great and noble deeds, even ready to give our very own life for someone else. But, if/when the ""storm"" comes, our judgment is temporarily clouded, and we are not capable to see thing clearly => we have little time, less ""light"" of reason and compassion, and so, we make quick/wrong/stupid decisions (most of the time). So, we might have many (good inclining) people in prison just for being a bad ""weather forecaster"" => doing wrong things during their personal internal ""storms"". (I hope I'm using good expression; English's not my native tang)So, generally good people: (or those inclining to good; those who listen to their conscience) might do foolish things in their ""storm"" moments (but these are only moments, when they pass  they're generally very sorry for what they did - and they'll try to make things better), on the other hand  bad people (or those inclining...): are also CAPABLE of doing noble things if something happens that helps them to see their ""light"", their ""sunny sky"" full of reason, love, compassion and peace. And they'll do it completely naturally.And now we come to the very POINT of this movie:Do not judge your fellowman at first sight, maybe (s)he had a bad moment/minute/hour /day/month/year/life, maybe (s)he just didn't have the opportunity to see his/hers blue sky lately (or ever). Maybe (s)he needs just a little understanding or a KIND word. Maybe that's just a moment that'll pass soon and (s)he'll be his/her old self again (= hopefully good). One wise man said: ""One good word can make a bad man (turn) good, and one bad word can make a good one (turn) bad."" We should try not to have any prejudices, paradigms... every man is a unique gift to human race... and also: essentially there are no races... and sadly: there are those who are willfully determined to be bad.Do not lose your faith in people's goodness, believe in them, give them more space, everyone can change, everyone can be good (or bad, unfortunately), just let us give everybody that chance  we might be surprised.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

I was surprised that this movie did not get more press, it is very unbiased to the way that it includes all races in its lens. It shows the raw side of LA. and yet is not particularly violent, you feel the desolation yet it is more through implication than actual visuals, i came away from watching this movie feeling wrecked yet when I looked back on it there was little bloodshed or violence. doesn't it just show that you don't need blood and guts to get your story across.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mixed Feelings,"I just can't find the right words to say how I feel about this movie. I can say that the acting is excellent. I've never been so mad and sad for characters before. I totally get the point of the movie. I grew up in Memphis during that same time, but I was kid I never witnessed anything like what is exposed in this movie. The amount of racism between all the races in this movie hurt my soul. The labeling, the blaming, the bashing, it just plain hurt to watch. Then it hurt because it's not much better today, it's different groups now not just races. In the end though I saw people be human to each other when it mattered most. I saw in the eyes of Dillon's character the realization of how terrible his actions had been and the impact it had on others as well as his own life. I can't say this is a terrible movie don't watch because perhaps if more of us watch then maybe a few of us can work toward a change. In the end we all have the same color blood. If you elect to watch this movie and you have a heart be sure to have plenty of tissues, but be warned it hits on some really hard subjects.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A daring movie exploring the issues of racism....,"....really gives you something to talk about with those you watched it with afterward. It is the most racy movie I've seen since American History X. You come away from this movie knowing that stuff like this truly does exist in real life, but at the same time wondering how everything can revolve around race with every single person in this movie with every single thing they are presented with. I know we are all racist at one time or another in our lives, to differing degrees. And I realize that many people are out there that think like these characters do, but thank god it's not as rampant as it was in this flick. In the end, it really gives you something to ponder, and even while you watch, you are sometimes taken back by what transpires from the very beginning, because you know in your heart that stuff like this exists everyday, and it makes you wonder how we all pretend to get along. A good movie, you could do a lot worse. Although, be prepared to be a little down after it's over, I'd recommend a comedy after watching this.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An excellent piece of work, that will make you think about yourself.","You don't have to live in America to appreciate this movie. You can be from anywhere in the world, and you would have met some sort of racism, or nationalism.. or any ism. Everywhere across the world, people will have a different opinion about this movie - because it's not always the color of one's skin that separates him from the rest. Sometimes it's where we're from, how we talk, how we dress, how we walk that makes us stand out. Sometimes people are just prejudiced for no apparent reason.This is something everyone should see. It will make you think about yourself, about how you treat people on the street, and how other people treat you.Yes, it relies heavily on coincidence. Yes, it does seem overly scripted. But it is a movie after all, and it carries it's point across very well. Unmissable.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This movie gets a bad rap - but I love it,Not sure why this film so often gets panned - despite its Oscar win. I find it so well told and well acted. It really conveys much about the complexity of race issues in the States. I thoroughly recommend it.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Film's plot  and cast rise above the difficulty of believably conveying a parabolic message about racism,"People are bad; people are good. Most of us are somewhere in the middle, quite capable of taking a step away from the gray, toward light or darkness, depending on the internal and external factors which gradually shape our lives. Want to see several examples? Take a look at this engrossing film, which from the get-go latches onto your senses and even pulls your conscience along with it so that you--well, I did, anyway--are continually having to relate to situations which shed a sobering light and a hideous shadow upon that place in your soul which attempts to separate right from wrong, that corner of your psyche which can't always distinguish good intentions from calloused self-righteousness, can't always make sense of why things happen the way they do to seemingly average everyday people.Similar to Magnolia, in the sense that several unrelated characters are thrust upon one another's paths, this film's plot highlights the oftentimes easily overlooked notion that we are all connected, that we are all significant parts of a great whole; and it manages to convey this lesson without triteness or blatant, conventional, highbrow lessons on morality--for the most part. Rarely do dramas such as this inject humorous Decalogue into hardship, criminal behavior and downright cynical despondency and alienation. And rarely does a serious film engage its audience by casting several flippant floodlights upon racism and its many disguises: e.g., its pretentious self-righteousness and its need to justify itself in the face of objectivity and honest intentions.Most of the time the cast steers clear of melodrama and superficiality, sensibly and sensitively providing pathos and relatability to their gradually intersecting roles. Particularly noteworthy are Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Thandie Newton, and heck, even Sandra Bullock (who doesn't usually exhibit a whole lot of range).At times, some of the coincidences do seem a bit too contrived, a bit too determined to tell a story about the cold and calloused side of humanity and the chance for redemption which waits for us just around the corner; it is easily forgivable, however, simply because this is a parable come to life, a study on the trappings we have set up for ourselves by refusing to understand and genuinely accept (and embrace) our cultural differences. If you have ever doubted it, you might walk away from this film thinking that we are all racists to some degree. And yet we are equally equipped with reliable consciences; we are somehow quite capable of drawing kindness and tenderness from the very same hearts which harbor those self-serving, destructive impulses. What we choose to do based upon those impulses will change us--for better or worse--whether we acknowledge it or not.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This is a movie for easily manipulated idiots who need to be told what to think.,"Bombastic, heavy handed, condescending. This over-acted production of one of the worst screenplays in history is amongst the worst films I have ever laid my eyes on.There is not one second of honesty or integrity in this picture. It is a movie that lets people believe they have sat through something thoughtful, despite the fact the film never asked them to think once.This film promotes so many racist stereotypes that it is shocking that any person in their right mind would consider it any sort of achievement in the important subject of race relations in America.A complete piece of garbage. Stay far away.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Can't find words to explain it.....Superb on every level!,"There's hardly ever a movie in Hollywood that stirs up such deep emotion. I'm serious, this movie made me think! I'm still in awe of it...I'm in love with this movie! Maybe it's because I used to live in L.A., and I've been shot at and had to sleep on floors; but it's past that. I think everyone can relate to this film in some form or fashion. From locksmiths to movie producers this movie has all of your stereotypes, and they're pitch-perfect. The score is amazing, the actors are at the top of their game, and the story is just heartbreaking. Please, I repeat PLEASE, go out and BUY, NOT rent, this movie. It'll leave you shocked. The Best Picture Oscar was well deserved. Excellent job guys!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Caught me by surprise,"Don't know if the movie itself caught me more by surprise or the reviews on here. I thought it was a very enticing and unique movie to watch, one of the few I could not guess on an outcome to. Of course I don't really care what anyone else votes, I just vote what I feel it was for ME. Without getting unto spoilers, I was happy to see a film that was not a cookie cutter style of film, but then again LGF does seem to have a knack for bringing this style of film to us. I was surprised by the group of actors that had been pulled together for this as well. I am not used to the type of film with different stories all interwoven, but like the result.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great movie about the complex human relations,"In my point of view this movie is one of the best movies of the 2000's.The biggest issues presented in this movie are racism and the misunderstandings that can lead from the smallest to the biggest problems.In this thought can be included the chain reaction of scenes what start's when the store owner does not understand than in order to be fixed the store's lock ,first it has to be repaired the door.But despite this he is accusing the repairer that he is cheating and it will not be paid.This lead's to a war between them with a miraculous end what is explained later with a simple fact. Another memorable piece from the movie is when officer Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe) shot's Peter (Lorenz Tate) thinking that the passenger will point a gun to him.Later too destroy the evidence Tom burn's his car what later it will be a worming object to some kids and too Cameron (Terrence Howard) who at last find's peace in his soul.An other great theme of the movie is the human personality sometimes ugly, sometimes beautiful.This is perfectly exampled when in a moment officer John Ryan (Matt Dillon) is molesting a woman in the front of his husband and in another he saves her from a mortal crash.(From this scene is the movie's title inspired)Mark Isham's soundtrack is greatly matching with the movie and Bird York's single ""In The Deep"" in the scene when everyone find's peace inside is the picture's highpoint.Best movie made by Paul Haggis",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
