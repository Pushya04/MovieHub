A very underrated film ( American C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10,"I really do not understand what these critics are based to rate a movie, this excellent movie has a horrible rating when others are not so good they have excellent rating, 30 days of night is a clear example that we can not judge a movie based on Critics",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only Had to Get 1 Thing Right...And it DOES!,"Atmosphere.What a brilliant place to set a movie where the creatures rely on the night for their strength. No place to escape, no respite, 30 Days of , we are coming to get you!Its a simple story, with good acting and a great style, but it is the unrelenting onslaught with relief a long way off in the future that sets up and carries the movie towards success.Awesome fun :)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very good movie, quiet scary.","Okay, this is a scary film actually worth watching.I've seen quiet a lot of vampire/zombie movies, and this one stands out to me, because even though it sometimes uses a bit of gore, that's not what makes it scary.It's the tension. You just don't know what is going to happen next, the atmosphere is very creepy and the movie just gets through to you, like you can almost feel the Alaskan cold. Most scary movies I see end really badly, this one sort of did as well, but with a bit of romance.The thing that scared me the most about it is the vampires, I mean, you wont want one of them coming into your room at night.Overall, very good and worth watching..8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good vampire movie.,"Well acted, well directed, great cast and a very good story.Something different to most vampire movies. Mostly very good effects and a decent amount of pretty serious gore.Not perfect by any means but highly enjoyable in my opinion and has some great music too.Definitely worth a watch for any vampire fans.Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than many a vampire film.,It's a reasonably original take that visually strip mines the comics it was born from. If you can ignore the very silly denouement and the odd way they have of showing the flow of time then this is a solid tense action horror.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Violent, Bleak, And Fun","These vampires are more like wild savages than the charming and seductive Dracula or the stylish and clever Lestat. Instead we get rampant bloodshed across the Alaskan winter landscape with our protagonists trapped in a hopeless situation, turning it into a hopeful one as they just barely survive, being hunted by the seemingly-invincible vampire menace, until the tables gradually turn.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great setting but disjointed,"Pretty good movie with great vampire concept and fantastic premise and setting. Characters do make you care, atmosphere is strong, and in places it's tense and scary. Would have benefitted from extending the first 'what's going on?' section of the film, which was excellent and resolves a little too quickly. Then reduce the length of the second half which is a bit disjointed, and you don't always know why the characters are doing what they decide to do. Gets a bit random, to be honest. Still enjoyable though.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very good film for its genre.,"I had the opportunity to see this film tonight at a free screening at a theater in Chelsea, NY with the director David Spade, Melissa George and Josh Hartnett all present at the screening and I walked in expecting another run of the mill vampire movie and walked away pleasantly surprised.It's no question that over the last 9 years the whole Vampire trend has been overdone to death. Blade spawned a sudden interest in a subject that has been around forever but hadn't been refreshed in quite some time. After Blade, enter Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series and so on and so forth until the whole vampire trend had well worn its welcome. A few years pass and here's yet another vampire story. What makes this story any different? The graphic novel, 30 Days of Night, put together by the talented team that worked on Todd McFarlane's stunning ""Hellspawn"" series, Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith found a way to do something creative within the vampire realm, and its completely to do with premise.That premise being, vampires being allowed to run amok freely in Alaska during a 30 day period when there is no sun to force them into hibernation during the day. Its simple yet fresh enough to maintain my interest, it's a wonder no one had thought to write this story until now.What's important to note is that the story does not go into too much detail about the leading characters personal lives, nor does it go into too much detail about the vampires themselves. We don't know how they came to be and what their philosophy is (besides sucking blood) and that's a good thing, Its plunged strait into action and this lack of over characterization, actually helps to strengthen this story.Despite the Alaska angle the film and the story itself is nothing really original. Even the vampires themselves are nothing we haven't seen before. Black trench coats and a mouthful of fangs, speaking in a foreign tongue with an evil squeal. But it's okay. I've seen it before but that doesn't mean that it's not going to make the movie any less entertaining.Where this movie is successful is in the fact that it's handled in a very realistic way. Nothing is too over the top, Evan; Josh Hartnett's character is a believable and very human sheriff. He doesn't do anything in this movie that doesn't seem plausible, in fact the film has very little cringe moments and hardy any cheesy dialogue.But it doesn't take itself too seriously either. It is what it is; an extremely gory movie about vampires killing people and it's thrilling, entertaining and put together very well. Its so basic that it works, not since the Decent had I seen a horror movie that succeeded in this matter by keeping the story basic and believable and not relying on cheap tricks to try and thrill the audience. Of course there's the sudden jump moments, but you don't see Even leaping over dumpsters shooting off semi-automatic weapons and spurting out one liners.When it comes to the films performances, the supporting actors do a good job and the ever dopey and extremely untalented Josh Hartnett whom I never fail to dislike, in everything he does, somehow seemed almost likable in this movie and I don't know why, but I did like him in this roll.Some of the shots in this movie are incredible; I can honestly say I've never seen anything like a few scenes that popped up in this movie. There's an overhead shot that spans the entire town amidst all of the chaos of the vampire attack and I can honestly say it is breathtaking.Overall it's a very strong film for its genre, dare I say one of the best. You simply can't compare it to Citizen Cane, or the Godfather but for what it is, its very good. If you like graphic novels, liked the Decent, like horror or sci-fi. Or Vampires. You'll be pleased. Well worth it for free and if I had played would be satisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unique take on the vampire genre,"Good movie. Scary, original and well made.Great acting with Hartnett, Houston and Foster being creepy/heroic.Well written and executed.More like a 7.5 but what the heck it ain't a 6.6 like it's showing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Good, Action-Packed Horror Movie","There are several good things about this film that differentiates it from the average vampire story line. The idea of using a small, Arctic town like Barrow, Alaska, creates all kinds of unique opportunities that most movies of this genre don't have available to them. For example, because of its geographic location it has ""30 days of night"" which gives the vampires a totally new lethal capability as they now have 24 hours in a day to wreak havoc. And they take maximum advantage of this new opportunity. Additionally, the extreme winter environment and the geographic isolation provide a new set of difficulties for the humans in their desperate attempt to stay alive. Another difference is the ugliness of these vampires and their behavior which is much more savage than most ""typical"" vampires presented in films today. They enjoy tormenting their prey. As far as the film is concerned, it was nominated in 2008 for a Saturn Award for ""Best Horror Film"" along with ""Best Makeup"". It boasts plenty of action, but this detracts a bit from the overall acting performances. While both Josh Hartnett (playing the lead character of Sheriff ""Eben Oleson"") and Melissa George (playing his estranged wife ""Stella Oleson"") performed adequately, the rest of the characters weren't well-developed, and it showed. All in all, though, this was a good, action-packed horror movie that makes good use of the dark ambiance and original concepts.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Boosting Addition to the Genre,"I am not a stainless fan of vampire movies, I just enjoy them when casually seeing one. I put them in the same bag that zombie flicks, so I have faith in the genre. This movie treats the story of a survivor group running away from a crew of Vampires, summoned in the darkness of an inevitable night. This optic more likely belongs to a class A Zombie, where they always run from their chasers, so expect changes.""30 days of night"" follows an interesting premise, with a new perspective, that moved me to see it. In an isolated town in Alaska, which it summons into a month of darkness, inhabitants will have to fight with a bloodthirsty gang of vampires. The movie doubles your breathing rate, grips you to the seat and prepares you for the gore spectacle with previous innuendos: a music that is both eerie and attractive, like a northern wind blowing. The constant snow falling gives a ghostly appearance to the show, the dampened and subdued lights form the perfect stage for the action to develop and an appropriate, narrow fast editing. Thanks to the brutal make up and great acting, the Vampires look soul-less and real monsters, that are not moved by a logic, nor softened as Anne's Rice; but into their brutal needs of feeding like a hound of animals.Always with your blood frozen and your hairs paralyzed, the movie just keeps you guessing when you are going to get a big sudden scare. There is an extensive make up work (basic for movies like these), that make vampires scary and impervious, frightening with the way they walk, move and gesture. Would I mind having one of them at home.Remind you of the gruesome parts, where skin is torn down like play-doll, the fans and new experience seekers will be satisfied. There is a mild character development, where we only ground for few of them.""30 days of night"" doesn't include a major budget. Expect what the poster and trailer promises. Tension, great action development, entertainment and:-Oh yes, there will be blood.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but Should Have Been Better","The northern most town in the US during a month of darkness is a fantastic setting for a thriller/horror movie. Does this story do the setting justice? It could have been better but it definitely could have been worse. The vampires that descend upon this small town are indeed monstrous. They're violent and smart but also very animalistic. They quickly reduce the population of this town to a small few. The biggest problem with this movie is that the characters are not very interesting. Most of them seem to serve no real purpose. The main duo are given a complicated relationship to make them more interesting but we're never really told why this relationship is strained. This movie is at times suspenseful as the small group of survivors hide out in one place or another. In my opinion, most of this town's residents aren't the surviving type, which is odd considering where they live. As the story goes from the first day to spanning the 30 days, it begins feeling a bit erratic. The movie struggles to make it feel like this significant amount of time has passed. Even with its issues, 30 Days of Night has its good thriller/horror moments making it entertaining enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Vampire Movie in Over a Decade,"As night begins to fall for a thirty day spell over a small Alaskan outpost village, a motley crew of vampires comes waltzing in for a feast in David Slade's adaptation of the graphic novel, ""30 Days of Night."" Ever since ""Interview with the Vampire"" vampires have been depicted in films as something hip, cool, and sexy. Recently the idea of becoming a vampire is like making a fashion statement or becoming a Scientologist. In ""30 Days of Night"" the vampires are nameless, cunning, animal-like bloodsuckers and far from mindless zombies (which have been more popular of late). Finally, vampires are restored to film as monsters to be feared and not as some sympathetic and alluring subculture.The film grabs you from its opening shot of a man walking through a desolate snow covered landscape away from an ominous boat docked in the ice and never lets go. Director Slade wisely avoids many of the seizure-inducing trappings of recent horror films. Sure, there are the prerequisite quick-cuts in the intimate scenes of carnage, but there are also haunting wide-angled shots and one expertly staged bird's-eye-view crane shot when the vampires first begin dragging people out of their houses into the street. While successfully adapting some of the great imagery from the graphic novel, Slade is fully aware that this is still a film and shies away from CGI and overly-stylized lighting and effects that would detract from the sense of realism necessary in a far-fetched horror film such as this.Slade also makes good use of his cast. Danny Huston is perfectly creepy as the vampires' leader. Josh Hartnett, who is typically miscast and emotionless, actually fits well the role of a wooden Sheriff of a remote Alaskan town. Ben Foster, who always overacts, is used effectively here in a bit role as an over-the-top Reinfield-like character who ushers the vampires' arrival in town. Melissa George is pretty and sympathetic as Hartnett's estranged wife. Like many serious horror films of recent memory (""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""The Descent"") the film attempts some character development that is often ""emo"" but never overplays its hand.Aside from being better directed and better acted than your run-of-the-mill horror flick, ""30 Days of Night"" is also fantastically gory. Decaptation aficionados will especially rejoice. Refreshing, too, is the way it takes its gore and action dead seriously. There are no silly one-liners or graphic sight gags. The characters are deeply affected by what they witness and what they have to do to survive. This is pure horror, and it's relentless.Yes, there are some missteps with the film's pacing and some huge leaps of logic in the amount of time that passes between events. However, for the shear originality of its central conceit, the intensity of the gore, and the haunting quality of many of its signature shots, David Slade's ""30 Days of Night"" is the most exhilarating horror film since Danny Boyle's original ""28 Days Later"" and the best vampire film since Francis Ford Coppola delivered ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" back in 1992.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the most effective horror movies I've seen in a long time,"""30 Days of Night"" is easily one of the best horror movies I've seen in a very long time mostly because everyone involved seemed to know exactly what it takes to make a decent horror movie. It's not obscene amounts of gore or monsters jumping out at the camera that make a movie scary. It's creepy atmosphere that makes a movie particularly scary, and this movie does a great job at creating the kind of atmosphere that fills the viewer with the kind of dread that so many movies fail to achieve. It's not perfect, but it's still better than just about every horror movie I've seen since ""The Descent"" (which also relied on a creepy atmosphere to fill the viewer with a sense of dread and hopelessness).This movie is set in the small town of Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost town in the U.S. Because it is so far up north, there comes a time every winter where the sun doesn't rise for 30 days. The fact that this translates into a month without sunlight attracts a group of vampires who attack the town and spend the month feeding on its citizens. Eventually only a handful of humans remain in town, and they must survive the month without starving, freezing, or being killed by the vampires. It's a fairly simple concept, yet the director makes it work incredibly well. There is a sense of dread and hopelessness that permeates this entire film. Barrow is a town that appears to be cut off from the rest of the world. It seems to be surrounded by a sea of white on all sides, and the citizens seem to be stuck in a state of depression. Barrow seems to be the worst place in the world to be, and that's before the sun sets and the vampires show up. When the vampires do make themselves known, that sense of isolation and hopelessness turns into a feeling of dread that doesn't go away. One really gets the sense that there is no escape for the small group of survivors. This feeling is made all the more real by the long periods between the vampire attacks. Normally I consider long periods where not much happens a bad thing, but here it works in the film's favor. We may not always see the vampires, but their presence is always felt. At any given time in the movie one can see blood splattered onto snow and hear the distant screams and occasional gunfire of yet another one of Barrow's citizens getting killed, and it's easy to get the feeling that any of the main characters could be the next to die. The vampires themselves are also unlike any we've seen in movies for some time. They aren't the kind of seductive and charming vampires that seem to show up in every other horror movie. These vampires are feral, ruthless, and sadistic, with sharp crocodile-like teeth and bloodstained clothes. There's nothing romantic about them or their actions; they just want to kill people and drink their blood. It helps that they get far less screen time than the human characters; normally we only see them as shadows in the background stalking their prey. When they do attack, it's incredibly vicious and horrifyingly violent (the first large-scale attack on the town is a particular highlight of this film). This viciousness adds to the hopelessness and vulnerability of the humans while making the vampires seem like some of the scariest movie monsters to come along in a while.If I can find any fault in this movie, it's that the ending seems a bit contrived and cliché. It doesn't take too much away from the movie though; to complain about it is really nitpicking more than anything. Overall it's one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time, and easily the best vampire movie to come along in years. I would definitely recommend it, especially since it's a good alternative to the endless ""torture porn"" we've been seeing from this genre for the last few years.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A good vampire movie, but the feeling we get is that the end result could be one of the most amazing in recent times, but some flaws are visible","30 Days of Night is an adaptation of the comic written by Steve Niles with art by Ben Templesmith which is published by IDW since 2002. What Steve Niles did was to gather stories and legends that are common knowledge to perform an original story with great potential for both comics m (original media), as for the others since the idea would work perfectly well also in sitcoms and movies (how this adaptation). All we know for certain locations in cities, especially the poles with the same characteristics of constant cold like Alaska, the sun appears and hardly at certain times when the days are longer with large periods in the dark. We also know all the fascination vampire stories have always generated at all. The entire atmosphere of mystery and fear at these beings is something that provokes curiosity and attraction. And the idea of getting thirty days isolated in the cold, without notice, in the dark, trying to survive amidst vampires is, by itself, a situation that creates fear. Was ready the scenario of what could be one of the most terrifying movies and interesting movie. The film is competent, but suffers at some points.Barrow, Alaska. During the 30 days of the local winter the city is in complete darkness. Almost all city residents decide to leave there these days, leaving for somewhere less depressing and frozen. Those who stay have to await the return of the sun and life. Something changes, however, when a stranger comes to town and announces that the end is near. They gradually falling energy, telephones, internet and all sorts of communication with the outside world. Initially interpreting such acts as acts of vandalism, the local sheriff, Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett), deals with his own personal problems such as cancer of her grandmother (Elizabeth McRae) and teenage brother Jake (Mark Rendall). Additionally, to deal particularly with the recent separation from his wife, Stella (Melissa George), who was for him to refuse to have children, even with both still harboring feelings for one another. When the officer and the other residents realize what is happening, it is too late. Only decapitation or ultraviolet radiation can deter the creatures. As a direct confrontation is almost suicide and the sun will not rise for the next thirty days Barrow, what remains for the group of survivors led by Sheriff's hiding until dawn.The adaptation was written for the screen by Stuart Beattie, Brian Nelson and the actual creator of the comic Steve Niles, which certainly contributes greatly to the work keep the main feature of the comic. The writing team can better explain some ideas of comics and there are no problems when it is wisely discarded in film, for example, the sub-plot of vampire hunters who comes from New Orleans. Spare, so more time to develop the drama of the city and the characters. Another point is the protagonist couple Eben and Stella. In the comics the two are very much in love, because in the movie they are separating. Surely this is a device used to enhance the final climax of the plot. And it works well, especially since the development of the other characters is poorly performed.Sam Raimi, who directed the horror classic The Evil Dead (1981) was very interested in the project and even thought about driving it, but it ended up being just as a producer, passing the command to David Slade, I had only the excellent thriller Hardy Candy (2005) on his resume. In his first work, Slade actually managed to create a constant atmosphere of tension with few resources, scenarios and focusing dialogues and actions in almost two competent actors (Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page).With a budget of $ 32 million, Slade is competent, but the feeling is that it is still the story could have been better explored. Maybe not the fault of the director who managed to create a great backdrop for the development of suspense, but mostly by script. The script does not work to present and create a bond with the characters the audience. Especially for a small group of people trying to survive the onslaught of vampires, this development that would make us care about the anxieties and dramas was essential. Even the protagonist couple Eben and Stella are poorly developed. We stayed the whole movie trying to know the real reasons that caused parted, and fail to see the chemistry between the actors. They end up looking like two more people in the group trying to survive and when you try to speak more of their relationship, always seems forced and out of place in the general context. Even the couple's friends in the film do not know exactly what happened in their relationship. This all undermines the very act of selfless Eben at the conclusion of the plot. Already the other human actors, are used only for issues narratives. The exploration of the personal dramas of the characters was essential to amplify the terror and the public more involved. Slade loses all chances to create an interesting drama amid suspense, from the plight survivors. Never see them struggling every day, that would make everything more realistic. What becomes more important is Eben's brother, Jake. The movie does not invest much in the suffering of the boy to see the death of a loved one, or during a violent act he is forced to commit. The character, however, appears to be recovered shortly thereafter.Vampires also arise only as the great villains bloodsuckers. Besides the characters practically limited to grunt and open mouth showing teeth, any question that addressed some of the secular history of the group is not even mentioned. 30 Days of Night also fails to follow the rules of their own world. Little is revealed about how vampires die, but at some point we deducting the only two modes are by decapitation or by ultraviolet light. At one point, a character says that they withstand bullets, but soon after they fall with a few shots. They feel the shots but not enough to be killed? Or are they dead? We cannot know. Sometimes they achieve speeding cars, while in others they cannot get a kind of tractor.The passage of time is also somewhat misplaced. Speak a few times even as missing until this nightmare is over, and when it is spoken there is a enormous amount of days between the actions of the film. There is a feeling that something is progressive. This spacing day is poorly explained. Virtually the entire first half occurs during the first day of winter, as residents look for ways to escape the attacks. Soon after the plot jumps seven days, revealing that the characters are still in the same place where they decided to hide. How to survive until then? Vampires stopped attacking? It is not natural to the audience as if they were gaps to be filled.Josh Hartnett and Melissa George not compromise even with little chance to build a relationship between your characters. Ben Foster can deliver a performance slightly above average as odd that announces the arrival of vampires. Danny Huston as the leader of the vampires, Marlow also has little to stand out, as well as his followers.Editing Art Jones is good, but at times when the group tries to hide the film's pace plummets, and the suspense gives way to boredom. But the action scenes interim know well with others and that feeling of monotony is largely forgotten at the end of the projection. Already the art direction of the double Nigel Churcher and Mark Robinse, and photography Jo Willems work hard to promote the construction of fear. The Snow White and the visual presence of vampires in each scenario because of the gloomy weather needed immediately. The sense of isolation from humans, the climate always night and look that resembles the one used in the comic is very satisfactory. The general plan air showing the initial attack of the vampires in the bloodbath contrasts with the white snow is very well directed.David Slade sins mainly not create anything new to the Vampires, just before reusing elements already used for humans. The camera shows Slade shameless massacres occurring in Barrow, and not excessively fast assembly appeals to the more violent scenes, further increasing the impact of the images. The violence and excessive blood eventually prevailing to the script that has several flaws. It is a good vampire movie, but the feeling we get is that the end result could be one of the most amazing in recent times, but that just ended up being a good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Humorous to the Desensitized,"This movie centers around senseless violence with little character attachment, which means if you've seen any horror movies in the last two decades is not very new.BUT This movie was interesting for three main reasons.1) The violence is excessive, funny, and usually the best parts of the movie (in that Bruce Cambell kind of way).2) There's no boring/forced emotional moments like 90% of Hollywood movies. It avoided cliché by seeming like its about to have this big emotional and moral moment after someone gets killed or the main characters bad relationship gets brought up. But then it cuts right back to the horror and violence. Right then, you could hear the audience let out a sigh, clearly bored of THAT formula.3) The settings and premise. The town looks great and being completely cut off from the world with 30 days of no sunshine adds a great atmosphere and tension.As for the actors, its the standard Hollywood mix. I found Josh to be decent (nothing special) and his ex-girlfriend was annoying and unattractive.Besides that the movie has the standard mindless filler actors who do the really obvious stupid ideas like yelling in the streets.To get right to the point, you'll get a good laugh and it's above average for its genre. Would I pay to see it again? Probably not but I'm happy I got free tickets to see a private screening.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Conventional Vampire Flick with a Few Twists,"There's nothing new about this vampire film. It's your basic vampire/zombie film about a group of townspeople making that familiar last stand with the usual bittersweet ending. But this was what we came here for, wasn't it?Anyway, sure, these vampire/zombie films have been done before many times, but I'm a sucker for them and can probably see many more for years to come. Still, this film could've been done better.First of all, it just took too long to see the vampires. We have to wait about 30 minutes of setup and dialog to get to them. Now, we all know this is a vampire movie and if you're gonna keep us waiting to see them, there'd better be a good reason. And there wasn't. All that waiting and listening to dialog was just to describe a background that was clear from the start and to develop characters who we ended up not caring much about anyway.But once the vampires showed up, things got more interesting. Visually, anyway. Otherwise it's just the usual monsters running amok killing everyone. It was just cool to see heads being decapitated. I don't think I've ever seen so many heads being cut off in such graphic detail in one film. Pretty neat. But it could've been gorier had the wood chipper been used more. It was shown early in the film as if it was going figure prominently in the ending, but, unfortunately, it didn't.The editing of this film was strange. Or perhaps it was the direction. People would just appear or disappear without much explanation. It was like in one scene someone was wondering ""what happened to so-and-so"" and in the next scene that so-and-so simply just reappeared without explanation of what happened in between. Then there was this other scene where the sheriff and his friend had to break from the group to look for another hideout. They struggled to get there as they fought vampires along the way, but they finally succeeded. And in the next scene we saw the rest of the group just appear in the new hideout. They were just sitting there calmly as if they had found safer path or had just been teleported somehow. Pretty odd.The ending was a conventional vampire movie ending, but with an interesting twist.As vampire movies go, despite the slow start, odd dialog, characters I didn't care much about and some strange editing choices, this film had enough gore and suspense and an interesting ending to keep me entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best horror movie in years,"I don't know how this slipped under the radar. The main character is shown to be making hard choices before the first vampire even appears and every scene, practically, is a moral dilemma with great play on viewer expectation. The performances, writing, editing and shot selection all are excellent. Josh Hartnett and, to my surprise, Ben Foster (who knew he was a great actor even before Rampart) were incredible.I hate to say this because it pisses me off to no end when I hear it from fans of The Matrix Reloaded and The Fountain, but the haters seem to be thick. Every negative review I read demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the vampire myth (particularly a confusion between the semantic and syntactic aspects of genre).The writers of this film understand vampires. The vampire is pure narcissism incarnate, utterly lacking in empathy, sympathy, and mercy; and the film expresses that through action and dialogue to an extraordinary degree. Vampires lack what makes us fundamentally human, and the horror genre itself is about the delineation between human and monster. Where this movie really shines is in how it shows that we have to make hard choices and become monsters ourselves to fight evil. I rank it right up there with Dracula.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is a good vampire horror! Yes, we can!","The movie is not a complete masterpiece, but it is damn close. It features cool vampires attacking an isolated town, people fighting for their lives, scenes with actual emotional impact and lots of blood.

If this film made me immediately jump to the computer and start the sequel to see how it continues, the other made me watch it in fast-forward.The film gets a little of that Swedish movie Låt den rätte komma: the vampires are human-like, but not human; they are strong and fast and deadly; they do not glitter, wear fashionable clothing or have other interests than drinking your blood. In a sense it is similar to Near Dark as well.Bottom line: There are holes in the plot and it doesn't really try to create a vampire mythos at all. But that is a good thing, as it adds to the gritty, visceral feel of the movie. It is the proof that vampire movies can be good! Therefore my recommendation is that you should not miss this film, but definitely avoid the Uwe-Boll-like sequel from 2010.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 stars of rate,"Just sing along with the quire here and keep telling how good this is , actually this movie is little in the shadow, no one speaks about it and you just never hear anything about it even when people speak about vampire movies, its so underrated its insaneDanny Huston is magic in this movie, looks just as a vampire should, just love the language they have with eachother and the way they look , perhaps the screamings can be a bit annoying but also suit in many timesThe only weak link in this movie is the ending, not quiet what I hoped for and felt a bit sloppy written, but the rest is top notch, great story and well done production, acting aswell, this is a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Solid and Underrated Vampire Flick,"Pretty simple and straight forward plot here - Alaska, wintertime, sun goes down for 30 days, vampires come out, everyone in the town gets eaten. Roll credits...basically. Oh yeah, and Josh Hartnett.Overall, this one is a good addition to the vampire genre with some pretty primal looking vampire design, tons of blood, and a good dose of human drama to round things outActing is decent but one of the best parts of this is the cinematography - there are some really cool shots and angles used in this (theres a super engaging overhead tracking shot of a full-on vampire rampage that is done really well). From a technical perspective, there a handful of seamless transitions from steady shots during moments of calm to (a little) shaky when things get stressful and frantic. The general atmosphere is very moody and dark (i mean, theres no sun, so yeah) creating a brooding and ominous vibe.This is def a reco for the vampire fans out there - its fast paced, bloody, and moody. Check it out!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
That vampire sound... nice!,"Brutal violence. A good horror movie. It wasn't always ""realistic"" (30 days is a long time), but the vampires were nice. The language however made them a bit ridiculous.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just drink your blood and shut up!,"It is with day-glo irony that one character in ""30 Days of Night"" makes an offhand reference to cinema's penultimate bloodsucking actor, Bela Lugosi. While the original Universal ""Dracula"" remains the cornerstone of cinematic vampire lore, the way of the mythic creatures has gone into hyperdrive in the last few years, most visibly in the ""Underworld"" series. Yes, it seems that vampires just aren't that interesting anymore, unless they're screeching, howling, hurtling through the air at great speed, and outfitted with the latest in repulsive denture prosthetics.Director David Slade, who began his career directing music videos before graduating to features with last year's overrated ""Hard Candy,"" does an impressive job establishing a bleak visual tone in the small community of Barrow, Alaska. Throughout the movie, the chilly atmosphere was so convincing it kept an ice-cold grip on my spinenot since John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" has isolation been established with such bone-chilling desperation.""30 Days""attempts an alchemy on a stagnant movie monster with only marginal success, since the script (co-written by Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie, and Brian Nelson) really isn't up to snuff. We get a few main characters who are defined just enough (in admittedly cliché parts) to earn our sympathy, followed by maybe a dozen supporting characters who exist A) solely to be picked off; or B) recite monologues we couldn't possibly care about before getting picked off. A big no-no in horror films is trying to give bit players depth when their demise is nigh. In the meantime, a lot of the humans' actions are Fright Film 101 stuff, running the gambit from simple clichés (at least half the movie is spent asking who/what the vampires are) to the idiotic (grandfather flees hiding place, possibly blowing the other survivors' cover; grandson dutifully follows after, yelling after gramps). Similar territory was covered more intelligently, and with a keener awareness of genre convention, in Carpenter's ""Thing.""While Slade is very good at establishing setting and mood, his choices in technique can be jarring. There are at least a half-dozen cuts away from (and into) action that is given no specific setting, nor any real setup (an early ""home invasion"" scene that seemingly comes out of nowhere is a good example). Also indicative of the past decade of horror is an over-reliance on chaotic, ""Saving Private Ryan""-style edits whenever a vamp attacks, which is more disorienting than exciting.Now, I grant you, all of these qualms could very well be peripheral if the movie delivers on its blood-sucking baddies, but ""30 Days""' most glaring misstep (and it is pure, graphic-novel flaw) is in turning our gang of black-suited vamps into periodic philosophers who strut around like smug Goth kids with blood on their chins. Every time fang-king Marlow (Danny Huston) paused to deliver a subtitled line in his guttural vampire-language, I nearly rolled my eyes in disbelief. I kept thinking, ""You're ruining itjust suck your blood and shut up!"" The other vamps screech and howl and get the requisite ""snarling close-ups"" as they feast on some poor sucker's neck. Ho hum.While Josh Hartnett and Melissa George do an admirable job of propping up their underwritten roles (they're an estranged couple, and you know the rest), their efforts, combined with Slade's eye for visuals, cannot raise ""30 Days"" to the level of a modern vampire classic. No matter how it's presented, a plot about vaguely-defined characters holing up in buildings for an indefinite period is nothing new. Which is a shame, since ""30 Days"" clearly had the potential to set a new genre benchmark.5.5 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vampires with a difference,"As Barrow, the most northerly city in Alaska, prepares for the heart of midwinter when the sun won't rise for thirty days something strange is going on. Somebody has stolen and destroyed all the cell phones, killed the sled dogs and sabotaged the only helicopter. Then a stranger turns up and is arrested; he tells his captors that none of them will survive what is coming! Soon after the attacks start; most of the townspeople are lost but a handful, including the sheriff and his estranged wife survive. They don't know if other groups survived but they do know that if they are found they will almost certainly be killed.It isn't often that a film brings something new to the vampire genre but this does; these aren't the gothic counts seducing their victims or characters with grand plans; they are more like feral beasts giving into wild urges. In many ways this is more like a zombie film as they control the town, feeding on anybody who they catch. Similarly their appearance is scary; most of them have a permanent 'beard of blood' from where they have feasted on their victims. The isolated setting gives a claustrophobic atmosphere; the characters know they can't leave town as the frozen wilderness would kill them as surely as the vampires. As one would expect there are plenty of deaths, both human and vampire, these are varied and occasionally amusing in a dark way... they are also disturbing at times. The cast is solid with Josh Hartnett and Melissa George doing decent jobs as the sheriff and his wife; however Danny Huston impresses most as Marlow, the head vampire. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to this who prefer gory vampires to sparkly ones!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I liked the look of the vampires...,"Top be honest this was one of the better Vamp flicks I've seen, the vampires had an awesome look to them and really seemed more like monsters rather then made to look ""stylish"". If I had one complaint, they sort of were a bit ""overacted"", if that is even a real term. Too much ""lets look at each other and howl"" or move our mouths in funny ways I guess, I don't really know where I'm going with this but for some reason or another it got a little old/ goofy and got more laughs from the audience then anything. Blank stares or shadowed faces would have been more creepy then showing everything up front.I would say this is a mix of elements from 28 Days Later and some from Pitch Black, and while far better then the later (IMO), its just not as good as the former. There was a decent amount of good moments, but I can't really say it was one of the scarier movies I've seen. I had fun,but it also seemed to drag in some parts. I'll rate it a 8/10 for vampire horror flicks, but overall it would probably be more of a 6, so I just rounded it to the middle of those.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 Days of Night Later,"I saw this film in the theater when it was released. I was.expecting something epic, and got an ""all right"" movie. I mean, it's basically 28 Days Later with fangs. I revisited it tonight wondering if it could be more appreciated with time. Sadly, it just can't. The film is well shot, well acted, and a great concept. What ruins it for me is the vampires. From the silly look many of them have to the ""language"" they speak. It's just too much a product of its time. Had it been made twenty or thirty years earlier, it might have been something for the record books. Instead, it is an ""okay"" movie that is worth a watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is a masterpiece and a magnificent addition to the vampire genre,"30 Days of Night (2007) is currently available on Amazon Prime, Hulu and Pluto. I actually have this poster in my house signed by Steve Niles (comic book author). The storyline follows a small Alaskan town when a group of Vampires arrive on the first night where they go into 30 Days of darkness. Will anyone in town survive? This movie is directed by David Slade (Hard Candy) and stars Josh Hartnett (The Faculty), Melissa George (Hunted), Danny Huston (Children of Ben), Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma) and Mark Boone Junior (Memento). The storyline and concept for this is absolutely awesome. The vampire depiction is very creative and felt new age. The gore, use of blood and kill scenes are very good. The cast is very well selected and I loved the characters and their subplots. The film also has a nice buildup to the invasion and then kicks into high gear once the vampires arrive and has a realistic ending to make the film even more intense. Overall this is a masterpiece and a magnificent addition to the vampire genre. This is an easy 10/10 for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 Days Of Night A Decent Horror Thriller,"30 Days Of Night is a decent horror thriller with an interesting premise. The whole cast do an admirable job in their roles including Josh Hartnett as Sheriff Eben Olsen, Melissa George as his wife Stella Olsen, Danny Huston as the ruthless vampire leader Marlow, and Ben Foster in a small role as a mysterious stranger. Hartnett and George do a good job as the leads of the film desperately trying to survive the onslaught unleashed by bloodthirsty vampires in an Alaskan town where there are thirty days of night. A perfect place for these kind of creatures if they could ever exist anyway. Huston makes for a menacing Marlow. His role couldn't been bigger considering Huston doesn't show up as Marlow for a while and he doesn't have that much dialogue either. But Huston makes the best of the role he does have as the sadistic vampire leader. The same can go for Foster whose especially creepy as The Stranger but unfortunately his part in the movie is cut short. From the action which is pretty much non-stop, to the suspense and horror, 30 Days Of Night is an above average vampire movie with just enough bite, blood, and suspense that does have some flaws but the movie over all is an entertaining horror thriller. If you're a fan of these sort of films then I'm sure you'll enjoy this one as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What 300 was to action this is to horror,"To understand my analogy you have to understand first what 300 was to action movies. It was beautiful to look at if relatively comic bookish, full of action, some powerful moments, but overall a relatively nonexistent storyline and minimal character development. 30 Days of Night is much the same animal.The directing is nice. There are some great shots, some really intense sequences, and minimal cheesy horror clichés. The whole film has a bit of an overproduced feel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's very much like 300 or Sin City in that respect. It feels and looks very much like an action/horror comic book.I went into the movie without any real expectations and when I came out I didn't exactly feel let down, but I didn't feel like I had just watched something very great either. The most I could give an honest inquirer would be a big shrug. It was kind of a mix between 300 and Dawn of the Dead, 300 because of the overproduced comic-book atmosphere and the lack of a moving plot, and Dawn of the Dead because of the dark content and the gore.I can't help but feel like something is missing from this movie to make it really great, and I now believe that quality is realism. It all felt a bit like a long Spawn cartoon or something of the like. It was fun to watch and it looked nice, but it just didn't resonate. Perhaps that was the lack of character development, but to be fair, there are some really cool moments in the movie and I do recommend seeing it in theaters if you can so you can judge for yourself.If you like horror movies, check this one out, maybe you'll feel like they got it exactly right.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Underrated IMHO,"I have a big nostalgic connection to this film, as me and my wife (girlfriend at the time) went to see it in Time Square on a visit to NYC from the UK.We really enjoyed the film and thought it brought a fresh take to the genre, plus the audience participation from the locals added that little something we were not expecting. (Will never forget the whooping at various axe scenes)I've just recently watched it again with my son for Halloween season and found it really holds up, story wise and special FX, plus he also said he really enjoyed it.I've always wondered why this film is never really talked about as being any good, plus the ok'ish score it has on IMDB feels a bit low to me.All in all I'd definitely recommend this as a film that should be a Halloween season staple!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Real Vampires.,"This movie is one of the stronger vampire films out there. The tension builds while the characters are introduced one-by-one while strange happenings, accompanied by a stranger in town, start to occur. Then the vampires show up and they are not your typical bloodsuckers either. The vampires seemed kind of stylish in modern clothing but are very cunning and animalistic which made them creepier and especially nasty. The CGI was done very well because it was concentrated on just their faces making it easier for camera trickery and lighting to hide the effects when necessary. The heroes in the movie came in many forms and not just the obvious ones. The idea of an isolated town in a frozen climate was a nice change and the fact that vampires are cold blooded and ""undead"" actually made sense. The lighting was perfect, the weather and snow looked very realistic to the point of actually feeling the cold. The towns people do very well as scared sheeple as the monsters close in and feed or use them as bait, which was a nice touch. The violence is sometimes swift and neat and other times it's raw and chunky but it's never shy about how savage it is. The atmosphere was brooding and appeared very real in a way with no cookie-cutter cliché nonsense to ruin it. I think the ending may have swayed critics and viewers to down vote but I saw it as a well thought out finale.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dark, moody, stylish..IGNORE the haters","I didn't think i could get exited by watching a vampire movie ever again. All the greats have made fine use of the mythology, Francis Ford Coppola, Neil Jordan, Steven Norrington, Guillermo Del Toro and lets not forget one of the greatest F. W. Murnau.30 Day of Night, is a delightfully nasty horror, which has once again has wet my appetite to see those whom are fanged back on celluloid. These vampire's are just scary, no sexual innuendo, they are just plain beasts.The films Comic book origins are quite evident through the film, one of its main draw cards is that it looks beautiful, the cinematography is fabulous, the punchy electro rock score used is effectively scarce during the film, silence is the films most potent suspense weapon.The Cast is great, Josh Hartnet Putting probably the best performance of his career, but it's Ben Foster who really steals the show, I've never seen a actor possessed by their own character to that extent since Anthony Hopkins and Lector. Mellisa George is perfectly fine, i wasn't blown away, but Danny Huston was superbly Menacing, his presence in the film was foreboding.Now to the films few flaws, the amazing build up, that incorporated the mystery of what exactly was going on in the town was swiftly ripped away by full on carnage, this was a little distracting, but soon the suspense returned.I have to recommend this film, i don't really understand why people arn't liking the film.

30 days of moving,"30 Days of Night was horrible. One of the worst films over the year. I had high hopes for it, I mean Hard Candy's David Slade was directing, how could it have gone wrong? Simple. It was pointless and flawed in almost every aspect. If it wasn't for the good photography and camera angles then this film would've joined Captivity and Intervention as my only 1/10 films for 2007.30 Days starts off by telling you facts about Barrow, Alaska, how it's the northernmost city in Alaska and how once each year it is plunged into 30 days of night. Slade introduces you to the character's and tries to show you how each of them flawed in a certain way to make you have feelings for them, although whenever someone died I felt no remorse what so ever, in fact, if I could have, I would've started to sing Another One Bites the Dust in the middle of the theater.The thing I was most surprised by the though, was how shitty the script was. It was written by Steve Niles (The man behind the graphic novel), Brian Nelson (Hard Candy), and Stuart Beattie (Collateral). 30 Days had numerous scenes of corny lines and irrelevant dialog. The reason for the name of my review is because every time a new time card popped up Josh Hartnett would be the first to talk, and every damn time he did he'd say, ""We need to move."" By the end of the film they had moved at least 4 times I'm pretty sure.Most people who liked the film were using the defense that it was a.) really gory or b.) super scary. I can now wrong them. My response to 'a' is yes, it did have lots of gore, some of it was cool, but really, does gore make a movie a 7/10? My conclusion to 'b' is great I think, plain and simple the film wasn't scary at all. There's no sense of isolation because most of the characters walk around an attic making tons of noise while the vampires are supposed to be walking along the roofs. If they're so superior wouldn't they have an increased sense of hearing? I will compliment the film on one other note however, they did do a good job of making vampires look undead for once. The teeth and the eyes helped increase the intensity of some of the scenes, still though that's not enough to save a film. Save your money for this one.I give it a 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good Concept, Decent Storytelling","This is the story of an isolated Alaskan town that is plunged into darkness for a month each year when the sun sinks below the horizon. As the last rays of light fade, the town is attacked by a bloodthirsty gang of vampires bent on an uninterrupted orgy of destruction. Only the small town's husband-and-wife Sheriff team stand between the survivors and certain destruction.No, I'm not a fan of the comic book(s) and yes, I'm a fan of David Slade's previous movie, ""Hard Candy"". So was this a film as good as ""Hard Candy""? Certainly not. But this film is better than most movies with this genre (AKA vampire movies).What I think might disappoint fans is the slow beginning.Like usual horror movies, there always come a bloody prologue resulting to kills and gore. Well, this one does not. Instead, literally nothing happens in about 40 minutes, if you exclude the random scenes of animal and human kills.I like the set up and the slow beginning obviously wants you to get to know the characters but what you get is no less than other horror movies that start off the violence right away. So yes, I think that might disappoint horror fans out there.What's after that is your usual bloody kills, chases with the shaky cam, and some decent plot themes. What I like most from the movie is the cinematography and the look/effects of the film. This film looks beautiful. It makes Alaska look beautiful.What I also like are the scenes that had some tension. There are little but that's better than most horror movies I've seen because I seem to never get scared of anything. The performances by the actors/actresses are decent but nothing special.What I find annoying is that the movie takes place over 30 days, or nights. So if you're watching the film and when 40 minutes passed with ""Day 7"" on the bottom of the screen, it will mostly cause you to make a huge sigh. When another 30 minutes pass and says ""Day 17"" on the bottom screen, you might look at your watch. Yes, these things annoy me because it makes the movie feel slow. Just to remind you, this is about two hours long. Maybe they should've gone with ""12 Hours of Night""? Yes, there is lots of blood. Yes, the violence is relentless (some kills are off screen, though). And yes, the ending is so similar to one other vampire movie that I will not say, which is encouraging and depressing, I suppose. Horror fans might be disappointed with the slow beginning but will love the remaining parts of the movie. I just thought it was your above-average vampire movie, which doesn't mean that much.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Breath of Fresh Bloody Air for the Vampire Legend!!,"""30 Days of Night"" is a very welcome addition to the ranks of vampire movies. This one is strictly for horror fans, not for doily-draped gender-confused romantics dreaming of third degree hickies from pretty fanged lovers in New Orleans.The fun begins in the first frame, courtesy of the evocative setting, a snowbound town at the Northern edge of America. The only iffy moment comes with the introduction of Josh Hartnett as the town sheriff. Young and movie star handsome, he threatens to come off as unbelievable, like the Ben Affleck sheriff in ""Phantoms."" Hartnett, however, despite his young years, has the gravitas to pull off this role, and director David Slade gets masterful performances from all the fine actors in this film.Melissa George is scrumptiously beautiful. (Her mouth is so cute it should be patented.) She's also an excellent actress, who horror fans should remember from the recent (and highly recommended) remake of The Amityville Horror. With her endearing little girl face and keen talent for playing it straight under the most fantastic of circumstances, she's likable, sympathetic and totally believable in this role.What really sets this film apart though is its portrayal of the vampires. Someone obviously boned up on ancient vampire legends, because these are the most authentic movie vampires since Boris Karloff's ""wurdalak"" in Mario Bava's ""Black Sabbath"" 40 years ago.Speaking in a strange Eastern European tongue (Romanian? or Hungarian?) these creatures bear the remains of human personalities, but are purely evil; cunning and vicious and blood-stained, like vampires were before Bram Stoker introduced the ""new improved"" (i.e. sanitized) Victorian model and Anne Rice gussied it up even more.Fans of Kathryn Bigelow's ""Near Dark"" and John Carpenter's ""Vampires"" will appreciate the high action and body count. The story is a bit slimmer than either of those two films (it is based on a comic book, after all) but it's very atmospheric and suspenseful, with superb production values all around.The visual efx are topnotch, especially when they're subtle, such as snowflakes adding their magical luster to a scene. The special make-up efx (blood and guts et al) are completely believable, but aside from a few very graphic images and much spilled blood in the snow, are not as overwhelming as some overly squeamish reviewers have claimed.The cinematography is gorgeous, and is enhanced by the seamlessly integrated visual effects noted above.If you're in the mood for a nicely paced, well-produced, superbly directed movie that'll satisfy your craving for a dose of traditional horror, you can't go wrong with this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Could have been better, but still a good modern vampire flick","30 Days of Night is based on a comic book by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith which, like every other comic book, I haven't read. It's not hard to see why they'd turn this comic into a movie, however, as the chance for a brilliant vampire flick is clearly there; we've got a snow setting, coupled with one of nature's strangest happenings, and of course a pack of hungry vampires. Considering all these elements; it really does have to be said that 30 Days of Night is a big let down. While certainly not a bad film; it probably could have been a masterpiece. The plot centres on a small Alaskan town. Most people that live there are deserting; not wanting to have to withstand the upcoming month of darkness. Those that remain soon find that the fact that alcohol is banned during this time isn't there only problem; as the local sheriff notices a few strange crime reports, and pretty soon the town is at the mercy of a gang of bloodthirsty vampires, hell-bent on chowing down on everyone left in the town, before eradicating any trace of them being there. Only a small few stand in the vampires' way...One of the main problems with modern horror movies is flashy photography. I don't know who decided that not letting the audience see what is going on properly is exciting, but whoever it was should be hunted down and butchered by a gang of bloodthirsty vampires, being sure to remove to his head to prevent him coming back and inventing some other rubbish. Credit where credit is due, however; this film doesn't feature too much of it. Once the vampires are introduced properly, things improve greatly and the film reaches its biggest high towards the middle with an excellent massacre sequence. From there, it's somewhat reminiscent of George Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead, as we watch the survivor's hole up and band together against the impending threat. The film stars Josh Hartnett, who is not as misplaced in the lead role as I thought he might be. He's a bit too pretty to be the town sheriff really, but he gets into his role well. Danny Huston as the head vampire is the real standout here. One big problem with the film is that it takes place over thirty days, yet it feels like it could have happened in one night. It's obvious why they chose to do it like this...but it doesn't feel right. It boils down to a disappointing and silly ending, but most of the film is entertaining and gory enough to please most viewers. Overall, this is not as great as it could have been; but it's an above average horror film, and I recommend seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mediocre with massive issues,"A reasonably good premise, with the worst direction/script ever.It's almost irrelevant that they're spending a month in total darkness for the amount of things we see happening. Could've been a regular weekend in a nearly abandoned town for the same effect.We jump from day 1 to to day 8 then to 27 then 30.We never see them eating, we never see any natural progression in learning or intelligence from our protagonists, we also don't see anything approaching the same for the antagonists. If you're super strong super fast, have super hearing... it sure seems like they could have cleared the few houses systematically without hassle.Also their plan the entire time would've needed to include burning the town to the ground and destroying all the evidence (bodies), or woodchippering them in the machine. Without doing so, they would have been leaving a ton of evidence of very suspicious things.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very unique take on an old legend,"I am typically not a great fan of vampire films. However,this movie is a new take on an old legend. The setting is fantastic and what could be more scary than 30 days of endless night when you are besieged by vampires. These are not your fathers vampires,nothing seductive or even campy about these guys. They are what the vampire was originally supposed to have been..SCARY! I think of all setting..an arctic or Alaskan frozen,isolated area is a great stage for horror and suspense. Movies like Howard Hawks ""The Thing from Another World"" and its 1982 sequel ""The Thing"" use the same setting with admirable results. Even the underrated Stephen King mini-series ""Storm of the Century"" uses the same cold,barren and isolated setting to create tension,despair and hopelessness. The acting is average,if not slightly above,and the mood and lighting are very good. All in all a movie that made you crave a little more when it ended..and that is what all movies strive for. Although it could have had a few improvements and should have provided a little more background for the story(things sort of just go to hell all at once),it is most definitely a film worth a couple hours of your time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An OK movie,"30 days of Night was able to keep my attention for an hour and a half, but I wouldn't call it scary. Graphic, very full of blood and gore and enough raw violence to satisfy any horror movie goer, but nothing that isn't predictable. If you are a fan of vampire movies, there are some aspects one can see pulled out from other movies. (But since this was a graphic novel that was probably the artist's doing.) There are many unrealistic plot holes as well, that throw the watcher back into reality to go, ""wait, what?"" It has some redeeming qualities towards the end, but over all, wait for video, see it once, but not quite worth an investment for purchase.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Stupid, predictable, and really loud!","For those who say 30 Days of Night was a new and innovative vampire film, I have no idea why you'd think that. This movie has a pretty standard plot (really the same plot as Night of the Living Dead, except with vampires in Alaska) with boring characters and dialog, and with lots of violence.For my negatives, I'll start with the direction. I was glad that it wasn't filmed with a shaky cam. However to make up for that, it had this style where almost every scene was a close up on an actor's face. After about ten minutes of nonstop closeups, it got very annoying. The acting was not bad, but it was always too dramatic. Either the characters wait several seconds to answer each others questions, or the characters have close ups on their mouths to emphasize the drama of their lines. Again, it's an annoying technique. The characters were either cool calm, or they were a nervous wreck, there was never an in between with this one. Also, it was pretty annoying the scare tactics used in the film. The vampires run quickly past the camera and are loud then to scare the audience. But when they're coming up on people away from the camera, they're quiet (with the exception of their loud, extremely annoying vampire cries). These are the small things that bothered me.The movie itself was a really grueling thing to watch. The plot of the film is a creepy stranger comes into an Alaskan town. He's picked up by the local police and tells them somethings coming. Of course, he is correct, and vampires come into town, during the month of complete darkness. A small group of survivors (led by Josh Hartnett) find ways to hide out and avoid the vampires for 30 days. The plan of the vampires to eat a town in 30 days of darkness sounds like a great plan, except, apparently, they didn't think that this town only has few people, and half of them, they turn into vampires. So how does this group of several vampires (who turns into more vampires later) survive 30 days off of these few people...who knows? But they do. Why do some people turn into vampires in a matter of seconds, and some it takes days? Who knows. How did these creatures keep the blood on their faces in the exact same areas throughout the film? Who knows. And there were many more inconsistencies throughout.Aside from these problems, and the bad special effects, this had some good qualities. Some of the action scenes were interestingly shot, and even though there is no real reason to, the characters become somewhat likable. At times it feels like it might pick up, but unfortunately,, it doesn't.Overall, this was a typically average vampire film that wasn't very scary at all.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 107 mins. R for violence.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Visually magnificent, but lacking a little too much in plot","30 Days of Night as you can probably guess, is about just that. A town in small rural Alaska, the northern-most town in the US, experiences a phenomenon where darkness sets upon the town for an entire month, and leaves most residents scrambling to get out. But unfortunate for those who stayed, a pack of hungry vampires has found the town and decides they should get fed. And as the dead begin to outnumber the survivors, it becomes very clear that those who can stay alive need to wait out until the sun finally comes up.The sheer idea for the film, having the town being draped in darkness for a month, is nothing short of astounding. Yes, it was lifted and is based on a graphic novel, but compared to your typical vampire-related horror flick, it is quite the step up. And as the film sets itself up for the feeding frenzy, it really continues to breathe originality and a blazing sense of imagination. Some of the things happening may not strike you as being particularly relevant at first (or even, who would do some of these things), but as the film moves along, it just all feels so right. And with a very sombre and coked-out character only referred to as The Stranger (Ben Foster) making bizarre predictions of the inevitably obnoxious death scenes soon to come, the film really feels like it is going to jump past the clichés, the terrible American horror norm, and become something extraordinary and memorable.But then the film betrays itself. It takes far too long to set up the motivations of the main character, Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett), his separated wife Stella (Melissa George), and even more time on supporting characters like the burly Beau Brower (Mark Boone Junior). I just got far too restless, and even more so when I realized only a few of these characters would make it to the final frame of the film. Why should we care about these characters when these laggy scenes just do nothing but introduce their one-dimensional selves, and not much else? It felt kind of like overkill, but also like the film was trying to compensate for having such a great idea, but no idea as to how to flesh it out.And when the survival scenes begin to kick in, it becomes even more of a hit and miss. Some scenes are genuinely terrifying and suspenseful, watching the characters try to cope with decisions of wanting to save their fellow townspeople, or just sit in genuine fear of not wanting to be the next victim. But then others drag on with meaningless drivel about absolutely nothing. It just cannot find the balance it needs to survive this pitfall of the idea for the film, and just does not seem to want to attempt more than a handful of times to try and amend it. And do not even get me started on the preposterous ending, which seems ripped out of an entirely different movie altogether (sad to say, it is almost shot-for-shot intact from the graphic novel).But while the film does have its share of story and pacing problems, the scenes with the vampires attacking are just plain stellar. There are more than a handful of quick cuts, but the majority of the scenes involving them eating their dinners are stylistically beautiful. There are some shots that are just so majestic and so powerful, that one wonders if they are actually in the same horror movie, or if they randomly started splicing in some art-house horror. The tracking shots, the close-ups, the long shots, they are all here, and are all so brilliantly played that the style just takes anything the movie has going for it, and catapults it right into the stratosphere. And even as the violence gets even more senseless and even more graphic, you cannot help but watch in awe at the visuals captured by the camera (and by CGI). Their exquisiteness is enough to make me pray that other mindless (or near mindless) horror flicks take note, and start creating similar if not better visuals. The music is above and beyond top notch as well, giving the film a really heightened sense of style and intense violence (albeit, nowhere near as blood-soaked as I had originally assumed it would be).The cast, for the most part, is alright. Hartnett has seen better days, and for some reason, seems to be struggling as the lead here. Maybe he had something else on his mind? Some of the scenes he is in just do not completely jive, and when they do, there is awkwardness to all of them. I do not like to even imagine saying it, but it looked like he had more heart to show off in Pearl Harbor, then he does here. George on the other hand, does an infinite amount better, continuing much in the same way she did in the very poor remake of The Amityville Horror. She had an aura around her there that felt like she was above the material, and the same aura appears here. Foster, for his limited amount of screen time, does a great deal of delivering dread and despair for a few of the characters. I wish he had more scenery to chew.But it is John Huston, more of a classically refined actor, who owns as the vampire leader. He does not speak any English (he communicates in the vampiric language and through grunts and body motions), but that does not stop him from being almost downright terrifying. Seeing this guy at work was a real pleasure, and I just wish the rest of the film was as well done as his performance is.Nagging issues aside, 30 Days of Night is a decent horror film with aspirations of being better than it is. Watch it for the visuals, and forget about the plot.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
review for 30 Days of Night,"Picture this: when Alaska is plunged into darkness for 30 solid days straight, a gang of vampires rampages a small town. This is the premise for the movie 30 Days of Night, and a very promising one, I feel. It almost makes one wonder how it hasn't been thought of before. Vampires, according to popular lore, cannot be in the sunlight, so storming a town kept in utter darkness for a month seems a genius idea. The movie, however, based on the comic miniseries by Steve Niles, was a bit disappointing and did not live up to the great premise that it set up.The town of Barrow, Alaska, where the movie takes place, is so far north that once a year they experience a month of complete darkness, hence, 30 Days of Night. The movie begins with showing some members of the town leaving for the month, but many still remain, including sheriff Eben, played by Josh Hartnett. His estranged wife, Stella, played by Melissa George, misses the last plane out of Barrow and is forced to remain in the dark town for the month.The first scary character is actually not a vampire, but something almost like one. This mystery character, played by Ben Foster, is captured and kept prisoner in the town jail. He has a Southern-sounding accent that might have been humorous, if only his lines hadn't been so cryptic. But when the vampires are later introduced, this stranger seems harmless in comparison. I found the vampires to be truly terrifying. They spoke in a hissing sort of language, and were always covered in someone's blood. But despite the fact that the vampires kept me quaking in my seat during the film, afterwards, I realized that most of the scares in 30 Days of Night were cheap.For example, the scariest parts of the movie were when a vampire jumped out of nowhere, causing audience members to jump or shriek. The movie was also incredibly gory (it is, of course, a vampire movie, and this must be taken into account), but I felt like many of the jumpy and/or gory parts were only thrown in for the shock value, or the thrill factor. To me, the thought-provoking premise wasn't entirely backed up by the cheap scares. I wanted to be scared by plot development and scary concepts, not just blood and tension that something would pop out of nowhere.This is not to say that the movie did not scare me, however. I was fully terrified by 30 Days of Night. Horror aficionados might deem me a wimp or a sucker, and this may be true, but I believe that this movie would be scary for most people, if perhaps not for those select fanatics who can't be shocked. 30 Days of Night is a good movie for anyone prepared to be scared in a haunted house type of way, as opposed to a The Shining kind of way. But if you crave background information, plot, and character development like I do, you may want to skip this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I will keep this fairly simple,"There are few things that really stand out in this movie that I would consider a revamp (no pun intended) of the vampire horror film. However, this film would absolutely be a run of the mill horror vampire flick if not for a few contributing factors. First and foremost, the direction and cinematography were superb. It was very well shot. The Alaska backdrop just looks great on film and I commend David Slade for the atmosphere he brought into this film. Second, the acting was much better than most of these types of films. The vampires are brutal and played brutal. Josh Hartnett, in my opinion, played his part to perfection. Melissa George was great, as well as the rest of the cast. No one really hit a sour note with me. The gore in this film is awesome. I'm guessing that due to the dark setting of the film, the cgi wasn't blatantly obvious. There were some really great death scenes that are worth the price of admission. The bad is what most people have been saying. They go to quickly through the days and you would kinda like to know how they survived those days not shown. The experience isn't really much new and I definitely could have done without the vampires shrieking all the time. The ending will divide people, but im guessing that most will lean to the side of dislike. Overall a pretty good film. Id say it's worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Descent Vampire Movie,"The film is set in Barrow, Alaska where for 30 days during winter the town is in perpetual night. The movie begins with everyone who doesn't have to be there leaving because 30 days without sunlight is somehow impossible to endure. Having grown up in Buffalo, I can assure you this is not true. So the movie sets up the town, depleted and cut off, vs. a troop of vampires, somewhat artificially but there you go. Initially the vampires run through the town killing everything in the their path. There's an overhead shot of this that is completely original and spectacular. I suspect that the director took it from a panel in the graphic novel but to film this shot is way more difficult than to create a static drawing.Anyway, from there on in it's the vampires vs. the plucky survivors and plucky they are. There's a bit of ""I wouldn't do that if I were you"" going on but that's just unavoidable in a horror film and it's kept to a minimum. In general the survivors act intelligently and most importantly believably as they try and last the 30 days until sunup. That goes a long way to keeping the movie afloat.The end offers a bit of twist although the final scene it is similar to Blade II.I would say that if you like this sort of movie you will not leave the theater feeling disappointed or cheated.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great Night-time movie,"i am 13 years old and i love horror movies,and this movie blows vampires out of the way,into a new generation. Everyone knows most of the actors in this movie, and this movie probably could keep you watching the whole 30 days. Shocking deaths and surprising ending. A true vampire flick from start to finish. Some of the most powerful scenes were the survival, the suspense was great and the actors where pretty realistic (i would've just ran away if i could). I could say so many more things about this movie and it's amazing style. (The plot was well planned out). The one question that will keep us going is where did they come from?",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good action, but boring characters who whisper every line","If I was basing my score entirely on the action sequences, 30 Days of Night would get a solid 7/10.Unfortunately, this movie is dragged down by dull characters. I didn't care what happened to any of them. If there had have been an even greater focus on the action, this would have been fine, but the movie seems to expect you to be invested in what happens to them.Also, everyone whispered most of their lines. Whoever thought that was a good idea? That doesn't mean the movie is more dramatic; it means you have to have the subtitles on to make out what they're saying.The dialogue was also pretty bog standard for a movie like this. It wouldn't have hurt the movie that much for them to speak up a bit.Really, the action sequences are what this movie did best. They're fast paced and gory like you'd hope for in a vampire movie. The soundtrack in these scenes are also really good. If this movie had have just been two hours of that, it'd have been so much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 days is a fresh view on an old theme,"After reading many of the reviews, both good and bad, well I took time out from my schedule, no Sunday night football, to go to the movies. My wife is not into horror films and my kids are just too young for this genre. I am not going to go into the storyline, just a quick review from a 30 something. Not a classic. It is a movie with some questions to be answered, but it has an overall good horror gauge. The Descent was probably one of the best suspense horrors in the last ten years and it did not leave a ton of questionable antics. The great thing about this movie is that is done with a serious tone, none of those cheesy one liners and the actors do a good job of looking scared out of their mind. The villains in this movie are convincing. We do not get to know a lot about them, but one thing we know for sure they are brutal. I recently watched 28 weeks later and compared to the first one, the 2nd one had some silly crap in it and was overall a big disappointment. This movie was a good movie for a matinée price. I don't think it was worth the $8 i paid, but overall I was not disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not based on a chewing-gum wrapper, thank God.","There used to be a time when movies had been based on novels. Then, when they ran out of good novels to adapt to the screen, they resorted to cheap dime-a-dozen novels. Then short stories, and now comic-books. I guess it's only a matter of time until big-budget flicks use pamphlets as their inspiration... Chewing-gum wrappers, too? Toilet-paper rolls?...Even worse, yet another vampire film.The good news, however, is that not all comic-book-based films have to be unwatchable pieces of childish Dreck a-la ""Spiderman"" or ""Ghost Rider"". The other good news is that this isn't yet another dreary vampire flick. 30DON is the best ever horror film with fanged bipeds, if we discount ""The Hunger"" which is more like a horror drama. Gone is the suave, cape-wearing, coffin fetishist who woos the thick, impressionable maiden with his outlandish foreign accent. That's about as scary as an episode of ""Will & Grace"".The third piece of good news is that the director of the legendarily asinine ""Hard Candy"" doesn't deliver rubbish this time around.These vampires aren't interested in chit-chat, their coffins are well out of the viewers' sight, and they never open their mouths simply to reveal clean, polished, white Hollywood dentures. The make-up is terrific, unusual, the fact that they use an unrecognizable language gets thumbs up too. An extra third thumb up goes for the leader of the vampires; for the actor who plays him so well, and his overall look and behaviour. He never snickers like the stereotypical blithering idiot baddie, and that's rare in such movies too.Sure, there's some nonsense, after all this is a vampire flick. The logic isn't all there, but the stylish direction, the visually impressive locations, and a fast pace make up for the flaws.I would just like to know why an Owen-Wilson-like pipsqueak such as Ben Foster gets cast in sci-fi (""Pandorum"") and horror films. I was kind of hoping that the days of midget-heroes (Cruise, Gere, Dorff, Slater) were coming to an end. Wrong again...",,Anonymous,Horror
Losing Their Heads,"As you have probably guessed, ""30 Days of Night"" is a vampire movie - which means it has elements of both terror and self-parody. It is very likely the year's best horror movie, coming from ""Hard Candy"" director David Slade. Nasty vampires methodically assault an isolated Alaskan town and theatre viewers rarely will find a moment to relax. Much like ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Phantoms"" there is a rapidly diminishing chance of survival in this world of perpetual darkness.Although vampire conventions are followed, Dracula-type wooden stakes and silver bullets are conspicuously absent. The film's gory visuals are not for the squeamish which is exactly what vampire movie buffs and fans of the original graphic novels will get off on. ""30 Days of Night"" captures the coolest parts of Steve Niles' graphic novel series on the big screen. Like the books it is filled with buckets of gore but manages to include a certain intelligence that fans of ""28 Days Later"" and John Carpenter's better movies are searching for but can rarely find. While some horror genre purists will be turned off by all the talking, there is very little actual character development and enough action and suspense for most everyone.There is even a geography lesson as we learn that Barrow, Alaska is the northernmost city in America, and even more isolated and alien during its annual 30 days of continuous darkness. During this period the vampires (who apparently have just discovered this vampire paradise) suck the blood of most everyone in the town. The exception being a small group led by Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and his ex-wife Stella (Melissa George), who must wait out the horrifying 30 days of night. The pairing of Hartnett (who has no discernible acting skills) with George (who is quite talented) could have been a disaster, fortunately neither part is particularly challenging so the skill disparity is not too obvious. And who watches these things for the acting anyway. Also fortunate is the casting of Danny Huston as the vampire leader, he sells his character (i.e. monster).Much like ""Day of the Dead"" and ""Jumanji"" the band of survivors do things to which the average viewer can relate. They raid a supermarket and hide in an attic. It's best to stay vague with even the setup for this movie because it takes so many turns, at first seeming to be one kind of horror film before events move the characters in other directions. The surviving neighbors fight back with some degree of success. Watch for the town outcast who uses ""bulldozers for bazookas"", in the style of Sigourney Weaver operating that forklift robot thing in ""Aliens"". . Screenwriters Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson craft characters that don't make stupid decisions and a plot that doesn't turn on unrealistic coincidences. Those who didn't read the graphic novels might find some of the intricate plot turns a bit too cerebral for a mindless night out at the movies and detailed explanations are hard to find. But at least the filmmakers aren't trying to insult your intelligence.It is nice to find a vampire film that is uncompromising in its violence and yet extremely subtle about its moments of self-parody (insert the Hartnell acting for a few laugh-out-loud moments late in the film). It's even nicer to find some effort put into realistic action sequences, not the fake fast cut nonsense that lesser directors use to mask their inability to shoot action scenes.Adding to the terror is having the vampires converse in a demonic language of their own (subtitles are thankfully provided). The vampires move at lightning speed but have little going for themselves in style or culture (there is no ""Underworld"" sophistication here). There are be-headings, animal violence, the slaughter of children, and a ""Gremlins"" inspired use of a snow plow. Get it on guys.Overall the film is well made, nicely filmed, and competently acted (even with the sometimes painful Hartnett factor). Obviously this sort of thing is not everyone's cup of tea but is great Halloween fare for those who get off on this kind of stuff.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been worse.,"So I ended up in a vampire movie. With Josh Hartnett. That certainly has all the potential for making one's blood boil and one's toes curl.Alas, it actually isn't such a bad movie. Sure, it's a vampire flick with a pretty boy as the star, but if you can get over that initial realization and the associated horror, and just go with the flow, there is a good chance you might enjoy yourself.There is some decent acting from a fairly interesting cast, there are some pretty scary and reasonably original undead, there are great visuals, obviously involving quite a bit of well-done gore, and even the script isn't all that bad. It's perhaps not an all-time horror classic, but it decent enough horror entertainment that could have been a lot worse.I even like the ending---some might find it a bit overly melodramatic, and it probably is, but it has original plot elements and also some nice visuals. Pretty good overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Fun Ride While It Lasts,"I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected to. The first two acts are great. It starts to drift into lameness during the third act, but trying to find a way to come up with a positive resolution must have been pretty tough. What makes this movie fun is the sheer hopelessness of the situation.Another plus is that the movie takes a little more time than usual to introduce us to all the characters and set up the premise. Horror movies frequently rush through the setup. This one lets the action tell the story -- we're spared the stupid character speech that tells us the who set up.The attention to story telling, combined with the dark setting, make this one a lot of fun. I just wish the ending had been stronger.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The vampires in this movie are - vampires,"There is no romance, drinking blood from crystal glasses and tenderly sucking blood from the neck of an aristocratic girl of angelic beauty, in this movie vampires are bloodthirsty beasts without much remaining free will in them, and as such they are very frightening. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good concept, mediocre execution","Vampire flick with a great concept: vampires invade Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost town in the United States, during the one month a year in which there is no sunshine. Josh Hartnett plays the town sheriff, Melissa George his ex-wife (I think) and Danny Huston the leader of the vampires. These vampires are the kind of modern movie monsters that aren't so suave as your classic vampire, but rabid, brutal, slobbering monsters. As such, director Slade applies 28 Days Later-like shaky-cam during the action sequences. That worked fairly well in 28 Days Later and its sequel, but is kind of annoying here. The film is actually pretty good at building a terrifying mood, and, despite the shaky-cam, the monsters are pretty scary. The heroes, on the other hand, are rather boring. The plot is basically your cast attrition model where a group of stereotypes gets picked off one-by-one. The film is condensed from a graphic novel, and I'd bet the source material is better. There are quite a few moments that felt underexplained, and though the film is supposed to cover a whole month, several days are skipped at a time and most of the action seems to take place in just a couple of days. I would still have probably given the movie a slight recommendation, but I thought the climax was rather silly.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pretty good.,"Allot better than I thought. Had some pretty scary scenes in there from time to time. Sorta took the 28 days later feel with the quick attacking zombies that come out of nowhere. Which I like. Those old movies with these blood craving Zombies walking along at 1 mph, while the victims always seem to fall down and lay there till the monster gets them, always seem fake and stupid. At least here, you feel general fear with putting yourself in these peoples places. Acting was pretty good. Good scary feeling with this nighttime/cold snowy feel to the movie. If I had to have a grief, its the same with allot of movies- the ending. More realistic way to end the movie was to have these zombies realize the sun is finally rising, but have Hartnett stop them from going into hiding, or wherever they came from. But, I can deal with that. 90 percent of the movie is a good solid scare-gore fest..",,Anonymous,Horror
Neat,"30 days of night for me is neither as good as and not as bad as some are saying, literally both sides are right at some point. Its an interesting and actually a good to watch vampire slasher styled movie (at least in my eyes). The best description of how it feels like is: ""undercooked but tasty"". Why is that?Firstly, this is a movie about a residentals of small town in Alasca trying to survive a whole sunless month while being trapped with a band of blood craving vampires, thats it, simple and entertaining plot with addon of some little side threads that do not bother in watching film at all. (and i like it).Simplicity is great,but not always, in terms of characters, 30 nights fails at bringing on screen memorable protagonist or at least villain, that are basicly doing nothing aside of the fact one is good and second is evil. This is a type of movie that actually needs a memorable characters that are more than ""i am a bad vampire, and this is a good human"", thats one of the mistakes that makes this movie not scary at all, and a bit souless, just climatic and gory (and i am an easy to scare guy).Acting is not bad, its just acceptable, but its not enough at least for 1-2 major characters to be great.Other major problems are weird and bloody action sequences that sometimes are just w-e-i-r-d and feel not the right way (not always),
but you just need to see it yourself to maybe understand my point.And music... Its a kind of movie that is desperately trying to bring memorable soundtrack and it does have problems with it. Sometimes there is to much of music or to much of silence, and when there is music, then its about to being forgotten instantly, basicly only a one of ending tracks is really fitting and just nice, no more.But the really best part of this movie is this one: its CLIMATE, it managed to be a really climatic and is quite memorable with its looks, it feels like an actuall isolated for whole month and covered in snow town in what something did happened, place seems very real, detailed, and the feeling of loneliness is present, costumes and makeups are also great, i would say that whole situation presented in the movie is veeeeery convincing.... A type of movie that at the same time disappoints you and overcomes your expectations, weird.I think you could give it a shot, i've enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good premise, good effects, good plot, good cast, AWFUL characters","It got to around the half way mark before I realised what had been bugging me all the way through the film. I pretty much sat thinking; this film isn't bad, so why aren't I excited or scared or willing the characters on? I finally realised it was because I didn't care about the characters in the film whatsoever. Now the idea is brilliant, the effects and make up are great, the cast is good and the script isn't bad, its just that the characters are so flat, I don't care what happens to them.I really wanted this film to be good, I'd heard a lot of people telling me that it was a great re-telling of a movie monster classic. However, because there is little establishment at the start and practically no development throughout the film, you're watching flat 2D characters walk around on screen for 108 minutes, without much rhyme or reason.If I were recommending vampire films to people, this would not be on the top of the list, I would much rather watch the likes of Dusk Till Dawn or Blade.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Solid,"This is an epic premise, well executed for what it is. The casting and acting is great. Much more of an action movie than horror to me. Elements of it remind me of ""The Thing"", which I also had some trouble getting fully into (I know, not popular to say around here).Action becomes very dense and hard to follow at times but overall is shot well. The atmosphere/sound design was probably the movies strong point in my opinion, as you feel it right away and it persists throughout the entire movie. Kudos for that.I'm just not huge on vampires, but I did think this was a different take on them and it felt fresh and inspired. It's just not something I would ever expect to be blown away by, but the movie mostly delivered what I did expect. This is the closest 7 to an 8 out of any movie I have watched recently, and I wish we could use fractions. Definitely worth watching!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good stuff,"I thought this would be just another horror zombie flick but as it turns out, it was actually quite a good movie. Yes, we've all seen the plot before but the 30 days without sun scenario actually gave the movie a big part of its realism. I get crazy enough during the short winter days so I can't imagine what your mind does to you if you don't see the sun for a whole month. The action is real and the survivors don't go to any extraordinary means to stay alive, they just used good old-fashioned group work. There were some good performance from the lead and it was nice to see Josh Harnett isn't just another pretty Hollywood face. The ending has a real nice melancholic twist to it.",,Anonymous,Horror
This is what vampires should be,Wonderful film! This is exactly what Vampires should be like. Mean hungry killing machines. I am tired of seeing Vamp films make vamps sexy.The acting was very well done and the lead actor surprised me in his role.

A Bloody Good Time,"The Good: 30 Days of Night is one of the most visceral, brutal vampire films I have ever seen. It takes a little while to get going, but once it does, the film really excels at tension and stacking the odds against our human protagonists.The vampires are the stars of the show here, and I can totally see why in 2007 (peak Twilight), this film was such a smash amongst bloodsucker fans who were tired of the creatures being the butt of every joke. I like that the film gives us subtle hints as to the vampires' social structure, tendencies, and norms without having to explain much. Also, of course, their brutality, cruelty, and misanthropy, which really puts them over the top as movie villains.Danny Huston is incredible as the main vampire (since referred to as Nosferatu by fans); I love how he straddles the line between human like and beastly. He has incredible screen presence too. Josh Hartnett is also a surprisingly good leading man. Yes, we've seen the salt-of-the-earth Sheriff a million times, but he does a good job with it. Also, Mark Boone Jr. Is so, so good in this movie. Definitely the film's biggest badass.What I really liked about 30 Days of Night is how after a night of bloody carnage and chaos, the film really slows down and becomes a tense cat and mouse game. And that final scene is so well done and gorgeous, it's iconic at this point.The Bad: The biggest issue with 30 Days of Night is the same issue with a lot of horror movies of this era: it can look quite ugly at times. There's a lot of bad editing and shakey cam, with takes away from the beautiful carnage. I feel like if it was made at a different time (like, now perhaps), we'd have a true classic that lived up to its source material.But the shakey cam can be so obnoxious at times, it honestly distracts from the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 Days Of Night: Genuinely Creepy,"Vampires, gore and Josh Hartnett. What more could you want? Well, that's what you get in 30 Days of Night. Hartnett stars as Eben, a sheriff living in the town of Barrow, which is annually plunged into complete darkness for 30 days. This is the perfect place for a gang of vampires led by Marlow (Danny Huston) to feed on its inhabitants for the month. Eben and his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) are forced to fight for their lives along with a group of survivors until sunlight appears again.Modern horror movies are usually just looking to make you jump but 30 Days of Night is genuinely creepy and scary. It manages to tap into the audience's element of fear and also makes them think of what they would do if in the character's situation, which is most common with zombie films. The scariness of the movie is because of the terrifying, not-your-typical vampires. These aren't the charming, handsome vampires we've seen a thousand times before but are merciless creatures that would tear you apart in a matter of seconds, strangely making them more believable.30 Days of Night is most definitely not for the weak-of-stomach. Once the vampires appear and start to feed, the gore kicks off with a big bang. The over-the-top amount of blood is necessary but it's shocking at some points, even for a vampire film. The most shockingly violent scene has got to be when a girl vampire gets axed in the neck twice.All of the cast give excellent performances, especially Hartnett and Huston. I really didn't think that Huston would be able to pull off a menacing vampire leader but after seeing him play the character I realise that he was perfectly cast. I do have one problem with Josh Hartnett and that is he doesn't really convince as a sheriff due to his young age.Brian Reitzell's music is the perfect score for 30 Days of Night. Consisting of mainly hollow noises, it sounds extraordinarily creepy. Also, the melody in the last scene is great.My favourite part of the film is the breath-taking aerial shot of the chaos brought by the vampires. Amazingly choreographed, it shows people running, shooting and being killed by the merciless monsters. It's really effective in that it makes you realise how fast they can take over the town.There's one scene near the end that I felt was very disappointing. I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen the movie, but it's the Danny Huston battle sequence. It was pretty pathetic after the rest of the film and I think it could have been a lot better.Despite that scene, 30 Days of Night is bloody brilliant. I give it 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Above average acting for a Vampire slasher flick,"I saw the movie with high expectations due to all the hoopla amongst fans of the vampire genre and horror movies overall. I found that I enjoyed the movie for what it was a little bit more during the 2nd viewing. I understood the ending a bit more, some people might not like the ending, but I'll leave it at that.Acting by Hartnett and supporting cast was satisfying and enough for integrity's sake, but the true stars were the ghoulish and demonic looking vampires who showcase some super speed and agility in this film. The make-up is astonishing, and jaw dropping. I loved the rubber suits from Underworld, but this is just twisted stuff. There was good tension and the vampires made for an imposing looking bunch and even a bit disturbing for that matter. Gone is the eloquence and vanity and here you will see a whole new vampire, sort a vampire/zombie mix, but very intelligent and even philosophical at some times.There are no cheap jumpy scenes here, and gore is held to a minimum until the end. Director David Slade did a decent job, nothing spectacular. He had big help from the big B movie budget and beautiful atmosphere created by the expansive set of a whole town. I just thought Slade used some western film noir and could have done a better job with some pacing elements of the plot.The end will leave you with some questions and some will say you are left hanging at the end and it is likely that another sequel will be produced shortly since this film was successful in box office. There is no doubt that you will remember this film for a while after seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but could have been even better!","""30 Day of Night"" clearly has an interesting premise and is made with love and care and it even has Sam Raimi as a producer. Once you get past the unique look and behaviour of the vampires, you are left with an interesting survival horror that makes you care for it's main characters and keeps you interested in what will happen next. However, I found the movie extremely reliant on jump scares and brutality to convey horror, which, of course, doesn't work. That way, you are left with perfect moments of tension that culminate more in action, rather than in horror elements. All in all, I recommend the movie to both casuals and horror fans alike. It's definitely above the average and can provide an entertaining time, but is in my opinion held from greatness by it's approach to horror. But then again, at least the vampires don't sparkle in this one and are actually evil and tortured bloodthirsty demons, so that's a plus... 7.5/10!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
bloody anemic,"Once again, a big-name horror film, but in the end rather a failure. But you could have guessed from the name-dropping, ""produced by Sam Raimi"". In this context, another mediocre film.I don't know the comic, but the material doesn't offer much. Accordingly, the focus is on the visuals. While the dark images seem quite stylised, the actors remain pale and the vampires completely without profile. Nothing new in terms of effects and ideas, on the contrary, memories of other films come up again and again. But unfortunately only of popcorn works like Blade and Underworld.Conclusion: no story ala Bram Stoker, no atmosphere ala Nosferatu, no humour ala From Dusk Till Down, but a copy of ""modern"" bloodsucker films.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid vampire movie.,"This is one of the better vampire movies out there.For 30 days and nights an Alaskan town is without any sunlight, which attracts a bloodthirsty gang of vampires.Starring Josh Hartnett (Lucky Number Slevin, The Faculty) as the small town sheriff.The vampires are depicted great with sharp teeth and long sharp nails. They do speak their own language and look somewhat distinct from humans. They have plenty of screen-time and you see them clearly as opposed to movies where the monsters are confined to the dark parts of the movie only.This is not a slow-burner and builds up tension pretty fast and holds it to the end.

Well done !! It is refreshing to see a vampire film that doesn't shy away from violence and that doesn't dwell on anything that can be even remotely construed as hokey. A new cinematic creature, 30 Days of Night's antagonists are ultra scary with their deformed appearances and their mercilessly gut-wrenching killing sprees. They speak in their own demonic language and have super human strength and speed, making them a Michael Myers fashioned juggernaut. High-pitched shrieks, blood-soaked visages and razor-sharp fingernails complete a frightening design of this force to be reckoned with.What impressed me very much, was the ending of the movie that was pure and simple stunning !!

"Wasn't bad, but needed better direction","A fairly original take on vampires given the drivel that's been passed out for the last several years (Dracula 2000, anyone?). Some decent scares, creepy ambiance, and surprisingly good acting (I generally despise Josh Hartnett, but he really didn't suck). The casting was typical Hollywood young & beautiful. I thought they missed an opportunity to show some new faces, especially native Alaskans/Innuits.What I think keeps this from being a top-tier horror flick is the pacing. It just didn't flow well. There was a missed opportunity to highlight the isolation, claustrophobia and tedium of the character's situation, something nailed perfectly in the film's obvious progenitor, The Thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Day for Night,"Vampires invade a snowbound Alaskan town during a month of complete darkness in this horror movie from 'Hard Candy' director David Slade. It is a pretty nifty idea (where would be a more appropriate place for creatures of the night to feed?) and Slade sets up the movie well with lots of uncertainty in the air before it is made clear that vampires are afoot. Ben Foster is delightfully sinister as a stranger in town who predicts the vampire plague and the icebound vistas appear appropriately ominous. Despite such promise, the film falls apart as it progresses because none of the characters are defined beyond broad stereotypes and none of the actors (Foster aside) have the charisma to render their characters relatable. Setting the film over 30 days is problematic too. It is hard to keep track of time and without scenes set aside to show the characters sleeping, eating, etc., it feels like the whole film has occurred over two or three days - not ten times as many. Most disappointing of all though is the highly repetitive nature of the film. With limited characterisation, everything basically amounts to one vicious attack after another, all of which are filmed in such a frenzied manner that it is impossible to keep track of what is going on. The film does at least recognise the irony of the premise and what one character says early on, ""we live out here for a little freedom"", echoes throughout.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Has its moments, but still a disappointment","30 DAYS OF NIGHT came highly recommended to me by some friends whose opinions I respect, so when I brought the DVD home from the video store I was excited to see what the box cover promised was ""one of the best horror films of the decade,"" or words to that effect. Unfortunately I eventually found myself disappointed by 30 DAYS OF NIGHT. I will say that I love the concept - a horde of vampires descending on a snowbound, remote Alaskan town just as the sun sets for a month - and the first half hour or so of set-up was excellent (as the unseen vampires methodically destroy every possible escape route for the puny humans still in town). The vampires were also totally bad-ass, which was a pleasant surprise (too many vamp films these days try to go the Anne Rice route and make them sympathetic, romantic, misunderstood creatures -- screw that, I want my vampires to be savage killing machines!!) But once the vampires attack and the real Monster Mash begins, the film fell apart very quickly for me. It's fun while the bloodsuckers are running around causing chaos, but there are far too many scenes where the surviving humans, after escaping to a new hidey-hole, have conversations like ""NOW where do we go?"" that kill any momentum that has been built up. The film doesn't skimp on gore, though, so it gets pretty major points for that; but overall 30 DAYS OF NIGHT seemed cobbled together from a bunch of spare parts. If the pacing had been tightened up a little in the editing room we might have had a classic on our hands; as it is, 30 DAYS is worth a look but not a must see. A shame.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Count Crapula of the Arctic,"A dark and nasty force descends on the isolated town of Barrow, Alaska, in the movie 30 Days of Night, and if you thought it was a horde of bloodthirsty vampires you'd only be half right in this paint-by-numbers denture drama that's heavy on the red corn syrup and devoid of much else.Heralded by some as the movie that puts the fright factor back in vampires after TV shows like Buffy and Angel turned them into lounge singers, crime fighters and less-than-threatening freaks of the week, 30 Days of Night did little more than vamp my ire at the Hollywood hype machine for marketing a fairly pedestrian big budget B movie as a new and innovative twist on a somewhat forlorn horror genre.Josh Harnett stars as the uni-browed sheriff of this small Alaskan outpost, isolated from the rest of the state by a lack of roads and inaccessible by sea or (inexplicably) air during the winter months when the northern sun dips below the horizon throwing the town into the titular month long darkness. Thus the stage is set for an all night buffet as a boatload of vampires arrive at sundown and begin draining the town dry.Based on the graphic novel miniseries by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, 30 Days of Night teeters dangerously close to comic absurdity at times, particularly whenever the vampires communicate using a subtitled language that makes them sound like Slavic Chewbaccas with cleft palates. It's pretty hard to be scared when you're holding back the giggles as the lead baddie (Danny Huston) barks out something that sounds like ""ack wack bubba-duck bokay"".Director David Slade does a good job trying to keep the story moving, however somewhere along the way, maybe in the screenplay or editing stage, what little that was interesting ends up being given short shrift in the quest to infuse the plot with action.The enigmatic and talented Ben Foster, last seen chewing up the screen as psycho gunslinger Charlie Prince in 3:10 to Yuma, is wasted here as a mysterious stranger (seemingly the vampire ship's human captain  it's never explained) who wanders into Barrow with the bloodsuckers on his trail.The result is a film that coalesces into a sort of Northern Exposure meets Night of the Living Dead, with little of what made the latter so terrifying, unless you consider three inch fingernails, bad dentures and blood smeared faces terrifying. In fact, this film contains none of the inventiveness, terror and interesting characters of Near Dark, the brutal 1987 Kathryn Bigelow vampire movie to which some are saying it shares the mantle of genuinely terrifying vampire films.Yes, a pale ""horse"" truly does ride into Barrow, Alaska, however in this case the pallor is that of boredom and a poorly realized story, and nothing more.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
113 Minutes of Disappointment,"30 Days of Night113 Minutes of DisappointmentTotal- 4.4 out of 10Sound- 7/10 Vision- 4/10 Design- 5/10 Acting- 3/10 Story- 3/10I love horror movies in general and specifically I enjoy vampire and zombie movies. From The Lost Boys, to I Was a Teenage Vampire, to Dracula with Bela Lugosi and the Hammer Film version with Christopher Lee, I like vampire movies. When I first saw the trailer for 30 Days of Night, I was excited for it since the premise is very original. After I thought about it, I'm surprised it's not been done in either a short story, novel or a movie previous to the graphic novel in 2002 ever explored this interesting and genre defying concept. I went to the theater excited to see 30 Days of Night. Don't get me wrong- I am more than willing to check my suspension of belief in the theater lobby before a movie- any movie, but if a movie is just too much it ruins the movie for me as a viewer. That's what happened with this movie.30 Days of Night is probably one of the most disappointing I've seen in a long time, even with its new twist on the clichés of the vampire in films. Considering that David Slade directed Hard Candy, one of the most original movies in years that makes this movie doubly disappointing. Overall, the film has so many holes and ridiculous inconsistencies in the plot and story at the most basic levels that it becomes difficult and tedious to watch. One thing on the check list for me was that all these people are in Barrow, Alaska which is 320 miles north of the Arctic Circle, and you never see anyone's breath at all during the movie? I didn't care about the vampires or for the people trying to survive the vampires since you never really get to know much about either group on any kind of level since there was no real character development. Most of the human characters are little more than stock horror characters waiting for their chance to get killed by the vampires who never speak and never seem to clean up, apart from their leader who speaks in an unknown language. The gore and the violence never stops in this film and that seems to be the point of the film more than anything else. The last third of the film simply was ridiculous and totally unbelievable, leading up to an ending that made me shake my head in disappointment.Technically, the best part of the movie was the make-up for the vampires which was very impressive and different. I did not like the herky-jerky, shaky hand-held camera which began every time there was an action sequence, that's just awful in general since you really can't see what's happening with the fight since the camera is shaking around. The shaky cam wasn't too bad with this movie, as compared to many other recent movies, but it was just another distraction. It seemed like half of the shots were either close-ups or 3/4 shots and in the beginning there was a bad two shot that just was annoying. There was one interesting but far too short shot of the vampires as they began their attack on the town. The music complemented the film and the sound effects were particularly good- I even heard the Wilhelm a couple times. The design and costuming were fine and were quite passable.30 Days of Night is a great idea but a slightly below average movie. There were too many problems with the movie for me to just sit down and enjoy it. Wait for the DVD or to see it on Cable if at all. Better yet, watch either version of The Thing, which 30 Days of Night seems to have copied a little from.",,Anonymous,Horror
"ehh, could have been better, could have been worse","Set in Barrow, Alaska, this next-generation zombie/vampire flick is about a strange group that visit during the month of darkness to terrorize the town. Ben Foster is once again chilling in his role (much like his stellar performance in 3:10 To Yuma) and the rest of the cast does a good enough job to not completely ruin the movie. The far north setting is kind of cool but the small village gets a bit stifling after awhile. The story gets very repetitive, is a bit shallow, does not develop characters, and is lacking in background explanation. This can work to a movie's advantage sometimes, like in The Strangers , but this method doesn't work well in this case. Certain special effects are not very appealing, such as the creatures faces and the last scene with Josh Hartnett and Melissa George (you'll have to watch to find out). This movie is best relegated for Halloween or a full-moon night when any decent horror movie will do.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 Minutes of Film,"I have a mixed opinion on this film. I liked the plot and all the scenes where the vampires were present. That accounts for my summary title. What I like most about the plot is that in most vampire movies the victims only need to hold out until dawn. This film had the unique plot of having to survive for a month.The vampire characters were great and the unique language they spoke added to the horror by further dehumanizing them.Unfortunately, the human actors didn't fare as well. In my opinion Josh Hartnett is equal on the actor evolutionary scale with Keanu Reeves. I don't have a higher opinion of the female lead Melissa George either. Most of the other ""human"" actors were of the same caliber.Perhaps Bill Pullman & Laura Linney in the leads would have improved the flow of the film.This movie could have been so much better than it is, but is still an entertaining horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good movie that uses a well-known beat-down type of monster,"My problem with vampires is that they're already out of fashion. 30 Days of Night tries to revive them and almost succeeds, but a few choices lessen the impact of this film's vampires.One such choice is that these vampires have their own language. They speak in this one language that sounds like a bunch of disjointed syllables. ""Tu kat ak mi ta lak."" Them talking is funnier because of their appearances. I can see that the producers wanted to make the vampires look like gargoyles, frowning features, and in part it's a terrifying appearance, but something about them always having their mouths open makes me laugh - I've always thought that people who have their mouths open all the time have a goofy face.About the plot, 30 Days of Night portrays the events that led to the destruction of Barrow, Alaska, by the night beings and the acts of survival of a group led by Eban, the sheriff of the city. They need to last 30 nights, the long Alaskan night. I see no downsides to the overall plot, a good and powerful story about survival and love in the face of inevitable evil.A good movie for lovers of the horror genre. While not groundbreaking, the acting and story are good enough for a recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good god...please say no,"I felt the need to enable an account in order to respond to my now realized utter indifference to the money I earn. Now...I was a little biased in that I am a fan of the comic. Keeping that in mind I had no anticipation of this ""motion picture"" bearing any resemblance to said book as the direction was not helm-ed by chris nolan or frank miller...the only directors/producers seemingly capable of translating a comic with dignity to the big screen. However...what is beginning to puzzle me is the following: to the best of my knowledge for something to be mediocre it has to be average. A ""C"" were we in high school. Now answer me this...HOW CAN SOMETHING SO F'ING MEDIOCRE BE SOO F'ING BAD? The plot, which I won't ""spoil"", seemed to be comprised of every generic device which are generally reserved as filler until a piece of effects-laden brutality wow the audience and make us giggle with sick delight and munch popcorn. I spent more time picking corn out of my teeth than taking mere moments of enjoyment from this trite excuse for an adaptation. It breaks down into several key components of suck. 1. Josh Hartnett is utterly incapable of emoting on screen. He plays callous characters quite well as in Sin City or even Lucky Number Slevin where the character has a heavy-hearted back story but doesn't really need to show that outside of intensity. 2. The aforementioned Hartnett is surrounded by a barrage of generally small-rolled actors desperately attempting to hold their heads above the proverbial blood-soaked water and fail to show anything that can generate more than a few sporadic laughs throughout the theater aimed at their inability to carry the scene. 3. This really should be the chief point. Who was it that felt the need to elaborate on anything outside of carnage engorging vampires in a month of darkness and snow? That's all I asked for. Ripping corpses, adrenaline fueled failed attempts at escape, and a hatred of garlic/silver/Jesus or whatever is fashionable to thwart vampires this year. No...just sequences of re-hashed ""We can't stay here!"" moments followed by jump-cuts anytime there should be on screen grisly. I would rather watch Underworld.

Kudos to the cinematographer for lots of very powerful, stark images. This isolated Arctic town is a pretty cool setting for a yarn like this - very original.Alas, the story didn't knock me out the way was hoping it might. With an elemental struggle like this one, there's plenty of dramatic potential. That makes it all the more disappointing when said potential isn't realized. I'm assuming that the graphic novel was way hip but this movie feels like it lost its way somewhere at one of the script meetings.But then, I wasn't expecting Shakespeare. So I give it a 7.

A Good Watch for Vampire Fans,"Surprisingly good, but not a movie that would be considered a classic. However this does stand above a lot of the more mediocre Vampire movies that have been made.It almost entirely relies on atmosphere, the coldness of the nomadic vampires is only matched by the Alaskan wilderness. The story works quite well, especially as there is never really any back story to tell where the vampires actually come from. The ending is quite well done and because it isn't really a happy ending I count it as a plus. Happy endings seem to be the go and having one that is not so happy is a welcome change. The movie is let down by some of the acting, which, if better might have made this a classic.Very much worth a watch if you like Vampire movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty solid and a unique idea for sure,"Finally, a scary movie that doesn't involve all the usual tropes. No otherworldly spirits, entities possessing dolls, children, etc. Nope, this film follows a cop in a tiny town in the northern extremus of the United States, Barrow Alaska, where due to the polar tilt, there is no sun for 30 days of the year. In the film, the town is attacked by...vampires? Ah. Okay.So, barring any questions as to how on earth a bunch of vampires came to a tiny town at the northern tip of Alaska, much less why they wear formal clothes or showed up (apparently) aboard a boat, the idea is certainly unique and has the potential to be a real thriller. The movie is tense, gory and the dialogue is good, and in all, and the effects hold up well. Of note--the film features quite a few really impressive shots that I'll definitely remember.The movie delivers well on its scares and doesn't pull any punches, as all the characters are faced with a series of increasingly difficult choices, to say the very least. The pacing is probably this movie's biggest downfall. The story is given in short little bursts that just seem to float into one another with no real rhyme or reason, and the only real distinction is an arbitrary ""Day XX"" that appears onscreen. I get that it's 30 days of what is essentially nighttime, but still--even the faintest mention of the passing of time in the dialogue would go a long way towards making the movie more believable.All that said, this movie does deliver, and it doesn't try to be something it's not. It's a horror movie, and one with an actually original idea behind it, at that. Of course, t I could nitpick the choices David Slade made in directing the film, but what good would it do? It's a solid movie that in my opinion isn't exactly groundbreaking, but certainly worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It took us centuries to make them believe that we are no more than just bad dreams.,"30 Days of Night is directed by David Slade and written by Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson. It stars Josh Hartnett, Melissa George, Danny Huston, Mark Boone Junior and Ben Foster. Music is by Brian Reitzell and cinematography by Jo Willems.Every year for thirty days the town of Barrow, North Alaska goes without sunlight. This year Barrow has visitors, VampiresBased on Steve Niles' own graphic comic, 30 Days of Night strips the vampire characterisation down to the core and triumphs because of it. There is nothing dandy or sexy about the vampires who have come to Barrow to feed for a month, these are ugly feral, insect like beasts who speak in their own language. The backdrop is a cold and snowy small town where no daylight is due for weeks, the population small, is about to become smaller with every passing hour. The set-up and execution is well handled by Slade (Hard Candy), antagonists and protagonists introductions are smooth, then the carnage unfolds and we shift into a tense game of cat and mouse as Hartnett, his estranged wife (George) and a few hardy souls try and survive until the 30 days of night have passed. And of course kick some vampire ass where possible.Problems arise with the fact that it never once feels like more than one night of horror, so the questions of sleep, eat and toilet habits don't come into until you start to realise this is spread over 30 days! Is that picky? Well no not really, especially since there is little to no depth of characterisations to feed off either, back story is minimal and only reserved for Hartnett and George to let us know they are separated but love each other, thus our hero has something extra to fight for! For a story spread over 30 days it sure does lack, erm, story. Yet the constant sense of dread, a number of breath holding scenes and some bona fide bloody terror, ensures that it's a thrilling addition to the vampire splinter of horror. Cast performances are fine for the material to hand, with Huston as the lead vampire standing out and tech credits elsewhere, again, are perfect for the material as written.Don't think about it too hard and there's a great time to be had here, while it makes for a great double with The Mist (also 2007). 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Is this really a Vampire movie?,"This movie promised so much and delivered so little...Horror movies are great, they push the envelope with tongue and cheek, B grade it all the way or give us a taste of otherworldliness with a great story and ending...this fails on all accounts.The acting was woeful, I hate watching film and having to suspend my disbelief in terms of what the characters look like and sound like. What accent did they have? Oz, Nz, southern American? Is everyone in Alaska that pretty and have lovely darling capped teeth? Cause if they are, this movie has done the Alaskan tourist board a favor, I'm going! What a joke.I enjoyed the strangers performance but kept waiting for him to eat bugs...and he did not...what a break through in vampire movie history! I mean come on, this film is riddled with minor tweaks to the Vampire myth to make it seem different, ooh in part two lets see them eating garlic...yeah! I have read reviews and can't believe people are hailing the monsters for there apathy to human kind. My question is WHY? Are they hungry animals? Where did they come from? The boat from the beginning of the film- what was that!? (nice shot but didn't explain or suggest much) The monsters/""Vampires"" were one dimensional dribbling farces. It was rubbishy am-dram bird of prey acting, with clicks and giggles- although the editing and sound people did a good job to jump me once or twice...but that should be a given.People might think Anne Rice and her team of dreamy think-too-much bunch of Vampires weren't hungry enough for some good Ole hunt down human savagery. BUT...at least we know who they were, where they come from. The basic ingredient of story telling- not to mention their scope of characters which actually go from young to old, mad to bad and ugly to beautiful.The chorus of aliens/vampires in 30 Days, led by the big bad daddy Athiest all think through him. How boring! Why even bother having them talk, think and mention god at all- oh thats right, suppose you have to get 90 minutes in some how. I just hope I find out in part 2...if we are so lucky to see those tremendous actors grace the screen again. (Josh Hartnett not included) The zombie/Vampires were somewhere muddled in-between Velocerapters and the Jack off the shining, with no clear substance and a lack of decision making in the directing. I like clarity in my demons.This is not a good film, nor is it average, it is not original and could of been something so much better- especially if naturally good looking people were used instead of wannabe white teethed hollywoodians.Thanks for reading.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Riveting and well played out; I was very entertained,"David Slade brings to the table a fun and chilling vampire flick with great pizazz and a straightforward plot to where the movie doesn't get too caught up in itself with twists and unnecessary edginess to give the viewer plain out fun and enjoyment from the get-go. Sure, this movie is no Oscar nominee, but it was excellently done and I found myself surprisingly enticed in the plot and characters with an intensity. The actors and actresses do a lot better than you would think with their somewhat tasteless characters and you can get into them because they're not so tasteless as the script calls for.Josh Hartnett is fantastic, David Slade directed just fine and all the other cast and crew did a very pleasing job with this movie. I thought the vampires were a little unoriginal, and in this case that's a bad thing, and the movie, like I said, not getting too fed up with itself does enough at times to make it seem unsavory, and make it seem like a ""big, bad"" film when it really just should've went with the flow, and even though it's definitely not Hard Candy, it's non-stop gratification just like Hard Candy was and I was very pleased with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has its moments--but not enough,"Film about a town in Alaska which, once a year, has only night for a full month. A bunch of vampires appear from nowhere (it's never made clear but it's suggested they came from overseas) and begin to slaughter the residents. A small bunch escape led by Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett). But the power is cut off, all the sled dogs have been killed, the cell phones destroyed and Oleson and others have to spend a whole month hiding and trying to survive from the vampires.This movie does have a lot of good things going for it. The basic plot (based on a graphic novel) is not bad. The vampires themselves are impressive--vicious evil creatures who can move VERY fast. Danny Huston chews the scenery as the head vampire and they all speak in an eerie foreign language (the audience gets subtitles). The acting is pretty good with one exception and most of the attack scenes are fast, vicious and VERY gory. Still I didn't like it.First of all--Hartnett. I've never liked him and this movie does nothing to change my mind--he's a terrible actor. He's the lead so it's a big liability. After the basic plot is set up everything goes by the numbers. You know who's going to live, who's going to die and the horrible predictable ""dramatic"" dialogue is just dull. Also the opening attack on the town is just so badly done it boggles the mind. It looks like it was edited by someone with extreme ADD! Things are going so fast and quick it's impossible to tell what's going on! The attack sequences that follow are better handled. Things do get a little better during the last half hour, but by then I was bored to tears by the horrible dialogue and cardboard characters. I only stayed in my seat because Huston was so much fun. He's having a great time in the role and it rubs off on the audience. Still, he isn't enough to save the movie. I give it a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A comedy, right?","I cannot believe the reviews I have seen for this. This was pretty awful at best. I must have seen the wrong movie because if this is popular then movie standards must have plummeted lately. Josh Hartnett picks turkeys like Bernard Matthews. He is actually the breast and feathers in this one. I found almost all of the cast on the verge of hysterical laughter, which killed any chance for me enjoying it. had it been deliberately played for laughs I might have succumbed. Only the vampires were convincing. They were much more serious. Not since William Hurt, hiding his embarrassment behind a beard in 'The Village', has an actor looked more like falling about in hysteria, as Hartnett does in this, again helped by a bit of a beard. Who wrote the wonderful script? Every time the survivors moved their base, it was announced they had to leave again. Did large segments get abandoned on the cutting room floor? I would have left it all, actually. Regarding the dialogue, only the vampires' strange lingo was anything like convincing. The rest of the script was pure comedy. Finally, in spite of the extensive gore, I was not once concerned about any of the characters because there was not a single scrap of tension or suspense. it made 'Dog Soldiers' and even the dreadful 'Underworld' seem passable.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad....,"I also saw a preview showing..I disagree with the other post on here that the female protagonist character (Josh Batnett's character's gf in the film, played by Melissa George) was unattractive. My husband and I both thought she was cute...(looks like a cross between Eliza Dushku and Olivia D'Abo or Erika Eleniak depending on which one if us you ask)Anyway, I thought the sound wasn't very good...and not in the scary parts, but just covering the audio during quiet dialogue parts. And I had some issues with the lighting here and there. Some scenes the characters clearly seemed like they were in the dark, others it seemed like broad daylight. No big deal really, any horror other horror movie, but the idea of this film was so hinged on the ""30 days of NIGHT"" i.e. DARK.And the vampire language...sounded more like klingon than anything else... would think it would have sounded more germanic or slavic...it was just weird...not necessarily BAD...just something that was pretty easy to make fun of coming out of this movie...Other than those little adds and the one disagreement I pretty much agree with the other post I read on here...I liked the gore in this and thought it was entertaining. Worth the $0 I spent to see it. :-)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vampires On The Snow.,"David Slade directs with a vampire flick. So what makes this different from other vampire movies? Well, the answer is nothing except that it is set in the far North where there is a season of 30 days of night (thus, these vamps will be safe from sunlight and rule for 30 days but there is a moment when Hartnett's character tries to kill them with UV but they are quick to cut off the power...). It is a very atmospheric film because the survivors are also victims of the weather and the whole little town itself plays a role. Slade manages to create a sense of isolation. The performances are... well, pretty much what you would expect from such films. The actors do the best they can with what's given. Josh Hartnett is quite alright as the hero. Melissa George is lovely. Ben Foster is annoying. However, it was hilarious to see Danny Huston in vampire mode. He is one of the last actors I would expect to see play a vampire. The vampire scenes are funny too. Especially when Huston's character talks gibberish to his cult and snorts order to his sidekick. '30 Days of Night' is strictly for horror fans. Normally I would choose a dozen other movies before deciding to watch this one but my mother and siblings really enjoy this kind of flick and I enjoy watching their reaction to it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good moody atmosphere,"Every year Barrow, Alaska has a mass exodus as it starts a period of 30 days without sunshine. Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) finds a lot of strange things happening. His ex Stella (Melissa George) misses the last flight out of town. Then they arrest a mysterious drifter (Ben Foster) right before an invasion of deadly vampires.This starts slowly, but there is a moody atmosphere building. The cold isolation works great as a way to ramp up the tension. The premise is something new for the vampire genre. I like the originality. The style also has a good look to it. The acting is pretty good for a horror movie. Ben Foster has the most interesting role. Josh Hartnett gets the leading man role. It's a good horror movie with something different.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Moody, tense, grim vampire flick","In recent years, vampire movies have transformed the undead into urbane clothes horses and pouting cannon fodder for roided-up alpha humans. Now, ""30 Days of Night"" takes vampires closer to their mythological roots than they have been in years. The bloodsuckers in this film are vicious, bestial, and ugly. Though humanoid in appearance, they truly seem monstrous. Their descent on the remote town of Barrow, Alaska has the sole aim of allowing them to feast on all the inhabitants as quickly and as brutally as possible. Barrow is so far north that in winter the sun does not rise for thirty straight days. As a result, a small group of (quite honestly, rather colorless) survivors led by Josh Hartnett have to evade and fight off the vampire horde for what seems like an eternal night.Director David Slade creates an atmosphere of tense foreboding, peppered with unanticipated shocks for the audience. The audience is drawn into a merciless, frozen world where the only thing that matters to either side is simple survival. Though the action scenes are expertly staged and plentiful, there are none of the completely OTT set-pieces (with souped up vehicles, guns firing holy water, ridiculous pyrotechnics, and obviously CGI effects) that have contaminated the horror genre in recent years.The vampires are allowed to be mysterious and menacing. We are not given any back story as to where they came from -though we see a derelict freighter in one of the opening shots, and they seem to speak some Slavic dialect. They are deliberately left as a terrifying enigma. Unfortunately, the human characters are really rather dull and it is difficult to care deeply for any of them.To wrap up, this is the best vampire movie in years. It lingers in the mind and offers ample quantities of gore, suspense, and thrills. There are a number of solid plot twists, and the script resists the temptation to offer any easy answers to the dilemma facing the ever-more overwhelmed townsfolk. By any standards this is a gruesome, chilling, Halloween treat for horror fans of all sorts.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Vampire Movie Since Blade 2,"Based on the acclaimed graphic novel of the same name, 30 Days Of Night utilises a premise so obvious that you wonder why it's never been filmed before. A small Alaskan town is plunged into darkness for thirty days of the year and a small army of vampires decide to make use of the lack of light to indulge in a feeding frenzy.The vampire genre in the celluloid world has become somewhat tired over the years and the familiarity we have them has lessened their impact. However, 30 Days Of Night goes some way towards refreshing things by portraying vampires as primal creatures which run around in packs ripping out throats with rows of needle-like teeth and spraying blood all over the place. Make no mistake; these aren't your Anne Rice vampires. These things are lethal killing machines with more in common with a group of wild dogs than human beings. They don't want to seduce you. They want to suck your veins clean as quickly as possible.This is a bloody movie - and rightly so. A wonderful scene early in the movie shows the impact of the vampires' rampage throughout the town as the camera flows overhead following trails of red which glisten upon the pure white snow. These things are messy eaters you see - imagine thirty days of gorging on blood and never wiping your face, and that's what these vampires look like.That's not to say that these vampires have no personality. The lead vampire in particular (played by the wonderful Danny Huston - an actor whose performances I've enjoyed in Children Of Men and The Constant Gardener) is an identifiable character dripping in menace whilst peering at his victims with soulless black eyes.The human characters are well cast here and each gets their own moment to shine. I've never really been a big fan of Josh Hartnett but he does a good job at portraying a man whom others look up to. As the town's Sheriff, the job of protecting the few survivors falls to him and you can see the pain and grief on his face as those around him are gradually turned into slabs of bloody meat.That this is David Slade's second feature length movie after Hard Candy is certainly impressive. Every shot captured by the cameras is a thing of beauty and manages to translate the soul of the graphic novel to the screen. I enjoyed the fact that the story gets moving almost from the first scene. You won't have to sit through half an hour of character back-story - the town's attack is already in motion by the time the opening credits have rolled.30 Days Of Night is, without a doubt, one of the best horror movies of 2007 and I look forward to seeing Slades' next feature, whatever it be.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not great. Just decent.,"A lot of people have been saying that this is, by far, the best vampire movie of the year. To some extent, that is true. Vampire movies have been rather few for the past couple of years so I do think that for the genre, this movie is a success.First of all, let me just say that Vampires don't scare me. I find them more cool and amazing than scary. That being said, I was kind of happy that the vampires portrayed in this movie did not change my perception of them as being cool and amazing creatures (Well, it was altered a little but not too much). There were a lot of spectacular scenes that are worth remembering. But of course, with spectacular scenes comes a handful of annoying and unnecessary scenes as well.Get this: why is it that whenever I watch a survival horror/thriller film, there's always this character that acts so stupid? I mean, when a group of people are put into a similar situation, would they really act that way? I do understand that that character was necessary so that the director could thrust in a good kill scene but heck! It's just annoying.Several things I didn't like about the movie were the ending, the final scenes (what the main character did was like ""WHAT THE HECK!?""), the way the vampires communicated (cool for some but gibberish for me) and the realism of the characters' conditions (when the movie says ""Day 17"", the characters don't seem to look like they've been on that hiding place for 17 days. You get what I mean?). And, oh yeah, the constant camera close-ups on Josh Hartnett's face (It's like they're trying to make him the next Brad Pitt-esquire superstar).Anyway, these are but minor issues that can be easily disregarded. It's a horror/thriller/action flick. Better yet, it's a survival flick. So just enjoy. Be scared. Bring your friends, family and sweethearts. Disturbing scenes were obviously removed for the Cinema (Note to self: buy DVD). However, some scenes might still be really disturbing for some people. All in all, a very decent vampire movie. Not really the best of all time but still arguably the best of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I was impressed.,"I have to admit i didn't have that high hopes for 30 days of night being any good, i saw the trailer and thought it looked pretty good but trailers are deceiving some times so i wasn't quite sure, so on the first showing in my local cinema on the night of Halloween i went and watched it and iv'e got to say it's definitely one of the best vampire movies i've seen. The whole movie was pretty tense and i could tell some people watching wanted it to end as soon as possible because they were scared s###less due to the gore and bits that made you jump and i have to say at times i was on the edge of my seat. Special effects weren't used that much apart from the vampires and the blood but it was all really well done and there were some very realistic decapitations and killings, the vampires were very messy eaters they kind of shook their head as they did which looked a bit weird and it made some people in the cinema laugh which i don't really think was the intension but it was all done effectively none the less.Josh Harnett who i'm not a great fan of for his acting ability performs the part of sheriff Eban well although i found it hard to believe at his age he could be a sheriff, the rest of the cast were good too and they all acted to the situation believably there were no semi auto weapons fired while diving over a table or exploding barrels or anything stupid like that it was all realistic.I really liked the birds eye view of the town when the vampires were trashing the place and killing everyone it was done brilliantly.30 days of night overall was a great horror and not a action comedy horror like so many nowadays,it was a serious horror movie with no jokes but it was entertaining and i think anyone who likes the genre and has a brain when it comes to knowing whats good will like it.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The acting isn't bad... the plot and character development is very.,"Josh H. and Melissa George are a good cast. However the town in crisis has no character - its small community is quite random. The vampires backgrounds are not revealed - who are they, where did they come from. The ending is very disappointing.Some good action scenes and suspenseful scenes - but plot really doesn't get anywhere.

"If You Can't Beat 'Em, Then, Hey, Why Not Join 'Em (?)","If you're seriously looking for a ferocious, modern-day vampire story that contains no glamour, just gore, then 30 Days Of Night just might be more than enough to satisfy your hunger and quench your thirst.Set in far-off Barrow, Alaska (during their winter's month-long polar-night), a voracious troupe of no-name vampires unceremoniously waltz into town and immediately engage in a brutal, non-stop feeding frenzy where Barrow's terrified citizens are the #1 choice on the menu.(Get the picture?)Even though this $30 million horror story was noticeably over-long at 152 minutes, its pace rarely seemed to lag and its blood-splattered gore and hideous make-up effects were, without question, first-rate.One problem with 30 Days' story was that no background was given on this particular pack of hissing, screeching bloodsuckers. Without being clued into their origins, one is left wondering exactly how old they are and how they've managed to survive up to this point.'Cause if these vampires actually operate the same way, as they did in Barrow, with such a lack of caution everywhere they go, then one couldn't imagine that they could continue to survive for very long at that recklessly rabid rate.Even though 30 Days did deliver a pretty gruesome story of hide'n'seek, it inevitably lost itself some significant points for its blatant product placement of Pepsi and Oreo cookies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
And Soon The Darkness,"This film has a similar central idea to ""Pitch Black."" Both movies deal with monsters that can only come out at night being suddenly given an extra opportunity to attack as often as they wish due to the disappearance of the sun (in ""Pitch Black"" it was because of an eclipse, in ""30 Days of Night"" it's due to Barrow's extreme northerly position in the winter). It also has a remote Alaskan setting like ""Insomnia,"" but that film dealt with the 24-hour daylight Alaska has in the summertime.Josh Hartnett plays the Sheriff of a small Alaskan town that, for one month every year, goes into complete darkness. This coincides with the arrival in the town of a pack of blood-thirsty vampires (from Russia perhaps? Alaska isn't too far away from Russia and the vampires do have an odd, clicking, Eastern-European-sounding dialect).Hartnett arrests a man in a diner for demanding raw meat with menaces. He brings him to the jail in the Sheriff's station where the prisoner's demented ramblings seem to be portents of impending doom (He is a lot like the Renfield character in ""Dracula,"" with his mad ravings, unusual eating habits and his apparent connection with the vampires).The film seems to be heavily influenced by the work of John Carpenter, particularly ""Assault on Precinct 13"", ""The Fog"" and especially ""The Thing."" There is also a nod to ""Salem's Lot"" when a vampire crashes in through a kitchen window at astonishing speed and then slowly rises to his feet. After that, the film becomes a sort of horror version of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" with the survivors of the vampire extermination holed up in an attic and jumping at every noise outside.Melissa George is the heroine and she looks gorgeous as always. She's rapidly becoming a scream queen for the YouTube generation with her appearances in ""The Amityville Horror"" remake, ""Paradise Lost"" and now ""30 Days of Night."" Josh Hartnett makes a welcome return to the genre he started out in with ""Halloween H20"" and ""The Faculty."" For some reason, he only seems to make an effort in horror or sci-fi flicks. In movies like ""The Black Dahlia"" and ""Hollywood Homicide"" he was sleepwalking and didn't seem interested at all. Here he does seem committed to the part and it's good to see him giving his all again.The vampires are a little anonymous. We don't know anything about any of them. Where do they come from? What language are they speaking? How old are they? Nothing. They are just a bunch of bloodsuckers and that's it (John Carpenter always says he prefers to have characters with no back-story in his films, so there's another Carpenter touch for you).We do learn in this film that you can kill vampires with an axe (that's a new one on me!) There are no stakes, garlic, crucifixes or holy water in this movie!The ending stretches credibility and doesn't really satisfy, but up until then, this is a good, solid vampire movie. Be warned though, it's very gory and if you're at all squeamish, steer clear.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It's Barrow, Alaska, where are all the Eskimos?!","Overall, I thought this movie was entertaining. The pace was good, and the action certainly kept my interest. Watch for the fly-over scene of the carnage through the town when the vampire attack gets into full swing. That shot is the best thing in the movie. The vampires were creepy enough, but what's with the same, tired long black trench coats? Thank goodness the dialog was kept to a minimum. As an aside, my friend who is a native of Barrow says they captured the look of the town pretty well. But we were all wondering where all the natives went to? Barrow is mostly populated by Native Alaskans. Did they all get some psychic signal (because all native peoples are psychic, you know). Maybe the ""shaman"" told them that the blood-sucking (insert made-up Eskimo word here) were back and they should hide on the ice in their igloos, eating seals and swapping wives until the vampires are gone? Oh but that would be racist, so lets just pretend that Native Alaskans don't really live there, because that's not racist at all. The writers obviously didn't think of Alaska as anything more than a backdrop. Aside from the no-bright-light thing, this could have taken place in any small rural (white) town that gets a hefty amount of snow. I really would have liked to see a bit more effort from the writers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
lots of gore and plot holes,"This movie was a little more graphic than I expected and that's a good thing. However, I had lots of questions throughout. Never mind the fact that in Alaska when the northern most parts have total darkness in winter, it is a gradual thing. They don't have 8 hours of sunlight one day and complete darkness the next, which is how this movie seems to depict it. The concept is a good one. A group of foreign vampires, perhaps Russian since they arrive by boat, send a human to the town of Barrow to destroy all phones and lines of communication as well as sabotage the only helicopter and others forms of transportation, such as sled dogs. The whole dog thing was so brutal and I did not want to see that.Then when the town's 30 days of darkness begins, the vamps begin attacking local citizens to feed. There are lots of closeups of blood squirting out of sliced throats, etc... Next problem I have is that Josh Harnett isn't exactly what you would think a sheriff of some isolated Alaskan town would look like. And once darkness comes and the power is cut, how come there seems to be so much light when the towns people are running around outside. When it's snowing, there would be no light from the stars or moon, so why did it look they had tons of light set up outside.Next issue, the vamps go from house to house tearing it apart looking for survivors. Why do they never do this to any of the buildings the survivors are hiding in. Why do they allow these humans to live for days on end instead of finding them hiding in houses. Also, when the survives stupidly go running around the town, why are they never spotted by the vamp lookouts on the roofs. Also, what was the point of running to the grandma's house for the UV lights. The sheriff proves it does hurt the vamps, but he only uses it on one before they cut the power. Was that worth risking his life for?As for the ending, I liked it. I never expected the sheriff to come up with that solution to save the day so to speak.FINAL VERDICT: If you like a good horror movie with lots of blood and gore, then watch this.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Spoiler-free lament of time wasted.,"Despite an interesting premise and some nice visuals, 30 Days Of Night is a dreary humorless mess which is entirely too long and incredibly dull. I've just recently started renting discs from Netflix again and decided to catch up on things I've missed over the last several years. For some reason, this was my first choice. Ouch!The humans characters aren't so bad, despite being a collection of clichés. None of them are particularly memorable, but nobody will care about that because this is a movie about vampires. I've learned is that vampires like to wear nice black blazers or cocktail dresses, evidently are incapable of closing their mouths all the way at any time, speak a mixture of Huttese and dolphin screeches, and can leap like monkeys until the action dictates that they suddenly need to stumble around like they've dropped a deuce in their drawers. Honestly, I was more impressed by the vampires in Twilight (and that's something no person should ever say).Despite those misgivings, I can safely recommend this to you if you're a big fan of sped-up jumpy-shot rapid-cut movie making, or the sight of people doing the ""rawr"" pounce pose while they're being lowered into the shot like they're some idiotic thrift store ninja. Unfortunately, I am not, and as a result I found this movie to be a fairly agonizing experience, enjoyable only for the colorful remarks I found myself uttering at the screen.Instead of watching this mess I could have been doing something useful with my life. I could have cleaned my living room, for one. I could have called up old friends. I could have cooked a nice meal. I could have painted! I did none of those, and for that I am sorry.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Almost really good!,"This movie came really close to being a classic. First of all it is an isolationist film (i.e.The Thing, Assault on Precinct 13, Dawn of the Dead), and mood wise it does a great job. Claustrophobia, and paranoia ensue. The problem with this film lies solely in its editing. There are a couple of scenes that just come out of nowhere and are short and make no sense. These could easily be fixed and I think the will I bet these will be re-edited for DVD. Otherwise the film is pretty good, very violent and pretty gory/ graphic. Overall this is a good film for Halloween, oh, wait it was put out weeks before Halloween. Well, see it anyways!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Would had been nice if it had an actual story in it.,"This is a rather good genre attempt, that is good looking and for the fans of the genre is still a good watch, but overall it's lacking too much with its story-telling to consider this a truly successful and great genre attempt.I think one of the problems with this movie is that it can't seem to decide for itself whether it wants to take on a serious and realistic approach or a more entertaining one. Result of this is that the movie features both of these very different approaches in it. Needless to say it doesn't blend in very well with each other. The one moment the movie is tense and unpredictable, the other its over-the-top and not really very credible.But perhaps the foremost problem is simply the movie its story and how it flows. Things are just happening within this movie. Nothing is really ever being explained and it's not the type of movie that has a clear main plot line in it. It's about a very small town in Alaska being under the sudden attack of a group of vampires, during 30 days of night. This is the story. Nothing more, nothing less. It may sound good and simple enough for the lovers of the genre but the movie and its characters are all over the place. It's as if some sequences are missing at times within the movie and the movie often makes too big jumps. The one moment they are hiding in the police station, the other they are at an attic and then again at a totally different place. The movie often doesn't bother showing how things happened.You'll also never feel attached to any of the characters really, since most of them remain very shallow and unknown ones. I mean, I surely don't know all the characters names within this movie, even those who have quite an amount of running time in this movie. I'm of course not talking about Josh Hartnett and Melissa George characters, etcetera, but about the rest of the townsfolk, who are hiding and trying to survive along with them. It makes this movie a somewhat shallow experience at times.But no, none of this really takes away the fun of the movie. This is why the movie is still perfectly watchable for the fans of the genre. It's a good looking movie, that obviously wasn't cheap to made. The movie has some good make-up effects in it as well as some other nice effective gory special effects. Yes, the movie does feature some nice gore but this is not what the movie is all about. It's being somewhat pushed to the background and the movie is more about the survival of a group of people under some very unusual circumstances.The movie constantly sticks to its main characters, which is also the reason why nothing is ever rarely being explained in the movie. Things are just simply happening within this movie, just as they are happening to the movie its main characters. The movie is based on a comic by Steve Niles & Ben Templesmith and the movie must have obviously sticked to its original source material. This approach taken by the story might work out fine and effective within a comic book but for a motion picture it's simply too lacking and not effective enough. Probably the reason why a lot of studios didn't really picked up this movie when being offered the change to produce it by the comic book authors.It's nice to see how much Josh Hartnett as an actor has matured over the years. I don't think I've ever seen him in a movie ever since 2001 (with the expectation of his 2 minutes role in the 2005 hit movie ""Sin City"") and to me in my mind, Hartnett was still that very young actor who made teenage-girls drool with his role in ""Pearl Harbor"". It's nice to see that by now he has really become a man and is more serious and matured in his acting performances as well. He positively surprised me in this movie.Could had been a great genre movie with a different approach and an actual clear main plot-line in it.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Screeching vampires get old....,"I have been a ""30 days"" fan for a while now, as well as a fan of Steve Niles who consistently writes entertaining horror comics; needless to say, I was very much stoked to see this film. Of course though, i did catch wind of some reviews and was forewarned that this may be a vampyrrhic meltdown...and in some cases it was.Josh Hartnett plays the lead Eben, not Evan, who is having relationship issues with his wife Stella, played by the too pretty to be taken seriously Melissa George, and as they are about to smooth things over, a stranger comes to town with some foreboding news.It's not soon after this that Eben, his bro, his pothead granny, Stella, and a few other miscreants are running and hiding from a gang of Russian(?) nosferatus.The blood flows pretty well in the film, as does the action, but there were a few times where I had to laugh and shake my head at some of the cliché plot turns/characters, ex: the old man who misses his dead wife and the worrisome guy who doesn't know how to shut the hell up!!! But the film had some nice direction from the HARD CANDY guy, and Josh Hartnett was actually pretty good. Its kind of fun to watch him lose his sanity.But the film is saved by Danny Huston. He doesn't say much verbally in the film but his mouth and looks do a lot of talking on their own. He owns the film as the head vamp, with icy dead stares and a menacing gait, but the same cannot can be said about the rest of the bloodsuckers. They twist their heads constantly feeding like seizure victims, always show off their teeth to ill and un-scary effect, and do not stop screeching!!! Ever. Why do vampires need to screech? Ugh.So all in all, nice cinematography at times(great shot of one bloody town), okay gore, bad ending, and too much screeching. I give it a wicked generous and lucky number sleven.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great weekend night timepass.....,"I saw the trailer of the film and i saw potential the only thing left to determine was the rating, there was no way you could pull off a good horror-vampire movie without blood/bleeding when I saw the confidence inspiring ""R"", and ""Sam Raimi"" as the producer I knew i wouldn't be disappointed.The opening sequence of the movie was artistic but completely confusing and unnecessary, but after that the movie goes on a steep uphill curve.Almost all the aspects of the movie are self explanatory, the mass migration, the reason the town exists, what who is thinking, etc etc.Almost no time is wasted in unnecessary and long drawn conversations as too the why how, and that really helps with the feature length, KEEPING A MOVIE WITH A VERY LIMITED PLOT LIKE THIS INTERESTING FOR THE WHOLE RUN-TIME IS NOT A EASY JOB BUT THE FILM MAKERS HAVE DONE IT WITH ELAAN.However i was not convinced about the flow of the days, the passage of time was very ineffectively captured at best, not only that, the way it was shown will lead to at least 20 improbabilities and impossibilities, this was one area where the film really lost out on.Character development wasn't much but it was never missed, just the right amount of focus was laid on development, and luckily FLASHBACKS A STAPLE OF MOVIES WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS EACH OTHER NEVER REARED ITS HEAD.The movie builds the tension and almost never really lets up, the movie lacked in numbers(there were a few good ones),the big tension or horror scenes (the ones where everyone laughs afterwards), but it made up easily on the tension that was maintained throughout.The action was good but this wasn't that much of an action movie, explosions, guns and obviously hand to hand combat are at a minimum and only used as means to move the story forward.THIS MOVIE IS MUCH MORE OF A HORROR THRILLER AND A WELCOME CHANGE FROM THE MORE ACTION ORIENTED VAMPIRE MOVIES OF LATE (which i am actually quite fond of).Acting was very good all around, melodrama was at a minimum except towards the end, especially good were Manu as deputy sheriff and The stranger.SURPRISINGLY ALMOST NO HUMOUR IN THIS ONE.Technically merely good/OK because the perpetual dark doesn't get to you, even movies like Pitch Black did a better job, fear of the dark is almost a universal human trait and it could have definitely been exploited.The other weak part was the end, it didn't really follow the tone of the movie, it was a typical FILMY (as we say in India) ending almost taking chick flick proportions its almost amazing this movie holds it own after such a weak ending.Censorship once again affected my viewing experience with a bunch of dialogues being lost thanks to the shoddy editing, in a bid to cut scenes of what the censors consider inappropriate.In all a great weekend night movie, can be enjoyed by anyone although it doesn't have enough action for a hardcore action fan.-s very poor flow of days, VERY WEAK ENDING, technically OK.+/-s explanations??? some people like/want them.+s very good acting, interesting plot, tense throughout, a few very tense moments, one liners.total 7.5/10 (im sure this movie will be better without censorship and I've added a half point for that, it did go above my expectations but i didn't factor that in because that would push the rating to high, the end was just to weak to merit a higher rating, and its a wonder a movie can get such good ratings with such a weak end ).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A different vampire flick.,"I saw this first in a theatre in 2007. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Bought the dvds of this n the sequel. Its a must watch for horror/vampire movie fans. Very different concept. I cannot recall but i must hav seen one similar concept (vampires in alaska wher the sun doesn't rise for few days). Maybe it was an episode from tales from the crypt. The plot - a group of vampires attacks a small town in northern Alaska in the middle of winter when the sun doesn't rise for 30 days. Scary uh? Well its a very good horror/survival thriller. On a visual level, this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. There isn't a shot in the film that you wouldn't want to pause and admire. It is fast paced n well acted n directed. There's loads of blood, some flesh eating, lots of heads blown off, plenty of axe wounds, and arm ripped off, and some cut in two with a buzz saw. At times the editing became tedious coz of the fast cuts n shaky stuff which spoiled the action. Nonetheless a different vampire flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hello Sunshine,"Unlike some (many?) other reviewers, I prayed for sun light. I could've left the cinema, but I went into a late screening, so no hope there ... but seriously: This was a waste of time. Begins good (if you extract the obvious and bland character bits), but get's unbearably every minute that passes by ... I'm glad it isn't told in real time!Back to some positive things: Josh Hartnett plays the lead role here and he's surprisingly good (for me he is at least). The lead vampire is OK, too. That's about it ... OK there's a bit gore that can excite you here and there, but that doesn't really get my blood flowing (pun intended) ... and speaking of which: Melissa might be good looking, but she can't really act, if her life depended on it (oops another pun?)!What could've been the problem one might ask, with a plot outline like that (see somewhere here on IMDb for that)? Since I read interviews with the main players, I think I have an answer to that: They didn't know what they were shooting! From Josh over to Melissa, over to the head vampire up to the director, everyone had another genre they thought this movie belonged in ... Wanna know the real fun part? No one mentioned horror and/or vampire movie! Yeah right! Guess we have our reason, why the movie did suck at the end of the day (aww man, two puns in one sentence? There's no better way to end a review than this ...)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant !,"Wow ! I had my expectations set so high, and I did NOT get disappointed! Besides the visual, which I think in some shots are beautiful, this movie made me jump around 6 times, which is rarely seen! I also, for the first time really in a horror movie had my heart beating twice as fast the entire time, because I really lived myself into it ! If that is correct expression:) The reason it only gets 9 stars is because you get introduced to the vampires too fast IMO!

Best vampire movie of its kind. Hands down.,"30 days of night is without a doubt the best vampire movie of it's kind. although i love ""Interview with a vampire"" which will always hold strong as the best vampire movie made in the last 25 years. 30 days of night cannot and should not be put into the same category. this movie is doing its own thing and has its own environment in which it thrives. The whole movie takes place in Alaska and the film makers use this location to its fullest advantage.The color contrasts of red blood splattered on white snow is beautiful on the eyes ( as weird as that sounds)This film glides so nice and so smooth that you actually don't want it to end. The creative process behind this film is clever and should teach a lesson to anyone who wants to know how to make a good movie involving Vampires.josh Harnet was actually very believable in his role given his age as a sheriff, as a matter of fact he grew on me more and more as the movie progressed. By the time it was over i sat back and it really sunk in just how good he was in this movie. i would recommend anyone who is into action horror to buy this DVD. Because this is one icy cold snowstorm and vampire ridden town that thrilled me beyond my expectations. Thumbs up to the cast and Melissa George was great as always to watch. By the way i should mention that these vampires are pretty damn scary looking and the leader of these blood suckers was one creepy S.O.B",,Anonymous,Horror
An effective Night,"30 Days of Night has a premise that seems undeniably suited for a vampire movie: in Alaska resides a town named Barrow, the northernmost city of the United States. During winter, for 30 days, the sun never rises, bathing the city in a perpetual darkness during that period. Comic book creators Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith used this as the basis for their tale of a group of vampires that arrive in Barrow to feed for those 30 days on the unwitting, and largely trapped, populace of Barrow. Director David Slade has now brought the tale to the big screen, and while it is hardly a perfect horror film, it is a cut above many others in some time and provides the appropriate thrills for the audience.As stated above, the setting is Barrow, beginning the day before the 30 day sunless cycle kicks off. Sheriff Eben (Josh Harnett) spends that last day investigating a number of unusual occurrences around the town: burned cell phones, murdered sled dogs, the only helicopter damaged beyond repair. As the sun sets, the town finds itself cut off from the rest of the world, and quickly under siege, as vampires have arrived at Barrow and begin feeding on the population, first just a few on the outskirts of town, but eventually moving en masse. Finding guns incapable of stopping the attackers, a group of survivors, led by Eben, and including his estranged wife, Stella (Melissa George) hole up in an attic and lay the groundwork for surviving the seemingly endless darkness.30 Days of Night is not scary in a traditional sense. Even with some scenes of suspense, the film instead relies on the adrenaline rush of watching the survivors attempt to avoid detection by the undead, who utilize their stealth and the bait of other survivors to try to lure their prey into the open. The vampires are appropriately creepy, covered in blood from their victims, and attack with a ravenousness that vampires have typically lacked in previous screen appearances. These vampires are monsters, pure and simple, and that is reflected in several scenes where they confront their prey and fill the audience with unease since we are relatively certain the humans will not survive.Despite the fact that 30 Days of Night is not a character-driven piece, Slade still manages to evoke a degree of feeling and sympathy for his human protagonists. The film deals in the sticky territory of who lives and who dies when faced against seemingly insurmountable odds, and also the questions of whether the choices made, even when the outcome seems obvious, are the right ones from a moral standpoint. 30 Days of Night is not some treatise on the human condition, it is still a horror thriller, but the fact that it takes the time to consider the issues is better than we usually get from a film of its genre.Acting-wise, the cast is solid, if not amazing. Josh Hartnett is appropriately stolid as Sheriff Eben, but also manages to communicate his desire to try and keep those around him alive while his world seems to be unraveling at the same time. Danny Huston portrays the vampire leader, Marlow, and while he is not given anything in the way of English dialogue (the vampires speak in some subtitled foreign language), he conveys an appropriate sense of meance.Visually, 30 Days of Night is effective, showing the dark world of Barrow, and director Slade and cinematographer Jo Willems do a good job of conveying dread by often populating the edges of the screen with the vampires lurking, ready to strike. The makeup effects that realize the vampires keeps them appropriately evil, but the work in this department is hardly groundbreaking.30 Days of Night is no masterpiece, and Slade's previous effort, the disturbing Hard Candy, was a much better movie, but nonetheless, 30 Days of Night is effective and efficient, so if you like horror films, it's worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly Watchable,"I usually get bored with movies, so if I can sit through it and not daydream I consider that a great start. Anyway, I went into this not expecting much. Sam Raime's Ghost House Pictures has a reputation for churning out some real crap as far as horror movies go. Josh Hartnet doesn't generally aspire awe with his acting abilities. Melissa George is known in most circles for her looks more than anything else. I was thinking at worst I could catch a 2-hour nap. However. The movie was actually pretty good. The direction and cinematography was great. Hartnett seemed like he'd matured a bit as an actor. He did a fine job. Melissa George has come leaps and bounds since the small parts I remember her from. She was great. Ben Foster is always good to see, and he's turning into a hell of a character actor (check him out in 3:10 to Yuma.) The guy who played the vampire ""leader"" or ""president"" or ""president elect"" or whatever they call it was really really good. Apparently his dad is John Huston too, which seems odd, but he was brilliant. All in all the vampires did a great job. All in all definitely worth watching (and you can't say that about more than 2 or 3 horror films a year these days.)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but not great.,"I am kind of on the fence about this one. First, I must admit that I have always been a fan of vampire films and I thought the concept for this movie (graphic novel) was a great. Secondly, the movie did definitely creep me out and have my on the egde of my seat. This in many ways the ultimate nightmare scenario, not quite on the level of Salem's Lot, but close. Finally, I think this will be a worthy addition to my DVD collection for a good watch on Halloween once a year, be warned though, this film is graphic. But I can't say this movie isn't without flaws.If you are expecting anything in the way of character development you can just forget it. Showing the relationships seems to serve only the purpose of showing us why character A might care why character B gets slaughtered, but you wont care. Also, I just felt it would have been more interesting to learn a little bit more about these vampires, where they came from and why they decided to take this town right now. They were scary enough but a little more back story would have gone a long way. There were also just seemed to be some obvious questions.Like why wouldn't these vampires just call it a day and head to the next town after their initial slaughter. Why the heck would they hang out for thirty days just looking for a few additonal ""snacks"" when according to the characters there were evidently some other towns in the vicinity, probably not a problem for these super human vampires to reach. And if there were a lot of people still alive that they were holding in reserve or as bait it might have been interesting to show that part of it.As I said this isn't a bad film but it's a toss up as to whether you want to wait for the DVD. If you are a big horror fan or love vampire flicks this wouldn't be a complete waste of your money but if not you probably just want to wait and give it a rent.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Superb Vampire Movie,"Right from the very beginning, this movie sets a gloomy and foreboding tone. A lone man appears wandering through the Arctic wilderness with a mysterious ship off the coast in the background. Then, the setting is established. This is Barrow, Alaska - the northernmost town in the United States, and a 30 day night is about to fall as the sun disappears below the horizon. The mysterious man turns out to be an advance scout of a sort for a truly frightening gang of very bloodthirsty vampires, who have decided to use the completely dark and completely isolated town as a feeding station. Josh Hartnett did a good job as the local sheriff who at first can't figure out what's happening, but then when he does has to try to find a way to help a small group of people survive this nightmare for 30 days without being caught. This is one of the absolute best horror movies I've seen in a long time. The setting is perfect and is an original twist on the vampire legend, the cast does a fantastic job of presenting the fear and sense of hopelessness the townspeople felt in the situation, and those who played the vampires did so perfectly and were totally convincing. These vampires were a bit different from what we're used to. There was no sense of semi-romance or quasi-sexuality that we've often see portrayed with vampires, from the time of Bela Lugosi on. These vampires just want blood - and lots of it, and they're on a killing spree to get it. The ultimate solution that Sheriff Eben Oleson came up with took me totally by surprise. I hadn't thought of it at all even though I, along with the townsfolk, was trying to figure out how to escape this madness all the way through. The movie is very gory, and definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you're a fan of horror movies (and especially vampire movies) this is most definitely a must-see movie. The town's isolation is used to good effect, although it's also the only niggling plot point. When the vampires arrive, one of the first things they do to ensure that Barrow will remain isolated is cut all the phone lines. That makes sense, but it also creates a problem. Surely people inside Barrow can phone out, and people outside Barrow can phone in. Surely someone somewhere in the world would have noticed long before 30 days were up that they can't phone anyone in Barrow? Surely this would have been reported? I know it's dark, but surely somehow the phone company would have managed to get someone up there to investigate? I mean, in the setting, surely phone service (or at least ham radio service) would be essential for medical evacuations, etc. And yet this goes on for 30 days with no one caring that there's no contact at all? That stretches credibility a bit. Still, in my opinion, by the standards of the genre and on the basis of its originality and atmosphere, this deserves a 9/10!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Vampire movies in some time!,"Having read the graphic novel in which this movie was inspired and not being very impressed (good concept, not very good anything else) , I was still optimistic for this movie adaptation. Director David Slade has made me happy in the past with his work in the disturbing film Hard Candy. Though Hard Candy deals with a real life monster (pedophiles), in 30 Days of Night Slade manages to fully realize supernatural horror and revitalize the vampire genre in a way not seen since the first Blade.The movie begins with a fighting husband and wife played by the dreadfully dead-pan Josh Hartnett (who is the only ""name"" actor in the movie)and the equally boring Melissa George. Hartnett is the sheriff of a small isolated town in Alaska called Barrow and his soon to be ex wife, along with half of the town, are leaving because Barrow is about to see its last sunset in 30 days. However, his wife gets in an accident with a local tractor and decides to begrudgingly stay in town and help Hartnett with some strange cases of vandalism. These vandalism's include every police dog being ripped to sheds, every cell phone in the town being stolen, only to be found burnt to a crisp, and the towns radio/power being shut off, leaving Barrow unable to communicate with the rest of the world. After a violent run in with an accented visiting vagrant, we soon figure out what's really going on. It seems traveling vampires have singled out Barrow Alaska and are exploiting its 30 days without the sunlight. Needless to say this movie gets violent fast, never pulls its punches, and can be adequately described as f***** up.Though the movie starts slow and there is some less than great acting as well as some overly simplistic dialogue, once the movie picks up it quickly brings you to the edge of your seat hiding behind your palms. Not only is this a good vampire movie, but a truly effective horror movie in general. Though I previously compare this movie with the more action/martial arts oriented Blade, this movie is far more chilling and adult. At times the violence was so unbearable and viscous I found my self wincing away from the screen (not easy for me anymore), other times the violence was handled more strategically off camera. Regardless, which ever way it was dealt with, the decision was made with how best to scare/disturb the audience. Also, unlike Anne Rice's beautiful homo-erotic vampires, these monsters are more like a pack of demonic wolves who will remind you why you thought Marilyn Manson was creepy when you were a kid. This Combined with the best aspects of Romero-esk zombie survival and the isolative snowy terror of John Carpenters The Thing makes 30 Days the best vampire movie in a very long time. However, the movie does have a somewhat disappointing ending (unfortunately one of few things that wasn't changed from the book) but it still manages to work in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 days of Night? (Feels) More like 30 Hours of Night...,"I am a big fan of The Thing (1982) and I was looking for films with similar vibes so I used IMDb advanced search; typed ''winter'' for keywords, then refined to narrow as feature films only, then horror as genre. This film was one of the films that were listed. So I didn't think about it much and started watching it without knowing anything about it. I can't tell that I really liked it, but it was an OK film. At least it didn't make me angry.First I'd like to mention the negatives. I didn't like Josh Harnett's performance, nor any other actor's in particular. Despite the premise and the name of the film, you can hardly tell where(when) you are in the timeline of 30 days. And it doesn't even feel like 30 days, it really feels like the events in the story happened in a single day or two, and that's the biggest fail of the film considering the premise. If they managed to give the sense that days were getting harder and harder, the audience would feel the tension rising. But as I said, it didn't happen that way.On the good side, I thought the vampires looked creepy, though I don't have any interest in vampires whatsoever.I don't suggest it to anyone, unless you are looking for a film to watch with half of your attention to kill some time. It's not an awful film, but there is nothing special or smart about it either.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

There are a lot of scenes in here that gave me the same kind of shivers as the ""eclipse"" scene in Pitch Black did.See it and judge for yourself, but if you really like horror films (and I don't mean dreck like Saw or the remake of House on Haunted Hill, for instance), don't be put off by the few negative reviews.

"Starts good enough, sets along the way","""30 Days of Night"" has an intriguing title and an intriguing premise - that of bloodthirsty vampires roaming a little Alaskan town where the sun won't rise during a 30-day stretch. And director David Slade, working on a script by Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson, from the graphic novel of Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, manages to build tension early in the film with this discourse.Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) is a sheriff investigating a series of strange crimes in the isolated town of Barrow, Alaska, such as the burning of stolen cellphones and butchering of sleigh dogs. His estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) is in town for a fire inspection but missed her flight out just before the town is set for a month-long winter without the sun. Soon, they find themselves in the midst of a violent frenzy of hungry vampires.As said before, it all starts promising enough. But then the film takes a disappointing turn somewhere along the way. The tension dissipates when Slade focuses on the handful of survivors as they try to survive the 30 days until the sun finally begins to rise. The plot becomes barely non-existent. Granted, it would be rather harsh to expect of a more intricate storyline for a film of this nature; but there's neither a sense of urgency nor a sense of sympathy for the characters as in, say, Zack Snyder's reworking of ""Dawn of the Dead."" And unfortunately, a bulk of the film is intent on focusing on them. The vampires can repetitively snarl only so much before they start to lose their intimidating factor.The only time the film regains its emotional bearing is towards the end, with a beautiful shot of Eben and Stella against a backdrop of a rising sun. But it would have to take a long time to get there.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Some cool scenes and good acting, but still not one of the best vampire movies","Based on the graphic novel, which I haven't read, 30 days of Night has some effective moments, good acting, intense scenes and great visuals, but it still isn't quite up there with the better vampire movies.Barrow, Alaska, the northern most town in the US, is plunged into 30 days of darkness. Taking advantage of the lack of sunlight for 30 days, a gang of lethal and nasty vampires descend upon the town to feast on the living. It is up to the local sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) to protect the town's dwindling populace against certain destruction.There are quite a lot of effective moments in 30 Days of Night. I like the look of the film as well as the look of the vampires. There are quite a few good scenes as well, but one of the best, and many have stated it here already, is the aerial view of the vampires attacking many of the town's folk who try to fight back with weapons that just don't work on vampires.The acting for a horror movie is also quite good. I actually cared about the good guys. Both Josh Harnett and Melissa George were very effective in their roles, as were the secondary characters. I also have to give the lead villain his due as well. Danny Huston, as the lead vampire Marlow was good. Ben Foster also appears in the movie. He is only known as the Stranger, but he comes to Barrow with a mission as well, which I won't disclose for it may be a minor spoiler.30 Days of night has a lot of good points, but I felt as if some scenes moved a little to slow, and there were some points in the movie that went nowhere. I think if the film had been shorter it would've been better, but these weren't the points that really bothered me as much as two of the characters that do things that make little sense. I can see why they did what they did, but why do things that make it easier for the vampires to get you. One character does something that was a little crazy, but not as disappointing as that of another character. The latter character does something even more far fetched at the end, which leads to a fight sequence which I found hard to swallow. Yes I've heard that this scene is in the graphic novel. Maybe it works in there, but what always works in a graphic comic doesn't always work in a movie. Still, 30 Days of Night was better then most horror films. At least it wasn't just torture porn like so many other films. I think if you are a horror fan you will enjoy this movie. I will award it a C+.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Where's my phone?30 Days of Night,"Here is the next chapter in the graphic novels cum film movement that has been taking over the industry. The ingredients seem pretty foolproof: a revisionist vampire tale screenwritten by the novel's authors, a setting without the sun for thirty days, a hard-r rating, a good cast, and visionary music video director David Slade fresh off his debut feature Hard Candy. 30 Days of Night is a brutal look into a world where the monsters reign supreme with little in their way to slow them down. With stunning cinematography, a beautiful washed out/dark cool color palette, realistic gore with unflinching detail, and a dark empty void of happiness, this one looked like a winner all the way. That is, until the ending. It is a shame that a story as hardcore as this one would take the path it does at the conclusion. Something a bit more tongue-in-cheek or satirical could have easily gotten away with it, but this one deserved to be allowed to run its course of brutality without a convenient finish putting a bittersweet smile on our faces before the lights turned back on, releasing us from the hold of Alaska's darkest moments.I can't say anything bad about the directing. Slade has shown again that style can add a lot to a visionary tale such as this. He is given more room to move as opposed to the two leads, one venue he had for the brilliant Hard Candy, but still closed in enough to be able to create an aesthetic that didn't need to change. The entire film takes place in the town of Barrow, amongst the houses, stores, and streets with the everyone knows everyone cast of locals. The Stranger who treks into town cuts them off from civilization and keeps the director trapped inside as well to find inventive places to shoot. Complete with jerky, frame missing attack scenes, Slade does not disappoint when it comes to eye candy. Close-ups abound and his ability to keep the camera on the casualties while they are chalked up is a bold breath of fresh air. Very few moments are actual scary jolts. This film's true fear creator is in the unabashed view of all the carnage at work.Staying on course, visually speaking, you have never seen vampires depicted quite like this. Their faces are distorted and smooth without blemishes. I have not read the books, so I don't know how much these creatures are manifestations of the artwork, but I couldn't help see the similarities to the beasties in videos by music group Aphex Twin. While the beings I'm thinking of were in the promos by Chris Cunningham, Slade too directed some of the band's work. Not only were the facial structures otherworldlyvery fallen angelbut the blank stares and open mouths they possessed showed a detached side to them as they were only out for blood. This is a dying race not attempting to expand their legions, but instead to just survive. I loved the one bald creature with blood on its face throughout the film. He was so memorable because the blood almost created a five-o'clock shadow on his face.Credit all involved, and the actor himself, for getting Danny Huston into this film. He is amazing as the lead vampire Marlow. I thought the foreign language was a stroke of genius, but it is his mannerisms that really allow the part to succeed. The mouth breathing is foreboding and creepy, dried blood keeps adding upon his face, and his eyes are made up of a continuous blank stare. Someone as accomplished as he is in supporting roles should be commended for taking a role such as this and performing it seriously. This is no Bela Lugosi, as one character says, this is a malicious being out for survival amongst a race that he knows is inferior to his own.As for the other actors, it is a pretty good job across the board. Josh Hartnett is surprisingly competent. I attribute that to the fact that he is mostly shown with a stoic, contemplative face. If there is one thing he does well, that is it. It's usually when he smiles and tries to be mister cool that he falters, but thankfully he never really gets that chance here. Ben Foster shows again that no one can do what he doesno one, and Melissa George shows she is an interesting actress whom I have not been able to see yet. Not quite sure if I liked her completely, but she didn't do anything to make me think I shouldn't have. Also, it's a pleasure to see Mark Boone Junior take on a role that lasts. Too many only have like five minutes of screen time (Batman Begins) and he is better than that.Again, though, the ending just left me cold. Sure what happens as a result stays true to the event, it is just the event itself that made me cringe. Harnett's sheriff must make a decision before his whole town and all he cares about goes up in flames. Up until that point, the movie had been an edge of your seat thrill ride where it seemed that no one was too important to die. I was even starting to smile that I might be getting a fully tragic end devoid of survivors. Unfortunately, the sheriff makes a decision so out of left field that it elicited more chuckles than poignant tears as a more thought out sequence might have. It doesn't totally derail an otherwise solid genre flick, but it does leave just the right amount of bile in your throat to sully what comes before it with a faint bad taste.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
best vampire movie i've seen in awhile,"I went in with low expectations, and this film really surprised me. It's probably one of the best vampire films I've seen in a very long time. I don't want to say too much for those who have yet to see it, but these vampires in the film were unlike any I've seen before. I've read some reviews where people were unimpressed with Josh Hartnett and I don't typically care for him but I thought he did a fine job in this film. I was looking for him to screw it up and I was really impressed with his performance, thought he did a great job. One of the things I love about this film is that it fails to explain a lot of things, I know some people dislike that but I feel that too many explanations usually lead to the downfall of certain films. This was perfect, and I can't wait for it to come to DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
113 minutes of fun,"David Slade did an exceptional work once again and is fast becoming a director from whom we can expect great things in the future.The film has an astounding look due to its excellently worked cinematography.The art direction is also top class while the way the vampires are portrayed adds extra points to it.The movie manages to pass through the feeling of isolation and dread that the characters are supposed to feel and i especially enjoyed the fact that a melancholic touch is present throughout it's duration.The action is intense and the gore strikes true.Additionally,if you are into Josh Hartnett as an actor there is no way you'll be disappointed as he does a high standard job in this film.Finally,it has to be said that for fans of Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and ""Vampires"",""30 Days of Night"" is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than this average rating here suggest,Genuine quite a good watch holes everywhere of course but horror films need to take liberties sometimes but enjoyable all round you probably just won't watch it again but it builds up the atmosphere very well.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Expected so much but yet again disappointed,"The fact that the movie takes place in the cold Alaska where just the sun went down for 30 days would be ideal for any horror movie.Only this should have provided an atmosphere that would creep us out whenever something strange happens. The problem is that the movie never gets scary or creepy even. It never makes good use of the setting. The lack of atmosphere could have been compensated with solid action scenes or building up some kind of tension. Not once did I feel despair or agony. How can we care for the characters if we don't really know them. The vampires appear in numbers and overwhelm the people living in the town. But when things are looking bad for the main characters the creatures just stop and vanish when they easily could have defeated them. This doesn't make any sense. Also we never learn about the vampires. Why are they in Alaska for god's sake? Only one explanation is given but also isn't good enough. There are some surprises in the movie that make the movie stand out a bit. But comes much to late to really enjoy the movie. I was so disappointed with ""30 days of night"" because it could have been so much better. The rare moments that are enjoyable just don't cut it. Very average!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice effort.,"Vampires myth is there in western world for centuries. In Hollywood cinema too they came to existence right from the beginning. In most of the movies the vampires would be seductively attractive ones and seduce their prey and in the time of making love they will bite. Sex and horror mix was there which is an effective thrill.Off late few movies tried to view the vampires myth in different perspectives. Some viewed them as a sect / race. Interview with a vampire even talked about a good hearted Vampire who never killed humans for centuries. John carpenter's vampires moved in a different direction by treating them as just creatures and mainly concentrated on hunting.This movie goes in creatures way. Vampires are not seducing demons but they act like violent were wolfs. They don't do magic. Don't fly. Incapable of acting as innocents. But they make noises as animals, speak some language, even their teeth too just grown enough like an animal, they are strong and effective like a strong wild animal, and they are violent. They live and hunt in groups. Bit cunning in catching their prey. And they are believably effective.The story line is interesting. In the north most Alaskan town sun will not rise for one whole month. Which is a very lovely spot for vampires to live. They come by a ship and start hunting the entire town. One group of people try to survive among these creatures.With this story plot, the movie does not have time to explain character formation etc. Just packed events which were enough for us to be thrilled till the end. There are some painful emotional moments too. The photography was excellent. Acting and music were enough to fit. The sheriff had major part of role in the movie which he does it for good. In the whole movie we see just one sunset at the beginning and one sun rise at the end. The rest is just snow and ice and grayish darkness. It also shows how human will can raise at odds by sacrificing one's self for the sake of the others to survive.If you watch it expecting to see a Vampire similar to the one of a Bram Stoker's Dracula then you get disappointed. It is not horror but thrilling to the end with some gory scenes. It's not a stylish vampire but a raw animal-like vampire that you can enjoy it. Cannot come into a classic list. but a good entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Vampire Movie Since Near Dark,"There are titles in this genre that generally seem to miss the mark. Contrived efforts either made too ""stylish"" and unnecessarily complicated, or too ""over the top"" and laughably unbelievable. The few exceptions that managed to stand the test of time (for me anyways), shared an element of tangibility. Meaning at some point I actually bought that this could be happening while watching it. This was one of those movies, and quite frankly, the first vampire movie to have done so for me since possibly Near Dark.People will name drop several entertaining (if not campy or facetious) romps through the bloodsucker genus to splatter film archives for the latter half of the 20th century - Salem's Lot, From Dusk Till Dawn, Fright Night, Lost Boys, Vampire Hunter D, Interview With The Vampire, Vampires, and the always popular Underworld and Blade trilogies etc, but outside of Nosferatu, Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), and the above mentioned Near Dark, there has been little in the way of anything genuinely frightening about them. 30 Days of Night manages to bring back some of the very raw and chilling elements of a good vampire story.The cast, while never very devoted to the development of any characters, also isn't ""selling"" the cliché archetypes you've come to expect from the recent spate of ""high school horror"" monster/psycho affairs. The acting is surprisingly good by the leads, and to some extent the support (no doubt credit is due to Slade for careful directing here). The first clue this was something to pay attention to was not only the shot selection, but also that the actors themselves aren't caked with make up. Slade wants you to see these people as real, a believable setting you can relate to. The storyline, conceptually, may be the weakest link here. Group of survivors in a town under siege needs to ban together to stay alive, and improvise survival strategies as they go etc etc. Not exactly a high calorie plot for the fiction novel devotee, but rest assured you're never quite sure who makes it. The setting is really the sell point here. Snowed in and locked away with no chance for help in an Alaskan town that sees no daylight for 30 days, it really conveys well, and almost reminds of scenes from John Carpenters remake of The Thing.The ""brood"", or family of vampires really is one of the defining qualities of this movie. There is something so cold, but so unforced about them. There is no Anne Rice script here, no lonely or lost soul you feel compassion for. They've been reduced down to the vampire essence, at the top of the carnivore food chain, speaking an ancient dialect among one another about how to best conduct war on man, to achieve their end to ultimately feed. One aspect I'd like to see become trend is you never feel like the effects get in the way. In perhaps the best use of GGI I've seen in some time, the effects are literally seamless. These almost reptilian hunters use their ability to stalk and hunt the weaker prey. There are no frills, bells, whistles, politics or high drama here. 30 Days of Night is a chilling, and primal human last effort to survive when the Hunters find their prey at their most vulnerable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Give It the Cold Shoulder,"Okay, yes, this is a seemingly big-budgeted horror film(this distinction makes it greatly differ from another big-budgeted film)with loads of blood, guts, unsavory acts of violence toward women and children, and an incomprehensible script if one is looking for any dose of realism at all. Look but in vain for ye shall not find it. What we do know is that Barrow, Alaska, a town in the northernmost part of North America, has a period of one month where it is blanketed in total darkness - 30 days of darkness with no sunlight(just in case the concept was too complex I explained it at its most fundamental level here - kidding of course!). For some unexplained and not-so-inexplicable reason, a horde of foreign-sounding vampires descend on the town as soon as the first day of darkness ensues. What we get then is a period of non-stop hunting - vampires are the hunters and a rag-tag group of Alaskans who chose not to go somewhere else for this period become the prey. We get your usual suspects here. The town sheriff and the girl he broke up with thrust together under bad circumstances. Josh Hartnett and Melissa George play the couple with some conviction. But let's make no mistake, this is not a character driven piece by any standard. We get the crazed loner who rides a bulldozer and several other weird townsfolk we have seen prototypes of for years in film. The vampires look less than impressive and speak some alien language, and the film is decidedly grim with regard to violence and how it is shown. Though I would not recommend this film to the casual horror enthusiast for that specific reason, I did enjoy the film - flaws and all - for its fast-paced action and use of setting as a means of creating mood, theme, and plot in such a refreshing way. The story is wildly inconsistent and the acting mediocre at best, but director David Slade has just enough juice in other ways to make the film work for me in many ways. This is not a real good film nor is it a good film like more mainstream horror pictures you might see - but it is a reminder of the trend of horror today of being graphic, cold, dispassionate, and dehumanizing. It also shows how action and horror - like in Aliens for example - can be fused and work on some level.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stylish and uneven,"This has a fantastic story concept and instead of giving us an action packed survival film, we are given something slightly different. The film has a strong filmmaking style and allows the horror elements to unfold. The central issue I had with the film was the villain and the choice to have the vampires speaking their own language. I feel it robs the film of true menace. I liked the film, but I felt this could've been a better film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lives Up To The Trailer,"I must admit that I have become a bit bored with the latest rash of Vampyre/Vampyrical cinematic attempts. I loved Underworld, but Underworld 2 led us somewhere so totally off the beaten path of the original, it left me cold. If you go all the way back to John Carpenter's Vampires, you'll delve right into some great Vampyre elements of the mythos, and some really creative innovations.There have been good-to-great Vampyre movies since, strewn here and there. But the idea of having only 30 days to feed, each year ... ? THAT is a cool idea. But it's not new. Jeepers Creepers comes to mind ... every 29 years, they get to feed for 29 days. And yet, this film was highly enjoyable.Action, suspense, tense (almost palpable) atmosphere, and believe it or not, believable performances by the cast! Hartnett surprises, but (unfortunately) part of his surprise is that he is the sheriff of this small Alaskan town. I do not know about anyone else, but I seem to have problems believing it. He gave an honest, realistic performance, but I could not buy him as the sheriff. I think it has more to do with his age and memories of him in other parts, than it does with his performance. As I said, his performance is believable ... more so than in anything else in which I have ever seen him, and that is a fact.The execution of the elements was classic. I will refrain from detailing any particular element, as I hate to read a review that spoils everything in a movie, so I rarely write them.I WILL, however, say that there were a few things with which I had a problem. Those things are enumerated below, so proceed at your own risk. They aren't spoilers outright, but a few could be POTENTIAL SPOILERS for someone who doesn't want ANYthing revealed.As I've said, Josh Hartnett did not fit in as the sheriff. I could have much more easily accepted him as a deputy than as the actual sheriff.He always looked too clean to meet the circumstances. They did give him a bit of grime, but nowhere near the amount of gore and dirt one would reasonably expect, under the circumstances.The Vampyres were so visceral. I personally prefer the more romanticized versions, though I could buy into the premise that 1500 years of evolution could/would cause such an animalization of these Beings.The filming during the kills is too ""busy."" The camera moves and the editing is so fast as to make you wonder if the camera man was having some sort of seizure during filming? The overall affect was to make me dizzy, without adding anything of substance to the film, itself. NOTE TO DIRECTORS: Slow it down and give us the graphic sequences you are too afraid to film! At least film alternate ""kills"" for the ""Unrated Director's Cuts"" if you MUST omit it for the PG-13 kiddies! But this was an ""R"" and THIS was the best you could deliver?!The town itself had a ""canned"" feeling, like they filmed this thing on the back lot of some studio, or in a large stadium somewhere. The feeling of isolation is necessary, true enough, but the sense that this was constructed and executed at a location secondary to the place to which we were first introduced, should give one pause. If Sam Raimi could make a mistake like that, no one is infallible.The use of the Infernal Promise, without going into the lore, or the mystery of the Infernal Promise, failed to please. (More on the IP in the next section.) I DID like that they included the Infernal Promise at all. It is used throughout the Vampyre genre with some great effect, but it was never better used than herein. The use of the IP also generated a secondary element I found delightful; that of the Stranger.The Stranger brought with it the sense of foreboding, sealed and personified. It engendered a betrayal on a level to which the average man needs to believe other men are not capable. From his introduction, the viewer knows there is something amiss on the pristine snow-strewn horizon.The use of the weather as a means of confounding the Vampyres' superior scenting abilities (done so subtly, as to negate this as a spoiler), and their method of covering the whole thing up, are both quite ingenious.All in all? I really enjoyed this superior work of thriller/suspense. It is a definite Friday/Saturday night movie, and belongs on the shelves of anyone who enjoys a good Vampyre movie. I categorize this as a thriller/suspense, as the kills are not as graphic as I expected, the blood (while there, laws yes!) is not as prolific as I anticipated, and the gore is at a bare minimum. I'd actually pay to see this again.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this movie until the ending. I would have liked it to be less emotional.If the ending was such that it was a precursor to the sequel, I understand, but then Melissa George should have been in the sequel, and she wasn't, which took rating stars away from that movie too.

Inupiaq people? Not in THIS Barrow!,"I'm married to a native of Barrow, AK who is an Inupiaq (the native population of this town). He said that he's pretty sure that the town of Barrow is going to be in an uproar over this movie once they see it. There's no movie theater in the town so for now the only Inupiaq people who will see this movie are the ones who have moved or are visiting elsewhere.This is the thing; if you're going to set a movie in a real town and that town happens to have a huge native population, then I think that you should show the people of the town some respect and not try to pass off Asians and Maori people as natives. I understand that the film was made in New Zealand but tossing a parka on a Maori does not an Inupiaq make! Native peoples of the world are not interchangeable and to substitute a member of one native population for another is careless and insulting.My husband also pointed out that the vampires' language sounded insultingly close to that of the Inupiaq people, although I doubt that this was intentional (OK, I hope it wasn't intentional!) I am curious to know how this vampire language was developed.As for the movie itself the plot was OK and I was entertained. Most of the reviews on this site cover the details quite nicely. I suppose I was looking at the film from a different point of view.quyanaqpak, eal76",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Guttural Take on Vampires,"Based on Steve Niles' own graphic comic, 30 Days of Night gets into the vampire characterisation down to the core and triumphs because of it. There is nothing glistening about the vampires who have come to Barrow, Alaska to feed. These are ugly, feral, insect like beasts who even speak in their own language (As they should, frankly). The backdrop is a cold snowy town where no daylight is in sight, the population is small, and is about to become smaller with every passing hour.The set-up and execution is done well, antagonists and protagonists introductions are smooth, then the carnage unfolds and we shift into a tense fight as a few souls try and survive through 30 days of night. It's a staple for Vampire movies in my personal opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why does the head vampire look like a man having a mid-life crisis?,"This was an good film. Its a new concept having the setting in Alaska. HOWEVER i can see a pattern emerging. It seems Hollywood etc.. are beginning to exhaust all other settings eg space, forrests, jungles, under water they are now turning to cold places. This is the second horror film set in Alaska in the past year...Overall this is a good film. Its tense and very very bloody and gory and the vampires had a different interesting look to them making them a touch scarier than the traditional ones with fangs. BUT! why the hell did they make the head vampire look like a man having a mid-life crisis? It really really annoyed me. He looked like an average man just with black eyes and fangs i would have thought he would have been the most deformed of them all, it was just a really stupid idea...I'd advise watching this its an interesting look at vampire stories i give it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally vampires with bite! but with little else,"30 Days of Night serves as a pivotal rebirth of the vampire-movie franchise with the premise of archaic, zombie-like, piranha toothed vampires that resurface fear in a genre that hasn't scared since Nosferatu. Despite this though, poor exposition and plot progression had minimized what could have been a fully revitalized fear of vampires.While the film certainly does an excellent job of setting the scene in the otherwise small and isolated town of Barrow, Alaska, locked away in 30 days of night, your more or less presented with a quick blitzkrieg of violence that numbs any perfectly planned tension and suspense that could have otherwise been capitalized.And yes, there is quite the amount of, at times disturbing, violence. This is reflected in the fact that these vampires, while committing horrible atrocities themselves, aren't taken down with splinters of wood and crucifixes, but with extreme force (i.e axes, shot-guns and even earth-moving vehicles).Acting is well done for the most part, especially in the case of Ben Foster's take on a mentally-ill vagrant. Otherwise, Josh Hartnett did an otherwise sufficient role as sheriff, but ultimately didn't serve as a very compelling character.In the end the film implemented the right elements but rushed them on the audience without good use of tension, leading you to be more rattled then actually scared. Perhaps as well, this story was better used as a mini series given the original comic-book it was based on. Somehow covering 30 days over a near-two hour film just didn't pace well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Vampire imagery is rarely portrayed in so savage a style without coming off as violence for violence' sake or just another attempt at the gross-out factor.

Quite slow and off putting,"Nothing completely memorable occurs in this film. The plot is nothing special but the scenery is nice to look at (the winter snow scene is different in zombie/vampire type films). So for one, that makes it stand out somewhat.There are some jump scares but after a while everything becomes repetitive. None of the characters tend to stand out, except perhaps Ben Foster though he isn't in the film too much.Seeing a majority of positive reviews from the top reviews and cannot understand why. A lot of praise about how scary or gory the film is, but the horror really isn't much.There are lots of blood and kills by the vampires and it is gruesome to look at but the majority of it is rather boring.Also the lead character's motive in the end was bizarre and very strange. It made little sense as to why he thought of that after 30 days- as in why didn't he do it sooner.The plot of this movie isn't interesting or engaging enough. The visuals are nice, the vampires aren't exactly intriguing either. Below average film, expected more suspense, more thrills and a more engaging storyline.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Modern Vampire,"This is a very modern day interpretation of the Vampire flick. A remote town in Alaska prepares for 30 days without sunlight and obviously this is ideal for any gang of vampires with 30 nights of free time on their hands.The town shuts down and the vampires waltz into town spilling blood and wreaking havoc all over.The hero of the picture is the town sheriff played by Josh Hartnett and the towns folk, led by the sheriff, gradually decreasing in number, battle for survival as the crew of vampires leave the dead in their wake and seek to eliminate the whole town so's ""not to bring attention to themselves"" quite! It is an enjoyable picture, there's lots of action and shocks to keep the average slasher fan on the edge of their seats. I did have an issue with the fact that the townsfolk, when met with a gang of albeit ""vampire like"" murderers, instantly recall all those tricks for disposing of said murderers from their favourite vampire stories- and lo and behold they are right. Also the passage of time seems to fly by, I found it difficult to believe that the action takes place over the said 30 days.Beyond that its still a good take on the genre. It does lose it's way toward the end and crosses the line between far fetched and downright ludicrous, but then, don't they all? on the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a great addition to the genre, but perhaps some memorable moments","In what began as a good premise failed to live up to anything of the sort. 30 Days of Night is a not that a good addition to this genre and I feel that when making a contemporary vampire film any correlation to the original novels and ideals can be disregarded in favour of making the film more acceptable to current audiences via other tools, prime examples being ""Blade"", ""Night Watch"" and the ever popular ""From Dusk Till Dawn""  30 Days of Night does this, but not intentionally  as although there is mention of sunlight, there is no mention of garlic, crucifixes or stakes etc and no real reason given for not mentioning them. It also lives up to many horror clichés, including the infuriating aspect of giving certain characters depth when their demise is so blatantly imminent, characters threatening the well-being of the others through panic, fleeing thus jeopardising others and reiterating the obvious.The title draws the audience into a false sense of what to expect, as we do not witness 30 days of night as on several occasions the narrative leaps several days leaving the audience questioning the protagonists' endeavours over this time and in doing so fails to attract any real level of isolation. The feeling of isolation was far better tackled in John Carpenters ""The Thing"" (also set in cold, desperate conditions near the arctic circle), as was the subject of vampires in his film of the same name.Evolving from music videos, director David Slade, (Hard Candy) does give us some nice shots and scenes with vampires leaping from rooftops and some well filmed bloodshed - the best of which being the birds-eye tracking shot of the village. It is a very revealing shot, as it not only depicts a sense of isolation and desperation, but also the horror and carnage being experienced by the townsfolk. In fact this and the facial makeup of the vampires were the two real highlights of the film for me. The ending is not, and will leave many people annoyed at its cheesiness.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An good idea made into an OK film.,"This is a good idea for a vampire file, 30 days of night in the Arctic should be perfect. The acting is quite good with Hartnett, George and Boone Junior giving very god performances, the rest of the cast don't have much to do.The characters are mostly likable and mostly behave in a believable way.The vampires are a little over-done in their movements but at least they behave consistently, none of this convenient swap from fast to slow and smart to dumb as the plot requires.There is plenty of action and a few unexpected twists as you go along. The ending is dark and done well without being over-played.The main problem I had with this is that the sense of time isn't kept, the people are supposed to be there for 30 days but don't need to shave or get cabin fever, it might as well have been 1 day of night for all the difference that the 30 days made to the story. There is also the one stupid bit where a building with bright lights, outside and in, and its own power is ignored when so much effort is made to dismantle everything else.Still those minor problems aside it is a nice horror that's easy to sit back and watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Combine ""The Thing"" and ""Near Dark"" and you get 30 Days of Night","I saw the midnight show of this movie and although it wasn't packed I was surprised at the turnout. I did not expect to have more than 10 people show up but I would say that at least one hundred people came to see a movie about a bunch of vampires.This movie was marketed as ""redefining the vampire mythos."" The graphic novel in which this movie was based certainly was groudbreaking and I must admit I agree with its proclamation. ""30 Days of Night really did a good job of staying away from the cliché vampire moments that a majority of the recent movies with vampires have followed. No kung fu fighting...which was a breath of fresh air. Far too often you find vampire movies in which all of the bloodsuckers (even newly turned ones) instantly have a 3rd degree black belt. Very frustrating... this movie does not have any of that.What this movie does have are scenes that probably will not scare or shock you but they do stick with you long after you leave the theatre. I won't mention those moments obviously but you will know what I am talking about. Unless you have not read the graphic novel of course. And even if you have the movie still has scenes that were not in the graphic novel.The vampires were not your traditional romantic eyed strangers that seduce their victims...Oh no. They were grotesque in their appearance, animalistic in the way they fed and they even spoke in a eery language. The villains in movies such as this either make or break it, well the villains certainly made the movie what it professes to be...""a new take on the vampire mythos.""Even Josh Harnett pulled out a very good performance as the movie's hero. Not a big fan of his, but whomever casted him did a very good job. The other actors did not wow me but they didn't take anything away from the movie. The main vampire was not as scene stealing as he should have been but his ""minions"" made up for that.The biggest flaw in the movie was that there were scenes in the graphic novel that should have been in the movie, key scenes but besides that, the movie was definitely one to remember. I gave this movie a high rating comparing it to other movies in its genre. I think it is right up there with ""Lost Boys and Near Dark"" as one of the best vampire tales ever. When you see it, go in there with an open mind and prepare yourself for a very entertaining, albeit gruesome, movie going experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense and frosty survival horror,"This movie is a very interesting vampire movie settled in a cold town in Alaska where strange people live, a little bit like ""The barber"".The only thing that I found bad about this movie is that it was too fast obvious that vampires had infiltrated the city. It would have been more interesting to let the viewers in the doubt of what happened, as it could have also been a serial killer or a criminal organization that committed the first crimes. As you now quite fast that vampires have organized that, there is a lack of tension after the very interesting and dark beginning of the movie. I must also admit that this movie basically doesn't add something new to the genre. Those two minor factors are the reasons why I cut some points off the rating.But at least, this movie turns then quite fast into an entertaining and intense survival story where everybody desperately tries to save his soul and reflect about his life. There are many intense scenes like the old and isolated guy who gives his life to save his comrades, the guy who got bitten by a child vampire and asks the other ones to kill him or the main actor who tries desperately to save his ex-girlfriend to prove her that he still loves her and wants her back. Another good point is the dramatical and uneasy ending of the movie that is as dark as the whole film's atmosphere. There is a lot of tension in this movie and you really begin to like the desperate and morbid atmosphere in the lost village and can somehow identify with all of this.To sum it up, this movie is an intense and atmospheric vampire movie and survival horror with credible actors and some shocking scenes. This movie might please to anyone who likes the horror genre and is the best horror movie of the year 2007 in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Formulaic, horror-by-numbers.","A two hour movie, set over the course of 30 days, but feels like it takes years of your life to watch.A rushed horror-by-numbers I'm afraid. The type whereby the characters are so shallow and frankly annoying that after half an hour or so you find yourself actually rooting for the crazed bloodthirsty villains.This movie may have been better if the cringeworthy clichès and lack of atmosphere had been embraced with a more tongue-in-cheek vibe. As it is, it's just another entry in the already stuffed catalogue of unoriginal and empty modern horror movie failures.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
really first-rate,"This is one of the best vampire movies of modern times. I don't want it to be because it is based on a graphic novel, and that just seems ""cheap"" or ""lowbrow"" to me. But nevertheless it is very good. Josh Hartnett and Melissa George give excellent performances as usual. The script and direction are first rate and the story lends itself perfectly to the film medium, despite its origins. The vampire genre is a tough one to stay fresh in but this films manages that (to be fresh) and also very scary. The ending is somewhat of a letdown, but this is part and parcel of the vampire genre I think. I checked out its sequel and that mess doesn't have a fraction of this film's class.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Total waste of 2 hours and $7.50,"I'm not going to write a long review because I've already wasted two hours of my life on this absolutely horrible movie. Suffice it to say it was not scary at all and anyone who says it is either smoked crack through the entire movie or they are kids who paid to see another movie and sneaked into this one. Do not waste your money on this one. You've been duly warned. This movie was such crap that my wife now wants to warn you as well.I am a lover of horror movies, always have been, always will be. My husband went on this site and read me some of the reviews here, and we were mutually impressed by the good reviews. This movie proved to me, yet again, horror movies have gone on a downward spiral and movie makers have their work cut out for them to really put the horror back in a movie. I felt this movie had too many places you could see it wanted to be scary, it just wasn't for me. I have not one good thing to say about this movie, I was looking forward to day 30 to say the least. To top it all off, we paid full price to it and had nothing but loud cell phone user, teen daters, loud laughers (im sorry was this a comedy???!!!) in the crowd.

A Good Flick,"This movie has a lot going for it. Start off with a great idea - Alaska's near endless night provides a playground for vicious vampires to reign. Beyond that, they back it up with some nice cinematography, good acting, and a decent story.I can't say that I loved the film, but I did enjoy it. It's head and shoulders above the vampire films I'm used to seeing. Though it never wowed me, it was consistently interesting and never dull. Well produced in every respect.I have to rate this film a 6/10. After Bloodrayne, it may deserve a ten.A quality piece of work.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbing and scary vampire/zombie-like scarefest...,"1st watched 1/15/2009, (Dir-David Slade): Disturbing and scary vampire/zombie-like scarefest about a foreign speaking group of bloody folks who overtake a town in Alaska during the 30 days of night experienced by this area during every winter. The small group left to fight or hide(really) from the predators all know each other, of course, because they live in a very small town. The sheriff, played by Josh Hartnett, is also the leader and makes the decisions necessary to survive. This type of movie definitely has been done before and in some ways it resembles ""Night of the Living Dead"" movies, except the vampire/zombies are more disgusting and speak(although it's in a foreign tongue  from what country we don't know). It's also similar to this movie in that the survivors realize that waiting things out is better than blasting the ghouls with a bunch of firepower. If they wait 30 days then the sun will come and burn them up and they're used to the winters around there so it shouldn't be that difficult, right?? Well it's not that easy and, of course, we get many opportunities to see the creatures suck the blood and devour their next victim. I guess the reason I liked this movie is because it does what it intended to do,, scare you!! The creatures aren't that smart --- for some reason they don't check the attics where the people are hiding out and they aren't that unique when it comes to movie creatures but they are scary. This one factor is really what measures these type of movies, so if you can handle the blood and gore, enjoy it!!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blood on the snow,"This is a decent vampire movie.Do not expect to get scared like hell,but it has it's fair share of chills.All the perfect examples of a supernatural setting are present.Remote Alaskan town,Desolation,Loss of contact with the external world,Stranger speaking in an Eastern European accent asking for fresh meat,dead dogs,and above all 30 days of night.The are quite a few preludes before the actual bloody mayhem but the first sense of real uneasiness sets in when Sheriff Eben Oleson actually confronts 'Something'which is faster than his vehicle and the film takes off from this point.Josh Hartnett has done a commendable job in portraying the helplessness of a protector who is not having many choices but will simply not give up hope.The character of Beau Brower(Mark Boone Junior) serves as a perfect foil to the Sheriff's determination of not giving up without a fight.Tough as a nail, Beau never seems to be afraid of the Vampires.He knows they can be killed too.The cold, the night and the claustrophobia are harbingers of the death lurking outside the hideaway of the survivors.The killings are brutal and gory, but most of them can be anticipated.The horror surprise elements are not that much.The culmination of the movie is also strange and a bit hard to digest.But overall its worth viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Brilliant,"One of my favourite vampire movies, 30 Days Of Night has bite and with that bite comes lashings of blood. When a town is plunged into a yearly period of total darkness, vampires descend onto the town for dinner, hut the strong willed town's people aren't going down without a fight. Melissa George and Josh Hartnett are exceptional as a recently split couple, this relationship doesn't burden the vampiric excitement, it enlivens it, putting you in fear for their lives, and the situation develops their characters. The camera-work pans slowly stirring tension, and the bloodthirsty vamps jump out regularly so you'll shudder quite a lot. You'll have fun with 30 Days Of Night, it totally brings fresh blood to the genre and is a breathe of fresh air amongst all the Twilight madness.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something new ... Scary Vampires!,"There are many different cinematic varieties of Vampires. From the archetypal Dracula of Christopher Lee complete with cape to the much more sensually erotic creatures envisioned by Anne Rice. From the the cyberpunk bloodsuckers of Blade to the party animals of Tarantino's classic From Dusk Til Dawn. For me at least, the Vampires in 30 Days Of Night really hit the mark. They are nothing short of relentless killing machines. There is a rarely portrayed ferocity in their attacks and their feeding. These are the types of vampires that makes the Hammer versions look positively appealing! They're Scary! But I'm going to be straight here - this film certainly isn't going to win any Acadamy Awards. Not that its a bad film - far from it - but (other than the vamps) it doesn't really have anything new to offer the audience.The acting is competent. Both Harnett and George put in good performances and the support is good. The lead vampire steals every scene he's in. But that could be because he looks like a demented Neil Tennant from the Pet Shop Boys! The story motors along at a healthy pace and the shocks are there to keep you on your toes. I was caught out a couple of times and paid the price by seeing my heart rate rocket! It will make most people jump a few times and there's enough blood to keep the attention of the gore-happy.My only major concern was the film rating. In the UK it is 15. There are a couple of scenes in the film that i wouldn't want my 15 year old kids watching. So any parents out there please be aware that IMHO the censor slipped up.All in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film. Its a welcome addition to the genre and is one that i'll be picking up on DVD.Well worth seeing! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

TERRIBLY WRITTEN w/ awesome vampires,"OK. The guy before me said this: ""the realistic reactions from the characters made me feel like i wasn't watching some trashy cheesed out horror flick."" What the f***. Apparently we weren't watching the same movie. I went to this movie expecting a grisly blend of 300-style cinematography/action sequence and 28 Days Later-style plot/atmosphere. I was incredibly disappointed. Apparently Steve Niles has never left his home, because he has NO idea how real people speak or behave. In terms of dialogue, this is the absolute WORST movie I've seen in a very long while. I laughed the whole time. Shame on Sam Raimi for attaching his name to such garbage. On the bright side, the cinematography was incredibly well done, and the vampires were damn creepy. However, this simply could not make up for how horribly written the entire movie was.

Slow at times, over paced at others, an inconsistent snore-fest where the dumbest ever vampires encounter the dumbest ever humans for the right to test the viewers patience.Whispered scenes of barely audible, unrelenting tedium are interspersed with sporadic yet predictable gore.

"Despite Some Bad Casting, a Well-Made Film","In Barrow, Alaska the sun sets for an entire month and the villagers are given 30 days of night... most of them are smart enough to leave for Anchorage, giving this town a population of 152 brave souls. But this year, they have visitors: a clan of ancient vampires has staked out the town and wants nothing more than to spend the next thirty days gnawing and clawing through every living thing in sight. How do you kill the undead?This film received some unbelievably high ratings. For my first viewing (in the theater), I was expecting a decent but not amazing film... with the excessive level of advertising, I had to figure they were going to inflate the box office numbers (something often reserved for less than wonderful films). I left the theater unfulfilled: a film that seems to have one of the best ideas imaginable made by a team that seemingly did not know how to make a horror film. Too stylized, too clean...We have Josh Hartnett as Eben Oleson and Melissa George as Stella Oleson, the husband-wife sheriff combination, who are having marital problems. They are just annoying. The pretty boy marries the pretty girl and they run the town full of ugly people? Thanks, Hollywood. Oh, they have family problems but are forced to love each other by a crisis? Thanks, Hollywood. Oh, Hartnett is going to be clean-shaven and wearing a light coat in sub-zero temperatures so he looks cute? Thanks, Hollywood. By far some of the worst casting...The vampires were a major problem for me. They walk around with blank stares on their faces, over-acting their parts (what are those faces). The leader occasionally spouts a line of nonsense philosophy. They screech and screech non-stop. Okay, I get it, you screech. You are annoying me. And they run really fast (which would not be bad, except a sizable bulk of the action happens so fast you never see it). I prefer sleek, intelligent vampires (Anne Rice or Bram Stoker variety) over ravaging monsters.I am also unsure about the ""thirty days""... the film really only takes place over about four days. Where are the other twenty-six? Apparently they sit for five days, act on one day, and sit for another five days. Am I really to assume no one tries to fight the vampires for long periods of time? I understand the concept was ""thirty days"" but this really did not play into it (nobody was starving or thirsty, for example).I have ripped on it enough, let me say a few good things: Ben Foster plays the Stranger. I am not sure if I loved his acting, but I loved his character, and could have used more development on him. Early on he comes across as a Crazy Ralph knock-off, talking about death, doom and gloom. But he becomes a Renfield-like character and gets interesting. I wanted more of this, but never really got it.The music was good -- actually very good (I liked the battle march), and as my colleague Greg Roberts says, the cinematography was nice. I do not know about great, but one scene really stood out as awesome -- an overhead shot of the city being destroyed. It was amazing and made me want to play a video game version of this film. There is also a good shot of what an ax does to a man's head, but that only made me wonder why I did not get more of that action if they were capable.The most bittersweet scene was with a vampire girl. Children are good villains, especially evil vampire children. But they did not keep her around very long and introduced her with the most off-putting, unnatural line in the film (""Want to play with me now?""). I could understand maybe ""Anyone else want to play?"" or ""I want to play with someone else"", but her self-referencing herself as having turned into a killer was just really stupid and poorly delivered.Give me this film with more blood, more shots of actual violence (instead of doing it lightning speed or off the screen), less family drama, less slow build up. And do not give me Hartnett and George without at least dirtying them up (though I admit Hartnett was great in ""Black Dahlia""). This film had more potential than most films coming out today, but squandered it all to be a Hollywood film.Update: Apparently my memories are fonder than my first impression. I went to my second viewing at House of Horrors in Oshkosh and sat down recalling a flawed but overly enjoyable film. After it was over, it was even better than I remembered. Reading this review, I am not sure what caused me to be so harsh on a David Slade and Sam Raimi film. I still think the casting was bad and the girl vampire was stupid, but the overall vampire feel is good and the cinematography is breath-taking. I had to bump this review up just a notch or two.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
CG effects and cheap scares are getting very old...,"I have never been a huge fan of Josh Hartnett but I will give him credit for doing an above average job in the role of his character, in other words, without Hartnett...this movie would have completely bombed. There are way too many 'cheap scares', for instance, a victim is walking at a distance and all of the sudden there is a black figure that flashes by on the screen (very closely I might add) accompanied by a thunderous thud noise thats incorporated to create the grisly 'cheap scare' that usually will get a jump out of people (people that haven't seen this trick a million times before that is). There are a lot of questions left unanswered to me, such as, what is the vampires' business in Barrow, Alaska? (Besides the 30 days of night thing which I can understand), is the rest of the world in chaos because of these vamps? I would have appreciated a little more of a background on their history so I could fully understand the whole spectrum of things, but maybe I'm asking for too much huh? There are too many people being introduced (without names of course) which further complicates the character development issue. We just see their faces and some brief dialogue but for the most part these people are introduced so quickly that when they do get attacked, we don't really have anything to care for them about, kinda like their just cardboard cutouts being sucked dry of their blood. The CG effects are just ridiculous, they are in an abundance folks! I in short did not find this movie A. scary B. suspenseful or C. intriguing by any standard, the only one thing holding the reins together for this film is, yes folks, Josh Hartnett. 3 out of 10 stars because of Hartnett's performance alone.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best partial beheading...ever!,"I'll start withThe bad:-It starts off slow in what may have been an attempt to build atmosphere and character development, but it didn't really work for me. -The random kills scattered through the first half weren't great, either. I would've rather seen a single shot of the action instead of many jump cuts - it would've been much more disturbing and horrifying. -The token little (vampire) girl saying, ""Wanna play with me?"" was a failed attempt to be scary. It could've earned points for showing her get killed on screen. -The vampires' dialogue was cheesy.The good:-Easily the best decapitation I've ever seen in a film, horror or otherwise. The camera is right in there for the best possible shot, and the make-up effects are flawless and incredibly realistic. Up until this point the gore had been lacking, but this made it all worthwhile for a gore aficionado like myself. Really - it knocks DAY OF THE DEAD out of my previous top gore scene. -Like Slade's previous film, HARD CANDY, it was shot beautifully. Several shots reminded me of paintings - stylish, morbid paintings. -One particularly impressive overhead shot carries you over a street of the town as vampires slay their prey in splashes of blood against the snow. -The beautiful ending (I won't give it away). I wasn't expecting to be moved as much as I was.30 DAYS OF NIGHT was definitely worth seeing. I'll probably buy it when it comes out on DVD. It's safe to say that this is the most well-made vampire movie I've seen (although I haven't seen many). I have a feeling that it'll be ranked up there with the heavyweight hard- hitting survival horror films one day, such as DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE THING.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"a deep, dark and depressing way to end 2007","From the trailers 30 days of Night looked like a good Vampire movie however with an out landish plot I decided to go ahead and check it out anyway. Set in the desolate and isolated town of Barrow in Alaska close to the Artic circle, 30 Days of Night is about a group of Vampires who decent on the town and its people after the town is plunged into darkness for a month. The good part about this movie is that well it was the right time of the year to realise it with the 'coldness' to it. The film did not waste anytime getting into the action as well most of these people are going to die anyway so who cares however Josh Harnett who I agree with most people was a little too young for this role but I felt that he carried him-self well. There was a miserable and depressing tone throughout the movie which really help set the mood and a very clever use of film colours which made one feel the harshness of the Arctic circle. For truly the real stars of the shows had to be the Vampires! not only was the interaction top-notch but also they didn't behave like Bella Lugusi ! These lot were fierce , savage and brutal and it was brilliant watching them on screen with a genuine creepiness to the way they howl (guess they don't like the cold either) and some great killing styles which made you jump here and there, with an eerie silence you didn't know where the would strike from. Having said the problems occur with the story , its starts of good but then feels rushed and messy and at one point we lose track of what is going on. Robert Kneepper still reminds me of Tea Bag out of prison break and the camera work just feels like a child was doing it and although the dim colouring did help it became a little too dark to follow in most places. Another thing was towards the end it just felt rush because it seemed that Evan knew a little tooo much about the Vampires?...when did he become Blade ? To conclude 30 Days of Night is truly big on the entertainment value however having said that it has its share of faults but if willing to see past them it is a good , brutal , fast movie and a good edition to the Vampire genre. Defientley worth a look at when it hits the rental stores.30 DAYS OF NIGHT : 7.8 OUT OF 10THEY HAVE LIVED IN THE SHADOWS, THEY ARE THE LAST OF THEIR KIND, BUT IN THE ARTIC CIRCLE, WHERE NIGHT NIGHT LAST FOR 30 DAYS...

"""You ain't gonna eat me!""","Sheriff Josh Hartnett tries to defend his isolated Alaskan town against a gang of vampires that strike during the annual period where the town experiences 30 days of night. A very cool idea for a horror movie, based on a comic book, that never quite reaches its potential. It's entertaining enough but not scary. Director David Slade cares more about action sequences of vampire attacks and people fighting them off than build a terrifying atmosphere. The movie has two basic speeds: too slow or too fast. It never manages to find a perfect balance.Josh Hartnett does a fine job despite seeming too young for the role of a sheriff that a whole town respects and looks to for leadership. Melissa George, Manu Bennett, and Mark Boone Junior are among the other 'good guys' that stand out. The vamps are led by Danny Huston, who is neither charismatic or frightening enough to make an impact. Ben Foster gives a wonderfully hammy turn as a Renfieldesque character who gets most of the movie's best lines. The direction is uninspired and I can't help but wonder how much better this could have been with a director at the helm with more style. Sam Raimi was one of the producers of this and I can only imagine how much more visually interesting the movie would've been had he directed it. It's an enjoyable movie but, like I said, I think it had potential to be something more. As it is, it's a nice popcorn horror flick with a decent cast and an interesting backdrop that goes on a little too long.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Almost the stupidest vampires ever,"Usually in a vampire flick I find myself rooting for the vampires because the people are stupid. Instead, I found myself rooting for the end of the film. The vampires were MORONS! They hissed everywhere they went, they looked stupid, they went after their prey like they were canine, and they had STUPID dialogue in a STUPID made-up language. For some reason at the beginning of the movie they cut away from blood and gore, while at the end they showed it in its full. The only reason for that had to be budget, because it added immensely to the inconsistency of the film. The idea for the ending while unique was too short and low-budget. If you want to see a good vampire flick stick to the oldies...Dracula with Bela Lugosi, The Lost Boys, Nosferatu (Klaus Kinski), or even the Ultraviolet series. Save yourself the cash.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overall excellent movie,"I have only reviewed one other movie and that was the Emily Rose disaster. This film couldn't be more different or much better than the old re-hashed vampire cliché. I see a lot of people on here claiming the ""plot"" isn't fulfilling. ITS A HORROR MOVIE NOT RAINMAN. The last good horror I saw with a comprehensive plot was...... wait there has never been one. If you want a logical explanation of why there are vampires in the world, or a resolution to their eons of persecution, go rent Stoker's Dracula. This ain't the love story that put you to sleep - I promise. I see others claiming it wasn't scary. My friends it was as scary as any movie I have ever seen. After being disappointed so many times at the box office, I am finally satisfied. In short this movie will satisfy you if you want to watch a horror. Especially a vampire horror. This is extremely well produced with a REAL budget and expertise. Raimi's best work, better than Signs and The Village put together. A 9 instead of a 10 due to the over use of the shaky camera or what I call nausea-vision.

Not enough gratuitous violence and no nudity,"30 Days of Night is a standard vampires-attacking-a-remote-town movie with the gimmick of the far-northern Alaskan setting that provides the condition of the title. See, because vampires can't exist in direct sunlight - bet you didn't know that - so thirty consecutive days without sunlight would be like heaven to them. But that's about it as far as originality for this by-the-numbers gorefest, although the thick arched eyebrows of Josh Hartnett provide some measure of entertainment.Barrow, Alaska is the northernmost point in the United States, and as previously noted in Insomnia, that area of the world is plunged into darkness for an entire month of every year. This is useful for the purposes of the story here, because it provides an deadline for the denouement - the vampires have to be out of there before the sun rises again. So our intrepid hero and his motley gang of scruffy, bundled-up citizens have a full month to deal with their vampire infestation.Sheriff Eben Oleson (Hartnett) is the small-town Johnny Law whom everyone knows and likes, although he keeps his feelings close inside, as most squinty-eyed, jut-jawed heroes do. On the last day of actual sunlight, he's busy making sure everyone's doing okay and is prepared for the coming darkness. Then he runs into a weird man known only as The Stranger (Ben Foster) who obliquely warns everyone that ""they"" are coming that evening, when night falls. Who are they? Superstrong vampires, that's who, and don't think they'll stop until they consume every last drop of your blood, or turn you into one of them. (The last part didn't make a lot of sense to me - why create someone who'll just be competition for food?) No hero is complete without some love interest, so we get Stella (Melissa George), Eben's ex-wife. They're attempting a separation, but naturally Stella - through hopelessly contrived events - is unable to depart the town before the last plane leaves. (How come no flights can arrive or depart the airport when it's dark out? The town has electricity. Maybe they can, but the plot wouldn't permit it.) So she and Eben are stuck together, arguing over who gets to save the town. Seriously. On more than one occasion, Stella says, ""I'm coming with you!"" - no way she's gonna let him do it alone! - and most of the time Eben overrules her, but not always, because he's a Thoughtful Hero as well.And to underscore Eben's emotional ties to the community, we're also introduced to his kid brother Jake, who looks to be young enough to be Eben's son. True to the genre, Jake desperately seeks the approval of his successful (to a point) older brother, and he tries to save the town as well. But no, he's not old enough, and Eben is responsible for him, and darned if some kid's gonna be the hero instead of him! So there's that.The movie leans rather heavily on its setting to move the plot along; the special effects are rather ho-hum, and the acting is weak. And it's not that Hartnett can't act - he's actually developing into quite the fine thesp - but here he's just sort of drifting along like a windblown snowpile. George is cute and perky and occasionally serious, but she too isn't quite up to the task. And that's perfectly okay if your leading man is charismatic or if the special effects wow the audience so much that they don't notice the wooden performances, but here that's not the case. You wind up turning your eyes to the gore that you'd expect to see in a vampire movie, but the gore isn't even especially interesting or vicious. Some scenes are disturbing, though; turns out the only way to kill a vampire is by beheading it, as guns apparently have little effect on them. Which doesn't stop at least one suicidal maniac from shotgunning several bloodsuckers in order to give his fellow humans some cover.Bottom line: Good, interesting concept, dreary execution. The movie's based on a series of graphic novels, and my assumption is that the novels themselves had more character and pizazz on the page than this movie does on the screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Time flies,"I haven't read the comic, and I'm not sure I knew it existed at all until I heard about this film. While by no means a classic, it is good, exciting fun, and the conclusion is fairly cool. The vampires(who have their own unique language) are creepy, eerie, cheesy and hammy. This is a proper R-rated horror flick, something we have *not* seen anywhere near enough of recently. It's pretty reminiscent of the recent Dawn of the Dead remake(2004) in tone and enjoyability factor, and one could compare this to John Carpenter's The Thing for the snowy, isolated aspect. The pace is fairly fast, and this has tension, and a little suspense. Editing and cinematography are well-done, with some use of hand-held camera. The dialog can be funny. There are jump-scares, and this is genuinely entertaining, engaging and effective, and delivers what it promises. The acting varies a tad, and other than Huston, this does suffer somewhat under there being no powerhouse performances. I like Melissa George(who, as Alias showed us, can put on a convincing American accent), and I don't have a problem with Hartnett, however, neither of them manage to carry this all that well. The FX are marvelous. This doesn't have a lot of backstory, and the plot may not hold up to close scrutiny, but if you just want popcorn cinema, this will do nicely. There is a ton of bloody, gory violence and a bit of strong language in this. The DVD comes with 72(not 79, as the cover claims) minutes worth of well-done, interesting and informational featurettes and quite a few trailers. I recommend this to anyone else who likes this particular guilty pleasure of a sub-genre. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I don't see it.,"I know some of my friends and a lot of vampire enthusiasts loved this film, but I don't see it. This whole plot just seems like a vampire re-hash of Night of the Living Dead (and Alive to a lesser extent). I found nothing original in this film other than the geographic location. That gimmick actually failed to click on a lot of levels for me, because it makes the whole film seem like it takes place over one night. I saw little evidence of the passage of time other than Hartnett's facial hair.The other aspect that failed for me was the romance/sub-plot. I kept wondering why they dabbled into the divorce/separation and never really addressed it. Did they not have enough freaking time in that attic to get their personal business out in the open?

Did nobody have any garlic?,"Barrow is an Alaskan town that is plunged into darkness for 30 days every 12 months. Whilst the townspeople are prepared for this what they hadn't banked on was a group of blood thirsty vampires who start to take the residents out one by one...30 Days Of Night is simplistic and old-fashioned in terms of its approach; vampires arrive and start killing people one by one leaving a trail of bodies and pools of blood in their wake. What this all leads to its a fairly pacey film with plenty of unpretentious thrills and spills. Director David Slade does a really good job here; the vampires are seemingly unstoppable and this creates a sense of peril for the remaining survivors as they try to figure out how to overthrow their much stronger and faster adversaries.Although it provides plenty of gore and old-school thrills there are a few problems with the film; for a start, there's no real backstory with the vampires; who are they? Where did they come from? At one point the leader of the vampires mentions they've been waiting for centuries for this, but why and where had they been? Another weak link lay with the characters; Hartnett is not the best of actors and doesn't do a great job in crafting out much of a character here (although I did warm more towards him as the film progressed). The other characters also failed to add much to the film making barely memorable contributions.Still if you're just looking for some old-fashioned gore, thrills and 100 minutes of escapism then, despite some of my reservations, you should find plenty to enjoy about 30 Days Of Night.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 Days of Night makes a journey through hell a joyful fright,"When you have to ask yourself if you want to see a Vampire movie, you know there is a good chance you may not want to. But you, that particular person, should watch the trailer. Watch that scene of the vampire on the top of the SUV. Notice the style with which that scene is shot. Doesn't it give you a feeling of nostalgia in a way? Perhaps that scene gives you memories of ""vampire movies when vampires seemed real"". Memories of what was scary was the vampire itself and not just what it does. I am here to tell you that is the case with this movie.I was caught up in trying to understand this vampire movie from the start. In the opening, the one lonely man trekking across the snow covered tundra - is he villain or victim? And what was it behind him as well as ahead of him? How do puny humans defeat creatures that feed on fear and blood when they have so little to give them help or hope? It's a story in a nearly barren snow covered village that empties out once a year because it is that time when everyone knows they will not see the light of day for 30 days. A few remain, willingly or not. Some will see the light of day and some will not, nor should they.This is not just one that offers you blood by the case. You get that and talent that doesn't go to waste. The talent is in the writing, cinematography, direction, makeup and performances. These vampires were going to take care of business and had no time for fancy kung-fu or flashy dialogue. They wanted blood, they smelled blood and they took blood.While there were slow periods which gave me time to think to myself, ""Hmm, that's Josh Hartnett"" and a couple lines that made me wonder, ""Hey, where is Josh Hartnett"", I left the movie thinking, ""Hey, that was Josh Hartnett and he was great!"". But you will give credit to all the actors in this movie. I loved watching Melissa George, Mark Boone(Flass from Batman Begins), Ben Foster(Charlie Prince in 3:10 to Yuma) and all the very creepy vampires who reminded me why vampires scared me when I was a kid. An especially creepy vampire was Danny Huston who played the head vampire, Marlow. Danny Huston, in my opinion, gives Bela Lugosi a run for his blood money.Thank you director David Slade(whose Hard Candy I will have to see now) and Writer Stuart Beattie(Pirates of the Caribbean).8 of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: 30 Days of Night,"While we're about a month away from the season of good tidings and the new year, what we have lined up for the next 4 weeks or so are 4 cinematic releases that deal with zombies, the supernatural and the undead. We have been teased with Aliens Vs Predators again in a town where the humans stand in their way and become sacrificial pawns. We have Will Smith in I Am Legend being the last man on Earth fending off strange creatures in the night. We have a group of shoppers stuck in a supermarket when Stephen King unleashes The Mist on them. And I actually enjoyed the latter 2 trailers for having adopted some bars off Clint Mansell's soundtrack for The Fountain (will we see more, since Requiem's was used ever so often).And the competition amongst them starts with 30 Days of Night, adapted from a graphic novel, which tells of the small town on Barrow in the northernmost part of Alaska having to go through 30 days without sunlight in winter, and those who can't stand the cold and the thought of living without sunlight, have opted to leave. It's pretty much business as usual, until a bunch of vampires decide to crash in and feast. And this is the beginning of one of my gripes about the film, as hokey as how the Superman comics team dreamt up of Doomsday - it just appears, with zero thought about justification and the whys and the hows. Um, so we're to believe that this group of super bloodsuckers led by Danny Huston's Marlow have been idling for centuries somewhere on Earth where the sun doesn't shine, before deciding that they have to respond to that rumble in the stomach.So once you can believe that, and the thought of it dismissed by a one-liner, it's a pretty gory vampire flick on most accounts. They're infused with 28 Days/Weeks styled speed and utter craving for plasma, and as a team, their moves are very keenly calculated. Thinking it's hip to invent languages, we learn Vampire-speak too, though most of the time their fangs get in the way of their pronunciation, so they sound like they're choking on thick clotted blood. Watching the way they dispatch their sorry victims, even though the camera cuts away just at the point of teeth plunging into jugular veins like how rabid dogs attack, you still feel a frightening chill when the view comes back to jolting bodies having their liquids sucked dry, and those scenes are disturbing, even after you leave the theatre. Those fingernails cum talons too provide our vampires with a facial weapon, and how you wish they use it to silence themselves each time they lapse into their orgasmic shrieks.Director David Slade of Hard Candy fame knows how to create tension and horror without showing you much, and that happens to be a plus point with its extremely patient build up, and the heightening of suspense. You have to tip your hat at him for crafting a very quiet movie at crucial scenes, so much so that the audience lend their ""Ssshhhhs"" not to tell fellow audience to keep quiet, but aimed at the characters themselves to remain like little mice lest they get detected. 30 Days of Night is a very grey movie in mood, tone and the weather, with occasional white landscapes littered with splatters of crimson, and with Slade just loving to provide us overhead views of the town run aground by rampaging monsters.The humans here though behave like typical vampire movie fodder. The bigger the ensemble, the more victims it can provide, not counting anonymous folks seen being victims from afar. Josh Hartnett's Sheriff Eben plays hero as he leads his bewildered town kinsman to survive through this 30 days of mayhem before the sun shines again, while trying to work out his estranged relationship with wife Stella (a very pouty Melissa George from Turistas, and I still say she's a dead ringer for Estella Warren!). As usual, you have a team of misfits feeding off each other's strength in a quest for survival, and a theme such as Sacrifice is never too far away from movies like these.But what I felt was a let down to its build up, was the unsatisfying ending, which left a bitter aftertaste with its abruptness and inability to resolve anything substantial. It also didn't allow for any sympathy for the victims as you would sometimes find yourself rooting for another kill just to satisfy your blood lust, also because little time is given for you to get to know those characters. As the humans learn that guns do zilch to their targets, there goes all hope, and try as they could to get creative in turning the tables, it boiled down to keeping it simple. Oh, and if you enjoyed the supermarket scene, I'd bet it served as a precursor to The Mist.30 Days of Night could have been a lot more, but unfortunately left some bits to be desired. If you truly want to enjoy this new age vampire movie, then I suggest leaving any inquisitiveness at the door, as the movie offers no answers nor clues to answer your whys. Perhaps a reading of the graphic novel might help.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Severely Disappointing,"Let me start off by saying, I was very excited to see this movie. I have been counting down the days all month until the release of 30 Days of Night. Who wouldn't be after the amazing TV spots and Sam Raimi producing the picture? Well, unfortunately this movie was a let down. The movie starts off slow and continues on this path for pretty much the entire time you're in the theater. There is essentially no back-story or character development. After reading an interview with Melissa George where she stated that they spent a lot of time with character development, I was under the impression there was going to be almost too much. Alas, there was virtually none. At times, the story seems very inconsistent with the way characters act. However, I was very impressed with the cinematography. The snow and ice were beautifully shot and the town was everything a gritty, Alaskan town should be. Unfortunately, this was one of very few enjoyable parts of the movie. Admittedly, it does pick up the last 20 minutes of the movie; but by this time, you have already lost interest. If you do buy tickets to this movie, come an hour late: this is the only way to somewhat salvage the experience. Wait until this movie comes out on DVD.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely One Of My  Favourite Vampire Movies.,"I loved this movie. It's extremely violent and bloodthirsty, which is not my usual cup of tea. But the story is so good and so original, and the characters so believable, the violence sort of works. In case you're not aware, it is based on a comic book, which is also well worth a read,and has been fairly faithfully reproduced. With the action being based in a town which is permanently in darkness for 30 days, gives a relentless, claustrophobic feel to the proceedings. Throw in some spectacular, but not over used, special effects and a great ending, and there you have it, a 9 star movie for me. (In case anyone is wondering,Salem's Lot, the original tele-movie for sheer creepiness, Blade and Let Me In are all right up there as well.)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Location makes it worthwhile ...,"The world really doesn't need another vampire movie ... but this one is pretty good anyway. While the plot is pretty basic, the acting, visuals and concept make this movie appealing.The movie is set in Barrow, Alaska - the northernmost point in the United States. The city is about to enter a yearly 30 day period where the sun doesn't rise. Unfortunately, this time there are some nasty visitors. When the sun sets, the inhabitants must hide to survive ... and the story progresses from there.The plot is pretty standard - hide and seek with the bad guys. However, the geographic isolation of the city and the 30-day period of night give the movie an interesting atmosphere. Furthermore, the characters / acting are pretty good. The characters are smart and easy to relate to.The vampires, while only a step above shrieking zombies, are very freaky-looking. Whoever was responsible for the visuals did a great job. Barrow looks pretty isolated and sparse, so it's easy to get a feeling of desolation and helplessness.If you like movies which employ a strong sense of isolation (like Alien, The Shining, The Thing), chances are you'll appreciate this movie all the more. Good characters make the movie succeed - a worthwhile watch if you're open to seeing a vampire movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not another vampire movie.,"What does this movie have that others don't ? Abolutely nothing, you have seen it all.Character development is really poor, you know nothing about the people living in the town, but that's usual in this kind of movie.The story goes like usual people hides, vampires hunt them.Cliché is all over the movie, from the start I would say the director wanted to copy that fargo thing with the snow and the sheriff. The vampires are dressed like they came from last night party, always covered in blood which doesn't seem to freeze.The flare explosion not that good, it should have been plain dynamite.The cheesy ending scene is just to much, you want to trow tomatoes at the screen.These only scene worth the money, when some guy gets it's head chop off, really nice.",,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining movie,"This was a very nice horror,even thought it lacked some elements that in my opinion could have made it more interesting...The surroundings were imba,especially cuz it symbolized lack of hope...So this town will be under siege by the night for 30 days...Using this,a gang of vampires decides to feed on the town's inhabitants...Vampires we're monsters in the purest sense of the word...They speak an unknown language,and they have their faces covered with blood...I think the directors chosed it in this way to make the movie more terrifying...But had they chosen to make them more humane,as most movies portray them, I think the movie would have been more interesting in the sense of thrill...Also the fact of having another idea behind killing people,a few at the time,would have been a plus...A negative aspect is the passing of days...Lack of planning is a minus here.

30 Days of Night (2007),"Rating: 4 out of 5Genre: Horror, Vampires, Comic BookDirector: David SladeStars: Josh Hartnett, Melissa George, Danny Huston, Ben Foster, Mark Boone Junior, Mark Rendall, Amber Sainsbury, Manu Bennett, Megan Franich, Joel TobeckSynopsis: ""30 Days of Night"" is an adaptation of the 2002 Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith comic book series about Barrow, Alaska. Barrow is as about far north as a town can get and as a result during the winter the town spends thirty days in complete darkness. The remaining townsfolk must fend for their lives when the town comes under the attack of a band of nasty vampires looking to drain the town dry. Will the Sheriff (Hartnett) help the survivors who are cut off from the rest of the world by paying the ultimate price?Thoughts: Director David Slade (fresh off the popular ""Hard Candy"") creates a nicely stylized adaptation of the popular graphic novel. The grimy, disgusting vampires make for a wonderfully tense time as the darkness and setting make for some quick and fun gruesomeness. I'm not the biggest Hartnett fan but he and the rest of the cast do a fine job conveying the terror and the lead vampire is particularly nasty to behold.In Conclusion: ""30 Days of Night"" is a wonderfully welcomed change of pace to the tired vampire genre. It has plenty of excellent technical design should give vampire fans something to sink their teeth into and the comic fans to be happy about.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Frightening, but Flawed.","30 Days of Night is a decent movie. It has great acting, a fair amount of gore, intense moments, and well done cinematography that helps give the film an eerie, desolate vibe. One thing that I love that makes it unique among other vampire flicks, is that it's set in Alaska, where hence the title, it's 30 days of nighttime. I also like how the film doesn't glamorize the vampires, but shows them as truly evil. All of that being said, the vampires themselves are rather stereotypical. Speaking of vampires, the film doesn't provide any information on where they came from. I wish we had a backstory for how they got there, or even how they started off as vampires. The movie is almost 2 hours long. I feel the movie could have been shortened. There are a couple of scenes that aren't necessary. As for the ending, the fight scene is underwhelming and the sunrise scene is cheesy. Overall, I think the film is decent and entertaining. However, it has some flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Dismal effort,"When there were more laughs than scares in movie claiming to have reinvigorated the vampire mythology, you find yourself doubting a writer and director's understanding of the horror genre.The opening thirty or so minutes are choppy and jumpy showing a lack of editing/storytelling skills, while the action sequences have dizzying and annoying camera-work. A few shots do show promise (the overhead of the carnage), but too few to give it a second chance.The lack of dialogue by the humans prevent people from really caring about many of the characters, since you have no clue who they are. Lines delivered with seriousness were laughed off by the audience and a handful of people actually left before the movie completely ended.With no back-story and very little communication between the villains and heroes, you'll find the whole film disjointed as if there were another fifty minutes missing or still needed to grasp your interest.On a positive note, when the camera actually steadied out to focus on a gory moment, you really see some talent in the SFX department.I actually thanked the screen each time someone was killed off, because it meant I was closer to the end of the film.Enjoy it if you can, ImprovMFr",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Well made but unpleasant,"Its well known that if you want to heal your failing relationship being hunted by vampires is the way to do it. Nothing like it for bringing you closer together.I appreciate that this film is quite well made but it is essentially unpleasant. You could say it is more realistic than usual but who wants that. Dog Soldiers was better. If you break with the conventions you have to find something better as a replacement. The plot is essentially a cat and mouse game with the humans doing all the ridiculous things people would not do like running around outside of safety.Also there is no real origin for the vampires. Good old Count Dracula antecedents are well known and of impeccable credentials. They have no class either, just nastiness. Just mindless monsters which the classical master vampire never was.Not a film I would ever want to watch again. The Thing is essentially the same cat and mouse type plot but so much better. So all in all just another unpleasant horror movie with nothing whatsoever to say about anything. Totally unedifying.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What the hell??,"This movie was almost interesting for the first 30 minutes, but it was all downhill from there. The vampires were annoying, and the ending was the worst I've seen in a long time. They built up to this great finale, just to have it all come down to one punch? (and an outrageously comical one at that) I wouldn't recommend paying good money to see this movie, but if it's on TV or someone else shelled out the few bucks to rent it or something it might be worth it to watch it just for a good chuckle.

"Good to see nasty vampires back, but it's a shame about the predictability","Having heard plenty of good buzz about this vampire film, I sat down to watch the DVD with high expectations. I was left both satisfied and disappointed. Disappointed, because it in no way breaks any kind of new ground. Stylistically it's heavily indebted to THE THING, conjuring up the same kind of icy wasteland backdrop and eerie isolation that goes along with that.The vampire action is gory indeed, full of arterial sprays and bloodied fangs, along with severed heads galore, but that's all stuff that's way old. This even reminded me of the BLADE films, especially the ending of the first Wesley Snipes movie and the ending of this one. Kudos to the filmmakers for bringing back vampires as they should be – feral, ferocious, and frightening – but other than that, 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is simply more of the same.What it does have is an interesting cast. I usually dislike Josh Hartnett, but here he's given the chance to show warmth as the town sheriff who leads the fight back against the vampire menace. Melissa George is a lovely actress, and she shines as Hartnett's ex. The villains are led by a creepy Danny Huston and Ben Foster, delivering another of his psychopathic roles as the mysterious Stranger. The special effects are, for the most part, very good, with only the occasional lapse into cheesy CGI acting as a detriment.The pacing is spot on and the segment where the characters are holed up inside a hidden antic is well handled, with plenty of suspense. But I didn't care much for the 'twist' ending, which made little sense, and other elements just seem to be thrown in to shock the viewer (the little-girl-vampire reminded me of the zombie baby in the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake: just there to be unpleasant). It's a fun throwaway film that doesn't outstay its welcome, but would I want to watch it again? I don't think so.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best part of the movie is the ending credits,"I'm giving this movie two stars out of ten, for two reasons: one, the premise was good, and a good movie could have been made out of it -definitely, not the case here. And two, the ending credits, which were actually much creepier and more suggestive than all the movie in its entirety.It would be long and pointless to note all that is completely wrong in ""30 days of night"". To name a few reasons not to watch this piece of nonsense, let's say it's boring, pretentious -especially in the depiction of the ""creatures"", for they aren't really vampires, more on that later-, packed with bad, bad acting; completely devoid of any tension or atmosphere; absolutely not scary (it doesn't even have that couple of predictable yet satisfying scares that even the cheapest horror movies offer); and laughable in too many a scene.The story makes no sense at all. We are never told a story; rather, we are witnesses to a number of sequences that are closer to action than to what a vampire movie should be. Another big problem with this movie is its complete lack of pace or of build-up: we never feel that we are watching a group of humans trying to survive a vampire attack for 30 days of night, with all the psychological content and depth that that would imply; the passing of time is marked by such a simple device as telling the viewer that it is ""Day 1"", ""Day 18"" or whatever. The characters never look or really act any different on day 18 than they do at the beginning. We never get the feeling that more than one or two days have passed. All the characters are barely sketched, they are interchangeable and we never feel, nor care about their plight.If all of that weren't enough, this movie throws all of the cinematic and popular vampiric mythology out of the window. The creatures that raid the little Alaskan village are a mix of zombies and ghouls, and they are ugly rather than scary. In fact, it wouldn't be unreasonable to watch it as if the creatures were actually regular wrongdoers or human bad guys instead of monsters.Those are only a few of the many flaws about ""30 days of night"", but I believe they are enough to put anyone off watching it... indefinitely.",,Anonymous,Horror
Beautiful cinematography filled with sadistic visions,"I watched this movie with my girlfriend. She is a big fan of Twilight and has romantic ideas about vampires. By the end she was so disgusted she had to walk away. This tells you what you need to know about 30 days of night. It's portrayal of vampires is far from the teenage romantic vision offered in Twilight. This movie is dark, cold, sadistic and bloody. There is nothing romantic about ripping someones neck apart and letting them bleed to death. Anyone who wants to be a vampire based on having seen Twilight, should watch this movie first to make sure they really want what they wish for (be careful what you wish for because it might come true). All in all I think this movie is an above average vampire movie. It is beautiful and atmospheric with interesting and believable characters, and not so ridiculous, posed, stylized and shallow like many other horror movies nowadays. It actually has some substance underneath all the gloss. I just wish the ending had been more intelligent, surprising and thought provoking. I like those movies with a twist in the end that makes your gut churn, like The Mist. If this movie had stepped up that extra notch towards the end, it would have been truly great.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One time is enough to enjoy these 30 days,"First of all I would like to congratulate the scriptwriters S&S because of the clever idea to send the postmodern vampires to Alaska. Actually,this creatures don't even look like vampires,but thats perhaps the postmodern fantasy is already in action. 30 days in the dark turns even Alaska to a holy hell for our wannabe-vampire friends from Romania. My second praise are for the great posters. These Gothic masterpieces will decorate many rooms of the well-minded millennium Gothic freaks. But there are some reasons to stop the posters to be a part of my life. I don't want to charge Slade. The director already proofs his talent as a music video director under the influence of intelligence, but his control over Josh the Slevin is definitely a tragedy. I guess Alaska or the studio was to cold for Josh. He really disappointed me with his bad acting. Plus,the movie has to lees scary moments. The splatter opportunities where abused like nothing else matter. And that's why I don't want to have the '30 Days' poster next to my DAYWALKER portrait.

Enjoyable Take on the vampire film.....,"Based in the graphic novel of the same name and co-produced by Sam Rami, 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is an interesting take on the vampire myth. Set in the small Alaskan town of Barrow, it begins on the final day of sunlight for 30 days (hence the title) and townsfolk who cant handle it pack up and leave leaving quite a few to brace the coming month. This leaves a group of vampires, who descend on the small town, a practical all you can eat human- buffet. Those who don't fall victim to the bloodsuckers, have to survive and fight back and avoid becoming victim to the vamps. Despite some plot holes and slight ropey dialogue in parts, 30 DAYS, handles very well as a genre film and contains enough blood and action and suspense to keep fans of the genre happy. The central human characters Josh Hartnett playing the town sheriff who has to protect the remaining townspeople and Melissa George as his recently separated wife, are decently convincing, but most impressive of all is the vampires, led by Danny Huston, who look nasty and are just that. These bloodsuckers carry unusual looking features, rounded out by super strength, razor sharp teeth and a strange foreign accent sounding something like Romanian or Hungarian, make them stand out as a formidable and terrifying assortment of memorable vampires. A decent and overall entertaining horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A new vampire way is born,"This has to be a spin-off for the vampire cult movies,better than anytime gore and vampire mimic..great story that evolves little by little to a horror and terrifying action movie.I honestly hadn't had so much suspense since Jeepers Creepers.Josh accepted this role and i'm glad that he did..he was great even though it's not his kind of movie genre..but that makes it even more interesting.Also it was a different and interesting scenery in the Alaska for a vampire movie .Loved it..gave it a 9 just for some script flaws but in general it's a great spin-off .

Innovative and atmospheric Vampire movie,"The Arctic circle isn't exactly the place you'd normally expect to find Vampires, but that's where they head in 30 Days of Night, a refreshing take on an over-populated genre that sees an isolated Alaskan town besieged by a pack of bloodsuckers during a month of constant darkness. It's not a classic horror by any means but it has several tricks up its sleeve to ensure that the film remains one of the more memorable of its ilk and definitely a decent choice for a night in with the TV on.What makes 30 Days Of Night so unique is down to several things. Firstly, the setting - the sweeping Alaskan wilderness lends a wonderfully doom-laden atmosphere to the film; the town losing all touch with the outside world as the sun sets. The frozen and desolate landscape makes the battle for survival seem all the more fruitless, as well as lending itself to some eerily beautiful cinematography. Second are the Vampires themselves. On film, they normally seem to be portrayed as tragic figures of eternal darkness (a la Interview with the Vampire) or trenchcoat wearing hedonists that listen to Industrial music (see; the Blade trilogy or Buffy the Vampire Slayer). The ones in 30 Days Of Night however are neither, they're just voracious animals who delight in ripping people to pieces and don't think twice about tormenting young girls for the sake of their bloodlust. Yes okay, the aforementioned trenchcoats are still in place but these aren't a group of hip youngsters who supplement their slaughter with pop culture references, they're pure evil unleashed in its most primitive form. And at least they don't all have New Rock boots on.Thirdly there's the acting. Josh Hartnett is reliably down to earth as the local sheriff but quite frankly, him and his relatives/friends/co workers are all rather dull. Thank God then for Danny Huston and Ben Foster as the villains, Huston going beyond the call-of-duty to deliver a frighteningly convincing portrayal of the pack leader, while Foster exudes menace as his human agent. Foster especially is terrific, giving a deliciously creepy performance that is almost certainly going to get him typecast in similar roles from now on. He's so unsettling in fact that it's almost a relief when the pack turns up and start tearing the limbs off townspeople. Sure, your arm might be gone from the elbow down and the stump is already frosting over with ichor, but at least you don't have to hang out with that weird Southern boy anymore.That being said, 30 Days Of Night is no instant classic by any stretch, but is a taut and effective little shocker with some grisly set pieces to keep the adrenaline going. Mark Boone's rampage with some heavy duty mining equipment at the half way point is the obvious highlight and there's plenty of factory machines for characters to get minced up in. Shame then that pacing of the film is at odds with itself, days flashing past abruptly and without any change to the present scenario. Plus, a sizable portion of the story relies heavily on the ""we've got to get across town, hope we don't meet any vampires"" theme. Once they've run to the restaurant, then an attic, then a convenience store, then a factory you'll be screaming at them to simply stay where they are. By and large though, this is a survival horror that relies entirely on the atmosphere and it remains constantly foreboding and oppressive throughout. Well worth a watch indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Favourite Vampire Movie,"I wont venture to say best because as a whole it's just not, but it is my personal favourite. I love the whole idea of this movie. Most northern town in Alaska, cut off, and facing a deadly and mysterious threat from what appears to be an ancient cult of vampires. And these vampires are scary!!!I've always liked Josh Hartnett and he did well as the main lead. I can't help but think 'Midnight Mass' took a page from this movie in regards to a very similar death scene.My criticism would be that you don't get a very good sense of how long the time period is in which the movie takes place. It's called '30 Days of Night', though when you watch the movie it just seems like the entire thing takes place in one night; as in just a few hours.Other than that, I really enjoy this flick. My brother and I saw this in theatres when it came out just days before Halloween, so I decided to make it a Halloween special once again.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nasty and scary,"30 DAYS is the best vampire flick since K. Bigelow's classic NEAR DARK. A roving band of eastern European vampires hits a small Alaskan town and quickly slaughters most of its inhabitants. Then the group begins to hunt down the few survivors. The vampires are extremely bloodthirsty, animal-like creatures, relentless and absolutely heartless in their search for blood. Josh Hartnett plays the town's sheriff who tries to save a handful of town folk and figure a way to defeat the creatures. Veteran character actor Danny Huston is the vampire group's very scary leader, and another character actor, Ben Foster, plays a man on the run from the vampires. In fact, the opening sequence of Foster hightailing it through the snowy wilderness is reminiscent of the opening scene of John Carpenter's THE THING, where the sled dog is on the run across the frozen Antarctic tundra from the desperate Norwegians. 30 DAYS is extremely atmospheric, gory without being over the top, and truly frightening. The entire film takes place in shadows and darkness, as the sun has set for 30 days, hence the title. Much has been made of the overhead shots of the initial carnage, and rightly so. Choreographing it must have been akin to staging a small war. In the end, the film goes on a bit too long, and lifts its ending from one of the BLADE flicks, but not to worry. You are guaranteed to be on the edge of your seat during this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good idea, poorly executed","It's a great concept - vampires who have a month of night to play with. But there are so many things wrong with this film that it's hard to enjoy it.(Spoilers follow, so if you're going to see it, stop reading here.) The movie is full of plot holes. The first thing we see is a pile of burnt cell phones, and we are supposed to think that the vampires' helper stole all the cell phones in town to keep people from calling for help. Yet not two minutes later we see the two lead characters talking to each other on cell phones. If he missed those, he surely missed others.The town's electricity goes out early in the film. A few people have generators. But when we go to the utility dome at the end, the lights are on and everything is running merrily. Why? The vampires go on a killing spree at the beginning of the film, for no obvious reason. Can they really eat that much all at once? This leaves a handful of people alive and hiding for the next month - first in an attic, then in a store, then the police station. All the while the vampires are creeping around outside. If they think they've eaten everyone, why are they still there? And if they haven't, why aren't they searching places like the store and the police station? They don't seem to have anything better to do. And why, in the final fight scene, do all the vampires just stand and watch while only one fights? Have they been watching too many martial arts films? And why, at the end, does Josh Hartnett not just go into the basement for a few hours? The film has other problems beside the plot holes. Much of the dialogue seems to come from some big Hackneyed Dialogue Generator. The pacing is jerky. For example, in one shot we see a person running to avoid detection by the vampires, and in the next shot the same person is almost sauntering, with no apparent distress about the possibility of being eaten alive if caught in the open. This happens over and over. And it doesn't help that most of the thirty days of the title are glossed over with screen cards like ""Day 7,"" which is immediately followed by ""Day 18,"" the main difference between the two being that Hartnett has grown a flimsy beard. Hartnett is wrong for the role, anyway. He doesn't have the gravity to carry off playing the take-charge sheriff. You sit wondering why the other people are, for the most part, unquestioningly following his instructions.Finally there are the vampires themselves, who are hard to take seriously. They're probably supposed to look hip and goth. Instead, they look like they escaped from a mental institution to attend a Marilyn Manson concert. They have distorted eyes and walk around with their mouths hanging open all the time, so we can see their teeth. This gives them a sort of slack-jawed Down's Syndrome appearance. They're not very scary, but you feel guilty laughing at them; it feels like mocking the afflicted.It's a shame about this movie. It could have been genuinely interesting. Too bad.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
The amazing vampire make-up alone makes it worth watching.,"From the moment I read the plot outline of this movie in a magazine, I'd been anxious to see it and this week I did and although it was much different than what I expected, it still was very satisfying. I was hoping for an amazing story that would be told beautifully with no plot holes and stuff. Instead, I've found this cheesy but really cool movie.All right, there are many moments in the movie that will make you say: ""Oh, come on! Who are you kidding?"", and you will definitely get mad at the characters for doing stupid things ( an accustomed cliché for scary movies I say. ""No, no, no! Do not f.cking go to check the f.cking upstairs!!!"" ), and you will easily realize the editing mistakes since there's absolutely no indicator that the time has passed except the claims made by the movie-makers with the subtitles reading: ""Day 7"" or ""Day 27"". I mean, according to me, all the movie took place in one night :) Poor character development and the general rushed-up feeling of the movie are some of the other low points.However, the incredible atmosphere, the somehow-masterfully-managed realism, the gore, absolutely brave and surprising scenes (Someone doesn't care about the rating!), the breath-takingly-cool and scary vampires, the amazing bird's-eye view shot where we witness a total chaos and massacre, and the few amazing moments where we watch Ben Foster doing a swell job as always, makes this movie an amazing and obviously different vampire movie.If you like vampires and scary movies, there's no way in hell you will get bored watching 30 Days Of Night. If you are one of those people who CAN enjoy cheesiness and clichés on top of it, this movie will be one of your favorites.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Visuals.... Stupid Ending.,"Okay, you live in a town that is notoriously famous for having 30 days of darkness once a year. You live in Alaska, so without sunlight you're pretty sure it's going to be cold and barley livable. Lets throw a large group of vampires in the mix and see what happens... David Slade's look at this scenario is well shot and full of graphic gore tactics that will make any true horror fan proud. However, I was not thrilled with a lot of the ""Quick-Cut"" action, and found myself rewinding way too many times to slow it down and try to see what just happened. When the audience is allowed to see the violence in real-time, the results are incredible... This is a very well crafted take on the vampire legend, and volumes ahead of suck-fest films like ""Blade"" and ""Underworld"". Here the vampires are fierce creatures of night, whom tend to rip their victims to shreds as opposed to biting their necks. Danny Huston is truly frightening as the undead leader, and Josh Hartnett does a fine job of selling the drama, but I had a hard time with the ending, which I found lame and pretentious... Don't get me wrong, this is a decent horror film and well-worth a viewing or two, I just wish the ending left me wanting more... It didn't. You will however see some of the best gore since ""From Dusk Til Dawn"", and some of the creepiest settings since ""Storm Of The Century"". By far the best be-headings ever put on film...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sink your teeth into this!,"Better than I hoped for, and it had my full attention for all of the movie. The basis of the story is interesting and somewhat different from other vampire movies. The movie nicely builds up the tension and you might find yourself hiding, holding your breath or sneaking around with the inhabitants of the small village. The vampires as might be expected are cunning, brutal and of course blood thirsty, there was something about them that made me want to more about their origins? The isolation, snow and icy cold location only adds to the movies appeal and drama.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bloody thrill-ride!,"Awesome scenery. Great atmosphere. Great premise and setting. This was really freaky! There is just so much happening within the first 20 minutes of this film alone that one doesn't even get a chance to catch your breath. There's no false scares here; these are all REAL scares. It was genuinely frightening at times, also thanks to incredible make-up effects. As the film progressed, it also became action-packed with nail biting suspense. This was easily one of the most interesting and exciting vampire films I've seen. One thing, though, why did the vampires resort to seemingly senseless killing instead of just quenching their thirst? Or did they intend killing as many as possible as food stock? But then the blood doesn't stay fresh. Just a thought, but otherwise the film was quite a thrill-ride!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watching this movie felt like 30 days of crap,"I sat down to watch ""30 days of night"" with a bit of a high expectation. The editors did a good job when they made the trailers. They hooked me, I was interested, but ended up being disappointed by the grab bag of clichés and lack of character development.Although I did find myself to be tense from the suspense , I also found that I was tense from being annoyed as I watched. Fast jerking quick camera shakes during sudden violent scenes brought me to the conclusion that the Blair Witch camera man had developed an evolved case of Parkinsons and then landed a job shooting ""30 days of night."" This attempt at creating a mood of urgency and panic in the scene only succeeded in making me say, ""what the hell just happened?"" The acting coach also succeeded in creating the most annoying vampires in movie history. Their constant cry to one another was like being punched in the face with a dying cat. They also kill a bunch of dogs towards the beginning of the movie, but with knives? Some of what was going on just didn't make any sense.I found it hard to keep track of who was who, probably because there were a lot of people and not a lot of development into who they were. All in all, it was a good attempt but too many factors made it unREwatchable. So if you have a poor attention span, don't mind bad explanations, and maybe even have a small case of ADD, then you've just figured out what to do for about 2 hours.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

An okay fare....,"Based on the comic book miniseries of the same name, comes '30 Days Of Night' which again revisits the genre of horror, with Vampires as it's leads. David Slade's direction is the sole saving grace of this outdated & lame script, his work is truly superb.'30 Days Of Night' is an okay fare, mainly because there is no new-thing over-here. Before I go ahead, I'd like to mention that '30 Days Of Night' is not meant for the faint-hearted at all. This one is a dark, gory, gruesome & horrifyingly violent. This needs to be viewed only after your a 17-up. Strictly for adults! Slade's direction as mentioned, remains as the main stay of this 2007 flick.

Really good horror,"David (Hard Candy) Slade directs this nerve-jangling adaptation of the popular graphic novel series about a mob of vampires that overruns a remote Alaskan town in the grip of 30 Days of Night. Josh Hartnett and Melissa George are the film's DE facto heroes (he's the stoic town sheriff and she's his estranged fire-marshal wife) but the picture's real MVP is Slade's camera (along with cinematographer Jo Willems), which careens across the town's snowy landscape to detail the vampires' horrific assault on its inhabitants, which are quickly pared down to a hardy few. The script, co-written by the source material's creator, Steve Niles, along with Pirates of the Caribbean's Stuart Beattie and Hard Candy's Brian Nelson), proudly wears its influences on its crimson-stained sleeve (Bram Stoker's Dracula, natch, but also Salem's Lot, Night of the Living Dead, and John Carpenter's version of The Thing) and boils down the graphic novels to a series of tense and extremely bloody standoffs between Harnett and George's band of survivors and the vaguely Slavic and ferocious bloodsuckers led by Marlow (a feral and frightening Danny Huston). And if the characters seem stock and the finale begs suspension of disbelief, the set pieces leading up to it are sufficiently supercharged with suspense and violence to please most horror fans. Standouts in the supporting cast are Ben Foster as the film's Renfield figure and Mark Boone Junior; the disturbing score by Brian Reitzell also merits a mention.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is what I call AWFUL,"New levels in movie history are being met with this film. It is one of the only horror movies worse than The Devil's Rejects and The Descent.

They always have blood on them and goofy eyes, so you know they're super-weird and super-scary.That moron from Black Hawk Down is a by the book cop, who turns into a vampire killer with his trusty axe. Stupid.Suddenly the days tick by on the screen and it's 29 days of night and then a stupid ending is stuck onto an even stupider and rushed piece of crap film and you realize you've just wasted two hours that could have been spent learning something interesting instead of ruining your evening by renting this junk.Don't watch this crap...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Town Plunged Into Terror,"30 Days of Night, directed by David Slade, is a relentless and chilling vampire horror film based on the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. Set in the isolated Alaskan town of Barrow, which experiences a 30-day long night each winter, the film follows a group of residents who must fight for survival when a band of bloodthirsty vampires descends upon them, taking advantage of the prolonged darkness to terrorise the town. With its bleak atmosphere, intense action, and terrifying vampire creatures, 30 Days of Night stands out as one of the most effective and unique vampire films of the 21st century.The film's performances are strong, with Josh Hartnett playing the town's sheriff, Eben, who becomes the reluctant leader of the survivors. Hartnett's portrayal of Eben, a man forced to step up in the face of overwhelming horror, is understated yet emotionally resonant. Melissa George also shines as Stella, Eben's estranged wife, who fights alongside him to survive the vampire onslaught. Their chemistry adds emotional weight to the survival thriller, creating a sense of personal stakes amid the bloody chaos. The supporting cast, which includes an ensemble of townspeople, adds depth to the story, although some characters are underdeveloped in terms of backstory.David Slade's direction is superb, using the unique setting of Barrow, Alaska, to its full advantage. The town, covered in snow and plunged into darkness, becomes a character in itself, amplifying the sense of isolation and helplessness that permeates the film. The cinematography is striking, with the contrast between the white snow and the dark, blood-soaked imagery creating a visually haunting atmosphere. The use of shadows and limited lighting adds to the tension, making the vampires' attacks feel all the more sudden and terrifying.The vampires themselves are a standout element of the film. Unlike the suave, charming vampires often seen in popular media, the creatures in 30 Days of Night are vicious, animalistic predators, which adds a primal and terrifying edge to the film. Their appearance, with grotesque and unsettling features, and their relentless nature make them truly horrifying. The film is unapologetically violent, with numerous intense and bloody sequences that keep the tension high throughout. The brutality of the vampires is matched by the desperation of the survivors, creating a gripping and harrowing narrative.One of the film's strengths is its unique premise, set in a remote location with a constant night that serves as both a setting and a key plot element. The 30-day darkness amplifies the terror of the vampire attack, creating a sense of hopelessness and claustrophobia as the survivors are forced to fight for their lives in an environment that offers no escape from the danger. The film also explores themes of survival, sacrifice, and the loss of humanity, adding layers to the genre.In conclusion, 30 Days of Night is a film with an intense atmosphere, strong performances, and a unique take on the vampire genre. The combination of a chilling setting, terrifying monsters, and a relentless survival story makes it a standout in modern horror. Its violence and bleak tone may not be for everyone, but for fans of atmospheric, high-stakes horror, 30 Days of Night is a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Greatest Bomb of All Time,"Greetings, Internet Movie Database. This was the greatest atrocity in film history. I know a bunch of horror movie fanatics will definitely pledge support to this catastrophe, but I, a former resident of Barrow, Alaska know better. First of all, that was not Barrow, that was not even remotely close to Barrow. In fact, it seems as though it were filmed in the middle of Canadian territory. The setting seemed to match a Canadian outpost, the buildings had the wrong design, there is no pipeline in or around Barrow, there were no real Inupiaq peoples in the film, the real sheriff of Barrow is obese and African-American, planes can land for that time that the sun does not shine, there is no diner and people's greatest problem in Barrow is the threat of each other. After that long list, I can evaluate on another problem. It seemed that the budget was minimal. The actors had plastic fangs and the violence was overdone. The scare factor was made by under-achievers who had music leading up to the ""SCARY PARTS"". All in all, this was the only movie that I have left halfway through and I am sure that I am not alone. Please, rate my comment of the usefulness.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pedestrian Horror,"I grew up with Christopher Lee and his version of a vampire. Staying up until 1 or 2am (while younger than a teenager) I remember going to bed and unable to sleep after watching one of his movies. I found the characters and their situations believable (more or less), and the director tried hard to generate a general sense of suspense, a feeling that something was not quite right...After watching THIS movie however, I think I'll sleep just fine. The story centers around a small Alaskan town that has 30 days of dark every year; this year something goes horribly wrong and it gets overrun by vampires during this time. Good premise and good production values, however there seems to be something missing. Perhaps its because you see everything a bit too soon...I didn't really find the movie very suspenseful. Or maybe it's because of the acting, which struck me as out-of-place in a few places (you can tell someone is actually ACTING being out of breath, as opposed to making you believe he is). Or perhaps it was a general sense of unbelievability to the movie as a whole, not from anything specific but just a gut feeling that prevents you from being able to identify with the characters (or their situation) at anything more than a topographical level. In the end, it was OK Halloween fare (with the price of admission paid for by the looks of the vampires, which I found excellent), but it simply didn't deliver many frights for me....",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A vampire movie that packs a solid bite...,"This was actually one interesting vampire movie back in the day when it was released, because it certainly broke the form that vampire movies tended to follow, and suddenly vampires were not these overly charismatic goth-like creatures.

And the concept was very interesting, nay, refreshing to say the least, because director David Slade certainly brought new and much needed blood, pardon the pun, to the vampire genre.The movie was definitely benefiting well from having great special effects and CGI. Some of the vampires, however, looked somewhat ridiculous, but it was hardly something that spoiled the movie.There was also a good cast performing the various roles and characters in the movie.

Best & most original vampire movie ever,"Let me just ay that this movie is by far the most and best vampire movie ever. This vampire horror movie was more than great for me because the story, the intensity, and the music was well balanced throughout the movie. I also love this one because of its lyricism, visuals, animalistic, but most of all, its originality.The direction of this movie was primal and scary. In saying that, the vampires are dangerous and frightening. There are no sexy vampires like in Interview With The vampire, Underworld, etc. And really really thought that it was clever.I've also liked this movie because of the curiosity that the vampires have and how they look at human beings as subjects they are observing before killing them. They just don't kill the humans just for the sake of killing and being scary. Humans in this movie are food and a case study for the vampires.Therefore, you will realise and create visuals that you wouldn't see in another type of movie. You bring people to a world they would not be able to visit in real life. Most vampire movies made today are just bloodbath and gory for the sake of more bloods and don't make much sense.So that's all. You will enjoy this horror because all the acting is great.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the worst movies I've seen!,"My wife and I went to 30 Days of Night with great anticipation; the concept and the trailers made it seem like we'd be in for a real treat! The movie began to disappoint from the beginning. Apart from having so many goofs in depicting a Barrow and the arctic that it became a source of distraction, there was much too long a wait for real action! Then we were subjected to what seemed to be the standard, generic, plot that we've all seen in countless B films and TV shows with a veneer of the vampire story. My wife thought that the language spoken by the vampires sounded, insultingly, close to native Alaskan speech patterns; especially since the native population of Barrow was almost completely left out of the film. She also thought that too much of the mayhem was off-screen, we were left with interior scenes of people talking and talking when we could have been seeing blood flying in the snow. The white outs could have looked like white outs: nothing visible and death coming suddenly out of the white. The vampires could have been naked, not dressed in evening-wear. A much better movie could have been made with a feeling of the supernatural conquering even the awesome force of nature in the arctic and the mere human having to face both.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Oldschool vampire horror,"30 Days of Night starts very promising. It plays somewhere in Alaska, which removes the need for a supernatural phenomenon to make the sun go down for thirty days. The lead character, played by Josh Hartnett, has charisma, a simple but acceptable background and does a good job of moving the story forward.The vampires are portrayed as they should be. As intelligent, bloodthirsty predators with only few human features left. The film succeeds at showing how they prepare their attack on a naturally isolated target area in a subtle way. They even look scary at times, although resemble the wood elves of The Elder Scrolls video games a little too closely for my taste.However, the movie suffers from a devastating flaw that is far too common to the genre: Overly stupid side characters. Starting with the cliché whiny boy, who has the word ""juicy target"" stamped on his forehead, to the senile elderly, of whom you just know that he'll get someone killed.It also takes far too long for any character to try out this thing called ""headshots"". A testament to the NRA education of the armed public, I guess.I just cannot stomach films with monster newbies anymore. Anyone who has ever seen a vampire film would have been considered an accomplish expert at undead extermination by the cast of 30 Days of Night. I do not need a lengthy introduction phase to the nature of horror movies anymore when watching a horror movie. Many other films have successfully solved this problem by adding a character who is a horror fan or has at least heard about the genre.Another minor flaw is that I never really got the feeling of watching a town go through thirty days of slaughter. Its one night, and not a very long one either. Apart from a few beards growing, there is little that would give it away to the audience.30 Days of Night is a decent reminder of the ""real"" vampires, before Twilight turned them into cuddly teenager fantasies. It has a lot of substance, but lacks interesting characters and a proper story.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gruesomely entertaining but disappointingly flawed exercise in mainstream horror,"In terms of inciting premises, few prove as fitting as the prospect of an Alaskan town, plunged into a thirty day period with no sunlight being attacked by a vicious roaming tribe of vampires. The isolated setting and uniquely unsettling natural circumstances set the scene for what should have been one of the most supremely gripping and utterly chilling horror epics to grace the cinema in years. Unfortunately, while Hard Candy director David Slade initially proved just the man for the job, it is his reliance on trite horror conventions which ultimately descends 30 Days of Night from the superb film it should have been to the lacklustre resulting product.The plot proves oddly reminiscent to classic Hitchcock thriller The Birds through its similar lack of context in the midst of a supernatural crisis. Instead of flooding the audience with eye-rolling historical exposition explaining the backstory of the vampires, Slade cuts right to the chase, so to speak, ignoring such qualms as to why and how the vampires arrived in Alaska and immediately immersing the audience in a breathless fight for survival. However laudable the lack of unnecessary volumes of backstory for the vampires is, a middle ground between it and the complete absence of context would have done wonders, elucidating certain questions and making for a more rich and compelling watch. Similarly, the weak script, leaving next to no room for character development and providing many implausible twists in character motivation, laughably clichéd horror situations and a painfully contrived ending seriously detracts from what could otherwise have been a staunchly quality horror piece.Slade's film excels on the technical front, its quality especially boosted by the unusually effective cinematography. Mercifully shying away from the trendy nausea of ""shaky-cam"", the film astutely alternates between jarring, abrasive close-ups and sweeping crane shots (one sequence where the camera pulls back to a bird's eye view of the town, surveilling the helpless denizens being gruesomely obliterated by the vampire onslaught is eerily beautiful), perfectly capturing the desolate beauty of the Alaskan setting. Similarly, Brian Reitzell's musical score proves one of the most effective horror scores in recent memory, its harmonious pounding and screeching exquisitely complimenting the carnage. However, considering the film's reliance on its action setpieces to provide thrills, the action sequences, while suitably bloody, are often clunky and poorly executed, failing to generate more than a routine level of suspense or terror.Particularly laudable is the treatment of the vampires themselves - in an age where such creatures are often portrayed as slick and classy, it is a breath of fresh air to see this new incarnation of vampires: feral, bloodstained, thankfully portrayed by real actors and not computer generated, and worthy of fear, even if their curiously animalistic movements draw parallels to enemy creatures in most modern shooter games, and the vampire makeup varies between overdone and almost non-existent, either way distracting in its inconsistency. One also gets the feeling that the creatures would prove more chilling with the exclusion of Danny Huston's ""vampire speech"", as his few hackneyed lines, spoken in a barking dialect only serves to deter from their overall menace.While the quality of the cast may not descend to the banal dredges which would normally plague such a work, few manage to contribute anything of interest performance-wise. While the typically wooden Josh Hartnett musters a sliver more emotion than his past work, he still remains far too flat a lead to capture the audience's sympathies or often interest. Melissa George similarly remains firmly imbedded in the realm of ""stock female action support and love interest"" - while George is hardly as abysmal as she could have been, she certainly doesn't offer much in terms of charisma or emotional realism. Danny Huston adds a dash of class as the head of the vampires, though whether the odd imbalance between the humanity and feral aspects of his character was intentional or not remains a constant question throughout. Ben Foster steals the show as the unnervingly captivating mysterious stranger whose arrival heralds the coming of the vampires, and Foster's fiercely convincing portrayal of a man utterly consumed by the grasp of madness is the film's only truly worthwhile performance. Character actor Mark Boone Junior is mostly wasted as a shaggy social recluse forced to battle for his life with the rest of the villagers.A slew of frustrating inadequacies take what could have been an instant classic of the horror genre, and instead strand it in the realm of the mediocre. While 30 Days of Night offers many a scare and a gruesomely entertaining watch, don't expect much in the ways of profundity or innovation to the usual genre conventions - overall worth seeing for those willing to take it for what it is.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blah.,"And not as in Dracula's ""Blah Blah! I'm going to suck your bloood! Blah!"" Although that would've been better than this. This looked hokey and the acting was atrocious. What a great premise gone into the toilet.I won't bore you with the problems, only to say that where the story can be believed, the follow through was agonizingly silly.I gave it a 6 only because there was some cool violence, and the atmosphere was chilling. Also, a few really good scenes made me stick it out. But if I think about the film any longer, I may just knock it down a peg or two...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sick and twisted vampire yarn,"I enjoy vampire films and the first thing that struck me about this particular telling was how beautifully shot it is. This is in part thanks to the wonderful location: a small town in Alaska heralded as the northern most town in America. The film begins on the eve of the last day of sunshine before a month of natural darkness descends on the small town. Following an annual mass-exodus the town population is only a fraction of its pre- and post-darkness size and those that have chosen to stay behind (including a skeleton sheriff crew of two - Josh Hartnett and Manu Bennett) are effectively cut off from the rest of civilisation until the airport and roads reopen when the sun returns.The suspense at this point is poised beautifully and David Slade does a wonderful job of setting up the anticipation of what is to come, which is effectively a free meal for the pack of vampires that descend on the town as darkness falls.The vampires themselves are brilliantly conceived; they look horrific and speak in a suitably guttural language that (thankfully) isn't subtitled leaving you as a spectator trying to guess their intentions through their use of body language. This works brilliantly thanks to some top-draw performances from Danny Huston (Marlow) and Andrew Stehlin (Arvin). Just meeting either of these two down a dark alley would leave you babbling like a school-girl.The stranger who descends on the town prior to the darkness is Marlow's familiar charged with prepping the town for the vampire's arrival and helping to add another dimension to the suspenseful build-up. The stranger is played by Ben Foster who puts in a good enough performance although his inconsistent accent does let him down.The gore is outrageous and sometimes unnecessarily graphic and the pace of the film is about right although once the killing starts there isn't as much suspense as you would expect considering the build-up. However, this is a minor flaw in comparison to the biggest let-down in this film: Josh Hartnett. Clearly chosen to help increase audience size, Hartnett stumbles through his lines without conviction and never quite seems to fit into his role as the sheriff charged with protecting a town in chaos whilst dealing with the emotional turmoil of a wife (Melissa George played far more convincingly by Stella Oleson) who left him and is now forced into helping him protect the remaining citizens of the town. This emotionally-charged role was too far beyond Hartnett's reach.There is one other issue with the film worth mentioning: although it takes place over 30 days, it never feels like it. By the end of the film you feel like 48 or 72 hours have past, Slade just doesn't manage to portray the longevity of their struggle for survival and is forced to flash 'Day 17' and 'Day 30' on screen to represent the passage of time. Unfortunately this and Hartnett drag this film from good to mediocre, which is a shame because Slade definitely has talent and I'll definitely be checking out his other directorial work.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Excellent Vampire Film, the Humans are the Weak Element","While most modern mainstream vampire films seem to feature delicate, romantic depictions of the bloodsuckers, David Slade has done us all a favor and instead brought us the fearsome, deadly creatures of the night we love. The film is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Steve Niles, set in the town of Barrow, Alaska as it settles in for 30 days of darkness. Taking advantage of the town's long-term lack of sunlight, a pack of vampires arrive and the townspeople are left to fight for their survival over the next month. Bloody, tense, and occasionally boring...Slade has managed to create one of the better vampire films I've seen in recent years.I loved the visual style of Slade's film, courtesy of cinematographer Jo Willems. Willems captured the cool, dark tones of the graphic novel with splashes of color (primarily blood red) and I thought the film was beautiful. The violence was graphic and often brutal, giving the film the hard R rating it deserves with decapitations and dismemberment to satisfy the gore-hounds, and there's a scene with a trencher that stands out as one of the best action spots in the film. I would've easily ranked this film amongst my favorite horror movies if it weren't for the fact that nearly the first two-thirds of the film drag on so badly. The film grabs your attention from the start with the weird happenings around Barrow (stolen satellite phones found burned, town dogs murdered) but then it grinds to a near halt as the survivors spend the next hour hiding, moving from one spot to the next, while the audience is desperate for something to happen.The best performance in the film comes from Ben Foster, as a mysterious Stranger who wanders into town before night and gleefully warns the town of their impending fate. He was exceptionally creepy, with his disheveled appearance and Cajun growl. Danny Huston also stands out powerfully as Marlow, the alpha of the vampire pack. One of the creepiest moments in the film has Huston mocking his prey while she pleads ""Oh God"", Huston taking a moment to glance around the sky in search before staring her in the eye and uttering...""No God"". The vampires really were the stars of this film; with their pupil-less eyes, pale skin, and jowls covered in blood from their recent kills, these are the vampires we want to see...primal and animalistic in nature. The humans in the film don't fair so well. The performances weren't terrible but they were outshone by their undead costars and I spent most moments eagerly awaiting the next attack scene instead of becoming involved in their struggles. Josh Harnett does a fair job as Eben Oleson, the sheriff of Barrow and leader of the human survivors. Melissa George, beautiful as she is, adds nothing too significant to the cast as Eben's estranged wife.The vampires are what make this movie so fun to watch but we spend a bit too long hiding from them, rather than confronting them. The first time I saw the film, I lost interest pretty fast until the final act when the humans began to fight back with whatever tools they could find. Still, I don't judge the film too harshly because it was one of the few as of late to paint vampires in a more bloodthirsty light, and for that, this film is worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rather Good,"well, I just watched it and it was a rather good suspense. It wasn't the 'horror' movie I would have expected or hoped for but still a good thriller.For one thing, you start with the movie in a strange tension, then as the movie goes, you start relaxing until it just becomes like an action movie or something. So it goes from horror, to suspense and then action. It wasn't typical for a vampire movie and I can honestly say this is the best one I've watched.It's a worth a watch in the movie theaters just for the fact that the loud noises really add a certain suspense element I don't think people that watch it on the internet will get.so, I give this an 8/10 just because it was also original, not the typical vampire movie for a change, I recommend this to anyone who just want to see a good movie and the fun thing also is that there isn't actually much gory parts :)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Rather good, bloody vampire movie...though not without its flaws.","For the most part I enjoyed this movie, however, I thought it could have been better too. The story has a the town of Barrow, Alaska about to go into its yearly ritual of 30 days of night. A time when the sun doesn't come. However, this year things are going to be particularly bad as a group of vampires are coming to town for a thirty day feeding frenzy. Let's just say that they do not take to long making their presence known as they begin slaughtering the citizens soon after sundown. I was thinking at this point they should be thinking about pacing themselves because unlike the real Barrow, Alaska where I think there are quite a few people this one is limited to like 150 people during the dark month. Soon we are left with the sheriff and a few survivors doing what they can to avoid being on the menu. Lot's of blood as to be expected and for the most part it is pretty good. Still, in places the camera work and editing make the movie seem rather choppy and I had a rather hard time telling what was going on. The vampires were not distinct enough for me and for some reason spoke in a foreign language which I found rather unnecessary. Also, I doubt if anyone else thought this, but I kept thinking the way the movie was setup was a bit familiar. It reminded me of the Australian or New Zealand zombie flick ""The Undead"". I mean we have the initial stage of chaos, survivors finding rather good shelter (here in an attic, in that movie a fallout shelter), a town isolated, and even a scene in a local store where our troops gather supplies and run across another creature. Of course, that movie was funny while this one is almost completely devoid of humor. Still though, it is a nice little horror movie with a great concept...just needed a little work here and there.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's about time,"It's about time a good horror movie came out. Lately, gore has been used as a substitute for plot (see: Saw, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of 100 Corpses, etc.). Not to say that those movies didn't have a plot (I enjoyed those movies), but the gore was just so overpowering that it consumed the weaker plot. This movie is also gory, but the plot and the suspense is also good, so you walk out of the theater with a good impression of an excellent movie, not a vomiting sensation. I love vampire/zombie movies, so this review might be a little tainted by that. I also watched a lot of horror movies as a kid. I knew that this movie was going to be good as soon as I saw the preview. It's got the right amount of startling suspense, special effects, plot, and character development. The other thing I liked was that the special effects weren't overdone. As far as special effects go, you have fake teeth, some makeup, and some mutilated bodies. Nothing looks fake or cgi, so I was impressed with that aspect. There were some moments that I didn't understand, like why some people couldn't drive away fast enough from the vampires, but others could run or walk away from them. (Update: I checked out the graphic novels and they explain it there - it's because of the cold). But, in general, it was an excellent movie and I would watch it again in heartbeat and will definitely buy it on blue-ray when it comes out.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Small town horror or a whole month of nightmare,"Thriller. A screen adaptation of the comic strip of the same name by American writer Steve Niles. I watched this picture on the recommendation of one connoisseur of cinema - and did not regret it. For a long time I have not watched a decent movie about vampires, but here - such a decent picture came across. And here's my quick opinion - A whole month of nightmare. As in any picture, there are both pros and cons, and now we will go over them with you.
So the pros:
1. Atmosphere - a lonely city, cut off from civilization, a whole month without the sun, a flock of hungry vampires scurrying in search of fresh blood. Feeling of despair and loneliness. The viewer can experience all this to the maximum. It's been a long time since I've seen a similar and elaborate atmosphere. Light, music, actors - everything perfectly creates a feeling of some discomfort in the viewer when watching. There are practically no shocking scenes here, although they write on various resources that these are ""horrors"". This is not horror - this is an intense thriller about the survival of a group of people surrounded by hungry and thirsty vampires. The picture does an excellent job of pumping the atmosphere.
2. Vampire theme - the fact is that there are very, very few decent (or at least watchable) pictures about vampires that have been filmed over the past twenty years. From the latter I can only remember ""Dracula"" with Luke Evans, released in the fourteenth year, where vampires were precisely vampires - creatures of the night, greedy for human blood, cruel monsters, and not glamorous beauties from ""Twilight"", which snotty teenage girls like. In this picture, vampires are presented in a classic form, albeit with minor reservations, but the same dangerous and cruel monsters as in the old film adaptations, adjusted for modernity, of course. The leader of the pack so generally has a mind.
3. History - the film tells about a group of survivors who are led by the sheriff of the small town of Barrow, which is located in the very north of Alaska, who must hold out for thirty days until the sun rises, while a whole flock of hungry vampires are hunting them ... There is a lot of blood, there are enough screams and voices, without overplay. Everything is pretty realistic if this word can be applied here. Several scenario twists are pleasing. And the final turned out to be quite interesting, albeit harsh. To be honest, I counted on another, more predictable, but the picture pleased me, not being afraid to ""show my teeth"", forgive the pun.
So the cons:
1. Logical holes in the script - there are not too many of them, but they are noticeable and slightly unsettled. Some realism of the scenario prepared me for logical decisions about what the heroes should make, but they do not always do it. These moments are striking, but because of this, I will not underestimate the estimate.
2. Melissa George - where have I seen this deceptive face and never closing mouth? Oh, exactly - the picture ""Triangle"" (which is impossible to watch without doping). What kind of hedgehog it was impossible to find another actress for this role? What, in America or New Zealand there are no beautiful and pretty actresses? Sorry, I don't believe it!
3. Faded heroes - except for the sheriff, of course. They are not remembered in any way and you do not worry about them at all, because fadedness is also faded in Africa. And I understand that for such a small budget (thirty million) the creators were able to hire only Josh Hartnett, a celebrity of that time, but all the same, it would be possible to reveal them in more detail, and not write three lines of text that you will forget a couple of minutes after them reading.
A little about the main characters:
1. Eben Oleson played by Josh Hartnett - the sheriff of the city of Barrow, who was attacked by a whole pack of vampires. Since our gallant hero represents the law in this remote wilderness, the task of exterminating evil spirits falls on him, while he must save the survivors and survive until dawn, which will come thirty days later. A bit sullen, but honest, well-wielding a weapon hero, without whom people simply have no chance. Josh among all the actors was the only bright spot for which I wanted to watch this picture, and for the sake of vampires too. Well done Josh!
2. Stella Oleson performed by Melissa George - CLOSE YOUR Mouth! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
3. The Stranger performed by Ben Foster is a mysterious person who appeared shortly before the attack of the vampires. Behaves aggressively and speaks in riddles. An extremely muddy type who should have played a big role in the story, but this did not happen. Only Ben Foster's charisma did not allow to further downgrade this picture.
I am sincerely glad that the creators for such a modest budget managed to shoot an excellent tense thriller with blood and even a vampire theme, and do not care about some problems and the fact that the shooting took place not in Alaska, but in New Zealand. The picture is already good with cruel vampires and a great disturbing atmosphere.
And I am aware that there is a second part, but I will not watch it, because this picture does not need to be continued (and the ratings for the second part are quite low).
As a result, we have a good and intense thriller about the confrontation between survivors and cruel vampires in a small snow-covered town, with a great atmosphere, bloodthirsty vampires and the heroic Josh Hartnett.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent vampire film,"30 Days of Night (2007) is a Josh Hartnett, Melissa George vampire movie. These two lead actors play a separated couple who must come together for the good of the townspeople around them when their Alaska town gets attacked by vampires. I liked these two talented actors in their roles, they fit them well in my opinion. The plot is pretty average and by the numbers for a movie like this, although some of the ways in which they execute that plot is different. I will not spoil anything in this review, but just suffice to say that there are some things that happen, especially towards the end, that do not typically happen in other movies similar to this. I appreciated that. The action is good most of the time, and I liked that this movie didn't completely rely on shock and gore, movies that do that are very weak. Overall, this is one that i mildly recommend, there's better in the genre, but it's certainly not a bad pick by any means. 7/10 for 30 Days of Night.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good horror movie with good acting, just a bit slow","30 Days of night was actually an OK film in my own opinion, the only flaw I found in it was that it felt a little long, the action scenes had a few moments, but the storyline seemed to fall flat in terms of new ideas, the vampires were definitely presented in a different way, but the overall storyline is just about a handful of people trying to survive 30 days of night being hunted by vampires, and thats pretty much it, no major character development and no complicated story that draws you in, its just straight forward and simple.I do disagree with reviews stating that the film had two weak leads, Josh Hartnett and Melissa Goerge's performances may not have carried the film but they did give good performances, considering I've always thought you can't really judge the acting in this type of film or any other horror film, because there are some good horror movies with relatively bad acting, and bad horror movies with actors you don't ever want to see again.Overall, good horror movie with good acting, just a bit slow.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than I thought it would be,"For some reason I put off watching this movie even when I started falling hard for horror, even after I realized that horror was fast becoming the premier art form of century 21. Something about the title put me off. Luckily I forgot what that off-putting thing was and lo, was able not only to watch it, but to enjoy it. I have no problem with certain tropes within the horror genre. Scratch that, I have no problem with most tropes within the horror genre, so long as they are in furtherance of a prime bit of horroring. I therefore give zero focks that the three givens were, well, given, since these three are pretty much de rigueur: 1. hitting with the car, 2. killing of the pets, and 3. ominous aerial view. The only trope I did have a problem with is the the-two-prettiest-people-in-the-movie-who-have-broken-up-for-no-good-reason-and-who-take-the-whole-damn-movie-to-get-back-together trope. Especially because of the gut wrenching use (read: overuse) of the and-one-of-them-sacrificing-himself-for-the-good-of-the-many correlation. Blech. The one redeeming virtue of the use of this particular overused cliché is that once the husband at the center of The Couple to Beat is dead the only male left for the newly minted widow to mate with in this newly minted town of ""Barrow, population 5"" is that dead hero's little teenage brother.

Best of genre,"I think we all know that Hartnett WAS an overrated actor in his day and has since then his name has been a bane to our eyes in the world of movies, but he's finally done something excellent and completely not in his acting type.This is one of the best horror films I've seen and definitely the best vampire movie in my opinion. It is also one of the bloodiest movies out there and therefore the squeamish should stay away.Don't think that this movie would be bad just because the last name ""Hartnett"" appears in the acting list. This is definitely his breakthrough performance that could put him back into the acting line, only he should probably stay to these kinds of movies just to be safe.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A small town in Alaska goes a whole month every year without light. This year the town is overrun by a bloodthirsty pack of vampires who kill anyone that stand in there way.,"I personally went into this movie expecting a lot more then i received. Overall this movie was pretty good, and the vampires were really well done. The vampires in this film seem almost invincible and add a new unusual look that make them more horrifying then typical movie vampires. Josh Hartnett and Melissa George play there characters very well and you find it easy to like them. Jake oleson played by mark rendall also delivers a fine performance and Ben foster is just plain creepy as the stranger. This film had a decent amount of action in it, but i really would have liked to see a little more added. A few more fight scenes between the main characters and the vampires seem almost necessary. The film also really needed a few more STAND-OUT deaths in order to allow the viewers to fear the vampires more and to show the true nature of the way they hunted.

Bloody encounter is violent revelation of the Vamp.,"This is a very stylish encounter, film committees have revised the history of the vampire from days of silhouette filming, throughout film noir and constantly reviewing the innovative alterations of the parasite ever since. Adapted from Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith's graphic novel comes perhaps the most enhanced and startling vampires to date. Even surpassing the malicious Frostbiten as possibly the most cruel and ferocious nightmare to date. 30 Days of Night is based on the factual nature of Barrow, Alaska, falling to thirty days of unreserved gloom, but with the visit of a few uninvited fictionalised guests. Although the narrative is as simple as watching meat fall off the bone this service does not offer any smiles. No knife and forks and no table reservations are made whilst this tribe are in town. This is a tale that follows the survival of the fittest, led by Josh Harnett and Melissa George, against the most enhanced bloodsuckers to date, in the wilderness whereby the cold feeling isn't the artic ambiance, its death approaching.These vampires, led by chief vamp Marlow (Danny Huston) can be labelled as heartless, menacing monsters; moreover these creatures lack distinct levels of emotion. Marlow's mob escort themselves with idiosyncratic shrieks, at scintillating speeds. These spongers offer no radiance, they are carcasses with extremely pale skin who stick around like leeches nourishing off every living essence until every last drop has been inebriated dry. It is remarkable, however that these foreign exports choose to haunt the fields of derelict ice sheets where the meat is rare and civilian blood is bitter. Common logic would propose to lope around the streets of boarders beyond the glacial landscape of Alaska and venture into the metropolis. But as the narrative would suggest, a second instalment is likely to be on the cards due to Niles and Templesmith's fictional continuation. One would only imagine these insects to whisk on from the wintry wasteland and vanquishing in city depths for feeble fresh meat.There is a discrete affiliation that the nation has with the vampire, a careless one actually. They are predictable, sometimes temperamental but an addictive creation. They are our departed cousins and instrumental body, demonstrating how life could be if other forms of meat and vegetation were not so widely obtainable in the common market for us to consume. Fans of revulsion and visceral photography will be in their element. The crimson is rich, sending shudders of emotion down your spine. The cinematography is sharp and its presentation is also rather conceivable. Some will uncover Slade's motion picture as unnecessary and lacklustre, but as always it's a virtue of taste. Romantic comedy aficionados will not endure passion from this love bite fest.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Huge disappointment,"30 Days of Night left me with many unanswered questions. I would have like to have seen some information on the origin of these vampires. I think every vampire enthusiast appreciates the origin of the vampire and I believe that the origin is what truly sets Vampire plots apart. Yes, we know they feed on blood. We also know that their favorite place to bite is the neck. They have superhuman powers and are very difficult to kill. Same story many different versions. I was not impressed with the role the leader of the vampire played. His gurgled language wasn't very convincing, the under-bite was poorly conceived and there were too many unnecessary growls. The only difference I saw in this movie was the location the vampires chose to feed. I felt more moved by the barren and cold location than the anticipation of a vampire attack.

Fairly decent isolation-horror that makes you appreciate a nice warm cup of tea,"Niles and Beattie certainly aren't top writers, having between them written some misandric trash extending to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. But Niles' involvement in 28 Days Later: Aftermath seems to have drawn the good from it - the 'covering open spaces to get to stronghold sans vampire death' theme is welcome here.The film is largely based on a family-run sherrifs office, taking the deputy or sherrif's day responding to cases as the way to present the growing number of perculiar happenings in the leadup to the onslaught. The number of suspects could have broadened after rather than before meeting one of them, but theres still enough mystery there all the same. I also like that such rare places do nonetheless exist on this planet, and it's nice to ponder how they live for an hour or two.One thing I really like is the vulnerability of the sherrif, inasmuch as he doesnt try to pretend that hes any less in the dark than the villagers are. And the dark is the pretext here - 'meat' and darkness soon make for a disaster where surprisingly few survivors are scampering about between corners of the same unforgiving confines.I dont think romantic plotlines are neccessary in any story, least of all horror, and that slows the warmup somewhat, but there is always a new development, and its a fairly enjoyable watch. The most heroic moment is actually from a character who is a relative outcast from the rest, and that is the warmest feeling one gets in this movie - that an outcast can be as worthy as anyone. 
I am a bit at a loss though how two main characters at the start of the film disappear by the end of it - the sherrif/deputy colleague of the protagonist, and a careless driver who - I think - appears only then. The other thing I'm not crazy on is the movie trope of the repeatedly-happy-looking-scream from one of the female killers, which gets a bit repetitive.Like Blood Glacier, its perfectly watchable, entertaining, set in snow, dogs sadly die, and its a decent average thrill if youre working through a list of horror films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fails to meet potential,"The film 30 days of night is built around a sound and intriguing concept, yet it fails to live up to the potential that the basic idea creates.Josh Hartnett plays Eben Olsen a sheriff in the small Alaskan town of Barrow. Due to the co-ordinates of the town it falls into a spell every winter where the sun sets for 30 days and does not rise (hence the title). This makes for a very interesting premise, 30 days of night, vampires, bloodshed, should be good right? But from here on in the movie is mediocre at best. The film begins on the final day of light for the small town of Barrow with the towns folk going about preparation for the 30 days of darkness. The stranger (Ben Foster) arrives soon after on a ship off the outskirts of the small town and begins his trek into Barrow through knee deep snow. At this same time strange things begin happening around the town which put the sheriff on edge. The stranger then arrives and gets into a scuffle with Hartnett at a bar which consequently lands him in jail, where he threatens the station employees and sheriff with the unknown danger that is coming to their town. Power outages mixed amongst other things follow these warnings but he is not yet taken seriously. Up to this point the movie is still interesting and the suspense while still awaiting the first attack is sufficient to keep you interested, but shortly after when the first attack happens, the movie takes a turn for the worse.The first attack is laughably bad. Hartnett discovers their victim and tells the townspeople to get to their homes and stay there until he tells them otherwise. The vampires arrive shortly after and all hell breaks loose. The movie shifts focus to a group of 7 or 8 people (including Hartnett) who hide out together and stays with them throughout the remainder. Despite this very little character development is made, a horror movie rarely has much character development i know, but there is ample time to do so. I found myself not caring who lived or died and at times not giving the movie my undivided attention.I will end my review here as not to spoil the movie for those of you who are going to see it but my advice is this, the movie is mediocre so if you are interested in seeing it wait until it comes out on DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Be Short-Changed By Personality Over Character,"There's a quote I recently read by the author W. Somerset Maugham. ""When you choose your friends, don't be short-changed by choosing personality over character."" 30 Days of Night seems to have been made by and will likely be enjoyed the most by people who have not read this quote or have come to a conclusion relative to Maugham's. However, can you blame them so much? This film appears to be a ground-breaker in its own right. It has some of the most striking and beautifully Gothic cinematography I have ever seen. It is so bleak in a way that is somehow inventive. I've never seen a film before this that has looked this way or similarly enough to it to be reminiscent. The photography is no doubt the film's most valuable quality.It's the film's look that gives it's small-town Alaska setting such atmosphere, such an all- consuming limitation that makes it feel so cut off from the rest of America. Would anyone here in Cincinnati find it plausible that vampires could take the town over? Surely somehow they could be overpowered. Not in this town, which is given a spotlit weakness by its wondrously atmospheric appearance in this film.Even if it's hard to believe that with a well-populated town, vampires intelligent enough to have Danny Huston as a leader would rampage and kill everybody rather than rounding them up and feed to their satisfaction, the relentlessness of the vampires and their unyielding ruthlessness accompanied by the filmmakers' willingness to stay with scenes of horrible torture, screaming, brutality, and depressingly sad scenes of gore, and how little the script cares to let minor characters go, and go in merciless ways only those who've survived some of the world's most horrific atrocities will feel they've seen any semblance of in witnessing death before, gives the film great intensity and suspense. But if it only could not go limp on us in the last 20 minutes, when the screenwriters, instead of climbing off for a smoke break, simply ran out of breath and let the pounding get weaker and drone on till the satisfied but rather flimsy finish.Those last twenty minutes or so haven't the meaning or effort as such dense tissue like the rest of the movie up till then, even though the entire time it's rather difficult to overlook how characters can hide from their relentless predators when every step should make a footprint in the snow, when it tapers off into implausibility in the context of its own creative license, not to mention silly American tough-guy-going-down-and-taking-as- many-of-them-with-me-as-I-can gimmickry. (For example, injecting oneself with vampire blood is a completely pointless act when it's fifteen minutes before sun-up.) Nonetheless, I still somehow did not leave this film reflecting upon it with such bad taste in my mouth. I don't look at it as a ground-breaker and certainly not a contemporary classic, but the inspired stylistic intensity in the film-making, responsibility for which can be taken by director David Slade, who also directed the seamless, criminally overlooked gem of a thriller Hard Candy, will hopefully be built upon with Slade's following efforts.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Shlock,"Vampires can only come out at night but what about above the Arctic circle, like in Alaska, where you have 24 hours without daylight for extended periods. That's the concept 30 Days of Night makes use of. At first the movies biggest issues seem to be mostly its blase cast, with the usual artificial exchanges and a lot of forced deliveries as it sets everything up. Just wait for the vampires. Who appear actually pretty quickly into this dragged out plot, and these aren't your normal kind that creep through the window. Their the turbo charged, super powered variety that swiftly demonstrate all means of fighting back are useless. Which leaves our collection of characters to hide and try and wait them out. However, that doesnt mean the acton stops. The vampires continue to find people whose throats they can rip out. The movie doesnt affect you on snh meaningful level that a horror film can. Instead it just inundates you with gore and more blood than a slaughterhouse which is comical until it's boring and then practically nauseating. Will these people survive or not? Frankly, what difference does it make when we live in a society with the mindless, bloodthirsty ghouls who made this junk.Maybe that's a bit dramatic but you get the idea.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Visually impressive horror film is somewhat flawed in the script but it's certainly an well made film.,"In the small isolated town in Alaska each month in a year. The town goes to total darkness for 30 days. Which most villagers decides to stay somewhere else for the month. When a mysterious stranger (Ben Foster) is been killing dogs and causing trouble in a small diner. The local sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) is trying to find out, where's this stranger came from. The sheriff's soon to be ex-wife Stella (Melissa George) finds herself stuck in this village as well. Now very strange things are starting to happen, when the villagers are getting attacked from the unknown. This stranger brings this eerie group of people. Which they are strong, violent and they are hungry for blood. Which they are vampires are attacking and feeding on these villagers for the whole month. They will not stop attacking until the whole villagers are dead. Now Eben, Stella and a small group of survivors try to hold on from hiding and fighting these unstoppable vampires until the sunlight comes back.Directed by David Slade (Hard Candy) made an extremely well-acted, well directed Horror movie with a few genuine moments of suspense and terror. Slade's visual style is the highlight of this film, which it's based on a graphic comic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. Slade certainly echoes some of the style of the earlier films of John Carpenter. Even Mark Boone Junior, who had a small role as Vampire Slayer in the underrated Carpenter film ""Vampires"". The Vampires certainly has a presence in this, especially Danny Huston as ""Marlow"". Perphas the problems with ""30 Days of Night"" is probably not what some audiences or critics were expecting to be. I felt the script, could have been much better in places. But there's enough character development from the human characters and the vampires are kept mysterious enough in the film.Sadly, this horror movie was an box office disappointment. The reviews were certainly mixed, although ""30 Days of Well"" is possibly one of the most well received horror movie of this year by certain critics. The conclusion is certainly familiar to ""Blade 2"". There's also a few (unintentionally ?) laughs as well but there's strong moments of violence, gory and a few jolts as well. The production designs by Paul D. Austerberry (Resident Evil:Apocalyspe, Assault on Precient 13 ""2005"", Highwaymen) and the widescreen cinematography by Jo Williems are first-rate. I think, it's one of those films will be a cult favorite once it's release on DVD. It's one of the strongest ""Vampire"" movies in a while but certainly not one of the best in the genre. It's one of those movies that certainly looks good in the Big Screen. It's worth viewing. Screenplay by Niles, Staurt Beattie (Collateral, Derailed) and Brian Nelson. Super 35.

Why is the score so low?,"What is wrong with this site ? Every review I read says it's a unique take and well told story yet its scored as a 6.6 movie. Something seems a bit off with the scoring algorithm on this site.It's a tight, claustrophobic setting and the characters are far more developed and realistic than 90% of Hollywood movies.

Bad Movie,"I like the new take on vampires that this story has. And the setting is great. Unfortunately this movie didn't make use of either. I couldn't figure out if it was supposed to be a horror, a thriller, or just a movie where stuff happens. There is never a time where you feel in danger like any good horror movie should have. And you are never on the edge of your seat like a good thriller.You just wait to see what happens and hope there is more to it than just gore. And the gore isn't that good.My other problem with this movie is the time-line. It is set in Alaska in a town that is above the line where night can last for over a month, hence the name. The problem is that there is no sense of time. The story plays out like it is a couple of hours, not days or weeks. No mention is made of how they survive for most of this time. 20 days pass with little more than a subtitle. Nothing is said about what has happened or why the vampires have seemed to have missed them. And apparently these vampires never wipe the blood off their faces, even after a month. There were just to many story problems like this.It just came down to a good story told poorly. Suspension of disbelief has to be earned, and this movie did not earn it.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Taut, focused, well paced and resolute","If you want emo sparkly vampires and deep emotional arcs, you'll have to look elsewhere. The antagonists here are boldly feral and savage predators, untainted by compassion or mercy, and this is a proper survival horror film in which you'll get little of the former and copious splashes of the latter.Sure, the protagonists might as well be called Brad and Janet, this isn't French art house. But the supporting cast do a solid job of filling in their relationships and story arcs, just enough to make you care about who lives and who gets torn apart.There's a fair budget here, and it's put to good use in sets and decent practical effects. The casting of actors of startlingly Slavic / Hungarian appearance is a bold choice and gives the vampires an otherwordly world look that CGI animators would struggle to match. And nobody skimped on the blood budget, that's for sure.There's gore, tension, futile heroism, tragic ends, a bit with a dog, I really don't know what more you could ask from a vampire film.And to its credit, it holds its dark tone right to the very last scene. Everyone involved deserves to take a bow for deciding on a straightforward premise and executing it well.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Set Up.. No Story.. No reasoning,"Hi, though i like such movies based on ""survival"", but this one could not go down my throat.. For simple reason, that it does not provide any ""reason"" for what all occurred in a town.. I liked movies like 28 days later, dawn of the dead etc because they actually gave a reason for existence of such vampires or whatever! The story does not explain where the vampires in this movies came from and where they go in the end.. neither does it show what happened to the survivors nor the town.

"Vampires in the snow, what else do you need?","30 Days of Night is a great survival horror movie with captivating terror and a consistently tense and isolating atmosphere.Performances are all really great, with the best coming from leading opposites Josh Hartnett and Danny Huston. Ben Foster, although not as present, makes quite the impression that really kicks off the fear felt throughout the rest of the movie. Huston plays his character in a reserved manner and manages to feel like such an overarching threat across the town. But it's Hartnett who really shines as the protagonist, the cop who's willing to save as many people in his town as he can, and is able to make the tough calls. The score is foreboding enough, but doesn't make too much of an impact until more towards the end. The town itself and some particular overhead shots in the second act really makes the atmosphere, and therefore the movie, work very well.A few of the townies really felt like individual characters, however there were a few that were given more of a spotlight, yet didn't feel like they were fully fleshed out. But that's a light criticism in an otherwise good film.Overall, a highly atmospheric and scarily entertaining survival horror movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A surprisingly fun and enjoyable vampire effort,"Holded off in an Alaskan town the few remaining left during a month of eternal darkness finds the town under a constant attack from vampires looking to feed and must fend them off in order to save themselves.This one was quite an enjoyable and fun vampire effort. Among the better qualities here is the long build-up to the vampires arriving, which is nicely handled through a slew of chilling scenes. The first attacks on the dog kennel and the houses on the outskirts of town, complete with the couple who are dragged under the houses, as well as worker attacks and the eerie howling in the distance are shoehorned nicely around the action of how they're slowly being overtaken all manage to come together in a setting up a fine based for the bigger, better action scenes here. The best of these is the spectacular assault on the town where they relentlessly overwhelm the townspeople jumping around, ripping up bodies and generally destroying the town rather fun, which is made all the more fun by the overhead viewpoint showing the streets and snowbanks littered with blood and feeding on the bodies around here. There's also quite a few other attacks in here, from a thrilling encounter on the streets where they overrun a car, the attacks of the station and all the fun of the later half which features the ambush in the general store, the encounter in the house and another big escape attempt through the streets using a giant machine-tractor tearing through their ranks in breaking up the bodies that makes for a great time here. As well, the finale here makes for some really enjoyable times with the final battling in the building, the big rescue attempt to get the friends' free and then the over-the-top final battle amid the burning town with some nice visual action, a brutal brawl and a fine finale which makes for a great finish on a high note. Along with the film's gore and impressive overall look for the vampires, these manage to hold this one up compared to the few minor flaws here. The biggest issue here is the film's inability to get the characters on the same page here in regards to what they're facing which leads them through a long stretch of time being defensive when it easily could've been going on the offensive to ward them off. The inability to grasp this concept makes for a lot of their actions suspect in terms of keeping their chances of staying alive down. Finally, the vampires themselves aren't all that scary. These here are the film's flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
". . . be very afraid (oh, I meant to say 'disappointed').","All gore, no story. I went to see this movie based on my fascination with other recent graphic-novel-to-film titles, like 300 and Sin City. The cinematography didn't seem to offer anything particularly similar. The story is seriously lacking, repeating the same scenario over and over again (one person sacrifices him/herself as a distraction while everyone else zips from point A to point B).The romantic tension between the two lead characters is seldomly explored and unresolved (and not in a good way). The consonant-heavy dialect of the vampires is a joke. Overall, this film is yet another ""horror"" film that relies on visual gore over suspense.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scariest Vampire Flick Ever!!,"30 Days of Night scared the living hell out of me, I went to see it when it first came out in October and it is the perfect Halloween movie. Im not a huge fan of vampire movies, but this one is awesome, i mean, i haven't seen a scary vampire flick since John Carpenters Vampires. This movie had Hollywood favorites Josh Hartnett(Halloween H20, The Faculty, and Wicker Park) and Melissa George(The Amityville Horror, Derailed and Turistas) as a few of the remaining townspeople, who are left to fight off a species of vicious vampires, who take over their town, which is surrounded by darkness for 30 days. Danny Huston(Children of Men) and Megan Franich portrayed the most vicious vampires that i have ever seen, as the leaders of the group. This film also starred Amber Sainsbury(The Ferryman) and Mark Rendall(Charlie Bartlett), as two teenage survivors fighting to survive in this graphic blood fest. Its definitely worth checking out!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
That was extremely boring movie,"It wasn't scary at all. The plot is pathetic and the ""special effects"" are horrible. I watched the whole movie, but I had to wind every second forward. There is nothing to comment in 10 lines, but I will try. Only god knows for what they got any rewards and nominations, but I assume for some kind of creatures which resemble vampires that you can never kill. Their run faster then a speeding car, leap everything in a single bound and don't die. Basically it's a waste of your time spending any minutes for watching this low-budged film. I like horrors and scary movies but good ones. There are many other films that deserve for attention but not this one and certainly I would never include ""30 days of nights"" to even third-rate film. However if you are very bored and don't have any things to do, you are depressed and want to commit a suicide then I would say ""go for it"". In many other circumstances you'd better wash your dishes which would be much more enjoyable.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
These vamps don't twinkle,"Ah, vampires, those pillars of the community who go to your local highschool and have pretty gold eyes because they only hunt animals. Oh, and they twinkle too in sunlight. I'm very pleased to say that 30 Days of Night isn't anything like that.These vampires have fangs that would make mincemeat of Kristen Stewart's neck and have a nasty habit of slaughtering every man, woman and child they meet. And they meet Josh 'the beard' Hartnett in his Alaskan town which is so northerly that the sun doesn't rise for thirty days (hence the title, right?).What follows is a story of survival, where the handful of remaining townsfolk (led by Hartnett's beard) have to last the thirty days before the eventual sunrise which will kill their undead foe (of which the head vampire bears more than a passing resemblance to Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys... but with bigger teeth and a thirst for blood, rather than poppy dance anthems).And it's good (if you don't look too closely). It has impressive action set pieces, characters you care about, plenty of gore to keep us 'claret-lovers' entertained and vampires who you don't want to slap for being so wet and 'Emo.' It could all be a classic, if it wasn't for the fact - and you might want to skip this bit, just in case you don't notice - that the whole 'thirty days aspect' seems to be well and truly glossed over. In fact, it could all happen in one night and you'd be none the wise.But that is a slight niggle and, if you like your vampires old fashioned and nasty (as opposed to falling in love with teenage waifs who are incapable of cracking a smile) then you should like this (although, whatever you do, don't watch the sequel - it's a terrible attempt at cashing in on the success of this one).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A well made stylish vampire flick,"The main premise is simple once a year during the winter the sun disappears for 30 days in a remote isolated town in Alaska, and when the sun goes down the vampires come out and they are hellbent on causing chaos. But what you really have is a survival film, how are the townsfolk going to last for 30 days with such vicious vampires lurking just about everywhere?Well director David Slade who made Hard Candy lays on the suspense and action with visual flair, so when the vampires do attack, a small group of survivors fight back, so for this type of movie to work, you have to have some inventive kills to keep the blood flowing and the adrenaline pumping, and you do get some nasty bloody kills to keep the horror fans happy. Neck's get ripped out, heads get cut off, vampires get shot left right and centre and even a kid vampire gets a gruesome demise, its all here in it's full bloody glory, the make up effects are very good. A special mention must go to Danny Huston as the head vampire, he embodies real menace and a genuine threat to the main players.Well as vampire films go, you can put this up there with Near Dark, From Dusk Till Dawn and Interview With The Vampire.

The vampire portrayals are quite gruesome -- especially the leader (Marlowe?) and his girlfriend (Iris?). (She's the stunning vamp chick with the long nose.)

One of the best of 2007!!,"Horror reaches all-new heights and temperatures in the Arctic vampire flick 30 Days of Night, a film which made 16 million dollars and was first in the box office during week one of release. Directed by David Slade of last year's underground thriller Hard Candy, 30 Days of Night gives a new name to vampire films with its slick acting and directing, stunning special effects, insane action, gallons of blood and gore, and intensely terrifying sequences. 30 Days of Night stars Josh Hartnett and Melissa George, and is based upon the graphic novel of the same name.After being plunged into darkness for an entire month, an Alaskan town is attacked by dark creatures that feed on human blood. Desperate to survive and without phones or any way of communicating, Sheriff Eben (Josh Hartnett), Stella (Melissa George), and a select few other survivors fight for their life against bloodthirsty vampires and try to make it through 30 days of pure darkness.Director David Slade utilizes beautiful cinematography along with the stunning surroundings of Alaska and snowy winds. All of the violent and gruesome scenes are not just nasty, but they flow with the story and make for amazing visuals. The CGI that is used in a few scenes is barely noticeable, and the brutality will, at times, leave your mouth agape. Slade brings a nice flow and great pacing, although sometimes it can be uneven, and gets some great performances out of the actors.Josh Hartnett, surprisingly enough, plays a completely out of control character for once, and he really shines in the role. His character has a lot of depth and goes through important changes through the film. Melissa George may not have been the better half, but she made the relationship between Eben and Stella pretty believable. Her character might be hollow, but she brings quite a lot of charisma and a great personality to her character. Ben Foster, undoubtedly, serves up the best performance in the movie as the terrifying and mysterious Stranger. With his limited screen time, he manages to bring in a creative accent and a grimy and unique look and feel to a rather bland character. He gets some of the best dialogue in the movie.Unpredictable for the most part, 30 Days of Night moves at an insanely fast pace and felt a lot like 28 Weeks Later for the vampire lover. One of the best horror movies of 2007, 30 Days of Night should not be missed for its unique performances, non-stop action, shocking scenes, great score, and a very creative direction from David Slade.

Too bloody and nothing new or unique except the little bit at the end of it. Old Donald Plesance in the first Halloween acted a million times better than this one. The plot is too simplistic and lacks of originality and every movement or happening is perfectly predictable.

This movie has some teeth!,"This is one of the best horror movies to come out in years.And it is one of the best ,if not the best,vampire movies too.Not since Nosferatu have we seen a movie vampire who actually looks the part.These vampires aren't the count type of older films nor are they the punk or yuppie variety vampire that so many recent vampire films have given us.These vampires are the descendants of Nosferatu.They have the look of death and disease about them.An isolated Aslaskan town,cut off from the outside world and thrown into darkness for 30 days,is invaded by a group of blood thirsty vampires.A few of the townsfolk struggles to survive the onslaught for the 30 days until the sun rises again.This movie is a non-stop ride of terror and gore.The special effects are so well done and everything looks so seamless and real.Heads are hacked off with axes and it looks just like you'd expect it to look.There isn't any cutesy horror movie dialog or cheeky asides in this movie.This movie is all business.The vampires are disgusting blood soaked creatures who have spiky teeth and long gore encrusted finger nails.The vampires let out this terrible squealing sound from time to time that is bone chilling.And the scene that was played in the trailer where the woman invokes the name of God is as cool a scene as I've ever seen in a horror movie.A glance into an empty sky by Marlow the vampire says it all.And how much better a location can you get than a snowed in backwoods town in Alaska in the dark for 30 days?One of my worries before I saw this movie was sometimes when there isn't a lot of light in a movie I have trouble following the action . But that didn't happen in this movie.Even though most of it was in the dark there was enough light to see every gory detail.Thank you David Slade for that.David Slade did a superb job as the director.He built up the tension without a lot of those phony horror movie tactics and the lowers the boom when the time is right and never lets up.Hopefully Slade will get more directing chances after this great movie.All the actors were good in this movie but special mention goes to Danny Huston who played the vampire leader,Marlow.He was spectacular as he crushed skulls and tore out throats.This movie has restored my faith that there are still people out there who know how to make a great horror movie.I just wish it wasn't necessary to wade through 99 stinkers to find 1 great one like this.This is a movie that horror fans will want to add to their collection.It is worthy of more than one watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

30 Days of Night: A Film Review,"30 Days of Night is a film that delivers a few scary moments, creepy looking predator-vampires and nothing else more. There is no story or no answers as to Who are the vampires? Where do they come from? What do they want? besides the obvious... Who is the creepy looking man in the opening scene of the movie who later gets thrown in jail?These and much more questions are left unexplained through the movie. Perhaps one needs to read the comics first to understand the film? My opinion is that they could have done so much better, being that idea of filming in Alaska in darkness is great... the filmmakers could have done more character development and a decent story.Gore, creepiness and violence were up to level for today's horror standards; as well as make up and costumes... Like I said the setting and idea were great, but if a story would have been developed, this film could have become a vampire favorite, not just one of many attempts to make modern horror movies.Too bad...",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
why was this film made?,"I started watching this film with high expectations. First several scenes, with small village covered with snow were promising. But soon after that, when I realized that, even though I kept my eyes wide open, I wasn't able to see almost anything on the screen because scenes were so dark that film was barely watchable. Vampires in this film are not scary at all. Reduced from philosophical Gothic monsters in films of the sixties, to mindless beasts without history or charm in this film, they are less scary than a pack of wolves. You almost feel pity for those simple, pathetic, bloodsucking creatures who are freezing on minus 50 C just to get a meal, instead of enjoying immortality in their castle in Romania and waiting their servant Igor to bring them fresh blood in a golden bowl. There are almost no special effects in this film, due to the obviously low budget. That was unsuccessfully compensated with shaky camera and ultra rapid nervous editing which simultaneously prevents you from seeing any detail (which was probably intentional), and makes you feel dizzy. Scary effects are made only by intense music score, loud nerve-wracking sounds, and almost constant screaming. Why was this film made? There is nothing new or original in it. On the contrary, it is full of clichés. There is no scene in it which we hadn't seen in other films at least ten times. This is just yet another exploitation movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 days of Night....,"In the last few years (98-07) there has been many vampire/horror movies released such as Blade. These movies tend to come off cheesy or lame. Recently I had to the chance to see ""30 days of Night"" and personally wasn't expecting a great deal, the only favorable thing about the film was that it was produced by Sam Raimi.The film is set in Barrow, Alaska where we are introduced to the town's sheriff, Evan. A simple act of vandalism (burnt cellphones) makes them question who would have done a thing like this.The film than proceeds onto explain that there is one flight leaving and no more flights for 30 whole days. For these 30 whole days, Barrow is in complete darkness.A stranger is caught and imprisoned with the help of Stella. The stranger warns them all that they are not safe, while at this time the power gos out and the vampires come to town.The film is of a high standard, a very good horror flick, an O.K story, good acting (Josh Hartnett was actually good in this film, I was surprised.) good film shots and techniques. Brilliant sound effects, people who are easily scared beware.So what brings the film down in the end? The ending, It was woeful! This movie deserved to be finished off better!

Horrible waste of time,"This is one of the worst films I've ever watched. The basic idea sounds good - 30 days of night sounds like an all-you-can-eat buffet for vampires, right? - but the plot, dialog, and acting are all uniformly bad. Only gore-fest fans who don't care about anything else will find this film enjoyable.The lead vampire does nothing except screech and glare, but I'd rate him as the best actor in the film. At least he shows a much better range than the wooden performances of the leading man and woman. Unfortunately the vampires, despite their superhuman powers, are made into bumbling idiots by the plot. 30 days of night and they can't even search a small town? I thought vampires were only supposed to sleep in the day time, so what was this bunch doing the whole time?I could go on for a long time, but don't want to include anything that might be considered a spoiler.

Such promise yet such a letdown,"Now don't get me wrong, I love me some vampire movies and gore and blood and gratuitous violence just like the next movie freak but after the first hour of this particular one I had to keep myself from walking out of the theater.Great setting, Hartnett does a very very good job as the sheriff and I loved the grittiness and reality of the town which they lived in. Great set up with how the action starts but then for me it quickly dwindled into a very very average flick. I'm tired, so very tired of seeing cliché after cliché in regards to monster movies. Are vampires intelligent? Do they dress nice? Do they speak their own language? Who really knows but if done well, a vampire movie can retain old feel as well as inject new as well. Having mindless drones run around screeching at the camera at every chance with that continuous open mouth, show me the fangs stare, does get tiresome quickly. Break the mold such as was done with zombies in 28 days later. Now of course they weren't dead in 28 days so how could they really be zombies but it was implied and the fact that they were the way they were due to a contagion did little to lessen the effect of the movie.This movie dragged longer than it should have and left too many holes and unanswered questions. Great build up with just as much of a letdown in the overall story. The ending didn't satisfy me as a viewer who wanted to see a very climactic finish.

The make-up done on her was a fantastic job.This director David Slade along with his production crew did an excellent job of showing the ugly, nasty and brutal side of vampires which has been glossed over or ignored in earlier times no doubt do to the fact that this stark, brutal portrayal of vampires could never be released to the general public in earlier times.

Falls short...,"This flick, based on the Niles/Templesmith comic definitely had the potential to make a decent movie, but the vampires and their weird Klingon sounding dialogue just didn't work for me, kind of took away from the suspense and made them less menacing and decidedly goofy really. Less vampiric hissing would've been most welcome. Kinda reminded a little of the theatrical cut of ""Land of The Dead"" (still a better movie) where the lead zombie is always moaning constantly. Less is usually more. Hartnett was good and well cast, and there were some good moments, despite the crappy vamp antics, but I would've preferred that they not have changed the end as it was in the book. That's my take anyway.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

30 days of blood and boredom,"If it is a traditional gore fest you want, 30 Days of Night is just the thing for you. The film has its roots in Night of The Living Dead. Personally, I think this formula is getting a bit dull. Just occasionally a filmmaker shows up with a fresh idea in mind, Like Ruben Fleischer with this years hit Zombieland, or before that, Robert Rodriguez with Dusk till Dawn. Everything else is either a remake or a movie like 30 Days of Night. Although these vamps are about as ferocious as they come, they have about as little impact on the film as the heroes who fight them. 30 days of Night is just a bore.In Barstow Alaska (the northern most point in the state, the last day of sun sees half the town pulling out to go south with the birds. For thirty days every year, no sunlight will ever reach that far north. It is the perfect feeding ground for a family of vampires who show up out of nowhere. The few dozen residents who are staying, get reduced to a few within a matter of hours. The sheriff, has to find a way to keep everyone alive for the next month, until Mr golden sun comes back.To say that the movie fails because it is unoriginal would be ineffective criticism. More specifically the movie has no energy. It is too slow. Of course there is nothing wrong with that, provided the film offers solid suspense like Aliens. 30 days of Night offers none. Instead it gives us copious amounts of blood which won't even make you flinch.The only positive thing that stays with you when you walk away from the film, is Danny Huston's performance as the head vampire, kind of amusing. A few nice shots here and there as well as a credible electronic score shine through, but I think 30 Days of Night is dismissible, and should be left in the shadows.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 Days was good,"I disagree completely with the previous comment. We saw the movie opening night at a Rave Theater with DLP and Digital audio, we were on a triple date that ranged in movie goers from me(I have been waiting for this movie for 2 months) to one of the couples who had never heard of it. There were a few jumpy parts and the movie was well done. It was a little different than the graphic novel, but still held together well as an adaptation. The movie created it's own rules about vampires, which is OK. The movie going experience itself plays a huge part of whether or not people enjoy the movie. I think the other couple just had a bad night. I don't listen to movie critics either, and I advise everyone else to see the movie for themselves. A writer for the SunSentinel in Florida said 300 was the worst movie she had ever seen...Are you kidding me.

"a gripping, brutal, bloody and very good vampire movie","30 Days Of Night, is based on the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. It has a brilliant premise : a town that suffers a month without sun is attacked by vampires. Can anyone survive the month alive....? The movie is directed by David Slade, who made the impressive Hard Candy, and produced by Sam Raimi. I don't know how faithful it is to the graphic novel, but the movie is very good indeed.One of the reasons for this, is that it does something that very few movies do recently....build up the tension at the start slowly, by allowing the characters a chance to develop before the action kicks in. Once the vampires do unleash their reign of terror, the movie turns brutal and bloody as the vampires rip, bite, tear people apart for food. This movie makes the creatures fearsome and terrifying, which they haven't been in movies for a while. I think the last truly scary vampires were in Near Dark and this lot are a match for them.Led by Danny Huston, they at times are almost playing with their 'food'as they hunt them down, with a brutal scene where a lone woman screams for help while being followed by the vampires, while the survivors hide in buildings unable or unwilling to save her.There is a fantastic set-piece where from an above shot, the camera moves over the town as the humans and vampires battle it out. Slade handles the action well, although at times it does seem over-edited during the attacks.The survivors, led by Josh Hartnett and Melissa George are not your typical group. Led by the town sheriff and a fire marshal, they are simply a bunch of normal people hiding and praying they can last the month. In a typical movie they'd probably all turn into fearless killers, but not here.The acting by the whole cast is impressive, with special mention to Danny Huston as the vampire leader, and Ben Foster almost unrecognizable as a stranger in town to cause disruption within the town to prepare for the vampires arrival.The language of the vampires is well thought-out. Not English, but something different entirely.If there is a criticism to make of the movie, it's that for obvious reasons it skips days as the movie progresses. As a result, it does feel like there are scenes missing. Also, although there are some good set-pieces within the movie (inculding a terrific one with a little girl), you would like to have seen more of the carnage inflicted on the town. As it is, it's mostly off-screen leaving it to sounds of gunshots and screams, although this does add to the tension and atmosphere.The ending too is a slight let down, but to give credit it gets away with it by not giving you the Hollywood ending you'd expect, but a proper and slightly haunting end.There's not much humour in the movie, which isn't surprising considering what's going on which is a rarity these days.This is a serious horror movie, one of the best this year and certainly the best vampire movie for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Over 30 minutes of Pain if you see this flick,"I have seen a lot of vampire movies, I've seen tons of horror flicks period, a lot of them indie movies and a lot of them big time productions.'30 days of Night' was the most disappointing 'vampire' movie I have ever seen. In. My. Life.For a 'horror' movie, the only actually 'scary' parts were the two seconds of startled feeling you just from the camera doing a close up on a decapitated head. I ended up actually *laughing* through most of it! A spoof movie, such as 'Shaun of the Dead' is a 'horror-comedy', it's got a horror-genre that is *supposed* to be funny.'30 days of Night' was actually *trying* to be a scary/thriller though, and that's what is so absolutely disappointing. Plot holes abound, screeching 'vampires' that were actually more like the sirens of Greek mythology, The gore of the film was trying but still lacking in comparison to other far scarier film-by the last 30 minutes of the movie I wasn't even trying to hold back my snickering laughter and lack of care for the 'victims'.Don't waste your money seeing this at the Theatre!

An excellent intelligent Vampire Tale,"Full marks to the cast and crew involved in making this movie. It is a tense thriller which doesn't rely on special effects to relate it's dark and sinister tale. Granted the effects are superb when they appear but it is the tension created that really makes this movie one to watch. In an age where horror movies are either not scary or just downright obscene, this one ranks among some of the best. It's intelligent and realistic portrayal of the vampire as a remnant of something human yet the purest of evil is very creepy indeed. Another important aspect to the film is the Alaskan scenery, photographed here to highlight it's exquisite finery. Once it's dark, you don't really care but there is some wonderful photography here.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Unique vampire flick with fast paced, compact story line.","Just saw this one last night in Castle Rock, CO. They cranked down the heat in the theater so it made the scenes of the arctic wasteland of northern Alaska even more bone-chilling. Compared to most horror movies today, this one has a more direct, old-school horror/drama feel. The acting is on par for this genre, although the female lead is a bit weak. It takes the viewer a good 20 minutes to really put together what's happening, but then builds to a continuously suspenseful, nearly 2 hour long movie. Minimal use of CGI with an even mix of on and off screen slasher scenes keep you toes curled. It's spine-tingling once you put together how the vampires actually get to this isolated region and how they move from one locale to another. The ending doesn't disappoint and leaves room for a sequel, but not blatantly. The only thing that disappoints is that the camera spends too much time on the vampires for the movie's own good. Collectively they can look like a crowd swept from the floor of an Eastern European disco at 3am after a hard night of Euro-trash style partying. Even in this movie, less would have made it better. Overall, the smooth, compact story line makes up for some cinematographic short-comings.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great film. Seriously!,"I went to see this film on Saturday 10th November and was expecting to be disappointed by another lame vampire film, but damn this film was good. It had great performances from Josh Harnett, Melissa George and the vampires. Josh Harnett's character was superb acting as the towns main hope and the fact that he was not a Steven Segal hero, but a regular, scared guy trying to help the surviving people. The film was a rather gory but who cares? Most of the films scenes were spectacular because of the realistic violence and the fact that you didn't know how the next victim would die! I am not sure why I liked this film so much because I'm not usually a big fan of violent films but this film was so believable andI was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end! I would recommend this film to anyone except children under 10 and elderly pensioners. Great film, go and see it. Seriously!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 dollars well spent,"Saw this in movie theatres upon its initial 2007 release and more recently (circa 2017) purchased the blu ray disc.A modern classic of the bloodsucking genre.Exotic location, excellent cinematography, top shelf performances, excellent special effects, a no nonsense story, & spooky choreography come together in the Alaskan (or is that New Zealand?) darkness for 30 frightful nights.To be fair, we only realise 30 ""days"" have passed when a character flat out tells us so. That's my only niggling criticism - there's no sense of elapsed time.You wouldn't know it but it really is a classic western. The town sheriff bands together with a few hearty locals as they try and weather the wave of brutality brought upon the town by a group of strangers from lands unknown.Director David Slade manages constraint in the pacing, which must have been difficult considering the amount of talent he had at his disposal both behind and in front of the camera. But the movie's much better for it.The design & behaviour, their language in particular, of the ""coven"" is unique to this movie, which is commendable.The sense of terror that has gripped the town is palpable, but the resolve of the townsfolk and their sheriff is just as authentic.There was a sequel made a few years later which I've not yet seen. It doesn't appear to have the same budget but as it's from the same series of graphic novels it may too be worth a look.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Living To the Hype!!,"This movie was simply Over Hyped especially since it was based on a comic (following other successful adaptations), had a big blockbuster budget, good-decent actors; not to mention an interesting plot and yet the only good thing to it was the special fx. My issues with this film for starters was how these super vampires at the end got a pass for the majority by ""The One Who Fights"" Josh Hartnet after they just killed part of his family, friends, village and himself as well(since he had to turn himself into one); he simply lets them go!! Another gripe which I have with this movie is how throughout this entire movie a huge throw down is culminating with ""The Head Vampire aka Marlow"" and Josh Hartnet's character and yet it's wrapped up within a couple of minutes leaving a lot to be desired. Hell Mark Boone Junior's character ""Beau Brower"" at least went out like a soldier when it was his time... and all Josh Hartnet's character could muster was a that limp victory!! So disappointing!!As for two possible goofs with this movie which seem to have gone unnoticed; 1). the fight at the plant involving Josh's character, his deputy and the vampire which I've dubbed ""The Bald Bastard"". During this fight scene ""The Bald Bastard"" has managed to wrestle the axe away from our hero and then he throws it at Josh's character missing him completely and hitting the railing and possibly falling off to the side and yet when the deputy has changed; Josh's character goes over to that same axe which is now placed on the floor near the railing and uses it to decapitate his former friend. The second possible goof (though I'm not completely positive); is that if that evil ""Bald Bastard"" is thrown into the mincer in that plant then who's the ""Bald Bastard"" at the end (were there two of them?? They looked the same).",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A decent premise ruined by a weak script and acting,"Barrow, Alaska is one of the most northerly town in America, and in the middle of winter the town suffers from Polar Night, a month of darkness. Often most people leave the town and only a few diehards stay for the period. They is no way of leaving the town. On the last day of daylight the local sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) has to investigate some unusual crimes, including stolen mobile phones being burned and all the town sledge dogs being killed. Everything becomes clear when a group of vampires led by Marlowe (Danny Huston) and use the darkness as a chance for a feeding frenzy. A group of surviving, including Eben, his younger brother Jake (Mark Rendall) and estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) have to hide and survive the hunting vampires.The premise for the film is good for a vampire film, a group of sadistic vampire isolate a small town and because of the polar night can do whatever their want. There are interesting ideas, like the survivors hiding like Anne Frank and her family, and the vampires avoid turning people by cutting off their heads. This are tough vampires with speed and strength and their own weakness is sunlight. The only other way to kill a vampire is cutting off their heads. But all these themes are no enough to save the film. Their is a weak script, with poor dialogue, lacking wit or realism. There is little character development, and many elements felt forced: like Eben's asthma and his relationship with Stella. People do also act stupid in a unrealistic fashion.The other main problem is the cast. Only Danny Huston comes off as a interesting character, as a sadistic vampire willing to use violence and basically a tough mother. But the rest are just a bunch of bland actors. Josh Hartnett is a really boring actor and seems too young to be a sheriff and too much of a pretty boy for this type of role. The only role he has been good in was as The Man in Sin City. Ben Foster is another boring actor in the film and lacked the skill generally to be an actor. Melissa George is easy on the eye and generally a better actor to most of the cast, but she too was miscasted and unbelievable as a Fire Marshall for the area. The casting was poor for the film.David Slade in my opinion is a fairly overrated director. His first film Hard Candy was overrated, with a lot of music video style camera tricks, and in 30 Days of Night there is no special shots, except for an aerial shot of the vampires attacking the towns people.There is a good level of gore to keep die-hard horror fans happy, but for the rest of us you don't need to knock yourself out for this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A well-made vampire movie, though it lacks depth","Whoever it was that said this was a zombie movie is insane. The characters even use the word ""vampire"" at one point. It's a freakin' vampire movie. That's why they're so fast and strong. Also, Eastern European, and with sharp teeth. Like, oh, I don't know... VAMPIRES!Josh Hartnett does a really good job with his role, and the cinematography is really well done. There isn't a lot of depth of theme here - the closest the movie comes to any sort of self-reflection is a series of quips by the leader of the vampire clan that express some of their religious worldview - for example, ""What can be broken, must be broken."" The film suffers a bit from the fact that it is adapted from a serial comic book. Specifically, the story jumps ahead days at a time without any establishing of what has and hasn't happened in the interim.The creative cinematography makes this a fun ""monster-gore"" movie, and the original premise makes it worth seeing. It's generally well-acted as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not what it could have been,"Barrow, Alaska. The most Northerly town in the United States. During the longest night of the year (er... that would be the '30 days of night' of the title) a group of vampires descend on the town, feeding on everyone that they can find. A group of people, led by an young sheriff, fight to survive the onslaught. Will these people make it until daybreak? Ah... Well that is the question. You will have to see the movie to find out, won't you?Frankly, I think the above setup for a horror movie is absolutely fantastic and brilliant and original (until somebody tells me that it has been done before) and I was really looking forward to seeing it. Plenty of scope for an full blooded ""Dawn Of The Dead"" battle-for-survival-against-incredible-odds, kind of a movie. It is such a shame that the execution of the idea left so much to be desired.Yes, the vampires are truly fantastic creations. Evil, gross, vicious, animal like mutations. Danny Huston, as their (Hungarian speaking?) almost philosophical leader, is great and made me shiver every time he appeared on screen. There is wonderful cinematography, in the latter stages focusing on the white of the snow and the red of the blood, and some brilliant scene construction, showing at a distance the carnage and mayhem on the ground. But, sadly and possibly inevitably, ""30 Days Of Night"" commits the cardinal sin of any horror movie. When the monsters' are not on screen, it is really boring and slow.Maybe it is down to the cast. I don't know. I didn't find them interesting. ""Hard Candy"" proves that David Slade can direct a pacy, interesting film with a minimal cast, when that cast is good. (That film is practically a two hander throughout.) I must say that even as a longstanding Josh Harnett apologist (I like him, really I do), I felt that his performance this time is particularly vacant and definitely nothing to write home about.""30 Days Of Night"" is not terrible, but it is not what it could have been.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally! A modern horror classic,"Based on the graphic novel of the same name, 30 Days of Night is about the survivors of a vampire raid on the small Alaskan town of Barrow. The cinematography is clear, chilling, and stylish. From the very beginning, before things even go bad, you feel a dark event on the horizon. The mood of the movie is unyielding and never lets go of its serious tone; You really feel the sense of struggle, hope, and loss at every turn. The performances are spot on and never seem too plastic or fake. I was really impressed by the soundtrack too as it's filled with ambiance and subtlety that helps build suspense and tension. Note that this movie is your typical hard core horror movie. You won't get any comic relief here (hello I Am Legend), this will creep you out. From beginning to end 30 Days is every thing I expected it to be. My only disappointment comes from the ending. I won't spoil it but will say that it is less than fulfilling. A sad addition to a very common problem with good movies. It never quite feels finished, but maybe that's intentional.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not a vampire movie,"The thing about vampires is that they're human monsters. The human part of them is what makes them more creepy, and attractive. I agree with a previous comment - these are more like fast moving zombies than vampires. They certainly devoured people more like zombies than vampires. The vampires in this film were just monsters, and not particularly scary either - they were a bit creepy, but their screeches were annoying and over-used. The made-up language wasn't the best idea either - what, you learn a new language when you get turned? Hm.The human characters were pretty good, but there wasn't much depth to them so it was hard, I thought, to be that bothered when they were killed or turned. I also saw a lot of things coming in this movie, which is shocking because I hardly ever see things coming. As soon as that big grindy-choppy machine was shown, near the beginning, it was plain that someone, and/or part of someone was going to fall in to this at some point.I thought this movie was exceedingly average, and I think it's going to disappear into cinema history without much of a trace. The reviews I've read claim that this is a 'genuinely chilling horror' and that the vampires are 'genuinely scary'. I disagree on both counts.

These aren't good looking vampires who want to fall in love and care about people, these are vicious monsters who are scary as hell.

Best vampires I've ever seen!,"I've really had low expectations, if any, when I set out to watch this film. I've had no information about the original comic strip, or the cast, or anything save for the short synopsis. Surprisingly, 30 Days of Night turned out to be the best film of the Monsters/Vampires sub-genre I've seen in a while, if not ever.The story and build up are great, and really suitable for a vampires flick. An Alaskan town going through a full month with no sunlight, what grounds could be more fertile for a vampires attack? The perfect combination of supernatural with fitting realistic set-up. The exposition is carried out through the uncovering of the preparations for the attack, and continues to show the way the few survivors struggle to survive, giving us some aspects of post-apocalyptic and zombies films. The plot is pretty straight forward, simple and lacking in any challenging complexity or twists, but then again the plot is not the ""main feature"" of this film, not by far.The entire cast has done a great job in my opinion, and I for one have been most impressed by Mark Rendall in the role of Jake, the main protagonist's kid brother. Script and cinematography have also been done just right. However, the best part of the film and the one that truly made it shine above all others which resemble it - has definitely been the vampires themselves. I'm not sure who deserves the credit for the amazing and almost perfect way in which the vampires have been designed and portrayed - but I've never seen better. These vampires weren't Victorian nobles like in Interview With the Vampire, not elitist pseudo- Goths like in the Blade trilogy. They were far from human despite having humanoid skeleton, limbs and such exterior organs. Their eyes, jaws, teeth and movement were savage and feral like beasts. Their banshee-like shrieks of communication and their authentic language topped it off, and really made them more alien-beast than human. I salute those in charge of creating these nightmarish creatures.This has been the second time I've seen this film, this time as a preparation for the much anticipated sequel. I really hope it lives up to this film's standards. While lacking any real twists in the not that complicated plot - 30 Days of Nights just might be the best vampires film I've ever seen.

I'm guessing this was done because they weren't supposed to be the seductive, beautiful vampires one usually sees in the movies, but bloodthirsty animals who are never sated, always looking for the next kill. Yes there was a lot of gore which usually turns me off, but the truly frightening thing about this movie was the feeling of being trapped that not only are the characters experiencing but the audience experiences as well. Josh Hartnett has completely redeemed himself in my eyes, (I haven't been able to watch a movie with him in it since Black Dahlia, the biggest piece of crap ever made), and was probably the best actor in the movie. I'm definitely going to see this one again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
How could you screw up what was laid out for you?,"30 Day's of Night sucked on so many levels, it's not even funny. Don't get me wrong, I loved the comics, but this movie was vile. Not in the good way either...The story was horrid. Even though the man behind the comics, Steve Niles, wrote the screenplay it couldn't have been farther from the original story line. There must have been two scenes, TWO SCENES, that were the same between the comics and movies. Why? The comics were practically story boards to what should have been done! And the comics were good, that's why they sold well. They shouldn't have strayed so far from the source material...The so called ""Special Effects"" were bad. Really, Really, Really, bad. The CGI was so painfully obvious that it hurt. 30 Day's of Night is like watching a hyper-violent ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". One scene in particular sticks out. Eben and his ex-girlfriend (Who should be his wife if it followed the f#%king comics!) are driving in their car, when a ""Vampire"" hops on the roof. The Animators were so lazy, that they didn't even give the vampire a face. It was just a shadow on their car. I've seen better animations in Pokemon.The acting, I didn't really have much hope for this seeing as Josh Harnett was cast in the lead. But, I will say he did a pretty good job as Eben. However, everybody else was vile. Nobody showed any emotion in their voice, none. It was like the Director hired his closest friends to do the job.Skip this movie at all costs. Maybe it's just because of my high expectations, but this movie ranks along with Uwe Boll's House of the Dead as one of the worst movies ever made. If you really, really, really, really, like vampires you might like it. Anyone else though, avoid like the plague.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sublime,"This was truly one of the best films I've ever seen. The setting, the sheer intensity of fear, the music...everything! It's like a cross between 28 Days Later and Resident Evil. The way the creatures are brought into the film is excellent. Even when the characters are merely talking, you are encapsulated in an fear that is unshakable. The absolute terrifying prospect of vicious vampires stalking the protagonists grabs you for the duration of the film. Somehow the film is made believable, even though it is a totally unbelievable situation. There are certainly elements from Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot. The sense of horror resonates through your entire being from the word go. For anyone that enjoyed video games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill this film is sure to thrill you. From start to finish the film is brilliantly paced. The characters do a great job. The whole feeling of the film is just great and it is one that must be seen by those who want a thrill and a scare.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of my Favorites vampires movie,"I will start of with the plot :After an Alaskan town is plunged into darkness for a month, it is attacked by a bloodthirsty gang of vampiresI really enjoyed this vampire movie,there were some really good scary and creepy moment in this movie, it never gets boring for long and is packed with some great gory scenes.The acting from everyone was really great, this movie had some really great special effects and the make up effect for the vampires were really good and made them looked really scary.The ending was really good and but really sad and i will go as far and say some might think this to be a tearjerker ending, which you don't get that often in horror movies.I give this movie 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good vampire flick,"This movie reminded me of the recent remake of ''Dawn of the Dead''. Undead creatures are haunting a group of civilians, and they have to fight back with all means accessible. There is one big difference and that is that this flick is set into a small Alaskan town in which it won't be light within 30 days. And as we all know: undead thrive in the darkness. I liked the dark atmosphere and the black humor combined with a thrilling tale of saving yourself against the ultimate evil. I also adored how they gave the vampires a religious way of thinking. It's as if their leader is some cult-figure and the others follow them as mindless goats. Nice metaphor of how some religious people are brought into doing hideous things out of their beliefs.The only thing is that there are a few clichés too many and the storyline feels a tad bit inadequate at times. It didn't spoil the experience enough to bitch about it, but it's worth to mention it to those who didn't see the flick yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good Idea, I Suppose, But Fails Miserably","I accept the idea that 30 days of night would be heaven on earth for a vampire, that being said, it doesn't happen that way in any part of the world, it's not scientifically possible. However, even if I chose to ignore that major detail (which, quite honestly, I did for the sake of enjoying the film) there were just too many problems with this movie for it to actually be anything more than barely watchable.First of all, the violence got choppy (and I mean really really choppy), so much so that I could barely tell what was going on when it probably would've been really cool to see. It's almost as if they couldn't hold their camera man was ADD or the camera was too heavy for him or something. It simply got really annoying really quickly.Second, I absolutely hate it when characters know way more than they should. For instance (and this isn't a spoiler because it's true with all vampire myths, except when you talk about that piece of trash book Twilight, but that's not important) how the hell do they know that the vampires don't like sunlight? They ""explain"" their reasoning, but it's such a stretch that within two seconds I came up with a million other, more plausible reasons for their ""explanation"" besides that they don't like the sun. I know that they could have come up with a better way of telling us that.Third I'll compile my issues with the vampires themselves (since there are only two) when the vampires attack someone it's like their having a freaking seizure. They keep flailing their heads around, it actually looks really funny and I had to keep from laughing, which is not good when your supposed to be scared by them. My other issue with the vamps, one minute they seem like intelligent hunters, the next they seem like mindless killing machines, back to intelligent hunters, mindless... intelligent... mindless... they switch back n' forth so much I could never quite wrap my head around what I supposed to think about them! Fourth and finally (without going into spoilers that is) I watched this movie expecting a frightening horror movie... it wasn't scary, and it can only be classified as horror for a few short seconds (and anything with vampires has to be horror). For the most part, it was a slow romp through the snow here, and some gory action there... I would classify it more as drama or action than horror.However, the look and feel of the film was good, I liked the art style a lot, so I was really hoping it was going to be good, and the story was not all that bad, enough plot holes to bug me, but I expect a few here and there... but it wasn't good, and it takes a lot more than an amazing art style and over the top gore to impress me (a matter of fact, over the top gore bugs me, I like realistic gore, that's always fun, but too much just gets way to in your face and distracts from the film itself).",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Bloody Mediocre,"I went into this with high hopes and was not disappointed, nor was I over entertained. The setting was marvellous, white and cold which offered an eerieness not often seen in recent vampire movies, the portrayal of the vampires was good, blood lusted, violent and addicted were thoughts that came to mind. The let down was the cast, in particular Mr Hartnett. He gave a mediocre performance and was not at all convincing as the hero. Perhaps a different casting would have seemed better to me, but as it was, the film will continue in my eyes as an OK attempt at a modern vampire movie. The graphic novel is supposed to be great, maybe I will read it then try the movie again, but as it stands just now, good effort ; just wide!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great movie and deserves more credit,"This movie should be ranked higher. It's a great movie with a great cast. It's a great, different take on vampires and the atmosphere and ideas of this movie are great. The seclusion, the dark and the fear make this movie an easy top 10 for vampire movies in my opinion. The fact that they have a unique perspective and something not done before is a breath of fresh air. Even the head vampire said they should have came here ages ago because of the 30 days the town is in darkness. This is definitely a must watch and a movie thats done right and not beating the dead horse when it comes to vampire lore and whats been done before.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rubbish Horror Film,"A bunch of vampires inplausibly cut of a town and proceed to attack the residents. When I was watching I wished it would end sooner than it did. Rubbish. Features the clichéd ""dog barking at alien/monster"", and then the murder of said dogs. Basically mostly action, i.e. vampires tearing at throats. Interesting in this film is the vampires speak there own language. Sounds a bit like Klingon.The town is very northern in Alaska and so has periods without any sun. This brings out the vampires.Somebody should have mentioned to the poor huddled survivors that they needed crucifixes and holy water, and maybe a bit of garlic.

Much better than I expected.,"30 Days of Night starts out with a fascinating introduction to its fascinating setting, Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost city in America. A quick look at Google earth with reveal this to be true  Barrow is very near Barrow Point, the northern tip of North America. I have a strange fascination with places like this. I'll probably never make it out there, but when I hear of places like that it always makes me want to visit them. For now, however, I'll have to settle for this vampire movie, which in many ways is better than average, but is less than average in many other ways.Josh Hartnett plays the town Sheriff, Eben Oleson, who spends his days crossing the t's and dotting the i's of his job, often just keeping up the formalities or other times in order to make the citizens, even the ones living alone out in the frozen wilderness, remember that they are all part of the town. You see, it's a pretty quiet life that they lead up there in the far north.Before long, however, some Strange Occurrences start taking place, with increasingly mysterious implications and circumstances, and then animals and people start turning up brutally killed. Structurally the film is pretty routine, but it's location adds a new element to the genre, and some of the photography is outstanding. There are a few aerial shots of the carnage, for example, some while the killing is actually taking place, which are some of the best shots I've ever seen in a vampire film.Similarly, the vampires themselves are impressively performed, despite your occasional overacting. The special effects and make up come together for an impressive affect that reminds me of those unbelievably creepy Asian schoolgirls in that LFO music video called ""Freak."" I recommend it, it's crazy.Before long, as is to be expected, you have a core group of the townspeople, the only survivors, we can presume, holed up somewhere sleeping in shifts, taking turns on watch out, rationing food, etc, and of course there is somewhere that ""if they can reach it they'll have enough food to last a month."" This has all been done who knows how many times, but there is something added to the personality of the vampires that I hadn't seen before.There is an interesting hierarchy to them, they are stratified with a leader and his minions followed by I imagine an army of lower level vampires that obey orders. In order to achieve motive for the screenplay's need for the whole town to be exterminated, the leader actually makes a clever statement, telling his followers that it has taken them centuries to make people believe that they were just a bad dream, so the humans all had to be destroyed to prevent the escape of any eyewitnesses. Evidently he's unaware of the real world response that a group of people would get from the rest of America if they were to come forward and claim that a horde of vampires had wiped out the entire population of the country's northernmost city.And one thing that I have to mention, the ending of the film (which is generally the worst part of most horror movies) is outstanding. Sheriff Oleson, in order to save the rest of the survivors, infects himself with vampire blood and then battles the vampires on his own before he fully transforms into one of them.There is, of course, going to be the standard complaint that the sun doesn't ""set"" one day and then lead to 30 days of darkness, but I should think that such a thing is irrelevant to a movie like this. In reality, think of it like the sun rises lower and lower in the sky as winter approaches, finally doing sort of a ring along the horizon for some time during winter, at which time it's never really daytime and never really nighttime. I've always wanted to see that.Although the movie is not without plot holes (there is an eerie shot of a ship ominously approaching the shore in the opening of the movie, which one of the vampires watches with some mixture of fascination and fear, and yet we never find out anything about it), the last shot in the movie is the perfect ending to the story, and the movie also, by the way, has what might be the most graphic beheading I've ever seen. If you're into that, don't miss this one!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
30 days of night and no alcohol?!,"This movie had a ton to offer. It spanned quite a few genres and accomplished them all quite well.As far as horror goes there was definitely a hard lean on jump scares but the creep factor despite this was certainly apparent. The vampires were scary and portrayed in a classic yet really cool way. I wish they had given us a little bit more background on who they were, where they came from and what their end goal was. I also wish they hadn't had them in modern garb and haircuts. It took away from the overall spook every time I saw the leaders high and tight hair cut lol.As far as thriller goes this one keeps up the pace and does a really solid job filling out its two hour run time. Now, I do think that it could've been cut down by maybe about 15 minutes, as it did feel slightly repetitive at times. However, it stayed thrilling and kept you engaged and on the end of your seat.This was also very much an action movie. They did a really good job with lots of stunts and special effects. There were some really gnarly gore and special effects and a particularly cool decapitation towards the end. I can only assume I watched a remastered version because the picture quality was great and it stayed nice and atmospheric throughout. I do wish they had done a little bit of a better job keeping it dark but still being able to see the action. It was quite light throughout the movie.This still feels like it follows the blue print of an early 2000's movie, but not in a particularly bad way. The script can be hokey at times with it's one liners, the acting is generally pretty good but still feels stilted at points (shout out to Ben Foster for a great performance) and for the most part it follows that horror/thriller/action rubric that was popular at the time. Even watching it 15 years after it's release, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and it still retains its vibe of a classic even with its age. 7.5 rounding up to an 8, would recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oh my God! It's the same old crap. With a new title.,"It's official! The horror movie genre has fallen into an annoying cliché hole from which it will never emerge. This movie was just the latest in a long line of disappointing horror crap. It takes the best ideas from other more famous (better) horror films and throws them into a pot and says ""There, I'm being creative. Right? Anybody? Hello?"" Don't believe me? Fine. 1. Dark ashy color: Brought into horror vogue by The Ring. 2. Jerky fight scenes: Brought into horror movie vogue by 28 Days Later. 3. General poor camera work: Blair Witch. They were creative and were rewarded as such. So why not steal it? 4. WAAAAAAAY (I really cannot possibly show my rage with that word) too much gore: Gore amount has been building for a long time but do we really need it? Yes, we all bleed but this just shows WAY too much of it with no purpose other than ""I think it makes it scarier."" 5. Loud bangs: Old cliché. But still, I want to be SCARED. As in frighten me, creep me out, disturb me. MY REFLEXES ARE FINE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN, NOW STOP IT. Just because I jump doesn't mean I'm scared. May I ask what the Hell is wrong with Hollywood now? Every genre now has a crutch and lacks creativity. This movie sucked because its components sucked. How can you have such a good plot idea and then perform it so blowfully? I can't believe that Hollywood will never produce another good movie again. This bites. I would have been proud to have been a part of a film like The Silence of the Lambs or The Shining or Scream or The Ring even if it meant doing a crappy job like janitor or best boy. Very proud. I wouldn't have signed onto this movie as the lead actor for a contract worth 50 million. Mainly because I would never work again if I did. But also because I have higher respect for myself than that. And if you have even the slightest amount of self respect you won't see this movie.

idiotic,"I'd never read the comics this film was based on, but it struck me as a somewhat intriguing idea... a group of vampires (i.e., monsters who can only hunt at night) discover perfect prey in a Alaskan town that endures a full month of night every year.Sounds like a kinda clever premise for a horror movie, right? Well, it might have been, if 30 Days of Night had anything more than an remotely interesting premise to go on. The acting, script, set pieces, costumes, and special effects were all laughably bad. I should note that I'm a big fan of some really bad horror movies... but for a bad horror movie to be enjoyable, it has to avoid the cardinal sin of being boring. Not only was 30 Days laughably bad in just about all critical respects in which a movie can be bad, it was also painfully dull to watch. The characters were so poorly drawn there was no reason to care what happened to any of them, not the humans, not the vampires. It's hard to say who were more vapid or annoying, the humans or the vampires.The humans suffered from stilted and silly dialog and bad acting, the vampires suffered from lousy makeup jobs (one of them looked like Trent Reznor in drag) and a ridiculous ""language"" (it sounded like they were speaking Klingon). Also, the plot never developed at all beyond ""there are baddies coming to get us""... no explanation as to where the vampires came from. Which might have been alright, if there had been any successful development of suspense or fear; but there was not. Just some pretty gory deaths, which in this day and age of ultra-violent horror movies, is just not enough to base a movie around by itself.There were some funny bits, like the vampires Klingonesque dialect and silly appearance, and some rather enormous plot holes (planes can't fly in the dark, eh?). But unless you're just looking for something to play ""Mystery Science Theater"" with, stay away from this steaming piece of junk.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very gritty. Very cool.,"I can honestly say that 30 Days of Night takes the tired, done to death vampire story and puts a rather fresh spin on it. Gone are the vampires who are so completely wimpy that Blade can kill with a single swing of his manly sword. These vampires are a new kind of evil, one that takes the speed and strength of previous vampires and kicks that up a notch. These are vicious, deadly predators. Animalistic. (Though they still wear the stereotypical 'goth' clothing: Black trench coats, black clothes, combat boots, etc.) Josh Hartnett plays Sheriff Eben Oleson of a small town near the northern spike of Alaska that experiences a full, uninterrupted month of darkness once a year.That makes it the perfect playground for an orgy of violence and carnage delivered by the most basic of evils.With a brilliant supporting cast including Mark Boone Junior, a chilling Ben Foster and beautiful Melissa George, backing the veteran silver screen star, David Slade directs a disturbing portrayal of the human instinct to survive and thrive in the desolate landscape while stalked by a tireless, terrifying death.Vampire lovers... drink your fill.I give 30 Days of Night, 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Complete waste of celluloid,"A dark period is about to start for a small village in Alaska. This isn't entirely strange as the town is located so far to the North there's a yearly recurring period of ""eternal night"". In this period most inhabitants of the town skip town because they don't want to be plagued by the long lasting darkness and the nasty effects that has on people.As the local sheriff and an accompanying officer ride around the town to do a final check up they find something odd: a pile of burned satellite telephones. As the investigation continues it turns out to be the start of something much more sinister. And so it starts. The remaining citizens of the town will soon find out that going somewhere else had been a better option. It doesn't take long before the sun goes down and the trouble starts.So far the story. Personally I love a good horror film and I love films where people get mangled for whatever reason. If there's a good streak of tension to it, all the better. If there's a bit of imaginative and new monster building to it, even better. Quite sadly, none of those are present in this film. Tension is non-available as the characters are played out so much using all the known monster film clichés out there that one can point out the next one to die about a second after the character comes into play. Imaginative monster design is out of the question too: the monsters are pretty much the same as the ones seen in many many more films. The one thing that the film does have is people getting mangled in a good way. Most of the kills are pretty vile and worked out nicely.All added together though it leaves a sad impression. A complete waste of celluloid if you ask me.3 out of 10 overused clichés",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
An excellent take on the vampire genre,"This film managed to make the vampire genre feel fresh and exciting again. Made on a mid-range budget of 30 million, every dollar ended up on screen, especially since the entire town had to be built from the ground up. CGI is kept to a minimum which works in the film's favor. The acting is good for the most part. The one exception - as per usual - is Ben Foster who always go over the top with his telenovela drama school intensity.Sure, there are some curious aspects. I've worked above the Arctic circle, and of course planes land there all year. And the perpetual night looks pretty bright in this film. But if one suspends disbelief enough to overlook these very minor points, you're in for a good ride.It's strange, I haven't seen much by the director David Slade after this movie. Judging from his impressive work on this film and the excellent Hard Candy which was released two years prior, I thought he would be a much bigger name today. I had to check IMDb to learn that he directed a Twilight movie (not my cup of tea) and some television episodes (including the Black Mirror episode ""Metalhead"" which, incidentally, is my least favorite episode in the series).I can recommend the blu-ray which has a nice collection of special features.Just don't bother with the pointless sequel released in 2010 which is amazingly bad.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

If you get stuck in between - which this movie did - you end up with a moronic subplot that has little to no action-beats.

Better than 6.6 for sure,"What I loved about the movie is its ability to give off the ""very close-knit community that is out in the middle of nowhere"" vibe. I've lived in Vegas my whole life so I always find seemingly accurate portrayals of small rural towns intriguing. That atmosphere is what really drives the terror and desperation for me. This town is already halfway cutoff from the world and is perfect prey for an onslaught of vampires. These creatures are much faster and stronger than humans, and most of the town is easily dispatched leaving only a handful of people just trying to survive. This attack comes out of nowhere and really catches the community off guard. These points are very evident throughout the movie. The vampires are brutal and terrifying. I wish there had been a little more backstory in their history honestly. I thought the acting was great with beautiful cinematography and gory effects that showed how fragile our bodies can be. It's pretty intense at times and I think if you try to put yourself in these people's shoes it can really add to the horror.

Turd,"This movie was basically a turd. Its very ""clunky"" , by that I mean it doesn't have much rhythm and flow to it.

Im not kidding- this is basically this movie in a nutshell. When the audience begins to tire of this , some gore appears on screen courtesy of some screaming (will they ever shut up)vampires , who incidentally look more like the members of an executive business meeting. Im still scratching my head as to why they were all wearing suits and evening gowns in the middle of Alaska.Maybe they got lost on their way to a boardroom meeting.It was probably supposed to look cool , but it didn't, it looked crap.

A good idea wasted,"I don't even know why i watch vampire-movies any more. The genre has become a marsh-land of mediocrity. But i guess i liked the premise of this movie. Living in the north myself i can relate to long and dark winters, and how this would actually benefit the vampire (if he or she can stand the cold that comes with it).My main problem with this movie is undoubtedly the fact that they wasted the whole premise completely. First of all they have no idea how winters in the north work. Here it's: one day there is regular sunlight, daylight for hours. The Next day it's complete blackness that goes on for thirty days. Doesn't that strike people as odd. They would have had almost no sunlight at all for a long time before it turns into complete darkness. Well, whatever. That's a minor point, even if it does make the plot a lot more nonsensical.A larger part of the problem is that they haven't done anything fun with the darkness. There is no skulking vampires, no regular town getting picked off one by one while life tries to go on. Rather this is a sudden slaughter and then humans skulking around. Without revealing too much i have to say that i would have preferred the other way around. After all the vampires come there to have a steady food supply over the winter while being able to walk around 24 hours a day. Basically that's not what happens.So, i liked the premise but not the execution. What of the other qualities of the movie? Special effects? Actors. Well, the effects are decent enough for the most part although it's nothing you haven't seen about a million times already. Vampires are pale with bad teeth, walking around wheezing and growling for no reason. The heroes are Mr goody two-shoes (Josh Hartnett) and a motley crew of not too interesting townsfolk. And of course there is the always-present ex-wife/girlfriend with a pretty face.Honestly, this movie bored me. There is a lot more finesse required for the vampire genre to do it for me. And if not finesse then maybe a sense of humor or good action scenes. What we have here is basically a long wait for something to happen. And when it finally does, it's less than exciting. I actually found myself preferring the Blade-movies to this one. At least there something happens and the vampires are menacing in an entertaining way. This is mostly just a good idea completely wasted. I rate this 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Now Here's a Vampire Movie To Sink Your Teeth Into...And Vice-Versa...,"So you say you like your vampires that are all harpsichord-playing, puffy-shirt wearing, emo-with-extra-eye-shadow and a side order of existential angst to go? If that's your cuppa blood, you might want to stay as far away from 30 DAYS OF NIGHT as you can. Here, there be monsters. These vamps are not quick with witty bon-mots, not romantic, seductive or sexy by any stretch of the imagination. They look at human beings the way we look at cattle. They're hungry. You're food. End of story.And if that were just the story, that alone would be enough. If you've seen the vampires from movies like JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRE$, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and NEAR DARK, you know the damage they can do; the havoc they can wreak.Now...imagine them doing it in a town where THERE IS NO DAYLIGHT.And that is the basic premise, just like the graphic novel it's based on, (which I hadn't read before seeing this, but I will sure read the entire series now!) In Barrow, Alaska, there is a period during the start of winter's depths, where there is no sunrise or sunset for a month. Those who can't bear the ""longest night of the year"" get the you-know-what out of Dodge, while the hardier souls stay to tough it out.Only this year, that thirty-day period is going to change the lives of the town and its inhabitants forever. A stranger is coming...and right behind him, Death follows.Video and now feature-director David Slade cut his teeth with HARD CANDY for his big- screen debut. I have not seen that film, but it comes highly recommended...with a warning. I guess it's going to be a pattern with his movies, because I am definitely making the same kind of recommendation with 30 DAYS. Lovers of anemic, bland, PG-13 rated schlock should probably stop reading here and go see the PROM NIGHT remake for the eighteenth time. Slade kicks it old-school here - kind of like a Hammer film on steroids, without the heaving cleavage and horse-and-carriage chases - and doesn't skimp on the blood and violence.It's also great that at least some time is taken for character development before the slaughtering starts. The usually ill-used Josh Hartnett shines here as Barrow's sheriff and reluctant hero Eben Olesen, a role that allows him to be much less...pretty, shall we say, than some of the romantic dramedy stuff he used to get pigeonholed into. Melissa George also made a great first impression on me as Stella, Eben's strong-willed, feisty ex, whose moxie definitely comes in handy when things get hairy...and ""FANG-EY""...And kudos must definitely go to Ben Foster (SIX FEET UNDER, X-MEN 3, HOSTAGE), for playing a character so skeevy you can almost SMELL HIM whenever he comes on-screen. Ditto to underrated actor Danny Huston, who makes one of the most wholehearted commitments to a role of pure, black-hearted evil I have seen since Anthony Hopkins went hunting for a nice Chianti to go with the fava beans. His late dad, John, would be proud.I know that most audiences these days just want their blood and guts and they want it NOW, but be patient and give this flick a chance. It does take its time getting started, but once it does, it becomes pretty clear that its R-rating was well-earned.And I have to mention that this is one of the most beautiful-looking horror films recently. The photography and art direction are unbelievable, (check out the DVD extras for the striking comparison between the movie stills and the novel's original artwork.) And the impressive visual and special effects come courtesy of the WETA Workshop in New Zealand. If you are a LORD OF THE RINGS fan, a Peter Jackson fan, or know anything about this outfit, you know that's all I need to say...It's the equivalent of having Tom Savini, Rick Baker and John Carl Buechler all working together at once.30 DAYS OF NIGHT is definitely one of the best and most terrifying two-hour periods you will ever spend in the dark...But at least, unlike a good portion of the people of Barrow, YOU will survive it...",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
disappointing,"Thinking that it was based off a successful graphic novel, i instantly thought, ""hmm, well the cinematography and art direction should be worth seeing, if not just the dialog. and it's about vampires!"" well i couldn't be more wrong. the direction of this movie (not taking into account the novel) feels like a cheesy b-horror movie script with a higher budget. and for a movie that is 30 days long, where pacing time is crucial, they fail too. where the movie begins wasting 20 minutes of our time trying to give the audience some character buildup, the remainder of the days jump with little or no explanation in between, leaving the viewer dissatisfied, UN-tense and like the characters in the movie wishing those 30 days end faster, but not because they are scared, but because the viewer is just bored. And with the time skip, as mentioned by other users on IMDb, many plot holes/inconsistencies arise. As far as horror goes, the gore level was decent, but there just wasn't enough tension or suspense that really built it up, thus if this movie wanted to redeem itself for cult value, it should have upped the graphic violence. watch it once, at home. if your a fan of the comic, my bet is you'd buy the graphic novels before you'd buy the DVD, unless you have nowhere to spend your money. the film is good for a date, where you don't need to pay attention to get the story and you can multitask before glancing at some action scenes.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best vampire films,"If you like your vampires bloody and exotic and monstrous, you will enjoy this film.

Fangtastic!,"Still waiting for someone to top this vampire tale, but no one really has, yet.The vampires are legit terrifying, the setting is unique and you get tons of vamp bang for your vamp bucks.

one of the best vampire movies in years,"Although this specific genre is not my cup of tea I really enjoyed the movie.I think it applies to both horror fans and to regular viewers as it has everything in it.From tons of blood to well written script,nice cast,and it's beautifully directed.The story is not original though as it combines the scenery from Capernter's movie ""the thing"" with the typical Vampire like movies you all know.It also reminded me a song from Judas Priest named Nightcrawler which refers to a beast that attacks a whole village and ppl hide in the cellar etc.This kind of stuff is all over the movie,as the poor human beings are huge underdogs to the bloodthirsty vampires...Maybe that's a good reason to see this especially if you dislike Hollywood-heroic-vampire hunters blockbuster movies like blade. Anyway with few words: claustrophobic,well written,highly recommended I almost forgot to write that the last scene is absolutely stunning :)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Long and cliché',"I'm not sure what I expected, but this definitely wasn't it. Filled with both visual and verbal clichés, this film dropped the ball in many areas.I do understand that most people go to see horror movies for the action (it had action) and the blood (there was plenty of that), but there should also be a story. 30 Days of Night made no attempt to engage the audience by providing sufficient backstory on the tight group of townspeople who were the center of the storyline.The movie leaps from Day 1 to Day 7 to Day 18 to Day 27, with seemingly no change in anything, yet the film seems to drag. It would have been better, cut down to about an hour and a half.On the plus side, the vampires were more rugged, physically powerful and far more agile than those in most other movies of its genre - these guys certainly were nothing like the suave Count Dracula portrayed by Bela Lugosi. Their leader spoke a foreign language (subtitled in English) that sounded more like Klingon than any earthly language.Perhaps my view of the movie was based on more than five decades of watching various horror films of all types. The younger moviegoer whose viewing is unaffected by years of other films may find it fun.The ending was touching in its way, and as has been noted before, there were some spectacular outdoor shots.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A gory and scary vampire tale.,"I thought before I saw ""30 Days of Night"", I'd just be seeing another pathetic attempt at a good vampire film. But I was pretty much wrong. I really enjoyed it in the end thanks to help from good old Sam Raimi, who was a producer. It's based off of a graphic novel series, which is also good, and revolves around a flock of vampires attacking Barrow, Alaska during its 30 days of night period. Only the sheriff(an acceptable Josh Hartnett) and his wife(Melissa George) can lead a small group of survivors to safety and hope they can survive for the month of darkness. I liked how the vampires got their own weird language and Danny Huston was a good choice as the vampire leader. The movie will also please gore fans with tons of bloody violence. But the problem is it switches between various days of the month too quickly and that adds to some annoying plot jumping. But I'd still see the film again and hopefully they'll make a sequel like in the graphic novels(they kind of set up the idea that there will be a second ""30 Days"").",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Completely underwhelming.,"Well, it wasn't a complete waste of seven bucks, but it was close. There were a few interesting ideas and some good cinematography, but apart from that the movie was pretty stale. There were plot holes you could drive a snow-plow through, wooden acting, cheesy b-grade vampires with no back story or development, (in fact, none of the characters had any development to speak of), and with one exception you could basically predict exactly who was going to live and die (and even in what order) from the very beginning of the movie. Also, it feels like there was a lot of stuff left on the cutting room floor. If you're not looking for much more than people running screaming and lots of blood being tossed around on screen then this may be right up your alley (although even then there are better movies to pick from), but all in all this film isn't really worth the time.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
No mercy. Can't wait for the next one.,"When I first heard about this movie I thought , oh, another vampire movie..ho hum, but now that I have seen it...""holy blood bath Batman!"" I found this one to have a ""no mercy"" approach and the bad guys are really really bad! These vampires are unlike any seen in the past and I guess thats what makes it so creepy. I look forward to ""30 Days of Night 2"". Maybe we will see a little more history about this breed of vampire. The setting is brilliant for this type of movie and only adds to the suspense. If you are a horror fan and you like a lot of gory detail then you will not be disappointed. The acting is well balanced and is good enough to keep your eyes peeled to the screen for the next fright scene. Effects are pretty darn cool. Great job cast and crew!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Let's just forget this (and also the idea that Josh Hartnett can act).,"If you take away the somehow scary scenery, loud music and gore sequences, what you get is a weak story filled with inconsistencies, no character development and no real sense of threat from the antagonists (so, can the ""good guys"" really die? And, more importantly, who cares if they do?).Not even the acting can be saved; lead by the appauling Josh Hartnett, who can't show sadness or grief without looking like a nervous little kid on a school play.And, of course, it ends with a ridiculously far-fetched ""twist"" (even for a vampire movie).In sum, let's just forget this movie exists in the horror-vampire genre.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wish it had stayed dark,"This is certainly the worst vampire movie I've ever seen, and - bearing in mind the obviously slick production available, and quality cast - I'd say it comes pretty close to being the worst movie I've ever seen.It totally lacks any sort of script or direction, and smacks of an attempt to cash in on the success of recent vampire shows, by someone who has presumably never seen a vampire show or movie.Leaving aside the embarrassingly economical and forced dialogue and plot, the whole thing just looks wrong. The town looks like a set, the scenes are weak, and we have a lead vamp who is the spitting image of Neil Tennant (Pet Shop Boys) - anybody who knows Neil, knows he is not the most intimidating or pants-wettingly scary person in the world.I have always thought highly of Josh Hartnett, but this performance is so bad - even allowing for the lack of suitable words for him to speak - that is barely recognizable as him.Had I been forced to act in this movie, I think I would have thrown myself at the mercy of the Tennant monster. Those actors fortunate enough to die early on, were the lucky ones. Avoid a fate worse than being sucked dry by a camp vamp - avoid this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Long Dark Cold Night!,"Highly entertaining vampire film with a great premise, there's no where to run! ""30 Days of Night"" in a way is a vampire version of ""The Thing,"" at least in it's setting, the isolated town of Barrow, Alaska, where many of the residents are packing up & leaving for the winter. A ship becomes ice locked in the Arctic Ocean & a colony of vampires converge on the towns remaining residents. What ensues is a game of cat & mouse, as the vampires feed off of one resident after another, until only a few remain.The cold bleak isolated setting definitely puts a chill to this film, & you'd actually think it was filmed in Alaska, but was filmed in New Zeeland! No matter, the setting is perfect for blood thirsty vampires feasting through the long night, 30 days of it, until the sun rises, & then the nomadic vampires move on. The vampires their selves are well done, & their Slavic Eastern European accents along with their brutal almost pack like behavior, only serves to make them more menacing, but the remaining few of the towns residents are not going to give up without a fight, & fight they do!To say much more would be giving to much of the story away. If you like ample amounts of dread, suspense, & survival of the fittest, all set in one of the most dismal places you could hope to survive, then ""30 Days of Nights"" is your sleigh ride to cold blooded horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

What a load of old b*llocks,"I have never been a major fan of horror movies and steer even further from those with a vampire theme as the fiction is repetitive and can at times overkill for the sake of blood and guts flying in to camera lenses and red mouthed faces arching back in slow motion in the moonlight after draining a body in the only other method of sucking off another person.So I wasn't looking forward to watching the questionable Josh Hartnett lead a film about the above and boy was I right to feel that way, this film is really really crap, so crap that I can picture the sound boom guys falling asleep and hitting Hartnett on the head several times, thus his complete inability to convey any emotion whatsoever, but then again maybe he got used to the flog in his hand and the dead horse before him after the first day of shooting.I feel compelled to warn you all away from this film and even Sam Raimi as executive producer seemingly asked that his credit be flashed in mini text for a nano second as the titles roll at the end.The vampires speak some form of chicken language but can also speak English and are not sure why they are doing what they are doing and Hartnett goes from being a run of the mill town sheriff to Bruce Lee within a minute, again no explanation, maybe he had the matrix? Might as well be the case as this would be just as plausible as the rest of the plot/non plot.The money spent on this detritus could have been used to build a school in Afirca which could educate hundreds and eventually produce an actor / director who could have done a decent job here, just a thought?

The clever idea of vampires taking advantage of the arctic night attracted me but I didn't expect such a good movie.This is no art-house vampire film, except for the cinematography which deserves a 10. It was well acted and very well directed. They didn't explain the vampires, or tell you that much about the humans, you found out a bit here and there as it went along. Kept it interesting.

Not at all what I expected! Very unsatisfied!,"I am seriously displeased with this movie! Although I was very much waiting to see it, ""30 days of night"" proved to be very far from what I expected. In a bad sense of the expression, that is. I will not comment whether the actors cast are suitable for their roles, I will just say that not a single one of them made me feel any sympathy or concern for his/her fate throughout. Moreover, I found almost no logic in the actions of the ""heroes"" and even less in the doings of the vampires. While watching, many times I asked myself the question ""Why did he do THAT?"" or ""Why did he go there?"" and my favorite ""When the hell did THEY get separated??"" Unfortunately, I couldn't find an answer to the questions. I also think that many other movies (""Dawn of the Dead"" for example) made quite a better job of portraying the passing time in the movie and also what happened through the time the viewers missed. Quite disappointing for me were also the ""vampire only"" scenes, in which I only saw a wasted potential for a good plot. In my opinion, the ""scary scenes"" were the biggest disappointment. I wasn't satisfied with their amount, intensity and even gore levels. What a waste! The only thing that I liked in the entire movie was its ending. And by ending, I mean only the last 3 or 4 minutes. But they were quite well done in my opinion. That's why I gave the movie a 2 in stead of a 1.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Possibly the worst vampire movie ever made,"I'm not really sure why people are giving this 7-10 stars. This is the worst vampire movie I have ever seen. The acting was awful, which was surprising because of how good Josh Hartnett's performance was in Lucky Number Slevin. It makes me think that no actor could perform well with the lines he was given in this movie. The script was really cheesy and cliché. The movie did have a couple of scary parts, but those were just the type where it gets quiet and a loud noise makes everyone jump. The vampires in this movie were clearly a rip off of the zombies in 28 days/weeks later. They weren't scary, just ugly and annoying (all they do is scream the whole time). There was one good character in this film, called the stranger, but after like 15 minutes of build up with him he never does anything. That pretty much describes the movie though. You always feel like something exciting is going to happen--something to take you away from the misery of the acting and dialogue, but it never does. I gave this 2 stars because I didn't walk out on it; probably would have and jumped to another movie if this wasn't the last showing and another movie was starting about 30 minutes later. I would not recommend even bothering with this movie, spend the money and time on something better.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
114 minutes of fantastic Vampire-Cinema,"This comic film adaptation of the Dark Horse miniseries is one of the most successful independent adaptations and a successful implementation of the material in cinematic art. Like the comic, the film works mainly through the setting and the atmosphere. Everything is rough, hypothermic and yet warm enough to empathize with you while a small town breaks into freezing cold. The characters play their roles really well, blend into the dark atmosphere of the film and become understandable characters. The story is paced very well and luckily the film works with the horror of imagining what has happened rather than splatter-like gore. Cinematography works intelligently with slow tracking shots, hard, but not too hard cuts, and with the spaciousness of the surroundings. The vampires are announced great, the arrival is terrifying and the characters who then slaughter the small town could hardly be more terrifying. Now and then you measure better conversations, or some conversations are gentle deviations from the otherwise fantastic overall effect, but in itself an underestimated and very watchable film has been made, which is vastly superior to the MCU in atmospheric matters, for example.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another terrible horror movie,"This was another in a long line of recent horror movies that are very boring, crappy, and have nothing but gore in them. A bunch of badly made up vampires terrorize a town, and high jinks ensue. I'm not going to even comment on the stupidness of the plot or characters because it has been done enough already by others panning this piece of junk. If C- grade makeup and a total absence of tension or scares sound good then this is a perfect movie. What were the actors thinking? Maybe it was a good payday. The script probably brought some chuckles when they read it and then they shrugged and said what the heck, its good money. I can't believe anyone involved with this mess could have thought this would be good at any point, and it shows big time. Even the gore wasn't anything special and that is all the movie had going for it.I'm glad I got this from netflix, but honestly its not even worth a rental.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
watching paint dry is more interesting,"I can usually find at least one good thing about even a mediocre movie that makes it worth watching. I am a huge fan of vampire movies as well.

And very random obvious things happen like a young girl walking in the open screaming for help getting murdered by the first vampire she comes across. Vampires kill... yes we know that. Where's the plot!? In addition, there is not a lot to draw an audience to the characters. They have little backgrounds to their lives and lack any admirable or even distinctive traits.
