Just great,"George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Shaobo Qin, Miguel Perez, and Livingston Dell make up ""Ocean's Eleven,"" a 2001 film directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film also stars Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts. This is a remake of the rat pack ""Ocean's Eleven,"" which I've never seen so I can't make comparisons. I suspect that this version has more emphasis on plot and the older one has more emphasis on the pack.The mastermind of a plot to rob Las Vegas' Bellaggio Hotel vault of $160 million is Danny Ocean, a very recent ex-con who had lots of time on his hands in prison to plan it. With the help of his buddy, Rusty Ryan (Pitt) he recruits 9 people who specialize in a particular expertise to carry out the elaborate heist. Problems come in when Ocean, obsessed with his ex-wife (Roberts), approaches her, to the annoyance of her present boyfriend, the owner of the hotel, Terry Benedict (Garcia). He ""makes"" Danny by sending out a bulletin with Danny's photo to the hotel staff, which puts him out of his own plot at the insistence of Rusty. But Danny isn't one to exit easily, in either marriage or robberies.This is a fast-paced, tension-filled, exciting movie that's highly entertaining. The plot is completely improbable so you have to take it for what it is - fantastic fun. And you never know whether something is going wrong or if it's part of the plan. The chemistry between the actors, particularly Clooney and Pitt, is great, and there is some wonderful acting. Clooney is solid as Ocean, a passionate man of quiet determination; Damon is terrific as an insecure participant; Don Cheadle, sporting a Cockney accent, is hilarious as an explosives expert; Elliot Gould is outrageous as their financial backer; Carl Reiner is excellent as an older con man who can do accents. Just as they all contribute their different talents to the heist, they do so in this movie. This includes the acting in the smaller roles played by Bernie Mac et al - everyone is perfect. Andy Garcia is fabulous as Benedict - both elegant and scary, he whispers instead of shouts and stays in control for the most part. Megastar Roberts is wasted - she doesn't have much to do.Any actress could have done the role, but I guess the producers wanted an all-star cast.Highly recommended for blockbuster entertainment value and star power. Just don't look for it to be realistic.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One Word: WOW,"When i first saw trailers for Oceans 11 i was amazed that they could get a cast like that into a film. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon are among Hollywood's elite and the lesser known actors such as Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, and Casey Affleck have made big impressions in other films that they appeared in. Whenever big hollywood actors are in a movie i always want to see if they're actually making a good movie or if they're just putting them together to make a profit and a bad film. Then i heard that Steven Soderbiergh was directing. By that time i was hooked because he directed one of my favorite films; Traffic. After all that time of waiting last night was the night. Opening Night with about 12 of my friends and a semi-packed theatre. After viewing the film i have to say my verdict is......WHAT A DAMN FUN, ENTERTAINING, and CLEVER FILM. Words can't describe how much i loved it. These actors weren't in it just to make a profit they were in it to make a memorable film. I don't want to give any of the plot away because it's just too good but i will tell you what i liked and some things i didn't like about the film.What I Liked:George Clooney and Brad Pitt are the embodiment of charisma. I'm a straight male but there is no denying that these guys possess a lot of style and charm. Not to mention talent. I've always enjoyed George Clooney as an actor and with each film he does he becomes an even better actor. i've always been a fan of Brad Pitt as well. He's just seems like an everyday guy in his films. Very natural and laid back. He's truly at home in this role.The supporting cast is uniformily good. To see Julia Roberts in a supporting role was odd at first but even in the few scenes she's in you can't deny that the girl has talent. Her scenes with Clooney are priceless. The dialouge in these scenes are suitably sassy and snappy. Don Cheadle and Bernie Mac making a lasting impression as well. Don Cheadle is becoming one of my favorite actors and Mac is obviously on his way with this film and his own hit TV show. Matt Damon is good in his role and his chemistry with Clooney during the last act provides us with some truly entertaining and hilarious moments. Andy Garcia makes for a truly suave villian in the film. I haven't seen him in much lately which is quite a shame because he's a wonderful actor. Scott caan and Casey Affleck are a dynamic duo. They provide some of the most hilarious moments in the film and it's because of their off-beat chemistry.Soderbergh is a wonderful filmmaker. He has an obvious love of films and this aids him in making good movies. He knows all the tricks of the trade and he uses them throughout the film. Subtle things are also down through the use of music. Images fly over a hip soundtrack that give the film an edge. This is especially certain during the final few scenes. Soderbergh is probably one of the best directors of our generation.Vegas is a pretty interesting back-drop for everything that goes on. Vegas is basically another character in the film and through Soderbergh's work on the film he gives it a life of its own.The final half of the film is outstanding. So much is going on yet the story flows at a nice pace so we know what is exactly going on.What I didn't Like:I tihnk i only disliked one thing about this film. Some of the dialouge was a bit cheesy but what film doesn't have that. My major gripe in the film was Julia's lack of screentime. She's good in the scenes that she's in but because her character isn't well developed you don't really care about her plight. If julia wasn't playing her however i don't know if any other actress could make you almost care with the screentime that she possesses.It's rare that i dislike one thing about a film. Ocean's 11 has already made it's way into my top twenty and it's most definitely the best film i've seen this year. Very nice work9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tasty cast in very cool and slick movie,"What a tasty prospect for a film: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts and for the young at heart amongst us, Joshua Jackson of 'Dawson's Creek' fame in a cameo role -all directed by the Oscar winning Steven Soderbergh!George Clooney plays Danny Ocean who soon after being released from prison, puts together a team of eleven to undertake a robbery of the three biggest casinos in Las Vegas in an attempt to bring in a reward of $150 million. What soon becomes clear is that it's not the money which will give Danny the ultimate satisfaction, but the opportunity to get revenge on the owner of the three casinos he is robbing -Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to be the new beau of Danny's ex, Tess (Julia Roberts).Some of the gang of eleven are more memorable than others -especially the Chinese acrobat, the explosives expert with a dodgy cockney accent and the medallion wearing Reuben -aka Monica Gellar's dad!  The cast are brilliant at acting cool -even if all Brad Pitt is doing is snacking on the screen (he does this a lot!), you are still transfixed by him because he looks so good on screen.What makes the story so intriguing is the fact that Danny's mission seems so impossible: security in the casinos is paramount and the route to the reward is littered with obstacles.  The number of close calls that the gang is faced with is great fun and one can't help but root for these crooks throughout the film.  It is also refreshing to watch a film which is dominated by male stars and is not filled with macho swearing.  Instead, we have a banter between the stars which is indicative of their camaraderie.'Ocean's Eleven' is a welcome option in the choice of movies available at the moment which is dominated by Oscar nominees that are not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  With this film, it's simply a case of sit back and enjoy the fun!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of my all-time favorites,"There is just something about this movie that makes it so great. There's nothing truly outstanding about any one aspect of the movie; nothing that will blow you away. However, everything is put together perfectly.Personally, I have a theory that any movie that absolutely blows you away the first time you see it, will lose its entertainment value very quickly. Not necessarily because the movie was not good, but because it just seems to get old too fast. This is NOT one of those movies.This is the kind of movie that will be enjoyed countless times. The dialogue is slick, and always to the point. There are few (if any) overdone scenes and/or lines that tend to become annoying over time.This movie flows exceptionally well. Personally, I couldn't quite figure out why until I watched the ""behind the scenes"" footage on the DVD. I didn't really notice all of the work they put into using as few shots as possible. The extra features on the DVD really explain it all. Almost every scene uses considerably less shots than you would think it takes to convey all of the activity going on. The music punctuates the flow of the movie and the shots extremely well.The cast is almost all big names. It's great to see actors like Pitt and Clooney and Damon come together in a movie and interact so well, without having to be the pretty boys or bad-ass heroes of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fluffy but lots of fun,"A rarity--a remake that's better than the original. 11 men led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) prepare to rob a vault linked to 3 casinos in Las Vegas. His partners in crime include Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Matt Damon and Scott Caan. Also, the casinos are owned by Tery Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is romancing Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Fun, engrossing, just simply the most enjoyable film of 2001. It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence. Yes, it's light; yes, it's a trifle but it's so FUN! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint--Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She's beautiful so why does she look so bad? Aside from that this is a fun movie. Just sit back and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the most Entertaining films ever!,"Ocean's Eleven is a very easy-going and purely fun movie to watch. The film is loaded with celebrities such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, and Matt Damon. Ocean's Eleven is very ""loosely"" based on the original Ocean's Eleven starring Frank Sinatra. Steven Soderbergh did a fabulous job directing this movie and having all the characters to connect to Danny Oceans group of 11. The plan is to steal 160$ million dollars from three Las Vegas Casino's. Sounds wacky? The planning time took up most of the movie, and you almost believe that it could be done after you see this. Andy Garcia did a fabulous job playing Terry Benedict, the owner of the Casino's where Ocean (Clooney) plans to rob. Brad Pitt plays and interesting role as Danny Ocean's sidekick. The plot flows quickly and some parts leave you laughing on the floor. Each one of the eleven characters had its own story behind them and it is seen when Rusty Ryan (Pitt) and Danny Ocean (Clooney) first go to recruit them to plan this heist. I have to say Julia Roberts didn't have a flexible character but nonetheless her presence in this film as Tess, Danny Ocean's ex-wife, is apparent. Ocean's 12 is due out in December with the same old cast and it promises to be a hit. This movie is one of my favorites because the premise is great and the actors are great.**** out of *****",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
They are having more fun than me,"When i first watched Ocean's Eleven my overriding thought was that these guys are having more fun than me.
Twenty years later i decided to re-watch to see if my opinion had changed at all but no , They still were having more fun than me!Dapper Danny Ocean is a man of action. Less than 24 hours into his parole from a New Jersey penitentiary, the wry, charismatic thief is already rolling out his next plan. Following three rules: Don't hurt anybody, don't steal from anyone who doesn't deserve it, and play the game like you've got nothing to lose. Danny orchestrates the most sophisticated, elaborate casino heist in history.I believe this film has a better reputation than it deserves.
Don't get me wrong , its mildly entertaining but for the most part it's very unremarkable.
The biggest problem i have is there is no jeopardy.
Terry Benedict , played by Andy Garcia is supposed to be this big time casino owner who you do not steal from but there is very little indication
that he is a menace or a gangster and the fact that they are having fun backs that up.Now to the elephant in the room. Don Cheadle.
Some people may find his accent hilarious and he may even be doing an English accent badly on purpose but think it's unforgivable. and lazy.
Surely they could afford an accent coach to at least make him sound slightly authentic.Ocean's Eleven is an example of style of over substance and the 1960's version is no different.

"O.K. so I watched a ""big"" movie . . .","At the request of my friends & family over the recent holidays I went to see this film.  Though it's not my usual M.O., I really enjoyed this movie.I've not seen the original 'Rat Pack' version of the movie (except bits and pieces), so a comparison between the two is not possible on my part.This version I found playful and relatively harmless, and the plot twists are undeniably clever.  The comradery between the actors is the most entertaining part of this film in my opinion. Elliot Gould's part had to be my favorite character if forced to pick, followed in close order by Clooney, Pitt & Damon.  Actually all of the actors did an excellent job with their roles.This movie won't change the world, or probably change your mind about anything significant, but the plot is fun, the cinematography is excellent, the actors all shine in their roles, and on occasion that is enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crackerjack caper,"I imagine that followers of the legend of the Clan would find it unforgivable
that George Clooney remade the ultimate Rat Pack film Ocean's 11. But I
think even Frank, Dean, and Sammy would be happy with what Clooney and
director Steven Soderbergh did with it. It's nothing less than a crackerjack
caper film with a few stars to gaze at also.The point in the original is that this was a film almost made as a lark for the
participants while the main players were appearing at the legendary Sands
Resort in Las Vegas. These were old army ranger buddies who decide to put their training to use and heist five casinos.Clooney and buddy Brad Pitt's film has them in the Frank and Dean roles and they're a much more professional outfit who are only doing one of them. But it's the one Andy Garcia owns and Clooney has a score to settle
with him. He's taken Clooney's wife away played here ever so briefly by
Julia Roberts. In the original Angie Dickinson had the part. And it was also
a brief part.Clooney and Pitt go out and recruit a crack team, some they know, some they don't. But it's a professional job and close run thing.Garcia is in a part the equivalent of George Raft from the original. It was 
business for Raft and business for Cesar Romero the syndicate guy he hires
to find them. But Garcia's a nasty character who settles his own accounts.The film has got a whole lot of nice touches stylistically and cast is expensive and first rate. For those familiar with the original the irony of that ending is replaced by something completely different. More in keeping
with George Clooney than Frank Sinatra.Nevertheless I think the Chairman of the Board would like this Ocean's Eleven.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not as Good as I Expected,"I'd heard good things, so maybe went in with too high expectations. It's entertaining, but nothing ground breaking.The plot of Clooney's character motivated to do the job to get back at his wife (get back with her?) I thought was cliche and dull.Overall not bad, but not great.On a sidenote, Cheadle's British accent I think is the worst attempt I've ever heard of it by any human never mind actor? So instant -1 just for that. Why not just have him be American or use an actual cockney actor if you must have that accent. So bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"You know, I don't get it.","Ocean's 11 isn't a bad movie. It's just too familiar. Caper movies are caper movies, but Ocean's 11 acts like it's covering new ground when it isn't. I caught this movie at a dollar theater and I thought: Soderbergh? Clooney? Roberts? Pitt? Garcia? Gould? Cheadle? Damon? How could I go wrong?What follows is an extremely predictable series of events that I saw coming way before I was supposed to. For example, as soon as we find out Clooney used to be married to Julia Roberts and is now seeing Andy Garcia, we can easily see what will unfold an hour and change later. The Clooney-Roberts relationship is an unconvincing, tired cliche, and it takes the whole movie to show us the predictable results.As soon as Clooney discusses his extravagant and unlikely plot, we know he's going to get away with it. And when the twist arrives, you just shrug and say ok. Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors and while he occasionally brings up the occasional vibrant scene, he can't get past what is easily one of the most predictable capers in recent times. Just about everything in the movie telegraphs its punches.I also saw Heist and The Score, but those movies had dynamic dialogue, dynamic relationships, dynamic performances and enough verisimilitude to draw you into the caper and leave you wondering what the characters were going to get away with. The dynamic in Ocean's 11 is ""Look how cool we are."" There's very little danger. You never get the sense that the characters are real people and therefore we never really care about them. The only exception being Carl Reiner's Saul.Clooney and company are fun to watch for the most part, but the story is strictly by-the-numbers entertainment with Soderbergh only occasionally pausing to inject some welcome Soderbergh-like visuals.All in all, it's not a total misfire, but it could've been trimmed and would've benefitted from an injection of humanity and originality. Highly recommended for people who haven't seen very many capers. Everyone else, don't expect the movie to blow you away.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
a pleasant souffle of a film,"Steven Soderbergh's remake of `Ocean's Eleven' is a stylish heist picture featuring some of the brightest stars in moviemaking today.  The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works.Taking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.A film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.Unlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.  It's cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?",,Anonymous,Crime
Smart Crime Thriller,"A remake of a rat pack film, this was a brave venture to take on, and thank you Steven Soderbergh for this valiant effort.Retaining a good cast, Soderbergh has modified this movie to fit with the times, and he has helped create a very slick and stylish thriller.Danny Ocean, wants to pull off the crime of the century, by ripping off three Casino's at the same time, while at the same time settling a score or two with the casino's owner.

To sum up if you haven't watched yet I'd definitely give it a go. I'm going straight into the sequels nowOnly real negative to this is that I just wasn't bothered by the romantic/love side of the plot. I could not care less if Clooney got his ex-wife back or not.

One of the Best Heist Movies Ever,"When you want to steal $160 million in cash from a huge casino in Vegas, you can either do it with force, or you can do it in a sneaky way. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang map out the casino and find a way to get down into the vault without anyone knowing what is going on until Rusty (Brad Pitt) calls the owner of the casino, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to state the terms. A large reason for the heist was that Benedict was going out with Danny's sexy ex-wife (Julia Roberts) and he wanted her back. The key to Danny and Linus (Matt Damon) getting into the vault was a device that Basher (Don Cheadle) stole, a bomb powerful enough to wipe out the power of Las Vegas.

Making the most of an average concept,"Movie goers around the world undoubtably drooled at the prospect of a movie carrying four heavyweight, A-list actors and the hottest director of the moment.  ""Ocean's Eleven"", a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack caper, contains these expensive commodities.  Directed by Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh and starring (deep breath here...) George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon, this movie was sure to make Roadshow Entertainment a bucketload of money on the premise alone.  It has done so, and while it may not be the world's most original and inspiring movie, it is a solid piece of entertainment, pleasing critics and audiences alike.Clooney is the title character, Daniel Ocean, a compulsive thief who has just been released from prison.  Upon leaving lock-up he has already devised a plan to knock off three of Las Vegas' biggest casino's, all in one night! Realsing he needs the best criminals in the business to pull off this massive heist he sets out on a sort of ""Dirty Dozen"" (minus one) round up of robbery genuises.This ensemble of characters hits and misses.  Clooney is excellent as Ocean. He is classicly stylish, very smooth and ultra-cool.  Pitt plays Dusty Ryan, a card shark and general villan with a heart of gold.  Since ""Fight Club"", Pitt has chosen solid and varied roles.  His portrayl of Dusty is spot on, you instantly like the character and admire is style and charisma. Don Cheadle is great as Basher Tarr, pulling off a decent English accent as the explosives expert.  Scott Caan and Casey Afleck play Turk and Virgil Molloy and provide the comic relief of the film.  Matt Damon has an understated role as Linus Cauldwell, the pickpocket of the group.  Perhaps most memorable of all, despite his limited screentime is Elliot Gould as Reuben Tishkoff, an outrageously over the top former casino owner. Swathed in gold and diamonds and sporting some hideously cool sunglasses, he hams his role perfectly as the jewish millionaire.Other characters are not as memorable or effective, but fulfill their roles enough to compensate for their lack of charisma.  Andy Garcia is effective as casino owner Terry Benedict.  It's great to see him back in an A-list move for the first time in a while.  Julia Roberts' role is small and more supporting that lead billing, but she plays Clooney's ex-wife to a tee.Soderbergh has a firm grip on proceedings and the film only lapses in a few instances.  The quality of camerawork and the tightness of editing is commendable and as an audience we are thankful that it is Soderbergh in control and not some MTV-style, music video director.  His contribution ensures that the film delivers on both an entertainment and artistic level.The film contains equal amounts of romance, laughs, action and dramatic tension and is enjoyable right the way along.  It may not be the best work of any of its key contributors but any film that can charm picky critics and audiences with a very small attention span is bound to be a hit.  Let's hope for more movies that can pull this difficult task off in the future.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Doesn't work,"How you can shoot a movie on location in Las Vegas and not even come close to capturing the feel of the town is beyond me, but Steven Soderbergh and company have managed to do just that. I know I'm in the minority here but this is mediocre filmmaking at best. It's badly cast with lousy dialogue and a score that doesn't fit the story. The leisurly pacing of this movie is all wrong for Las Vegas. This film is just plain bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Positive and insightful!,"Ok, so maybe the original 1960s film was just an excuse for Frank and his buddies to hang out and make some money out of it, but it was still a smash hit. Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.In the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.It is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.It is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.Ocean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.Admittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!This is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.This is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come.",,Anonymous,Crime

You'd better believe that I'm in!,"I've always had a low opinion of Frank Sinatra, so I've never seen the original version of ""Ocean's Eleven"", but the remake was pretty neat. The plot of course has ex-con Danny Ocean (George Clooney) getting eleven people to help him pull off a heist in Las Vegas. The neat factor mainly comes from their planning, which takes up most of the movie. Really cool performances from Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac, and everyone else, make this one neat movie.

The impossible heist,"It's the impossible movie heist recipe which requires a couple of big-time movie stars, one bad guy, a team, a plan which most likely isn't planned that good, quite a lot of things which should fall conveniently down to luck or chance to happen smoothly, enjoyable music, atmosphere in which the movie takes place, playing illusions with the movie characters and you to reach the final conclusion of how they pulled it off.
I remember watching this movie when I was young and I remembered quite a lot of things even watching it now. As a young kid I enjoyed this movie but watching it now I enjoyed it too but I applied logic to make sense of the heist which I shouldn't had.
Overall I think it's not an excellent and
not a bad movie. It's somewhere in the middle for casual watching but you shouldn't try to apply logic too much or you will ruin it for yourself.Would recommend to anyone who wants to see one of their favourite movie stars pull off a heist but it wouldn't be my first choice.

More glitter than gold,"You know this type of people whose broad and most sincere smile only means that they have come up with some tricky scheme to screw you over? Well, George Clooney seems to be that kind of a person. Once you see his smug face, you can definitely be sure that whatever you buy that he's selling is gonna be the truest of fake.Now add some serious cast, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts (still in her prime), a convoluted heist plot, and enough reason to dislike the bad guy - and you'll be literally waiting for our A-Team to succeed and cheering when it does. Yes, it does indeed. Did you really doubt that for a second?Ocean's Eleven, released in 2001, still belongs to that (hopefully) gone era of Hollywood cinema when easy was fun and style was enough to substitute substance. And damn, how in style this film goes! All shiny and sparkling, with enough fun little twists and moments of humor, with Clooney and Pitt exchanging impeccable smiles and snappy one-liners, with a sleek kingpin of an antagonist and his dumb nitwit minions - and of course with the charm of Las Vegas and its vibe of easy money and endless entertainment - Ocean's Eleven makes you feel like a spectator at a very expensive and exclusive show.But that era is over, and even the general audience is into trying to dig a film's surface, not necessarily deep but enough to expect a second layer to show itself. And that sort of thing Ocean's Eleven is kinda short of. The big talent is wasted on walking around, looking perfect and sounding confident, while the only character carrying at least some emotional charge is the usual suspect of a good person's ex-wife and a bad person's current love interest. So we can only thank Julia Roberts for being a good actress enough to make those small things count and show a variety of emotions on her face. Because it seems that the rest of the stellar cast only took a single facial expression with them on stage.It is said that a casino is built like a labyrinth to keep visitors in. Huge, loud and blinking, but still a labyrinth. And so does this film, like a race through a maze, try to keep you thinking of anything but its essence. The truth is, the real essence of this movie is not Mr Clooney's smile or the wads of cash he and his friends try to steal. It's that fir-shaped car air freshener that is shown to us for long enough to suspect some bizarre case of product placement. A screamingly strong-smelling piece of unidentified material that doesn't really make the air enjoyable for breathing but instead is only suitable for distracting you from realizing how stale and stuffy it is. Well, you could of course let yourself be fooled for the whole ride, but it's much healthier not to take it at all in the first place.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A star-studded and entertaining heist film.,"While I usually agree with people who say that remakes are worse than the originals, Ocean's Eleven (2001) is an exception. Not only did it bring the same amount of star power that made the original stand out, but it had a heist that was much more entertaining and compelling than its predecessor. Having re-watched it recently, I found it still stands up over 20 years later, even if it's starting to show its early-2000 edges. I still think it's a classic that works because of its complexity and scale.It's impressive how there are so many big names in this movie, yet they all have their room to shine. There's a reason many of them are still making great movies today, and their talent is on full display here. And perhaps the collective charisma of this all-star cast makes the heist they pull off so thrilling. Sure, I already knew how they were going to do it, but I still noticed details I hadn't picked up on in all my previous viewings. The stakes were definitely higher than the 1960 version, that's for sure.For all the ""cool"" and ""suave"" mannerisms and dialogue, I can see how it would appeal to a younger version of myself. Even if Danny (George Clooney) wanted to show Tess (Julia Roberts) the true nature of her new love (Andy Garcia), he did it in a way that feels more arrogant than I remembered-and the scene where he interrupts their dinner proves my point, I think. The high-contrast and saturated look of this film feels like it fits stylistically with the early-2000s-which unfortunately hasn't gotten much better since then. Overall, though, Ocean's Eleven is a fun remake that was strong enough to merit two sequels.A star-studded and entertaining heist film, I give Ocean's Eleven 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Self-congratulating and preening crime thriller that is more style than substance,"An old-time con gets out of the can and comes up a grand master plan to rob a casino strongbox. But is it business or is it personal?Movie makers are so short of ideas that they are prepared to remake movies that weren't very good in the first place? Having said that, this product belongs in the ""Star Is Born"" mould of film: A frame to put your star product rather than anything special or unique by itself.All star cast? Well about six people here could be considered stars (Andy Garcia we will count as a falling star, Elliot Gould as well and truly fallen!) and even most of these look like overpaid extras. Matt Damon needs to be looking for more substantial roles than this - he is getting a bit old to be the wide-eyed tea-boy. I think Brad Pitt has a good set of washboard abs and a nice face, but has he ever convinced you that he is good at anything other than bench presses? Master thief - don't make me laugh. Julia Roberts isn't much more than a muse but does well enough with her well paid bit-part. Very dignified.George Clooney has been lucky in life. Nice TV face that has been given a chance with movies because there isn't really anybody else coming along. While mediocre in mediocre material he is quite good with this type of light and throwaway material - understated and cool. That guy should market antiperspirant.We shouldn't go in to how they plan to turn over the casino given this is so much of the movie. However I am sure the casino security people wiped tears of laughter from their eyes watching things unfold.The security they have is unbreakable and criminals don't rob big vaults anymore - when was the last big robbery of this type? Besides they would simply kidnap someone important even if they were mad enough to give it a go. Sorry film makers - if you want to focus on crim's then small timers and drugs dealers are all you are left with.All faults to one side, this is quite an acceptable  little package, but there is something missing at the heart of it. Namely tension. I couldn't really care less if they got caught or not and frankly without this bank robberies become men-at-work movies.Good to see that while very few people have seen the (excellent) British comedy-drama Two Way Stretch (with Peter Sellers) the authors of this piece clearly have! It would be interesting to show the two films back-to-back to an audience and see which they preferred. I would bet on the low budget Brit-pic myself.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Slick, Smooth All-Star Cast Never Seems to Risk Failure","George Clooney, Brad Pitt and dozens of their elite Hollywood buddies get together to remake and rejuvenate this rat pack classic from forty years prior. The end result is a slick, mildly overproduced adventure that's smart and suave, though not quite so much as it seems to think it is. Much of the movie is blown on excessive, ""look what we can afford to do"" antics that are, admittedly, fun to watch but ultimately do little to endear the cast to their audience. Rather than a case of pillaging the rich to fill the coffers of the poor and desperate, this first installment of the Ocean's franchise feels more like a case of the filthy rich reaching into the cookie jars of the filthier. The heist genre loses a bit of its inherent suspense when a film's protagonists have access to a garage full of police paraphernalia, server racks spilling over with imaginary ""future tech"" computer equipment, Italian sports cars, cushy upper deck hotel rooms and access to all the blueprints they'll ever need. Clooney's charisma does buy him a degree of invulnerability to this phenomenon, which makes him an ideal centerpiece, but after the first viewing most of the team's close calls seem far too easily resolved. With these resources, Beavis & Butt-Head could have a pretty good shot at making off with a casino's millions. Good for a few action spots, at least.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Thou Shalt Steal,"In recent years George Clooney has produced or directed a number of films such as ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" or ""The Men who Stare at Goats"", most of which reflect his left-liberal political convictions. These convictions are not, however, always so well reflected in his choice of films as an actor. Witness, for example, the macho action-thriller ""The Peacemaker"". Or, for that matter, ""Ocean's Eleven"", a caper film which- like all caper films- preaches the message that ""Greed is Good"" and which- like an increasing number of modern examples of the genre- adds a further message to the effect that ""Crime does Pay"".Here Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a career criminal who comes up with a plan to rob a vast sum of money the vaults of three Las Vegas casinos, the Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. Now the man in the street might think this scheme to be a thoroughly dishonest one, but for the purposes of the film we are expected to regard it as a highly laudable enterprise because the owner of the three casinos, Terry Benedict, is portrayed as an unpleasant, thuggish gangster. Benedict is also the current lover of Danny's ex-wife, Tess, so under the moral code which governs caper movies Danny has two quite legitimate reasons to steal from him with a clear conscience.Now the Las Vegas gambling scene may have been under the control of the Mob back in the days of Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, but I always understood that these days the Nevada Gaming Commission are keen to keep it squeaky-clean and to exclude anyone with criminal connections from having anything to do with running the casinos. It therefore seemed odd that the film-makers could, without falling foul of the laws of libel, imply that three major casinos (all of which are real institutions) are owned and run by an obviously crooked individual like Benedict. It seemed even odder that the real owners of the Bellagio welcomed the film and allowed the team to shoot on location. It seems that in some businesses any publicity is good publicity.I won't go into details of Danny's scheme to relieve Benedict of some of his ill-gotten wealth, except to say it is extremely complicated in order to overcome the casinos' elaborate security precautions. (You probably have to watch the film several times to understand it fully). Suffice it to say that it is so complicated that Danny needs to recruit no fewer than ten former colleagues and other criminals, each with his own special skills, in order to pull it off- hence the title of the film. To British eyes the title ""Ocean's Eleven"" would appear to have sporting overtones, as both soccer and cricket are played between teams of eleven men, but as both sports are much less popular in America than they are here these overtones were presumably unintended.Given such a large cast, it is not surprising that there is no serious attempt made at characterisation and hence no really outstanding acting performances. Although the film was made with an ensemble cast, however, the film-makers managed to attract a surprisingly large number of big-name stars, including not only those two great male sex-symbols Gorgeous George and Beau Brad but also the likes of Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould, Andy Garcia and Don Cheadle.""Ocean's Eleven"" is a slick, glossy piece of popular entertainment- a sort of superior popcorn movie; I enjoyed it more than the rather dull sequel ""Ocean's Twelve"". (I must admit that I have not seen either ""Ocean's Thirteen"", the third episode in the franchise, or the original Rat Pack ""Ocean's Eleven"" from 1960). My main concern about it is its apparent rewriting of the Ten Commandments so that the eighth now reads ""Thou Shalt Steal"". It is by no means unique in that respect among modern films, but at least the likes of ""Entrapment"" were honest about their own dishonesty. ""Ocean's Eleven"" seems to be going out of its way to justify theft and robbery provided that the owner of the stolen property is sufficiently unpleasant to make him a legitimate target. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A little predictable, but entertaining fare anyway, from Oscar winner Soderbergh","Steven Soderbergh, a really good director who (deservedly) won for Traffic, comes back with a type of film sort of remenicent of Out of Sight (mainly in style and humor which is low key but cool) but also a remake of the 1960 caper film with Frank Sinatra.  Here, Clooney plays a recently released inmate who schemes with Pitt to gather up a crew total of 11 (it might seem more, I lost count) to rob three casinos in Las Vegas all owned by Garcia. It goes through the motions almost too easily, yet this movie shouldn't be taken totally seriously as how Soderbergh most likely intended.

"A star studded cast with a story that couldn't miss, the perfect recipe","Granted, there is some bias to this review as I absolutely LOVE heist films as well as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Bernie Mac (may he rest In peace).This is a star studded cast executing an absolutely brilliant story, simple as that. The plot twist on top of what is already a great heist premise pushed this film into the upper echelons and it has aged amazingly. The only negative to this film is maybe the worst accent I've ever witnessed in a film which was Don Cheadle's British accent. There was zero rhyme or reason for it too as there is no explanation for him being British, but it's almost so bad that it's intentionally bad which makes it oddly kinda funny in the overarching scheme of the film. On top of the wonderful heist ensemble crew led by the ever brilliant George Clooney and Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts as Tess Ocean and Andy Garcia as the ""villain"" Terry Benedict do a great job as well. Andy Garcia is so great as the ever confident, vigilant, and almost slimy Terry Benedict that you can't help but feel yourself rooting against him, but you don't hate him. And Julia Roberts does a great job as the idealized moral compass of the film, giving a different perspective on everything as the innocent bystander caught in between.To round it out, it's simply a movie whose only flaw is an accent so bad it's almost fun.

"""Hungry Baker's Dozen""","Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.As far as heist movies go, it's excellent, but I think I'm very picky when it comes to heist movies. In order to get me behind the criminal protagonist, it needs to be overly complex, but not complicated, and there needs to be an alternative motive, such as ""get the girl"".This entire franchise does a decent job of this, keeping the motives and implementations interesting. Part of the problem with that is that because of how complex the heist is, have the movie is an explanation of how the heist is going to happen (with JUST enough information left out for misdirects), then there is the actual heist, with some misdirects, and an explanation of the gaps, if not the heist itself, then a resolution.That's the formula for every heist movie ever, which is part of what makes it boring. It has to be special to really grab a audience and make it memorable.This movie does all this with a great cast, and certainly enough production value.

I also enjoyed the romance between George Clooney and Julia Roberts that does help play a huge part of the end of the movie. Then, you have Andy Garcia is the villain and I like that he isn't the typical mustache twirling kind of bad guy, he's just a normal dude who runs a casino and will protect his money at all cost. The movie has an insanely fat paced to it woth its near 2-hour runtime to where it manages to keep your eyes glued to the screen while also not skipping on any details. The big heist at the casino is one of my favorite movie heists I've seen in a very long time. And finally, this is just a fun popcorn entertainment movie that you can have a lot of fun with from beginning to end.Overall, Ocean's Eleven (2001) is my favorite movie by Steven Soderbergh and it's going to take one hell of a movie to dethrone it as my favorite from this man's legendary filmography.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Swagger In Sin City,"This remake pays homage to the Rat Pack's original heist film of 1960, and exceeds it. Director Soderbergh pays tribute by using a cast with similar swagger and seemingly similar camaraderie. It all begins with George Clooney, who portrays the titular Danny Ocean with a coolness and confidence required for the man who would take on the greatest of heists.The script follows the requisite formula for all cinema heists: devise an impeccable plan, assemble an infallible team, rehearse until the timing is perfect, them execute. Of course, the execution is where planning meets reality. There will always be unforeseen exigencies. And that is why the final needed ingredient is Luck.This is a glossy production, as one would expect in Las Vegas. Soderbergh's Frat Pack is a classy crew, including Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, and Don Cheadle. Soderbergh gets extra credit for casting Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner, who shine like diamonds on a walking stick.The script is excellent. Even as the plan is explained to us, viewers are kept guessing as to the final twists. And when Danny Ocean is sidelined from part of the plan's execution, there are deeper games at play.Special mention to Andy Garcia, who plays the casino owner with just the right amounts of arrogance and hubris.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Why bother remaking this film?,"As it was, the original Oceans 11, wasn't a masterpiece of filmmaking!Whatever was in Mr. Soderberg's mind in taking this project, is beyond comprehension. The plot is ridiculous, to put it mildly. It is very convoluted and just to think this gang could carry it off just goes to show us the arrogance not only of the director, but the whole production company involved with this mess. Are we the only ones to think that Brad Pitt is a bad actor? He just doesn't register an emotion in this film, at all! What about that other over-rated star, turned producer, actor, screenwriter, Matt Damon? He is just beyond help. These 2 actors could improve a lot by taking serious acting classes before they even venture out again. Their characters are phoneys, as they're portrayed by these 2 on screen. The only one that shines in this film is George Clooney. He is an actor with a terrific screen presence and a natural, in comparison with the rest of the others. His scenes with Julia Roberts show a rare chemistry and we believe in their past and present involvement. The rest of the cast is just blah. Why doesn't Hollywood use writers and directors who can give us original stories with plots that can be believed instead of remaking films that had their moment and don't merit a remake in any way, shape, or form.

Ocean's Eleven,"As remakes go - I think we will struggle to find one that is better than this across any genre. It's not just that the cast is full of A-listers, it is that Steven Soderbergh has invested just as much time with his story and with the characterisations as he has with the visuals, the gadgets and, of course, just about everyone from Brad Pitt and George Clooney to Julia Roberts and Matt Damon. The premiss being that Clooney ""Danny"" assembles a group of skilled operators with a view to relieving casino owner ""Benedict"" (Andy Garcia) of a great deal of money. Their planning must be meticulous - each having their set tasks that they must deliver precisely to support the overall - dangerous - plan. All looks to be going along well until the boys discover that Julia Roberts (""Tess"") - the ex-wife of their leader - is now dating their mark. Could that compromise their entire operation? The action builds well, here - the contributions from each - especially, for me anyway, Carl Reiner as the curmudgeonly ""Saul"" and Shaobo Qin as the lithe and supple gymnast ""Yen"" - who reminded me somewhat of Burt Lancaster's equally acrobatic buddy Nick Cravat - are charismatic, enjoyable and impressively they all gel quite well too. The ending is a masterstroke, and there is a suitably fitting ""Clair de Lune"" to sign it all off. Good entertainment all round.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A classy guilty pleasure,"Worthy remake of the famous rat pack caper found a whole new pack taking over from Sinatra and the boys with Steven Soderbergh at the helm. Oceans Eleven is a glitzy, snazzy, and most importantly, fun recreation of the classic bank robbery film. The production value alone keeps everything shimmering along quite nicely, but it is the first rate cast, directed through Soderbergh's experienced lens that takes the infectiously entertaining piece over the top.In less skilled hands the film still would have been a fun, if unnecessary comedy caper diversion, but with this cast and crew becomes one of the most easily digestible and classy pieces of adult fluff entertainment to emerge post-millennium. Sure, the smug ensemble cast tends to wear a little thin after a while, but they are directed in such an entertainingly concise way that their indulgences become our own. Whatever doubt one may cast in the face of so many Hollywood A-listers gathered together to competitively mug the camera becomes cast aside after realizing how smooth the direction really is.Deceptively elegant, the Las Vegas cinematography compliments Soderbergh's smooth transitions perfectly. For all the late-game revelations that joyously unfold as the robbery occurs, the director really got to shine leading up to that elaborate heist. It is in the seductive filming of this outlandish proposal that elevates the crime comedy to a level of class film of this caliber rarely achieves present day.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The characters have some nice moments, George Clooney (Daniel Ocean) and Brad Pitt (Rusty) have good chemistry here, and their interactions are well done.

I really was expecting to enjoy the movie.However, I found it mind-crushingly dull. The film really drags, and I found the whole thing entirely prosaic. Whilst production was slick (as is to be expected) it felt formulaic and sanitised, as did the plot.It was so boring, the ingredients for a good film were there, but the plot just trudged along towards its inevitable conclusion, I never engaged with any of the characters, and ultimately Ocean's 11 seems like the kind of film a computer would make given a stack of statistical data on what joe average likes to see at the movies.I really like action films too, but as far as I am concerned this doesn't even count.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

"I got two words for you, mini-bar.","Literally fresh out of prison, Danny Ocean is busy setting up a seemingly impossible robbery. The plan, along with ten other experts he has roped in, is to rob the main vault at Las Vegas that houses the takings from the three main casinos.The original Ocean's 11 released in 1960 is an OK film, more watchable for the Vegas setting and the irrepressible cast of Rat Packers than for any purpose or structure. That this Steven Soderbergh remake trumps the original in every department is a triumph of entertainment values over pure star appeal. Some would put a case up for the cast of Soderberg's film using stars to entice the audience in? But really at the time of release it was a stretch to put George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon (all excellent here) on the same pedal stool as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin.The most striking thing about this remake is that the whole cast seem to be enjoying themselves, mainly because they are not being asked to over exert their performances from their very astute director, they really are just asked to turn up, enjoy each other's company and deliver one of the coolest pictures to have been made in the decade.The film is purely out there to entertain, it has geniality pouring out from every frame, this is a character based heist caper full of laughs and derring do shenanigans - even Don Cheadle's ill advised (and pointless character arc) cockney accent manages to create smiles instead of being an on going hindrance. Some critics said the film is far too shallow to have any real worth! What the hell do they want? So the crooks are nice guys, it's a refreshing change to see a Vegas sparkling bright without any seedy undercurrents, where these robbers aren't using AK 47s to obliterate the opposition, it's wits and dashes of cool that fills out their respective armouries.The soundtrack and scoring are themselves cool characters in the piece, whilst a big shout out goes to the bona fide stunt work from the wonderfully elastic Shaobo Qin - which merely puts another cherry on this already delightful cake. All the cast (too many to mention) are great, from Andy Garcia's suave and mean boss, Terry Benedict, to Julia Roberts' (walking like a goddess) Tess Ocean, all things in the film deliver a feel good movie that when all put together, and all things considered, is a film made by lovers of the medium for, well yes, lovers of the medium itself! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Flipping the switch on Sin City,"Sharp, canny, dashing remake of the Frank Sinatra Rat Packer from 1960 about the ultimate Las Vegas heist. Master thief George Clooney and pal Brad Pitt enlist a disparate group of con-artists to rob billionaire casino owner Andy Garcia of his millions in his highly-guarded vault--and, just for good measure, his girl too. Wonderfully fast and hip, with a sleek direction by Steven Soderbergh (who never stops teasing the audience) and a glittering array of stars and character actors, all of whom get a good slice of the pie. Of course, the byzantine (and expensive) plot these guys concoct could never be duplicated in reality--and that outlandishness does spoil some of the fun. Still, the cartoony way this motley crew takes over the Bellagio, with Soderbergh's camera zipping around the action like a fox, provides high entertainment the whole way through. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Slick with stellar performances,"I haven't seen the 1960 film for a while, and plan to re watch it shortly. But I will say I did enjoy very much this film. True, there are a lot of characters so sometimes the film feels shallow, and sometimes the pacing is a tad too pedestrian. But there are a number of things that made it a slick and well done film. First, the direction was excellent. Steven Soderbergh is a talented director, and he direction is super efficient. The plot is good, about Danny Ocean and his ten accomplices planning to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously. The soundtrack is cool, the cinematography is professional and the script is witty. But it is the stellar performances that make the film. George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould and Bernie Mac all give fun performances, elevating what could've been a predictable and unoriginal film into a quite enjoyable one. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Great Heist Film,"While we are in lockdown I thought I would try and watch some older franchises and the next one I have chosen is the Ocean's franchise starting with Ocean's Eleven, now this film is a remake but I thought it was the appropriate one to start with and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of 11 con artists attempt to rob the three most lucrative casinos in Las Vegas on a fight night.Main Character
George Clooney plays Danny Ocean in the film and he does a great job, he fills the charming and charismatic lead very well and I thought he was a natural fit to be the lead in this group and his character has the biggest arc in the film and the most motivation for completing this heist and his chemistry with Pitt is a real highlight for the film for sure. Brad Pitt plays his no1 ally and as mentioned above they have great chemistry together and it is pretty clear that Pitt is the coolest character in this film which is full of cool characters for sure.Supporting Characters
This film has one of the most star studded casts of all time so it is time to talk to about the great cast. Matt Damon plays another member of the crew and he is a great addition to the cast. He and Clooney have a bit of a rivalry but it works for the story and both of the characters are fleshed out by it. Andy Garcia plays the bad guy in the film and he does a great job, he is chilling and very swauve, you believe in him as the villain and to be honest you wonder what exactly he did wrong to deserve this robbery being planned against him. Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck and Elliot Gould are also really entertaining parts of the crew and have their own really great moments. The one person who doesn't get much to work with is Julia Roberts, she is written pretty poorly and I will talk about it more in the story why I think it is.Story
The story does a great job in making you root for this gang of criminals because they are so likeable, the introductions give each character a personality which helps flesh them out. Also I love watching a heist being planned and seeing the creative things they come up with. However, the love story for me jut doesn't work, you can tell this film came out a while ago as Roberts is written basically as an object and a plot device which is pretty ineffective.Script
The script for this film is great, the humour really works and helps make the crew so fun and likeable, the interactions allows the film to flow and keep you interested as they plan. Though as mentioned above the dramatic dialogue doesn't quite work for me as most of it is involved with the love triangle and that just didn't work for me.Style
The style of this film is so cool, this is presented as one of the most cool films ever made in terms of its style. Seeing a heist being planned and executed at Vegas which this crew really works and adds to the spectacle. The mix between suspense and coolness flows fantastically and makes this a better film to watch.Overall
Overall, this is one of the better heist films ever made, it is a great time with a large well known cast and a very suspenseful conclusion.Rating - 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Awful,"This is a really bad film. First of all, there is the acting. Most of it was rather dull, with the exceptions of Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, and  Andy Garcia. Even Matt Damon--one of my favorite modern actors--gave a dull performance. Clooney was the worst, as the arrogant thief who sets out to prove that it's okay to steal $160 million dollars, as long as its because some respectable businessman who works for his money dates your ex-wife while you are in jail. That is pretty much the theme to this film. Then there is the dialogue. It's just plain terrible (with a few good one-liners here and there, I must admit). Probably the worst dialogue comes at the very end (in Rusty's car). By far the worst scene was near the end, when the robbers are standing near the fountain, it was bad stuff. This film does not even compare to the original. Frank Sinatra is much, much more of an actor than Clooney is, and he's not conceited. The original was better, and the premise was better. I liked a group of army buddies with nothing to lose better than some guy trying to 'screw the guy thats screwing his wife' with a bunch of people he had never before met.

However, the story that was told was boring, and it was no more than a bunch of actors developing their characters very poorly. I was especially surprised by Julia Roberts performance, her character was especially poorly developed. Her performance was shallow, and there was a lack of history and future with her character.

Hits the jackpot!,"By C.J. CauleyThe city of Newport, Kentucky played host to the very first theater screening of the 2001 version of Ocean's Eleven.  While Frank Sinatra starred in the film's predecessor in 1960, Kentucky native, George Clooney, takes the helm this time around.  The premiere was a red carpet event with Johnny Bench, Marty Brennaman and other local Cincinnati celebrities basking in the limelight.  The highlight of the event was the hosts, George's parents, Nick and Nina Clooney.  Nick Clooney is one of the most recognizable celebrities in Cincinnati, having been a newscaster there for many years and currently hosting his own radio show.  Nina quipped ""I used to be known as Nick Clooney's wife, now I'm known as George Clooney's mom."" Not a bad gig if you can get it.  The couple were absolutely beaming about their son's latest premiere and I soon found out it was with good reason.When his elders stepped out of the theater to prepare for their trip to Los Angeles for the official premiere, the younger Clooney stepped on screen as Danny Ocean.  Recently paroled after four years in prison, Ocean sets out to gather up some old partners in crime to pull off the perfect heist: rob a vault that contains over $160 million from three different casinos. Hustlers, con men and pickpockets come together with experts in surveillance, electronics and explosives.  At the center of the conspiracy are Ocean and his best friend, Dusty Ryan, played by Brad Pitt.  All together, they add up to eleven which was about six too many.  When you have that many people in that short amount of time you don't really get a chance to know them or care about them which is unfortunate because they are quite the group of misfits.  The criminals included everyone from relative newcomers Casey Affleck and Scott Caan to phenomenal talent like Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and the legendary Carl Reiner.Andy Garcia plays Harry Benedict, also known as the bad guy.  One of the richest men in Las Vegas, he owns the three casinos in question.  To top it all off, he is dating Ocean's ex-wife, Tess, played by Julia Roberts. Clooney is out to win her back and put Benedict in his place in the process. Roberts was believable as Clooney's love interest but he was not believable as hers.  While she made goo-goo eyes at him, he stared at her more like a little sister.  It was the only part of Clooney's performance that I didn't buy.  Garcia, however, played the fuming, jealous lover to a tee.  The resident pickpocket, Linus Caldwell, played by Damon, was the newest and seemingly untrusted member of the group.  This was touched on only briefly, however, because the two hour time limit was not enough to expound on this part of the story.   I also found it odd that 37-year-old Pitt referred to 31-year-old Damon as the ""kid.""  The real kids were the Malloy twins played by Affleck and Caan.  While they also offered some comedy relief, it was the cast's two older entries who turned out to be it's best.  Elliot Gould shines as the financial backer of this band of would-be thieves and Carl Reiner is fantastic as the Saul Bloom, the grandfather of the group.Pitt gave his usual two-dimensional performance but the chemistry he had with Clooney made up for a lot of that.  They played off each other with excellent comedic timing.  Clooney gave an excellent performance even though it wasn't much of a stretch from previous roles like that in the Peacemaker or Out of Sight.  There will be no Oscar nominations for acting in the future for Ocean's Eleven but the large ensemble cast will not leave you disappointed.  Their quick quips amuse throughout.  One scene between Damon and Bernie Mac and another with cameos by TV heartthrobs including Joshua Jackson and Topher Grace are highlights of the flick.  Unfortunately, Roberts is the only female in the cast, aside from a cameo by Holly Marie Combs as herself.  But, it was great to see that the current Ocean's Eleven is lacking the disgusting misogynist tone set by Sinatra and his rat pack friends in the 60s version.  Back then the women were 'dames,' they were an annoyance and worst of all, pushovers.  No such ridiculous stereotypes rear their ugly heads in this pleasantly updated version.  Despite the time restraints that restricted the storyline, Ocean's Eleven really hits the jackpot.",,Anonymous,Crime
Stylish and highly entertaining,"Ocean's Eleven (2001) is one of the more stylish and most elegantly filmed movies from its time. This film may well be the best of the franchise, in terms of overall plot, style, substance, and entertaining factor. Although Ocean's Thirteen is quite well made. All the actors play their roles well, lead by George Clooney as the title character, as well as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia. The pacing of the film is solid as everything appears to be there, and with a large cast, we are to see them all perform. Director Steven Soderbergh seemed to have fun making this movie. He shot this film very intimately often allowing the camera to stay close on the actors a tad longer than expected which lets their personas shine through their personalities draw you into the movie as much as the caper itself. It's not often you see a movie where the direction has as much wit and cleverness as the plot itself. All together, Ocean's Eleven makes no pretense to be something other than a clever heist movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Classic Heist Movie,"Finally got around to watching this, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It took a while to get going, but when it did , I was hooked. I enjoyed the film's many twists and smart writing. I had forgotten about things that were set up early on that ended up paying off later. There were several moments where I found myself going ""Oh no. How are they going to get out of this one?"" Much like the vault the main characters try to rob in the film, it had many twists and turns. It was just an all-around good old fashioned heist movie though a bit dated. You can definitely tell by the pop culture references, lighting, fashion/hairstyles, and cinematography that this was made in 2001. But maybe it was cool at the time. I don't know. The banter between the main characters is witty. I'm excited to see what happens in the sequels and the reboot/sequel opening this week.

Tasty Treat That Leaves You Hungry,"After having seen this movie more than eight times (not by choice), I've come to realize that the original lukewarm reviews I read were correct: this film is not much better than mediocre. That's not to say that the film is terribleit's notor that you shouldn't watch ityou shouldbut rather that it has many flaws, some of them glaring.Ask most people why they saw the movie, and they'll say something like ""It has George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it,"" or ""It has Julia Roberts in it,"" or ""Stephen Soderbergh directed it."" Ocean's Eleven is a ""People"" magazine reader's dream come true. So many celebrities in one movie: what bliss! The point is that Ocean's Eleven is not meant to be strong on character or plot; it's meant to be strong on Star Power. In fact, it's surprising that there is a plot, such as it is. It follows the new Blockbuster code: Hot Bad Guys who are actually Good Guys want to steal money from crooked, mean Big Businessman; they make elaborate plans, use fancy equipment, and ultimatelybut we all know the ending. Soderbergh may court the strange, the offbeat, the underbelly of society, but he also knows that when making an action movie one should not deviate too much from the tried-and-true. He gives us what we want, and more.George Clooney and Brad Pitt as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively, are the most likable of the bunch. They have a rapport that either is natural, or was rehearsed so effectively and so well that it became natural. They're like Laurel and Hardy, only with stubble and expensive suits. They eat each other's lines, insult each other, show off in front of each otherin some ways they're a more compelling couple than Clooney and Roberts.Incidentally, Julia Roberts, apparently confusing Tess Ocean with Erin Brockovich, gives an intensity to her role of The Chick that is entirely inappropriate. This is an action movie, not a chance to win another Oscar. She delivers lines like she's chopping onions: short, quick, and full of force. Of course, her dramatic skill is unquestionable, but in this case a lighter touch would have been more fitting. I can understand her desire, if she had it, of wanting to give more weight to her role as Clooney's ex-wife and Andy Garcia's new girlfriend; it must be frustrating to be a piece of meat that men fight over. But she should have been more perceptive of the movie's genre and its requirements. In action movies, chicks should look hot and be tough; not much more is (usually) required.The fact is, we hardly ever think of Roberts, or any of the other Big Names, as anything but who they are off the set. Although Garcia calls Roberts ""Tess"" several times, somehow the name always rings false. The other cast members, being less famous, have the advantage of being able to play their characters more convincingly.This movie was a remake of another all-star movie made in 1960. (I've been unable to see more than snippets, and since I currently live out of the US I'm not able to rent it.) Most reviews refer to this previously made film, but the fact is that Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven is its own entity. We should judge it not based on its predecessor, but on its own meritsunfortunately too few.When I first saw this movie, it was dubbed in Spanish, and I thought it was well made, well acted, and generally better than most action movies. (Of course, I was on a date at the time, so I wasn't scrutinizing every detail.) Upon subsequent viewing, however, this movie's imperfections only become more glaring. It's too bad. Although you won't think you've wasted two hours if you watch it for the first time, this movie is not one that you'll return to over and over againthat kind of film where each time you see it you discover more of the director's ingenuity, or the actors' skill, or the screenwriter's craft. This movie is good for a quick laugh and a thrill, but, like cake, it's not ultimately what will satisfy your hunger.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Presented in a totally different guise from the 1960 classic, the film overflows charisma on the part of its cast, which makes many consider it better than the original film","One of the most revered films of the 60s, Ocean's Eleven (1960) was an epoch, mainly due to the team of stars it managed to gather. In the direction, Lewis Milestone (1895-1980), consecrated with the classic ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", of 1930. In the cast, the members of the group Rat Pack, the friends Frank Sinatra (1915-1998), Dean Martin (1917- 1995) and Sammy Davis Jr. (1925-1990), simply the greatest stars of the time. And even though the work is not so widely accepted by the public and critics, it is still essential for the subgenre of assault films.For a new version, it would be complicated to assemble a team of stars like that - without making production unfeasible in the face of millionaire fees. For the heartthrob George Clooney had a crazy idea, worthy of Daniel Ocean, the leading character of the gang of gangsters. Partner of director Steven Soderbergh at producer Section Eight, Clooney joined the project with an innovative solution. He would give up his millionaire salary and convince other big stars to do the same, to act for a symbolic amount. Thus, Ocean's Eleven, the 2001 adaptation, was born victorious. In the direction, the label Soderbergh, a great Oscar 2001 champion with Traffic and Erin Brockovich, would guarantee the quality and repercussion of the film. When it came to casting, Clooney's plan was already starting to work. Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle and Julia Roberts complete the list.In the plot, Ocean's Eleven, led by Ocean (Clooney, of course), plan to loot the three largest casinos in Las Vegas in a single night. Supported by eccentric businessman Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand have the most complete and complex security system in the world. Only a team of specialists could carry out the theft. Well then. Rusty Ryan (Pitt) abandons ""poker lessons for promising Hollywood stars"" in order to help friend Daniel Ocean. Thief Linus Caldwell (Damon) also joins the team. Basher Tarr (Cheadle), an explosives expert, adds to the list, which still has two drivers brothers, a gambling entrepreneur, a master of disguises, a hacker, a fake dealer and even a Chinese acrobat.Steven Soderbergh, who had won recognition with Traffic (2000), establishes an interesting visual identity for his work, opting for different angles and camera movements that bring a special charm to the narrative. The director delivers great dynamics with transitions, close-ups and quick camera openings, with panoramas within the environments and the frames have become a franchise's trademark. The work establishes a third person view that makes it look like the viewer is present in the action, sometimes with a camera on top of a car, sometimes with a fixed camera in a restaurant, in a casino, and so on. Not to mention the beautiful aerial plans of Las Vegas, which help to build the necessary ambience for the film.Another highlight is also the great photography, incidentally also commanded by Soderbergh: the Las Vegas of 2001, in a first arrangement by Soderbergh, is more dynamic, unlike the original work. From external to light stripping, the remake of Ocean's Eleven gains momentum when resting its fluidity in a skillful edition. Responsible for a photograph that prioritizes Vegas night and the warm colors of the casinos, Soderbergh provides the ideal mold for the style of the narrative - and here, everything rests on the style - to gain prominence. It is no exaggeration to say that the film breathes the largest city in Nevada. The use of colors is also extremely important, allowing the public to notice the difference between scenarios. For example, the more diffused and peer-reviewed lighting in the red, brown and gold tones of the casinos contradicts the backstage of the same scenario, whose warm palette gives way to the technological coolness of blue, white and gray.It is clear that a surprising narrative and full of twists like this could not support itself. It is not surprising, therefore, that Soderbergh creates an adorably thought-provoking image composition that plays with the scenic anachronism, placing several chronologies that converge on their own climax that is based on comedy, drama and police. In this way, the director makes countless explanatory advances to Danny and Rusty's plan - an enlightening method that would even be repeated by several works of the genre and that would definitely mark an era.The big difference between the original version and the new version is that each member of the group has a specific talent that will be explored throughout the film, instead of everyone being on an equal footing, so to speak. And at this point the script gets it right by focusing less on the action in the assault action, and more on developing the personalities of each one. Whether by a smile, a silence, a sigh or a look, each of the Ocean's Eleven is presented with a minimum of background and personality. It is clear that Matt Damon gains more space than Shaobo Qin. The surgical delivery of lines, however, goes through all the actors. It is they who subtly dictate the difference between Pitt's and Clooney's cynicism, the longing for Bernie Mac and Cheadle, or the comic insecurity of Damon and Eddie Jemison.Although Clooney and Pitt are the real protagonists (Rusty eating the whole movie was a great move from the script), there is enough time for each character to gain layers of context that are essential for us to empathize with them. Clooney and Pitt not only bring the usual charisma to the scene, but also incarnate protagonists so well outlined that it is difficult not to fall in love with the quick dialogues they create with each other and with the arc that they use with such determination. Not to mention the supporting actors who, although they seem a priori disposable, actually have a lot to offer for the continuity of the work. In short, each of them functions as an essential piece of a well-crafted puzzle - and if one fails, the chance of the plan becoming an epic disaster increases exponentially.Although they function as anti-heroes, it is easy to discover who the real antagonist of the story is. Andy Garcia does a spectacular job giving life to Terry Benedict, tycoon responsible for the administration of the three casinos and also for ""stealing"" the seductive Tess (Julia Roberts) from Danny's hands, who still has feelings for his ex-fiancee. Rusty soon realizes that one of the reasons why Danny insists on invading these specific places also rises as a personal vendetta against the one who has caused him so much harm - even if it costs him both his own and his friends' freedom.The soundtrack by David Holmes brings many elements of jazz, as well as the original film, but allowing to add striking songs at certain times, such as ""A Little Less Conversation"", by Elvis Presley, as well as some punctual electronic beats. Stephen Mirrione's editing is also worthy of applause, it is not easy to edit in an agile way amid the many parallel plots and giving equal prominence to so many characters. The editor ensures a frantic pace, especially when the plan comes into action. In addition, he is able to establish the essential elements for the outcome of the narrative, delivering just enough for the viewer to assemble the puzzle in his mind, but making room for him to be surprised nonetheless. Without the singing excesses and acts of cabaret perpetrated by the 1960 film, the delight of suspense is given by the team's formation to the execution of the plan, with very few drops of rhythm.Technically, Ocean's Eleven mixes elements of the classic The Sting (1973) with the agile Snatch (2001). From the first, it copies all the detailed preparation of the big coup. Of the second, it reuses editing and editing, speed and soundtrack resources, as in a video clip. The result pleases, logically, for the energy that comes from the stars. At this point, the viewer already maintains a strong connection with the plot, with the stars and with their characters. Soderbergh not only manages to arrest the public, but also avoids or misses some small drops in rhythm that the film may present. But don't be alarmed, they are few. It should have existed more often during the beginning of the projection, but the director manages, with great merit, to make the part of the ""junction"" or organization of the team right at the beginning of the projection one of the funniest and most interesting of the entire film.Charming and with a fine sense of humor, Ocean's Eleven by Soderbergh is a film that has aged very well. Its jazz soundtrack and metalinguistic details only contribute to a combination of ornaments punctuated with extreme attention. A film with its own tone, discretion and grace, is and has always been the antithesis of the noisy, hysterical and needy blockbuster. It was a surprise at the time of its release - even more for turning a primary story into something far superior. And perhaps most interesting of all, it is one of the few works that does not care about conventionalisms between ""good and evil"", even allowing anti-heroes to manage the robbery perfectly. Presented in a totally different guise from the 1960 classic, the film overflows charisma on the part of its cast, which makes many consider it better than the work that originated it. Whether or not it goes according to the opinion of each one, the fact is that the source material must always be respected, after all, it is from there that everything originated.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Stylish, clever and cool heist flick, but in the end, it's just an empty film with a pretty cover","I finally got to see this, after hearing so much positive stuff about it. People were raving about how it was the definition of cool. I believe someone even told me that it rivaled the likes of a Tarantino film. Well, having seen it, I can say that it's definitely got a lot less style than a Tarantino film, and none of the associated substance. It's basically an empty shell, albeit a pretty-looking one. The film has plenty of acting talent, but not even half of it is put to any use. There are just far too many characters, so many of them spend the better part of the film, following their initial introduction, sitting around, not really doing anything at all. Maybe the film should have been Ocean's Five instead... so we actually got some semi-interesting and well-developed characters instead of these cardboard cutouts spouting hip lines every chance they get. The dialog is witty and at times clever, but it's almost entirely superficial. The plot is decent. Another thing is that there's not really anyone to root for; it's a film about dishonest criminals stealing from other dishonest criminals. The pacing is OK. I found the film to be far too long and drawn-out. It could easily have been cut by at least half an hour. Once again, we don't care about these people. Submit any viewer of this movie to a lie detector test and ask if they saw this for the heist or for the characters. If anything less than 90% prove to have seen it entirely for the heist, I'll be very surprised. Then there's all the unneeded scenes, probably done to establish relationships(between the characters that we don't care about). Add to that, the plot holes and completely random actions of some of the characters. This film reminded me of a Danish produced film... Klatretøsen, or Catch That Girl, as it's international title is. It's a children's film, and I found it far more interesting, involving and plausible than this. Note that I didn't claim it was more entertaining. That's what this film is; entertaining. Nothing else. As a matter of fact, you should probably either see the Danish film, or the American remake(which I haven't seen... yet) as you'll probably find more substance in either of them than this film. If you insist on seeing this, just prepare yourself to be underwhelmed and possibly disappointed. I recommend this only to the biggest fans of the stars and people who look for an attractive film rather than a meaningful one. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Eleven Evaluation,"Ocean's Eleven (2001) is a comedic film, based on the 1960 film Ocean's 11, about a group of thieves, led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his accomplice Rusty (Brad Pitt) who rob The Bellagio casino in Las Vegas along with two other casinos that feed into its vault. The casinos are all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) whom Danny has a personal dispute with. They are all very smart people who know how to play outside the law and win. The plot is cunning and The gang of thieves stress and collaborate together to pull off the perfect crime in this clever film.I've seen this movie many times and every time I watch it, I still admire it. Ocean's Eleven is a witty and funny film that keeps you thinking up until the end of the movie. Every detail is perfectly placed in the movie and I still catch new important clues relating to the plot every time I watch it. It really plays with small details and the relationships that the characters have with each other. There is a perfect balance of fun and seriousness in their job and you can really tell that based on their conversations and interactions with each other. It's a brilliant film that I can watch again and again without boring myself.This film is unique in the way it was filmed and edited. As Rusty and Danny explain exactly what they will be doing according to the plan, this film flashes to them enacting their plot as Rusty and Danny talk about it making it very neatly edited. It tricks you when it comes to time and location, making you really think about what is going on. I also love the cinematography of this film. It takes place in Las Vegas and you really get that when you're watching it. The dim lighting, and glamorous wardrobe selection really conveys what the film is trying to get across, as well as the characters as they are playing different roles. It's really the kind of film that makes you want to rob a Las Vegas casino. And who better than Brad Pitt and George Clooney to rob it with you? The cast is absolutely magnificent. It is picked perfectly with star studded actors. Each actor and actress plays their role exquisitely. The main character are introduced into the film showing exactly who they are and their distinct personality right off the bat, and you love each of the characters instantly. They are all quirky and have their own little comedic mannerisms and actions that just add to the hilarity of the film.I've seen other con-like robbery movies but this movie really is my favorite. There are even two sequels to Ocean's Eleven and I still keep this one close to heart. This movie reminds me of another robbery film, Inside Man (2006) with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Now this movie is more intense than Ocean's Eleven and is not a comedy like it, but it does share some of the same features. Both of these movies deceive you in the plot just as the characters have deceived their robbery victims. In Inside man, Clive Owen pulls off the perfect bank robbery just as Clooney, Pitt, and their crew did in Ocean's Eleven. I love both movies but I really enjoyed the comedic appeal that the Ocean's Eleven added to something serious like robbing a place. It really makes it more entertaining for the audience and makes you love the quirky characters even more.This movie is simply a delight to watch. I could watch marathons of these movies and still wish I had more to watch. Clooney and Pitt steal the show in this film and lead us through this funny and smart plot effortlessly. The whole idea of this movie is simply gold and the whole cast shows us that throughout every scene. I really think highly of this film and encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to take the time to watch it. I would also suggest watching its sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007), as they are written just as perfectly as the first one.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's a good movie. But like I said, it's not that big of a deal. I felt like either there was too much said or then they didn't say enough.

The Cast Makes it Worth Watching,"Ocean's Eleven (2001)*** (out of 4)Remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film features a new slew of ""A"" list actors as they try and rob three Las Vegas casinos in one night for a total of $150-million. I really don't think this remake improves on anything in the original movie but at the same time this one here contains an excellent cast that helps keep everything watchable. Director Steven Soderbergh adds a great style to the picture that keeps you glued into what's going on but at the same time making sure you never think about things too much or else you'd quickly realize that the entire plan simply could never happen. Soderbergh manages to keep the film moving at a very quick pace, which certainly helps things since overall this is just an average caper film. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck and several celebrity cameos certainly keep you glued to the screen. Not only do the actors all show up in good form but several of them turn in excellent performances. This includes Garcia who is just so calm, cool and collective that you can't help but love the character and the way he handles his business. Both Clooney and Pitt share some great chemistry and even Roberts manages to be charming.

A light film that entertains the audience well.,"This movie tells the attempt to rob the vault of three major Las Vegas casinos by a group of professional thieves led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney). It's a very light film, made for entertaining, with an improbable but fun plot, full of moments of intelligent humor that look good in the movie. In addition to Clooney, who has done here one of his most popular works, we have Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts among others. Clooney and Pitt stood out for the positive, being able to amuse and to make humor without losing the charm of their characters or overshadowing the colleagues. The story is relatively simple but allows almost all actors to have room to appear. And although I said the story is unlikely, the biggest problem of the script for me was the love trio Clooney-Roberts-Garcia. The idea was good, but it did not work out because Julia Roberts never seemed very willing. The romantic chemistry between her and her two colleagues was zero and I ended up thinking about what the actress really thought she was doing in the movie. Andy Garcia has already made more inspirational performances but was decent enough on his character. The scenarios are very good and realistic, from the safe to the gaming rooms, and the great sights of Las Vegas are truly beautiful and look good on the screen. The soundtrack is great and stays in the ear.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Perfect script, perfect cast ....just perfect","A film like this doesn't happen that often.. kind of a right place, right time moment. For me it is a classic modern movie, with a touch of old school charm. First watched it in 2001 and 18 years later it still is worth rewatching every year. It's not what they do during the film, it's how they do it. Brad Pitt and George Clooney are excellent, Julia Roberts adds so much class and Andy Garcia is perfectly cast for his role. Great ensemble cast too that really keeps the film moving, adds humour and no one is left underused.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The king of the dialog comedy,"Steven Soderbergh is the unchallenged lord of comedic dialog (not including Inigo Montoya, but that character has only been in one movie.) Soderbergh has proved this countless times, with everything from this to the Informant!Generally, his movies contain very little ""immature"" comedy, which comprises physical comedy, primarily people being hit in the groin or the head. His comedies rely much more heavily on wit and comedic interplay. They are all the better for this fact.Ocean's Eleven, definitely the smartest and best of the Ocean's movies, may be the best of the Soderbergh collection in general. These actors have the art of banter down to a science, literally. I think some of them may have majored in it in college. The Oceans crew pull off the effect of making this gang of thieves seem like a family, albeit a dysfunctional one. And therein lies the charm. We are so used to wanting to see the criminals locked up in these movies that it's a refreshing change to see the people on the right side of the law, at least on paper, be the fools and bad guys.These robbers are in it partially for the money, but partially for the thrill of the heist. But these guys aren't necessarily adrenaline junkies or sociopathic criminals. Rather, it's almost like a sport. The thing that makes these criminals of the Vegas underworld so charming, however, is that they aren't out to hurt people, at least in the physical sense. I don't think any of the crew ever carried a gun at any point in the film.Not only was I empathizing with these criminals, I was laughing, occasionally to the point of tears, along their exploits. Not at their exploits, these guys are the best in the biz, and for good reason. No, I was laughing at the quick one-liners that were so adeptly thrown in there that not a single laugh feels forced, as well as at the general and increasingly imbecilic and barbaric actions if casino owner Terry Benedict.This has also got to include one of the best casts ever assembled, as well. George Clooney is marvelous. Almost all of his movies are comedies, but he is able to act so serious, dead-pan, throughout, that he is often forgotten to be a comedian, or at least a funny actor, first and foremost. Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are equally fantastic, and Bernie Mac was the funniest he'd been in years. And let's not forgot Don Cheadle. He plays the comedian's role quite nicely. I'd recommend he stick to it, if he wasn't so good in movies like Traitor. And how about that Amazing Yen? Everyone here is so funny in their own unique way that they are incomparable. But that's what makes so good...the cast is so unique, but also grafted together so seamlessly, that is easy to feel that if not all were there, the movie wouldn't be what is. Each piece is of the same importance.In the end, this may be one of the funniest movies you'll ever see.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

lightheaded heist,"I admire some of Soderbergh's films - The Limey especially.  I went into Ocean's 11 having heard that it wasn't much more than a celebrity parade dressed up with a heist plot and some nice camera work.  It probably should have ended with the homage to The Right Stuff where the gang seems to evaporate in front of the Vegas fountain.  Packing the expensive talent into a pointless epilogue drained most of the goodwill I had left for the film.Some of the things I hated were - the lighting of Julia Roberts in her first scene was  bad.  Why give her a mongo upper-lip shadow?  Farting away the whole `Pitt is mad at Clooney for making the job personal' with a single line was  okay I guess, since I really didn't care about the subplot at that point.  It's a good thing electronic components can just bounce back from an EMP.On the other hand, the script did stay ahead of any expectations I had as far as the particulars of the heist (which was kept vague anyway - when the film was over, I couldn't say where the vault was in relation to the casino floor or the surveillance room, whereas I could draw you a map of the heists in Rififi, Asphalt Jungle, Topkapi or The Red Circle).  I loved Eliot Gould. Andy Garcia was beamed in from a better movie - all of the other actors are winking at the camera and striking poses in their gloriously outlandish outfits.  I love and admire long takes, but I do occasionally get a caffeine kick out of editing that looks like it was snipped from footage taken by a swarm of bees.  With all the rumors around right now about remaking some of the most unique accomplishments in film history, I really appreciate the fact that Soderbergh decided to breath some life and style into what was a `meh' title.Ocean's is like People magazine getting stuffed into a decent Bond film. Nothing wrong with that.",,Anonymous,Crime

Three casino heist,"Th 1960 rat pack original was not regarded as a good film which apart from Peter Lawford, the rest of the rat pack did too much partying to take the shooting of the film seriously.Director Steven Soderbergh's remake is light in its feet, he has the actors in shape and makes good stab at a lighthearted, stylish caper.Danny Ocean is a con man straight out of prison who gets a gang together and plans go rob the Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand on the same night. All casinos owned by Terry Benedict and he is the man who is now going out with Ocean's ex-wife.The teaming up of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle garnered a lot of excitement and press attention. They even managed to get two rival World boxing champions to meet in the ring on screen. Lennox Lewis who was the world heavyweight champion at the time was so distracted by filming his scenes he subsequently lost the defence of his title.The true assets of the movie is the director and screenwriter who constructed the plot and kept the movie sharp and the egos restrained.The film is fun as you go from the idea of the heist, planning to the recruitment of the team members and then actual robbery itself.

one of the best heist capers films,"Clooney and Pitt are a great duo; they have great chemistry, comic timing and are just an attractive pair. The plot is eleven men who are robbing one of the biggest casinos in Vegas on fight night for a possible bag of $150million, split between them. It's a completely ensemble cast including Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Bernie Mac, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts amongst others. It's clever, witty, multi-layered and something of a film that you can watch again and again and see more things each time. It's one that I had to watch a few times to get the entire plot and each time I see it I don't remember the full points so it's a good yarn. The writers were brilliant.It's shot excitingly, with lots of crisp cuts, and jumping between scenes using a split screen occasionally, giving it a retro feel. The plot is convoluted enough that it's believable, if a little slick (given it's got Pitt and Clooney in it that's a given), with some clever time wasters to ramp up the tension, and I just adore Brad Pitt's characterisation - he's ALWAYS eating! Don Cheadle (uncredited, apparently due to a disagreement) is a funny Britt who speaks primarily in cockney rhyming slang is a bit of a hoot as well.

Great entertainment with an awesome score,"One of the coolest movies in recent memory Ocean's 11 is a stamp of authority on the part of director Steven Soderberg. Starring an ensemble cast and with the assistance of some great background music and cinematography Ocean's 11 is top notch entertainment. The movie provides an engaging two hours that develops in exactly the manner one would expect from this sort of production. The storyline, while certainly not a masterpiece of plotting (there are numerous holes, some of which are rather large), offers enough to keep audiences guessing and to inject a little tension into an otherwise harmless and lightweight enterprise. There are also sufficient moments of comedy to maintain an upbeat tone. And, of course, there are plenty of familiar faces, starting with Clooney and Brad Pitt in the lead roles, and going all the way down to Julia Roberts in a rare supporting performance.

One of the penultimate heist films,"I think that Ocean's Eleven is the film a lot of my generation recalls when they hear the term heist film. And for a good reason. A reboot of an older film by the same name, it updates its story to the modern era, features an all-star cast of high end actors and as a whole is the very definition of slick and cool. Exactly the qualities a good heist film has going for it.Objectively looking Ocean's Eleven doesn't really do anything revolutionary. The story, while more sympathetic to the crooks, is basically the same as far as the premise goes, the plan is clever and will keep you guessing until the end, but doesn't contain any huge twists, and the style is something we've seen before. It's just a matter of how well it can pull those clichés off. And this movie is the very definition of tropes are not bad. Everything in it is textbook, but in the best possible meaning of the term.To be fair, a lot of that is due to the two main leads, Clooney and Pitt. These two are cool and suave in everything they do, and together they are dynamite. It's no wonder they got two sequels out of this. I'm actually somewhat disappointed they didn't get more.You've all seen this film already. It's a part of our cultural understanding nowadays, a cliché, a definition, an understanding of something that just is, a trope in and on itself.

The Rat Pack version did have the different casino's they robbed, but here it was all compiled into one 'megavault' that seems to be able to be cracked by a granny in between her nap and afternoon tea. There's nothing original about this movie and as said the actors are much underused. The ending is even more boring than the rest of the movie. The cast (sans Clooney and Roberts) just stand there in a line looking at nothing for about ten minutes and then look at each other as if to say 'are we supposed to have any lines in this scene'.

Pretty boring,"Add me to the list of people who think that Hollywood is running out of original ideas. This film tries too hard to be cool. Somehow, you get the impression that the big stars of this movie (Clooney, Pitt, Roberts, etc.) are just laughing at all of us, saying ""Don't you wish you were beautiful like us and could appear in movies and make lots of money like we do?""I'll admit I've never been a fan of George Clooney. In this movie and others, he apparently wants to be the next Steve McQueen (who turned down Sinatra back in 1960 when when asked to appear in the original movie). The only problem is, Clooney's not McQueen. McQueen didn't have to act cool, he was cool. As was the real Rat Pack.Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are somewhat better. Both at least show some talent, although this film gives them little opportunity to use it.The rest of the cast is decent, but again, they haven't got much to work with.

Andy Garcia is convincing in his role as well.Probably the best thing about this film was the soundtrack - there was some decent music in several sections throughout.I haven't bothered to see ""Ocean's Twelve"", as the real ""heist"" of these films is being played on the moviegoers who've paid to see them.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The story is a very tricky one in the sense there are many things the director does not want the viewer to know, until it makes sense. However Soderbergh fails to create real thrills and tension in the viewer, although he has several aces up his sleeve. As beautiful as the film is shot it is at times too long. I bet the excellent cast (by reputation) had a wonderful time as so much great actors were combined in one film. It is not that I did not enjoy this film, but rather that it leaves a very odd taste in my nervous system. This is a film without much suspense, many thrills, laughs or anything above normal rate and despite some flaws still manages to entertain. It just has a certain something I cannot really name, although I suspect what it is. It is the fact that the job is pulled by decent criminals, led by the most decent, gentleman - like villain there ever was in film history, George Clooney. The fact that he is around gives this film extra charm that makes it worth seeing. George Clooney puts in that certain something.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

There are great set pieces and twists in the first two-thirds, and then it all peters out at the end. Sonderbergh seem to fall back to his art-house roots and gives us a lot of pretty pictures and a loud soundtrack, while the plot just fizzles out and the movies cruises to the end on sheer charm alone.I'm going to stick my neck out here and say I think the original Rat Pack film actually worked better.

The Great Soderbergh SellOut or How To Make 'Charlie's Angels' With Guys,"This movie is so superficial, it makes me doubt whether the legendary 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' was made by the same director.All the characters are at least obnoxious, the plot is predictable and the 'three' casinos advertised in the trailers is just one.A crowd pleaser nevertheless, 'Ocean's Eleven (2001)' is a waste of talent, but also a money machine for Soderbergh & co.2/10",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best heist ever,"Sure, Ocean's Eleven is a remake.But it does take some skill to make it comparable, if not better than the original. The cast is really hard to maintain, it's like a dream team, and all want attention. The film is split in three parts, the introduction and recruitment, the planning, and the heist. The film is not only enjoyable for the heist and how it's pulled (which is a surprise only once) but in fact the whole film is enjoyable AGAIN because of the ""bad boys on the run"" tone which is very funny in the way characters are introduced.A sure DVD buy which will give you fun on several viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Alas, it's all fantasy","In the commentary by Damon, Garcia and Pitt, one of them points out that in any other town, these people would be the bad guys, but because it is Vegas, and they are rolling a casino, it's OK, and we all applaud! But of course, the casino owners know that too, and that is why the security is so tight and so few attempts get very far (search for casino robbery to learn fascinating stuff!).It is so slick, it flows so well, we know who every one is and what they are doing - mostly. The basic idea is simple, use some ""Mission Impossible"" type fancy technology and equipment and then just go.All the acting is superb, and there is nothing wrong with the production and directing. Although lots of goofs have been spotted, they are all trivial. There are also lots of great lines, (check out the 'quotes' section)My problem is in later trying to work out just how they did it, ie, Ocean explains to the others that the $150+M will be split evenly between them, but later, he trades half of it all to get his ex-wife back?

Average movie,"I found this film quite boring, managed to keep myself awake to see the ending. Don Cheadle's accent was terrible, OK? It was not passable,like some people here seem to think. God know's why they didn't hire a british actor instead.Andy Garcia was good in an understated role. Clooney? Well, I don't know , I don't seem to like him in the films i have seen - although the only other one I saw him in was Batman and Robin.Julia Roberts seems to get uglier and uglier. I know, I know, that's very unfair but... when I first saw her in Pretty Woman, I was like, 'Wow -she's really hot'. In this film, she was pretty mingin' mate! If I was George, I would have given her the one-fingered salute at the end of the film for being such a money-grabbing floozy, and him and Brad could drive off into the sunset together.

Ocean 11: A New Heist,"I've never really been a fan of the Ocean's movies. To be fair, I don't know that I ever really gave them a shot either so seemed like time to rectify that, sit down and watch the trio and give them a fair shake.The result? These movies aren't for me. The cast is stacked and fun and that's really the saving grace of this movie because honestly the plot is just boring. We bounce around, watching them plan and execute the perfect heist and it should be fun but it's soooooo obvious at every turn. There's never the slightest moment of doubt, we always know that, no matter what happens they're going to succeed with minimal struggle or recompense.Also, it's pretty well discussed at this point but seriously? They do all that work, get all that stuff to do this and the payoff isn't anywhere near big enough to warrant it. If the movie veered into the territory of exploring Ocean's addiction to theft even at the cost of himself then that could be an interesting take but that's barely an afterthought.Still, this movie is harmless enough and makes for solid background noise. I just didn't find it capable of really holding my attention because there's no question as to what's going to happen, not even the slightest moment of suspense. Not every movie needs that but this one is so much polish and not enough substance that it could've used something more.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"STYLISH, SMART AND FUN-JOYABLE!","I was never interested in seeing ""Oceans Eleven,"" though ""Ocean's 8""'s release slightly made me want to see this film as well as its sequels. One boring day, I decided to watch and I had very low expectations. After watching it, I HAD A BLAST... at the film's 2nd and 3rd acts.Acts 2 & 3 - FUN AND SMART! The planning and execution of the heist was a brilliant ride from act 2's start to act 3's end. These acts were near-perfection! (Some parts were slightly boring)ACT 1 - The film has a lot of supporting characters which, sadly, meant a lot of dragged and sometimes uninteresting introductions to said characters. If act 1 was the entire film, I'd give ""Ocean's Eleven"" 4 stars. Thankfully, it's not.NOTE: Though the character introductions were too long and, at times, uninteresting, the actors did their best. Their on-screen charisma made these scenes slightly better.I still have one more flaw with this film: Julia Roberts' character. Despite her amazing performance, her character was just a plot device for Danny Ocean. Yes, a plot device is important but when a character is a plot device, the film shouldn't make you feel that said character IS a plot device.Overall, I had a blast with ""Ocean's Eleven!""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's witty, it's got a really god plot, and it's so extremely stylish! It's actually better than the first movie from 1960. And that's not very often, that the remake is actually better than the old one. I remember when i was about to see the premiere, i was thinking to myself: ""Perhaps i can still get a refund"", cause I had very little faith in the movie.

"An American Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels...","Ocean's 11 reminded me a lot of Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, both by Guy Ritchie.  Ocean's 11 had the unique and humorous characters like the Ritchie movies, but unlike Ritchie's movies, I felt that Soderbergh did not use each character to their full potential.  For example, the two young getaway drivers in Ocean's 11 were hired (in the film) not so much for their skills, but for their antics.  I do not ever recall a car chase in the movie in which they were showing off their driving skills.I also did not like the romance part of the story in Ocean's 11.  The movie was up and down between the humor and action of the heist and the relationship between Tess and Danny.  These parts between them slow the movie down heavily.  Also, the ending of Ocean's 11 could have really been improved upon.Regardless, Ocean's 11 was a breath of fresh air for the movie industry. I really enjoyed it, but I would recommend Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels over it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A-List actors celebrate their own hipness,"I didn't have much fun watching this movie.  As heist movies go, ""The Italian Job"" is a much better film, but of course lacks the ""star power"" of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia, who looked really bad in most of her scenes here.Clooney is the centerpiece here, so if you like him you'll probably like the movie.  I thought the pacing was terrible, the plot contrived, and the jokes forced.  The ""Ted Nugent called"" line, which some reviewers found incredibly funny, sounded like the lame jokes that these ""stars"" tell each other between takes.  All in all, the whole film comes off really smug, as if the actors and director spent the whole shoot congratulating themselves on how cool they all are.Granted, the point of the original 1960 Rat Pack film was much the same, but Clooney ain't no Frank Sinatra, baby.  What this film shows me is how lame these people really are when they don't have a good script or character to hide behind.  Take my advice:  avoid this film and rent the new ""Italian Job"" instead; it's a lot more fun.",,Anonymous,Crime

It's all about the banter.,"The remake of Oceans 11 turned out to be more like the original one than I had thought.  The best thing about this movie is the banter between the actors, just like in the original.  There are a lot of really funny lines (some of them aren't delivered well though).  That and some nice cinematography is basically the only thing I really liked about this movie. The plot is very slick, too slick if you ask me.  After explaining how impossible it will be to get into a mega-vault in order to steal $160 million from three Las Vegas casinos, the 11 guys proceed to do it almost without breaking a sweat.  There are only a few brief sequences where they fear that something may actually go wrong, and even in those scenes the tension doesn't seem as intense as it should be.  Maybe that's because the lead guy, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) can do  prison time with no trouble at all.  When the movie starts, Ocean has just been released after 4 years in prison but there is only a slight mention of how hard prison life was for him.  He even has some banter with the parole board as he's being released. As for the characters, all the actors do suitable jobs but there is no character development.  They try to create some by giving some of the characters a quirky habit (one guy sweats a lot, Brad Pitt is constantly eating, etc).  Plus, these guys must be the cleanest criminals the world has ever known.  They're clean cut, well dressed, and they don't even swear a lot.  Even the stripper in one scene is fully dressed. So it seems, despite their denials that's it's a totally different movie than the original, the more things change the more they stay the same.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Matt Damon could have done with a bit more conviction here, though and his character(Linus Caldwall) doesn't properly develop. Julia Roberts is another let down here and gives a wooden and very unconvincing performance. She smiles but doesn't really act here.

Too Cool For School,"This movie was ok primarily because of the performance of the actors led by the smooth and charismatic George Clooney. As a heist movie the plot was a bit stock with the usual high tech security and lasers. Andy Garcia gave the movie some credibility given the plot was fairly preposterous. The movie was watchable and somewhat entertaining but overdone on star power to the point of glare. Basically you wonder if anyone not in the Hollywood incrowd had a shot at auditioning for the movie. Sometimes lesser known actors help fill in a movie. For example, the movie did not need James Caan's son and Casey Affleck is far too good an actor to be given the bit part he had. Damon was good in the movie but also not needed nor was Julia Roberts.

Excellent,"PLOT:  A+ ACTING:  A+ ACTION:  A+ OVERALL:  A+I had been following the development of this film since day one:  director Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich) and George Clooney teaming up post-Out Of Sight for a remake of an old Rat Pack flick called Ocean's Eleven.  Now, two years later and sporting one of the most talented casts of actors and actresses ever assembled, I finally got to see the film I had been looking forward to.  I was not disappointed, what I found was both entertaining and something other than a popcorn movie.  This is one of the best films I've ever seen and I don't think I'm the only one who will end up saying that.The story deals with Danny Ocean (George Clooney), a con-man just out of doing a stretch in a New Jersey prison.  Anxious to get to work, he teams up with pal Dusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and the two men hatch a plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos on the night of the biggest fight in Vegas history. Forming a team of specialists in a Mission: Impossible-esque fashion which includes: a Cockney demolition expert (Don Cheadle), a pair of bickering Mormon brothers (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan), a pickpocket (Matt Damon), an aged con (Carl Reiner), a blackjack dealer (Bernie Mac), an electronics expert (Edward Jemison), a Chinese acrobat (Shaobo Qin), and the men's bankroll (Elliott Gould), the eleven prepare the biggest heist of their lives on an un-crackable vault.  As the story progresses and we watch the plot progress, we find out the vault is not the only winning on the table. Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts), is currently the girlfriend Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the man who owns all three of the targeted casinos.With such a cast of all-stars, it was worth the price of admission alone. Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Roberts, it's a dream come true.  However, this film is not a dream, it is the real thing and will not disappoint.  Each actor works superbly in the confines of their role, not trying to out act one another or take things too seriously.  They are the perfection of cool and it's incredably entertaining to watch them act without breaking a sweat. For example, little mannerisms are worked into each character for  depth and detail when the story cannot focus solely on them.  Such a mannerism is that of Pitt's character, Dusty, he is eating something is every scene.  Granted, I would to have loved to see more of each character (Roberts could have had a lot more to do), however, the film is not about these characters, it's about the heist.  If it was an ensamble piece about eleven criminals robbing some casinos, the film would have been about two hours longer than it's two hours and fifteen minutes.  Don't get me wrong, I would have loved to see more, but more isn't always better.  Why can't more movies have a cast like this?  Every actor took a pay cut just to be able to work with one another and have fun, which clearly shows.  Everyone is having a good time.  Not in the same way the Rat Pack did in the original (film for  an hour and take the day off), just getting together to make a great film.Of course it's not just the actors and actresses that add this flair to the film.  It's the screenplay (written by Ted Griffin), musical score (David Holmes), and the direction/cinematography (Steven Soderbergh).  The screenplay is sharp in it's dialogue and action, adding twists and turns and just a plain cool tone to the flick. The score is also something to notice, composed by Irish DJ David Holmes who once again teams up with director Steven Soderbergh (they previously worked with one another on Out Of Sight), gives us a score of funky jazz that I absolutely love.  It really sets the whole mood.  Finally, my hero, Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh provides excellent direction and gritty cinematography (he also shot Traffic himself) that gives us an excellent sense of location.  The man is truly one of the grestest filmmakers ever.  His influence is visible in much of today's cinema and if weren't for his first film, ""sex, lies, and videotape"", independent film would not be where it is today.  I hope he gets another nomination and possibly another win.  He learned not to come out with two great movies this time around.  I should also mention that there is a likeness between this film and Soderbergh's Out of Sight.  Is this a bad thing?  In my opinion, no.  Out of Sight is one of the best films I've ever seen, while  Ocean's Eleven borrows some of it's style from it's predessor, it pays it's  own way.I had read the book and bought the soundtrack before I went to see the film. I even tried to watch the original, which to my surprise was drawn out and just a romp of excess.  It was refreshing to find that Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Angie Dickinson had been replaced with such a talented cast of Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts.  I couldn't get enough of Ocean's Eleven and I still feel the same.  My friends plan on going back again tomorrow (the day after opening night) for another showing.

Promises Loads Of Fun And Successfully Delivers It,"Smart, stylish & sophisticated, Ocean's Eleven is a sneaky delight that brims with a fun vibe & moves ahead with a carefree attitude, is jam-packed with colourful set of characters who are expertly brought to life by its charismatic cast, and is all the more strengthened by the smooth chemistry they share with each other.The story of Ocean's Eleven follows Danny Ocean who, the moment he is out of prison on parole, begins concocting his next robbery. Needing a team of skilled accomplices to carry out his highly ambitious mission, he enlists the help of an old friend and puts together a team of 11 accomplices, all of whom must work together to carry out the heist successfully.Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise and keeps adding new characters without slowing down the plot. Soderbergh directs each segment with a playful tone and keeps the lighthearted nature of the story alive at all times. The writing is sleek, witty & energetic although the central core of the narrative isn't strong enough.Las Vegas is captured in all its glory, thanks to its exotic shooting locations, well-carved set pieces, vibrant photography, swift camera-work, bright lighting, trendy costumes & numerous aspects that only help in uplifting the film's opulent look n feel. Music also carries a groovy element although it isn't anything memorable.Coming to the performances, Ocean's Eleven features a charismatic ensemble in George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck & others, with both Clooney & Pitt impressing the most. Bringing his charming screen persona into play, Pitt delivers a show-stealing performance but Clooney isn't far behind plus the chemistry between these two is one of the film's main highlights.On an overall scale, Ocean's Eleven is an enjoyable, entertaining & sufficiently satisfying delight that promises lots of fun throughout its 117 minutes runtime and, for the most part, successfully delivers it. The lack of seriousness only takes it so far and while it's certainly missing the element that makes a good film great, Ocean's Eleven nevertheless manages to sideline its shortcomings with a thrilling climax that lives up to its expectations.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Clever crime caper, but not quite among the best of the genre","I love crime caper flicks and this one is pretty good and made better by the all-star cast.  I haven't seen the original Oceans 11 starring the Rat Pack, so a comparison can't be made, and probably isn't fair, really.   As with any good caper movie, you have a man fresh out of the clink (Clooney) who plans the one big job that will set him for life and allow him to take the straight and narrow when its done.  We follow the recruitment of the old gang, the planning, and assorted hi-jinx along the way.  The characters are interesting enough, with a mixed bag of old-time Vega$ types as well as some young nerdlings and assorted hipsters thrown in the mix, makes for an entertaining bunch.  The plot is to rob three casinos at once and actually is quite elaborate.  One thing I dug about it was that they slowly revealed how the robbery would take place, so your are kept in the dark for much of the movie.  To complicate matters, Clooney targets one of the casinos because his ex is seeing the owner.  Normally, this would seem like a contrivance to bring in the 'chick flick' audience (Doesn't having Clooney in a movie already bring in the chicks??), but it tosses a kink into their plans, so I'll let is slide.  The movie is entertaining enough to recommend, but doesn't quite stand up against the best caper flicks.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Eleven Review,"Steven Soderbergh's remake of 'Ocean's Eleven' is an action filled heist film about a criminal, Danny Ocean (George Clooney), who was just released from jail and close friend, Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), who gather nine other men and plan to rob 150 million dollars from three different Las Vegas casinos. It is a fast-paced, clever film that is so entertaining, it has you rooting for the thieves. It is full of a great cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and many more. There are a lot of key characters but each ones important qualities to the job allow them all to come together nicely. It was shot very well with many of the scenes in low lit, dark rooms to show the privacy among the group and the conversations of the heist. In contrast, the casino is full of bright neon lights and gold decor to show it's extravagance and wealth. There is a constant theme of conflict and suspense that can be seen from small mistakes made throughout the heist, the relationship between Danny and Terry (casino owner), and Danny trying to win back his ex-wife. Overall, It is a good mix of comedy and suspense that always has you watching till the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good if you dont question anything,"This movie is good but if you question anything, it completely falls apart. There are A LOT of things in this movie that they dont make any sense or that the director completely ignored. One example is that Brad Pitt's character basically knows everyone in the united states and also knows exactly where to find them anytime of day.This movie would be 10 times better if someone actually put together a coherent heist. Otherwise this movie feels like its trying to be smart but ends up being more like ""Now you see me"".I think the significance of this movie has been overhyped.

That is the main thing that I can say about OCEAN'S ELEVEN. If you ask me, the best things about this film were the lights and casinos of Las Vegas. Also, in my opinion, Danny (George Clooney) was a very smooth criminal. To me, Tess (Julia Roberts) was a very beautiful woman. My favorite outfit of hers was the gold dress she wore when she and Terry (Andy Garcia) went to the boxing match. Anyway, I thought that everyone involved did a good job, the cast was perfectly chosen, and the direction was excellent.

How to knock over a Casino...,"Imagine if you will an all-star cast.  Now imagine that same cast doing what they do best--act.  Ocean's 11 is not like that.Don't get me wrong now, I didn't say they didn't know how to act--I said Ocean's 11 is different if you didn't want the hassle of figuring out what the actors were trying to get across to the audience.Having said that...Ocean's 11 is a nifty little robbery flick that is fun to watch and great for a lazy Saturday night.  In fact, the whole atmosphere has that Saturday Night draw, so it would be difficult thinking otherwise.George Clooney stars as a con just out of prison getting ready to pull another score.  Brad Pitt stars as his buddy getting the whole thing set up. It's really great watching these two guys playing against one another. They have instant chemistry on the screen and are complimented by all the other slowly introduced actors in the story--Matt Damon, Andy Garci, Julia Roberts, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould...etc.  They are all fantastic.One thing though:  If you ever wondered what ever happened to Vincent Mancini in Godfather III--look no more--he dumped Imobolare to work in Las Vegas.  Of course I'm talking about Andy Garcia as the bad guy.  I don't think I've seen Garcia since G3 so it was a surprise to see that he was playing the same type of character which led me to believe that his career was nothing but a big type-casting event.  It wasn't until recently that I realized he did other things other than Vincent Mancini roles.  I guess that's a tidbit that's neither here or there.The sets on Ocean 11 were very well conceived.  The color, lighting and audio was the usual Hollywood splendor.  There's really nothing bad to say about this movie.  I would give it a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is all about good writing, characters, plot, pacing, camera work, score, and set designs. Apart from one characters laughable English accent (and I'm English, people!) there's virtually not a line or scene out of place.Hollywood today could learn a lot from noting the heartbeats of this film, and the great, great underrated screenplay that drives it.

An Ocean of American stereotypes.,"Thief wants his girl back and plan a job to rob his rival. He gathers a team. The robbery is a success and the girl goes back with him. A rather superficial story set in the colourful and well illuminated Las Vegas. The actors play well but not all are convincing. The robbery is ingenious and is the core of the movie. But towards the end there was this feeling of unfinished business. As if a piece was missing. Or maybe a too superficial movie. The trailer was more attractive than the movie itself. Nevertheless, it is still enjoyable to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Simply brilliant,"Ocean's Eleven sets out to be an engaging, thrilling yet fun heist movie, and it manages to accomplish just that. It's stunning, it's simple, it's brilliant. Everything about the movie, from the pacing to the acting and dialogue, is done with so much thought and so well.Ocean's Eleven has quite the typical heist film plot. A criminal, Danny Ocean (played by George Clooney) plans to pull off possibly the biggest heist in the history of the United States, planning to rob $160 million from three casinos in one night. It's no easy task, and he seeks out a team of people (eleven, to be exact), of which include great actors such as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Carl Reiner.I think it's easily the acting that makes this heist film such a standout from other similar films. Matt Damon is so innocent and yet so powerful, and Carl Reiner plays Saul very well, but for me the two best actors had to be George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Together their characters Danny and Rusty lead the team in real style, right from the get-go. Clooney plays his character stunningly, honestly yet with plenty of fun injected into it. Brad Pitt shines in his role, just so...amazing. The highlight of his character for me was easily when he casually got Basher out of an arrest.The dialogue in this movie couples itself perfectly with the acting. It's just such witty, fun dialogue. It's the type of dialogue many may cringe at, but if you're watching this movie you've got to remember that it's just trying to have fun. Everything from the content, the timing, the delivery of the lines, is done so well.Personally, and rather obviously, the highlight of the film had to be the heist. The movie doesn't waste time getting to the heist like other heist films (I'm looking at you Fast Five...which actually copied an awful lot from this movie), and once it gets to the heist it doesn't muck around. It just rolls with it, and it has plenty of witty fun along the way. The heist itself is clever, it's smart, it's brilliantly thought out by the characters and more importantly the writers of the movie.My two only gripes are rather minor; the ending and Basher's accent. I'm not even British but the cockney accent that Don Cheadele puts on can't possibly fool anyone; it's just so unnecessary and whoever suggested he use one should be fired. Also, I don't want to spoil the ending but I feel it could have gone just a little further. It's still great, it's just that it could have been perhaps more satisfying. Still, that's why there are sequels.Ocean's Eleven is just such a clever and yet heist film. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a thriller or is just looking for a quick way to kill two hours. You won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good Vegas Fun,"Ocean's Eleven had a really cool feeling to it- a cool cast, a cool premise, and it was based in Las Vegas - what more could you ask for?  George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon made it easy for me to keep my eyes on the screen (I would love any movie that had those three in it, no matter what the plot was).  One thing I didn't notice until the second time I watched it was that Brad Pitt is always eating something in every scene!  Casey Affleck and Scott Caan were hilarious in their roles as the brothers from Utah - they reminded me of my brothers.  I was also impressed by both Elliott Gould's and Carl Reiner's performances in their roles.  It was a nice change to see Elliott Gould in a more intelligent role than the one he has on Friends.  Even though I hate to see Andy Garcia as a villain, I think he did an excellent job - his character was easy to hate.  I always enjoy Julia Roberts, however I was a bit disappointed by her awkward performance in this movie.  It seemed like she was just there to deliver lines - I don't think she really got into the role.  Another thing - someone needs to teach her to walk like a lady!  That being said, I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I would give it 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Casey Affleck is really good, and Soderbergh does a good job at directing.  Some plot holes, but they didn't bother me too much.  My only complaint is the story line between Clooney and Roberts. There scenes together are good, especially their first encounter to the audience.  The story-line between the two, however, does not develop at all, and when it ends you are sitting there wondering what happened.  Other than that, good heist movie even if it has been done before.  The acting is done very well.  Although it does seem like an all-star basketball game where there are too many stars on the court.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Could Be Better, Could Be Worse","After having seen this movie more than eight times (not by choice), I've come to realize that the original unfavorable reviews I read were correct: this film is not much better than mediocre. That's not to say that the film is terribleit's notor that you shouldn't watch ityou shouldbut rather that it has many flaws, some of them glaring.Ask most people why they saw the movie, and they'll say something like ""It has George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it,"" or ""It has Julia Roberts in it,"" or ""Stephen Soderbergh directed it."" Ocean's Eleven is a ""People Magazine"" reader's dream come true. So many celebrities in one movie: what bliss! The point is that Ocean's Eleven is not meant to be strong on character, or plot; it's meant to be strong on Star Power. In fact, it's surprising that there is a plot, such as it is. It follows the new Blockbuster code: Hot Bad Guys who are actually Good Guys want to steal money from crooked, mean Big Businessman; they make elaborate plans, use fancy equipment, and ultimately...but we all know the ending. Soderbergh may court the strange, the offbeat, the underbelly of society, but he also knows that when making an action movie one should not deviate too much from the tried-and-true. He gives us what we want, and more.George Clooney and Brad Pitt as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively, are the most likable of the bunch. They have a rapport that either is natural, or was rehearsed so effectively and so well that it became natural. They're like Laurel and Hardy, only with stubble and expensive suits. They eat each other's lines, insult each other, show off in front of each otherin some ways they're a more compelling couple than Clooney and Roberts.Incidentally, Julia Roberts, apparently confusing Tess Ocean with Erin Brockovich, gives an intensity to her role of The Chick that is entirely inappropriate. This is an action movie, not a chance to win another Oscar. She speaks words like she's chopping onions: short, quick, and full of force. Of course, her dramatic skill is unquestionable, but in this case a lighter touch would have been more fitting. I can understand her desire (if she had it) of wanting to give more weight to her role as Clooney's ex-wife and Andy Garcia's new girlfriend; it must be frustrating to be a piece of meat that men fight over. But she should have been more perceptive to the genre of the movie and its requirements. In action movies, chicks should look hot and be tough; they shouldn't be too serious.The fact is, we hardly ever think of Roberts (or any of the other Big Names) as anything but who they are off the set. Although Garcia calls Roberts ""Tess"" several times, somehow the name always rings false. The other cast members, being less famous, have the advantage of being able to play their characters more convincingly.This movie was a remake of another all-star movie made in 1960. (I've been unable to see more than snippets, and where I live I'm not able to rent it.) Most reviews refer to this previously made film, but the fact is that Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven is its own entity. We should judge it not based on its predecessor, but on its own meritsunfortunately too few.When I first saw this movie, it was in Spain, dubbed in Spanish, and I thought it was well made, well acted, and generally better than most action movies. (Of course, I was on a date at the time, so I wasn't scrutinizing every detail.) Upon subsequent viewing, however, this movie's imperfections only become more glaring. It's too bad. Although you won't think you've wasted two hours if you watch it, this movie is not one that you'll return to over and over againthat kind of film where each time you see it you discover more of the director's ingenuity, the actors' skill, the screenwriter's craft. This movie is good for a quick laugh and a thrill, but, like birthday cake, it's not ultimately what satisfies your hunger.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Boring,"This an absolute waste of two hours, 120 minutes of your life, that you unfortunatly never will get back.

One of my favorites; a truly perfect film,"Watch this film a couple of times and catch all the great one-liners and little details, and you'll realize that ""Ocean's Eleven"" is brilliant.

Convict Danny Ocean (George Clooney) assembles a team of twelve men to pull off a heist to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Supporting characters like Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac (rest his soul), and Elliot Gould are all excellent, but for me it is Brad Pitt that manages to steal every scene and deliver every line in the funniest, smoothest way. Andy Garcia is also perfectly cast as Terry Benedict, the casino owner who commands authority just by his actions. This is one of the rare films that everyone in my family (Mom, dad, brother) all enjoyed equally. It's easy to watch and completely entertaining. I like ""Ocean's Twelve"" even better than this film, since the comedy in that one is even more brilliant and improves ever more with each viewing. This, however, ranks nearly as high as that sequel.

Easy money,"Danny Ocean and his co-conspirators are looking to do the impossible. They're not even as careful as they should be about it. They want to see just how far they can push their luck. So it's appropriate that the establishment they are knocking over is a casino (actually, three casinos that share one ridiculously secure vault).Steven Soderbergh is trying to continue a streak of great directorial efforts, to give us an encore after winning an Academy Award. To do it, he's assembled a cast that reads more like a producer's wish list. Soderbergh got all of 'em. Knocking over three casinos in one night? Impossible. The guy responsible for two out of five Best Picture nominees last year making a movie that people will want to watch starring Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Matt Damon? Well heck, that's just easy. Whether it's good or not is a different proposition and, perhaps, a moot one.The film takes no time to explore what's at stake for any of the eleven, except Ocean himself. Each man's take is not that much in movie terms, roughly $13.6 million. So why risk it? Even exploring the lives of three of four characters would have sufficed. So I guess they just want money. For what? Well, because--the house always wins. Elliott Gould's character, when the idea is proposed to him, tells Ocean he'll need a crew just as crazy as he is. So assemble he does, many crazy fellows. But what exactly makes them so crazy? Why are they selected? Soderbergh didn't want to spend too much time on assembling the group, so he had to leave much crucial information out. And it hurts.Not that Soderbergh and HIS crew don't put on a good show anyway. He's brought several actors together who are used to carrying films by themselves and asked them to play minor character roles. Budget plummets, net profits soar. This move should represent something very positive in the filmmaking community--the idea that acting is fun and work is work (though even the reduced rate each A-lister here was paid is more than the average American makes in ten lifetimes). The problem is they risked nothing. This film could not miss. Everyone involved is obviously having a blast, but the film never finds a soul. It's too busy being cool and clever.So cool is ""Ocean's Eleven"" in fact, that I missed that there's barely a curse word, no sex, no violence. Nil. A caper movie like this typically has plenty of each, but not this. Not that  Soderbergh seems to be necessarily avoiding them. These things that are meant to add something to films--sex, violence, profanity--are like a subject in a conversation that just never comes up.Soderbergh shoots this one himself, as he did with ""Traffic."" I wonder how much the guy actually directed on this one. With this kind of acting talent, who tries to direct? Even before he won his Best Director Oscar, he was probably thinking about a project in which he could be mostly a cameraman. That's why ""Eleven"" falls far short of ""Traffic,"" ""The Limey,"" and ""Out of Sight.""

This is not the 1960's version and should not be put on the same level as it. The change in technology has changed so much since the original 1960's Rat Pack movie that the 2001 version acts as a totally new film. The original was a great movie no denying that. The heist in the 1960's version was way ahead of its time. But a lot has changed in 41 years; in this age of computers it would have been impossible for the original heist to work without a Vegas camera watching you.

"Formulaic and nothing deep, but well-acted and very entertaining.","You could point out how ridiculously complex the robbery is. You could wonder why Tess dated the casino owner in the first place. You could even analyze the underlying sexism in the story, but by doing so you're really missing the point: 'Ocean's Eleven' is not supposed to be deep or meaningful - it's just very fine entertainment.Danny Ocean (George Clooney), master con-artist and thief, has just been given parole after a few years in prison for the one crime he got caught for. So naturally the first thing he does is get in touch with old partner Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), now teaching stupid Hollywood teen stars how to play poker, and they assemble a crew (his 'Eleven') for a stunningly audacious heist - he's going to break into the vault that holds the cash for three of Las Vegas's biggest casinos during a world heavyweight title fight. Ocean also plans to steal his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) off Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the owner of the casinos.It's a heist movie, and as such there are a few basic elements - experienced pros, talented youth (Matt Damon), beautiful love interest, evil villain, super-secure safe. Yes, it's predictable in its basic plot, but the real pleasure in the movie comes from watching the ingenious robbery unfold, twists, turns, problems and all, and the considerable charm of the stellar cast. The deadpan Pitt and Clooney  and the snakelike Andy Garcia are particularly good, and there are some excellent lines:Clooney: 'What happened to Billy X?' Pitt: 'Dead.' C: 'He got shot?' P: 'No, skin cancer.' C: 'You send flowers to the funeral?' P: 'Dated his wife for a while.'There's not much substance in the film, but there sure is a lot of style.RATING: 7/10Tane",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

One Of My Favorites!!!,"This movie was totally great! I'll admit, the only reason i saw it was because I like Brad Pitt and I saw the preview for Ocean's 12 and so I saw this one, but when it was over I kept thinking ""Wow! Why didn't I see this sooner?"" It's truly great, the all-star cast and the fun, casually atmosphere makes this movie addicting, spectacular, and most of all just pure fun! The sophisticated scheme was again, great, and Danny and Rusty used their brain to come up with it.Like all movies it wasn't perfect, but the only flaw I found was that the plan went TOO well.

"Fast, Fun and Filling","This film is pure fun right from the beginning.I cannot honestly remember the last time when I've seen ""cool"" personified on the silver screen. The cast is superlative, plain and simple. This movie is meant to be an entertaining, escapist meringue and it delivers.This movie expects you to pay attention and I respect that. The dialog can move at a quick and brisk pace, much like ""The West Wing"" and ""SportsNight"", which is something I admire. Too many movies these days fall into two categories; those which move at such a slow pace as to make sure even the dullest person can follow along, or those movies that move so fast you can leave for five minutes and not miss anything (ex. Mission Impossible 2).While watching this movie you come to realize two things: one, the actors had fun doing this movie (and you can see it) and, two, you have fun watching this movie. As heist films go, it is probably one of the best that I've seen. If you liked the re-make of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", you should see this movie.As I told one of my friends ""Finally, a movie where you get your $10.00 worth.""",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Form over substance,"This is perhaps one of the most unsatisfying films I can remember seeing in a long time.  Given the talent on show, both behind and in front of the camera, this film could have been a classic.  Instead it's a lightweight crime caper that trades solely on our affection for the (many) headline stars on show.The saddest indictment of the film is that my abiding memory of it will be Don Cheadle's hopeless cockneyish English accent - why not just get an Englishman to play the role and at least try to do it properly?Failings aside, there are some plus points.  Clooney and Pitt are both excellent, the swift pace means there's no time to dwell on how the lack of depth to both the plot and the characters and the script is adequate. Always a pleasure to watch Andy Garcia, although he is employed here merely as a stereotype 'boss' character.Disappointing, given what might have been (6/10).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very well done!,"I went in to this movie prepared to hate it, but hoping for the best. Being a huge Sinatra fan, I am probably one of the few people who really enjoyed the original, and not simply for camp.And to be blunt... I just can't stand Julia Roberts.  In my humble opinion she is just about as overrated as an actor can be.But, this film was just plain great.  Entertaining all around... funny, but not overly so... this film seemed very tight to me in it's weaving the story in a way that gives the big ensemble cast their own chances to develop their characters on screen without hurting the plot advancement.  There are a bunch of ""techno-heist"" films out now... and I'll put Ocean's against any of them.  While not entirely unpredictable, I was having such a good time throughout the whole film that I just didn't care.  Terrific use of music to propel you through the story and provide a sense of pacing... just one of the many things I noticed about the movie.My girlfriend even liked it, which brings the number of films we agree upon to 4... (should I be surprised that 3 of these films star Brad Pitt, I wonder?)As for Julia... mercifully her role limited her to be the eye candy and not the Erin Brokovich, which I think she does much more convincingly.I know it will never reap any real critical recognition, but for sure it has a spot on my dvd rack where it will see repeated use.In my humble opinion.... probably the best remake ever.  I really love well crafted movies... it takes so much work to make a feature length film, and to see one that is so well made all around is such a breath of fresh air.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

One thing that really struck me was the whole 60's vibe present in the film.  While it takes place in modern day Vegas, the look, feel and sound of hay-day of the Vegas strip is somehow present.

A glossy finish without content,"First of all i have to agree with a critic saying ""Entertaining but not engaging""Steven Soderbergh probably thought that the content is second as long as you have a handfull of beatifull stars. Ok, George Clooney delivers one-liners in his standard ironic way with a touch of arrogance and Pitt/Damon is as goodlooking as ever but it all feels a bit to polished and empty. Arrogance by the way distinguish the 3 allready mentioned self-assured ""hunks"" efforts in this film. And the love story between Julia Roberts and George Clooney's characters is totally unnecessary and a waist of Roberts talent. It doesnt really add anything but rather leave a sense of what?/why?.Sure enough, you can expect a few laughs but there a bit too cheap and holds the standard of a Late Show-cast reject.The original version is no masterpiece either but i really did expect more from Soderbergh and this uninspired cast.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Eleven - A Comedy With Class,"Some of Hollywood's biggest stars came together to help form a motion picture that is both fun and delightful. George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a man who just got out of prison from being caught stealing a large sum of money. But, nevertheless, Ocean wasn't ready to stop there, because he had something bigger in his mind than ever before... to rob 3 of the most largest casinos in Las Vegas, all at the same time. Once Ocean was set free, he then gets the world's most cunning, deceivous and rather clever 'men on a mission' to join together and help him get the job done. Ocean was planning on stealing all of the 150 million dollars stored in the casino stocks, with 11 people to share the reward with. The movie is filled with excitement through interesting dilemmas and hilarious character personalities and interactions. Brad Pitt is great as a man with class and who knows how to do things right, while Matt Damon is terrific as a mysterious robber with a subtle charm that makes him likable. The lovely Julia Roberts plays Tes, Ocean's ex-wife, and complications arise when she starts dating the casino owner (Andy Garcia). Since Ocean still wanted Tes back, it became obvious to the team that Ocean had more on his mind than they first thought. Will Ocean get all the cards he needs to win the game? A great, coming-of-age motion picture that's filled with laughs, great performances from all the actors, and a fresh screenplay that make this film well worth watching.

"George Clooney's performance, and how Brad made it possible","This movie caught the wonderful suave, wit, and pure entertainment bliss that is found in this original!  George Clooney successfully portrays a robber whose capers are beyond remarkably brilliant, but also incredibly easy to get caught. ""Ocean's 11"" had me guessing for exactly how they could not only conceive, but actually carry out, and keeps you wondering: just who is the bad guy?

Uber-Coolness On Demand,"Three casinos. One hundred and fifty million dollars (the stakes, not the film's budgetbut you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise) and just under a dozen of modern cinema's most capable and recognised stars combining to create I daresay the greatest heist movie of all time. As Jake LaMotta once said: 'That's entertainment.'Hit-and-miss director Steven Soderbergh assembles George Clooney and Brad Pitt, who in turn assemble Damon, Gould, Mac, Qin, Reiner, Jemison, Cheadle, Affleck (the good one) and Caan (the young one); a crack team of thieves and con-artists poised to rob Terry Benedict (Garcia) of his wealth and, if all goes well, his girlfriend (Roberts).There is a lot to like about this film from an artistic perspective. The cinematography is always slick and co-ordinated beautifully with the required speedy pace. This is particularly impressive upon a second viewing. Because of how few individual shots were actually used in this film compared to most other contemporary efforts, one has to admire the skill in direction; being able to convey so much activity in so few shots without leaving the film feeling sluggish is a real credit to the production team.While dynamic filmmaking from behind the lens is part of the reason for how well Ocean's Eleven engages its audience, it is the actors that set the tone perfectly. Heavy-hitters like Damon and Garcia are persistenly in control of every scene, and are complimented by some above-average performances from the rest of the cast.But it is the fantastic interplay between Clooney and Pitt that makes the movie. Accommodated by an offbeat script that plays towards these two actors more than any others in the film, they inject a believable 'buddy-comedy' undertone, which doesn't feel at all out of place, probably because the movie refuses to take itself seriously. Rather than trying to convince us that to steal money from a casino in this way is actually possible, Soderbergh positively lets the mechanics fall by the wayside and instead puts his primary focus on pure entertainment.As a rule of thumb, the ending of a heist film does not have to be its strength, as knowledgeable audiences are content to have simply gone along for the ride, and whatever ending the film throws together to justify the series of events will usually suffice. For Ocean's Eleven, this is where a refreshing point of difference lies. A twist ending of sorts, the conclusion is altogether satisfying, unique, and has clearly been well thought-out, so as to avoid a minefield of potential plot holes.This film is as much about the essence of Vegas and excess as it is about a crime syndicate. A sexy soundtrack (the kind of music you expect to hear in the Hard Rock Hotel foyer), fun references to other genre-moulding crime films (including The Godfather and Sinatra's original Ocean's Eleven), expansive shots of The Strip's skyline and cameos galore make the film utterly enjoyable in the plainest sense of the word.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Not the best movie I've ever seen,"This is okay, I guess. Not near as good as I hoped, but what ever really is? The plot is a bit flimsy, as is the lame, half-cocked romance between George Clooney and Julia Roberts, and definitely the underwhelming acting. Pitt and Clooney aren't given a lot to work with here, and most of the time it's all clichéd super-slick con artist posturing with little to no actual emotion or anything put into it. Seriously, this could be really good if our main characters had ever shown any emotion aside from the conniving smirks and poker faces they usually seemed to have on, but as it is, all I can say is that this is too generic and unmemorable to merit any of the praise it has been given.It does get some points for an entertaining climax and the well constructed heist, but that doesn't make a movie.

A Testosterone-Heavy Good Time,"A very obvious plot flaw towards the end concerning the lone female cast member almost sinks this lighthearted remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film concerning a simultaneous heist of three Vegas casinos. The fact that the flaw could have easily been corrected makes it all the more disconcerting and you leave the movie shaking your head. But ultimately the memory of the geniality of the project wins you over. It's definitely minor Steven Soderbergh but that's the point: after the seriousness of both `Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich' this must have been a welcome relief and he has a lot fun letting his actors indulge their hipness quotient. The large cast does just that, with George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts among others preferring to underplay rather than ham it up (although the always-welcome Carl Reiner has some very juicy scenes impersonating a Russian). Soderbergh revels in the testosterone heaviness of his film--there are some shots of backlit Vegas fountains exploding that would seem almost silly if they weren't tinged with the bit of melancholy that occurs after orgasm. All in all, a good way for Soderbergh to recharge his batteries.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

An Uninspired Remake Of An Uninspired Original,"I was not a huge lover of the original version of ""Ocean's Eleven,"" but would still give it the nod over this rather weak and uninspired remake. Basically what makes this the weaker of the two is the cast. In the original, there was the chemistry of the ""Rat Pack"" to at least keep things interesting. Here, George Clooney et. al. are never able to establish that same rapport and a movie that boasts some big names (Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, etc.) is never able to convince me that the cast was working as a team.The same problem that infected the first version is apparent in this as well: the plodding beginning which takes us in great detail through the planning of the casino heist. Here, though, the planning itself leads to questions. To do everything that this bunch did in preparation would have required (it seems to me) a fair bit of seed money. Sure, $160 million is a lot of money, but I found myself wondering at times why they needed it. In any event, the planning of the heist is not exactly spell-binding. This version goes into far more detail about the heist itself than did the original, but it loses points for its ending, which was quite weak compared to the ""Rat Pack"" version.Since I wasn't a fan of the original I wasn't really expecting much, and that's exactly what I got: not much!3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

The love story is flat and so naive! No chemistry at all between Clooney and Roberts. The ending is the worst part, spoiling the movie, which so far had been not a bad action flick. I cannot simply believe that money-loving Julia at one moment turned to georgious George! Even is so, they showed everything literally (do they think the viewer is so dumb???) ending with the compulsory kiss. The action part of the movie is better, but there's been lots of such robbery films and this one does not outstand. The robbery itself is filmed quite well and is surely the best part. Acting? Pitt, Clooney, Damon and Roberts are disappointing. Garcia not bad.

The acting is fabulous and the plot is witty, intricate and and best of all ridiculously unbelievable but for the sole purpose of being ridiculously unbelievable. It's a charming little piece of filmmaking that isn't expressive of the director's desire to make a statement about life, but rather a collaboration of fine actors with a superb knack for style, a script with the perfect dosage of whimsical dialogue and clever plot twists, and a director capable of Oscar-caliber schematics giving his audience a break from social commentary by replacing it with unrealistic yet straight-forward amusement. Steven Soderbergh, after masterminding Traffic and Erin Brockovich, doesn't disappoint simply because his film entertains rather than moves, and although some film critics may question his motives in choosing such a project, I'm impressed with his consistent ability to appease movie-goers whatever the subject matter. So there you have it. After finally seeing Ocean's 11 ending months of anticipation, I can honestly say my expectations were exceeded, and I couldn't be more excited to have discovered another film to be added to my collection in the very near future. Needless to say, everyone should see this movie. I assure you, it will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Ocean's Eleven, Rating's Eleven","WOW. I just watched Ocean's 11 yesterday and I think it is one of the best movies of 2002. A wonderful cast, it's kind of obvious being it includes George Clooney (ER), Brad Pitt (Legends Of The Fall), Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) & Julia Roberts (Pretty Woman). Every cast member has a spark that unites them all. No character (even though the script obviously says otherwise) has a bigger role that the other. Ocean's... unites Hollywood's hottest star in one film. Though film could of been better written, works for any fan. Film's smartness will dazzle you at the end. Even though Julia's role is small it is smart and sexy. Clooney's role will leave you breathless, with his abbility to confuse you, even though according to script. Pitt's part is a secondary role but is played splendly. Damon's role is of a dumb thief, he still played it perfectly. Director's directing is better than any other Steven Sodebergh film. BOTTOM LINE: 11 (out of 10) for Ocean's 11",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Nothing special, but still enjoyable","No, this film won't win an Oscar or anything like that.  But I have a feeling you'll enjoy it.The plot, admittedly, is pretty predictable, at least until the actual heist attempt starts.  There is some interesting sleight of hand here that forces you to do a mental rewind, not unlike ""The Sixth Sense"" and its surprise ending (at least for those who didn't wrack their brains for half the film to figure it out early).  The plan of the heist itself is pretty far-fetched, which does help to heighten your anticipation as to whether they can actually pull it off.  Entertaining?  Yes.  It's still the weakest part of the film, but it's still fairly good.Not that the plot matters, really.  The assemblage of actors here more than makes up for it.  There is nothing flashy about the performances here -- they're simply played well, very straight-faced, very every-manish (or dare I say, ""Bruce-Willis-esque"").  The gang as a whole is an interesting and entertaining mix, and it is these caricatures here that make this film enjoyable.This film is not really a heist film, per se -- it's not about being suspenseful, but rather, much like the Rat Pack it hails from, it's about being smooth and suave.  This cast does so in near-perfect fashion.  There is a certain timing and tone in every bit of dialogue, and he who takes the time to analyze it sees just how well done this film really is.Further reinforcing that this is not a heist film, it ends not with guns blazing but with...well, I'll let you see that for yourself.  I've mentioned already that there is a lot of trickery involved with the heist, much of it hidden from the viewer as well until the end.  I laughed out loud in the theater when the final trick was revealed, and then my rating of this film went up a couple points.Those seeking Academy Award material may opt to wait for the DVD.  But if you just want a couple hours of entertainment, this film shouldn't disappoint.My IMDB rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nice use of 'Clair de lune',"Except for the ""3 to 6 months later"" coda, the last 5-6 minutes of the movie is edited so that it's choreographed to a plush orchestration of Debussy's ultra-romantic ""Clair de lune"" piano piece. Very nice little tour de force by Soderbergh, and makes up for the emotional chemistry that doesn't really exist between Clooney and Roberts. One critic famously described how ""Clair de lune"" evokes fountains rising majestically in the moonlight, and that's exactly what we see as our heroes gather to contemplate what they've done. (Not that there isn't something a bit phallic about that particular shot as well - there is, I'm just choosing not dwelling on it here!)What about the rest of the movie?

Fun ride to crime,"In my opinion (humble or not) 2001 was the heist year. David Mammet put in his two cents with Heist. Edward Norton, Robert Deniro and Marlon Brando teamed up for The Score . Even that Kevin Costner piece of crap 3000 Miles to Graceland involved a casino heist. Steven Soderburgh also threw his hat into the heist genre ring with a little movie called Oceans 11.Oceans 11 is a 'remake' the 1960 'classic'. I put remake in quotes because the movies are quite different and I put classic in quotes because the original was drek. George Clooney had they easy job of replacing Frank Sinatra as Daniel Ocean, the brains behind the scene. Frank Sinatra was in one good movie (Manchurian Candidate) that I have seen and he is the reason I find it hard to watch that movie again.

Anyway, I liked the theme and setting of the movie and how it was taken place throught Las Vegas. Then when they pull their carefully planned heist, there are a lot of things done that actually seem like could have pulled off in a casino, where as the movie claims is the most impossible place to rob.

Decent heist film with an excellent cast.,"A remake of 1960's Ocean's 11, Ocean's Eleven is a 2001 heist film directed by Steven Soderbergh. It follows Danny Ocean (George Clooney) as he assembles a crew of 10 others likeminded crooks and hatches a plan to steal upwards of 150 million dollars from three Las Vegas casinos.
Ocean's Eleven is a film that works almost exclusively due to its excellent cast. It is filled with Hollywood A-listers, and it pays off. With a cast boasting a combined four Academy Award wins for acting and 13 nominations, the film is always fun to watch. For as great of an ensemble as the movie presents, the characters are unfortunately weak, nonetheless. The cast makes it a fun time, but any real emotional impact is lost by a lack of any justification other than greed for the heist. As the film reaches its end, I find myself wondering if I really want our crew to succeed, and the film's script does nothing to support or expand on such moral questions in any way. Ultimately this leaves us with a group of characters that are just barely likeable, but only due to the charisma of the talented cast, not the quality of the script.
Setting aside the questionable morality of the characters, Ocean's Eleven is still endlessly entertaining. It is paced quite well, and the setup/planning portion of the film is interesting enough that it never feels like it is dragging on as you wait for the heist to begin. As for the heist itself, the planning and execution are brilliant, and although it does often feel too convoluted to be believable, there are too many real examples of heists done in the same vein as this one for me to criticize the believability too much.
There is a lot to like in Ocean's Eleven, and if you're looking for a good time you can't go wrong. The whole movie comes together quite nicely, and you'll certainly never be bored. That having been said, the story that it tells is quite a shallow one, and never resonates in any deeper way. If all you're looking for is a little bit of escapism, you can't go wrong with Ocean's Eleven",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
All-star ensemble cast caper movies don't work!!,"Ocean's 11 is another ensemble all-star-cast caper movie.  As such, it is one of the best of that lot, but overall that lot is a sorry lot.  Ocean's 11 reminded most recently of a similar ensemble caper flick of a few year's back, ""Sneakers"" (1992)with Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier.  The reason ensemble cast caper films don't work is that there are too many characters for any of them to get developed in the course of a 2 hour movie.  Both of these films (Ocean's 11 and Sneakers) therefore come off as shallow, undeveloped, and slight.  One of the big attractions of Ocean's 11, that gets us into the theater in the first place, is Julia Roberts, but her character is so poorly developed here that she is little more than window dressing and we never understand her motivations (in fact, she doesn't actually do anything in this movie, when you come right down to it.)  The saving grace of Ocean's 11 is the stylish, sophisticated filmic style brought to it by Steven Soderbergh.  Is is so, so refreshing to see a crime picture without a lot of gunfire.  Still, my wife complained as we left the theater that the film didn't have a climax.  You be the judge--the whole film is a mixed bag that way.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The slick and sly group hand out a magnificent performance as they make you realize that sometimes, in certain aspects and circumstances, crime does pay  and with an interest","Long before Thirteen and Twelve, there was Ocean's Eleven. A salute to Hollywood's golden era where glamor and glory graced the silver screen, Eleven was a cool breathe of pure cinematic fun when it initially hit theaters during the winter of 2001. Being a remake to a forgotten Rat Pack 1960 release only added more glitter to the story  as director Steven Soderbergh managed to recruit some of Hollywood's finest current talents to this intelligent remake. When you come to think of it, there really isn't that much room for mistake when you have living-legends George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia as your main leads.If plot is of any importance to you, you'll probably want to know this is about Danny Ocean (Clooney), an ex-con who just got out of a 5 year period behind bars. Determined to make a final heist before he retires from crime (yeah right), Ocean finds the perfect target  a casino owner named Terry Benedict (Garcia) who has his eyes out for Ocean's ex, Tess (Roberts). With the help of his ten newly recruited accomplices (each individual specializes in a different field of theft), he plans the perfect crime  simultaneously robbing three Las Vegas casinos owned by Benedict. The suave gang of criminals soon set their plan in motion, working every little detail leading up to their final move.The slick and sly group hand out a magnificent performance as they make you realize that sometimes, in certain aspects and circumstances, crime does pay  and with an interest. Kudos go to Soderbergh and his gang for this one, as I truly had a ball watching it, as I'm sure they did making it (btw, the sequel, Ocean's Twelve, is a far inferior predecessor to this film  but the threequel, Ocean's Thirteen saves the prestige of the trilogy).",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

It keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat and just when you think you have a bead on what's going to happen next, the film throws a curve ball twist right past you.

A real winner,"2001 was unusually awash in heist movies. Ever a popular genre, 2001's crop included one with top box office draws (Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell in the horrible ""3000 Miles to Graceland""), a pairing of two cinema legends (Robert de Niro and Marlin Brando in ""The Score"") and acclaimed writer David Mamet's take on the genre (a film simply called ""Heist"").With all of this competition, perhaps the least likely candidate to yield a memorable film was ""Ocean's 11"", which was a remake of a long-forgotten rat pack movie directed by the hit-or-miss Steven Soderbergh with a cast (other than Elliott Gould) better known for their looks and celebrity than their acting chops at the time.Movies are often more than the sum of their parts, and ""Ocean's 11"" is not just the clear winner of the crowded 2001 class of heist movies, but one of the greats of the genre. With a jazzy soundtrack that literally hits all the right notes for a hip, sleek movie, ""Ocean's 11"" is shot much in the style of then-recent movies like ""Casino"" and ""Boogie Nights"" with a rolling, non-stop story set to a great soundtrack that keeps presenting you with interesting new things and never making you sit through a tedious scene.The story is wonderfully simple, and gets around the basic problems of the heist genre (revealing too much too soon about how the climactic heist is going to work) in a fun way that isn't heavy-handed. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) recruits a crew of odd but talented criminals, each with their own specialty, for an unprecedented robbery of three Las Vegas casinos. And, as the gang is surprised to find out, this may be as much about getting back Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts), who is married to the ruthless and ice-cold owner of the casinos in question.No one is going to confuse this with a serious movie about criminality, this plan would no more work in the real world than the idiotic one in ""3000 Miles to Graceland""), but the charm of ""Ocean's 11"" is that it's so sleek and fun with its great music, frenzied pacing and larger-than-life characters that you don't really even care about the deviations from reality.Forget the sequels and the other heist movies of 2001, ""Ocean's 11"" is the only winner here.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good but...,"George Clooney, in his suave, low-keyed voice, is the persona of cool in Ocean's Eleven.  The funny scene with Matt Damon and Bernie Mac (along with Andy Garcia) is very good, but Clooney along with Brad Pitt make Ocean's Eleven an enjoyable ride, albeit slightly slower than expected.  Don Cheadle's cockney accent is very good, and Carl Reiner shows why his form of comedy will be around for a long time.Wasted in this movie is Julia Roberts, as the ex-wife/girlfriend/pawn. Although her interaction with Clooney via lines and lines of snappy repartee is done well, she doesn't have much else to do but look good and make Garcia and Clooney jealous of each other.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Letter To Steven Soderbergh,"Dear Steven,Please quit putting Julia Roberts in all your movies. She's not THAT great. I realize she is the most famous movie star in the world and the studios love her bankability.....but. You know better. Come on......she was not right for the Oceans 11 role.  It should have been a woman with more grace, say...Catherine Zeta Jones.  Julia is a little too rough around the edges. She plays a hooker well and a single mom of three....a street walking cinderella, if you will.I love George Clooney. You have my permission to use him in every movie you do for the rest of your life. Okay. Maybe only roles he is best suited for. So far so good. You also could have cast Tom Cruise in that role. That would have been pretty good. He's smart, sexy and very likeable.Brad Pitt....egh. Not bad, not great either. Matt Damon....ROCKS. Andy Garcia....ROCKS. The Guy who played the card dealer rocked. Cheadle....what was up with the unnecessary accent? Affleck & the other young guy: HILARIOUS. Sometimes less is more. Good job with them. Elliott Gould: I love this guy! Carl Reiner: How cute.This movie was cute. Entertaining, predictable and cute.

"After a mindnumbingly boring first half, we switched off","Clearly, this one-star review is only about the first half of this movie. It is possible, though from our experience of that first half not likely, that the second half is dramatically better.However, what we (three people) saw in the first half was so mind-numbingly boring, with a bunch of lifeless, soulless, expressionless characters doing very little, very slowly, plus what they do is morally wrong, that we could not stand it anymore, and switched off, depressed.The movie-makers seem to think that just presenting the biggest stars of the day, particularly Pitt and Clooney, interacting with each other is enough to carry the movie. That might have just about flown in 2001, but more than two-decades later it's a non-starter.There's no character-development, and hardly any background given. Clooney and Pitt set out on their project for reasons that are never made clear, so we have no idea why we have to sympathize with them, rather than wanting the police to come in and arrest everyone else involved.The part of the movie that we saw seems to be entirely in love with the actors in it, and itself, and glamorous Las Vegas kitsch, in a way that's a total turnoff. Apart from that the characters are lifeless, the editing is all at the same pace, and barely anything happens. We simply could not get past the smug, borefest that was the first half.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

7 on a scale of 10,"I went into this movie expecting it to be great. It wasn't even close to great. Other than the fact that it had one of the most recognizable casts in history and the fact that it was very slick, it lacked quite a bit. As a ""theft"" movie, it really offered nothing new. The twist was interesting, but not one of those things where you hear yourself say, ""wow"".I like this type of movie and I like the actors, so I don't feel cheated. A 7 is better than everything below it! Nevertheless, the chemistry was notably lacking in my opinion. Also, since I was miserably assaulted by TRAFFIC not all that long ago, any movie made my Soderbergh will, at least for awhile, have the Soderbergh stench.If you are interested only in movies that have even the slightest amount of believability, don't bother watching this one.

""'Suicidal?', 'Only in the mornings.'""; ""Don't turn up in Newport Beach trying to by a 100,000 dollar car."" And one other time, but I can't remember when that was.  The Newport Beach line is classic, a sly reference to the kidnapping a few years ago of the former Bellagio owner's daughter, wherein they paid the ransom, but the kidnappers got caught in So. Cal., trying to buy a Ferrari for cash.  This line flew way over the heads of the audience in the showing I saw.  And damn we were in Reno, Nevada where the kidnapping made pretty big news.  But then the audience was laughing and having a good ole time thoughout the rest of this movie.  Both these facts lead me to believe that the audience was lobotomized.It's amazing in a movie with so many actors having tremendous on-screen chemistry, that none of it shows here.  The chemistry of this movie is nil, assign a number from 1-10 to whichever actor in this film, epitomizes charisma and chemistry for you, then divide that number by 11.

You can't take your eyes off the screen,"Directed by Steven Soderbergh, this brilliant movie rates 10 out of 10 on the celeb-o-meter. With the gorgeous George Clooney (Danny Ocean)joined by the equally handsome Brad Pitt (Rusty Ryan) it appears this film can do no wrong. The central plot of the movie revolves around Danny's impossible plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos, conveniently owned by Terry Benedict, his ex-wife's (Julia Roberts) new man. The script is full of witty and slick dialogue, providing plenty of comedy moments, notably between Pitt and Clooney. However, the enjoyment of the film is let down by Don Cheadle's dodgy cockney accent as Basher. You cannot take your eyes off the screen for a moment- not only because of the males but the plot is very complex and you may leave the cinema wondering what just happened in the last two hours. The soundtrack is one of the best film soundtracks I have heard and full credit should be given to composer David Holmes.

The music is also exciting as it lacks almost any vocal parts. Its just a lot of instrumental pieces that really propel the movie to another level of excitement. Watching the thieves plan and carry out the robbery was captivating. This movie never had a dull moment, the action and the fun kept coming. Garcia is great as the owner of the casinos and plays his role so well that you come away cheering the group to rob him of all he's got.

Not exactly ""sex, lies, and videotape II,"" now, is it?The first ninety minutes of the film is very entertaining as Soderbergh returns to the verve that he had with ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey,"" with very good performances by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and a shocker from Bernie Mac.  The first half of the film is stylish and surprisingly believable, but then descends into what can be referred to irrationally as a remake of ""Entrapment"", complete with sporty silver suits, and laser beam sensors.

Forty Years On,"This is not a bad film  but neither is it particularly good. On the plus side, how pleasant to have a caper movie that doesn't involve guns, violence and multifarious `things exploding'. On the down side, however, if it is a caper then it really needs a bit more tension and suspense to engage our attention. The eleven crooks of the title are all OK guys (allowing that Don Cheadle obviously learnt his accent at the Dick Van Dyke School of Cockney). Wouldn't it have been so much more enjoyable if one of the eleven had been incompetent, or even better, a potential traitor in their midst? That really would have injected some tension. But the casino owner (Garcia) is not an OK guy so the outcome can be guessed without too much difficulty.Then it's all a matter of hi-tech skulduggery as the thieves plot to make their way into the casino vaults in an attempt to help themselves to a cool $160m. The plot has as many holes as a Swiss cheese. But who cares when the whole caper nearly grinds to a halt for want of a couple of AA batteries just after they've managed to black out the whole of Las Vegas.Many will see this film for no other reason than the star cast list  just like the original version of some 40 years ago. Most of the crew seem to be enjoying themselves and Elliot Gould steals every scene he's in. Julia Roberts wanders in and out, although quite why is anyone's guess. She looks lost and confused for much of the time. But then she does appear in the credits as `Introducing Julia Roberts' so maybe she's right to look perplexed by all that's going on around her.If you've nothing to better to do on a wet Wednesday in Wigan this would be a harmless and reasonably enjoyable way of whiling away a couple of hours. But if it's real excitement or suspense you're after don't bother. It ends on a worrying note  a potential sequel seems to be lined up. Let's hope it's another 40 years before it gets made. That way I, for one, won't give a damn, by then being in the great movie (rather than casino) vault in the sky.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Clooney and Soderbergh ""Steal"" Vegas Heist Film","""Ocean's Eleven"" is a uniquely Las Vegas movie. The lights, casinos, hotels, fountains, and televised boxing matches - all shot on location along the strip - will captivatingly resonate with anyone who has spent time in the Gambling Capital of the World.Sin City is inextricable from the film's plot as well. After being released from prison, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) plans a new heist to rob Vegas' three biggest casinos in a single hit. With the help of his former partner Rusty (Brad Pitt), Ocean puts together a team of eleven to infiltrate and empty the collective vault for the Bellagio, the Mirage, and the MGM Grand.The movie is an ensemble project if there ever was one. Today, the star-power would almost seem overwhelming as Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner and others join Clooney and Pitt for the heist. Matt Damon does not even show up until the film's near-thirty minute mark, playing no more than a tertiary protagonist to complete the titular eleven.Outside of the heist team, Andy Garcia plays the cold, calculated owner of the three casinos. Non-coincidentally, his character is romancing Ocean's ex-wife, played by Julia Roberts. This dynamic feels a little forced, but it effectively adds a hefty dose of humanity to Clooney's devious character.While all of the stars deliver quality performances throughout the film, Clooney undeniably steals the show. Danny Ocean is the textbook definition of a smooth criminal, and Clooney plays the part with such confidence and charm that we both empathize with him and feel his persuasive influence, even as he leads others into perilous situations.Based off of a 1960s movie of the same title and plot, ""Ocean's Eleven"" casts Clooney as a character originally portrayed by Frank Sinatra. Such shoes appear near-impossible to fill, but Clooney manages to fit them with seeming effortlessness. He makes the character his own, but doesn't do so by deviating from Sanatra's old-school masculine suaveness. Instead, he actually manages to polish these traits with added likability, refining the archetype for modern audiences.Star power aside, though, this movie does not take gutless shelter under its rock star cast. The reason why ""Ocean's"" succeeds while other ensemble films fail is because of its smart story. Although there's not enough time to get intimate with all eleven members of the team, no character lacks an identity. Meanwhile, the narrative is complex, suspenseful, and twisty - especially towards the end.Simultaneously, whatever the plot lacks, director Steven Soderbergh makes up for it in style. He clearly gets the best out of his cast, ensuring the characters retain good humor even in the diciest of circumstances. This is in large part thanks to the clever, perfectly timed editing from Stephen Mirrione, who won an Oscar for his pervious work with Soderbergh on ""Traffic.""Under the pseudonym Peter Andrews, Soderbergh also serves as cinematographer. He captures the lavishness of Vegas with the appropriate amount of glamour, but never loses a sense of reality. Once again, it is a Vegas that anyone who's been there can recognize, and the film itself plays like a high-stakes game of chance. Until the end, the audience never really knows who has the best hand; everyone wears their poker faces with a smile and the pot only grows up through the final minute.Like most movies with a major twist, ""Ocean's Eleven"" might not be as stunning the second time around. Nevertheless, it's a bona fide classic in the heist genre, and Soderbergh and Clooney shine so brightly that a rewatch, though not as impactful, could still be quite engaging.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A stylish remake of a 60's classic,"After directing heavy dramas like TRAFFIC (which won him an Oscar) and ERIN BROCKOVICH, Steven Soderbergh decided to lighten up a little with this delightful remake of the 1960 rat pack classic. George Clooney steps into Frank Sinatra's shoes as Danny Ocean, the ex-con who gets together with a large crew of cronies to rob three Las Vegas Casinos owned by a Las Vegas bigwig (Andy Garcia) who is now dating Danny's ex-wife (Julia Roberts). The screenplay is a little on the complex side and sometimes it's a little hard to keep track of what Danny and his crew are doing, but the film is so great to look at and the cast appears to be having so much fun, you really just let little plotting devices slide and just go with it. Clooney has never appeared so smooth and slick on screen and is backed by a great cast including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Elliott Gould, and in a casting stroke of genius as a veteran con man, comic legend Carl Reiner.

Caper Movie.,"Basically this was a caper movie.  A bunch of professionals go against overwhelming odds to rob a impregnable target.  It wasn't bad.  The movie managed to keep me entertained throughout.  I found the 2 lead's, Clooney and Pitt, egos distasteful and the lead female role was terribly miscast. Julia Roberts was skinny and sullen and not at all the beautiful object of desire as referred to in the movie.  I found myself repeating ""Hey Collegen Man"" whenever she appeared on screen.  Don't you think something is wrong when you have to be told through the script that the person coming on screen is supposed to be beautiful.  Shouldn't the appearance of the actress say it.  Some of the female extras were much better looking.  Many of the supporting cast were fun to watch and the plot twists were, though expected, entertaining.

Everything goes smooth, nothing fails, and they get the money. Although a bit clever, it feels like the original parts are stolen from movies I have yet to see.

"Its not very often that a remake of a movie improves on the original, but Oscar winning director Steven Soderberghs updated version of ""Oceans Eleven"" is far more enjoyable than the 196","The twenty first century version may not feature the epitomisers of sharply dressed cool that were Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack  Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop  but it does feature some of the biggest movie stars in the world today including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon.Clooney steps into Sinatras shoes as Danny Ocean, a brilliant con artist who decides after his release from Prison to put together a small team  the ""Oceans Eleven"" of the title  to undertake a robbery on a scale no one else has ever attempted; stealing $150M from the underground vault of three of Las Vegas biggest Casinos. The elaborate plan involves a series of clever deceptions, most of which are refreshingly not signposted to the audience in advance. Although that means that youre never quite sure what will happen next as the elaborate robbery and its many attendant scams unfold, the supreme confidence of Clooney and his team means you never really doubt that they wont succeed. However, perhaps surprisingly, this doesnt take from your enjoyment of the film. It has an eminently watchable cast, with Clooney and Pitt in particular creating an onscreen chemistry reminiscent of Paul Newman and Robert Redford in ""The Sting."" Only Don Cheadle lets the side down with a frankly awful supposedly cockney accent and terrible dialogue as an English munitions expert.

I didn't care that ""Rumble in the Bronx"" had no plot, or that Arnold Schwartenegger can't act. If stuff blows up, I'm happy. And I'm not sophisticated enough to appreciate dramas.But -- I do appreciate an intelligent plot or characterization that does something original, makes me think, and when stuff blows up there had better be some good tension and great action.""Ocean's Eleven"" is a straightforward heist flick without much of the above. It's not exactly bad (like ""The Score"" which I found offensively boring compared to its promos), but just uninspiring. The all-star cast does nothing to lift this impression.Who should see this film:-- action buffs who have nothing better to do on a rainy day,and haven't formed false expectations from the all-star billing-- I can't think of anyone else. Arty types definitely stay away.he film is not a comedy, and unless you've got quite a seriouscrush on one of the stars, I would not go just to see them.I'll give Ocean's Eleven a respectable but not eye-opening 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Pure, Top Class Entertainment!","Wanna watch a movie which isn't particularly demanding, but not a shallow, no-brains blockbuster either? Then try Ocean's Eleven. It's a witty and stylish crime comedy whose purpose is solely to entertain for a couple of hours. And entertain it does.As the title suggests, the film has 11 protagonists: they're all con-men, and they're uniting for the biggest heist in history. The target? The Bellagio, a huge Las Vegas casino. The motive? None in particular, except perhaps the fact that the casino's owner, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), is dating Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts), who just happens to be team-leader Danny's (George Clooney) ex-wife. The fun can begin...The movie is a remake of a '60s Rat Pack flick, but you don't need to have seen that film, or even heard of it. Just think of the 2001 Ocean's Eleven as an ordinary action comedy, and you'll still have a great time.The screenplay has a vital role in this movie's success: the plot is expertly constructed, so that it will be captivating but not too complex, and Steven Soderbergh brings it to the screen with brilliance and elegance.But what really makes this film special is the cast: every single actor is absolutely comfortable with the various roles, and even though the focus is on some people (Clooney, Garcia, Roberts, plus Brad Pitt and Matt Damon), the other members of the ensemble (including Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould) have their chance to shine too. I was particularly impressed by Garcia's performance, which somehow reminded me of his unforgettable Godfather character (""Congratulations. You're a dead man."").Highly recommended. It won't annoy you for a second.8,5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining,"The casting coup, though not quite matching up to K3G, would still draw big crowds. Hopping onto the bandwagon is Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich), the flavour of the year 2000.The movie is a re-make of a 1960s one with same name, starring the 'Ratpack' led by Frank Sinatra. In short, the story deals with eleven men joining hands to loot three casinos in Las Vegas (where else?). The plot and cast arousing a good deal of interest, Soderbergh wouldn't need to worry about marketing.After an initial good pace, the movie slightly slows down and then picks up steam in the second half. The planning and execution of the robbery are impressive, with some surprises and subtle humour packed in. Some glaring loop-holes and cliches in the screenplay become forgivable.Clooney strides his part like a king, while Pitt is stylish. The rest are adequate in their small roles. Soderbergh maintains his trademark slick and realistic narration, aided by intelligent editing.Overall, an enjoyable movie, enhanced by the presence of big stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great Movie Almost Spoilt by Silly Cockney Accent,"I am sure we all remember the travesty of Dick Van Dyke's attempt at a cockney accent in Mary Poppins? It seems that Don Cheadle went to the same school of acting and continually confused an Australian accent with cockney. Why on earth bother, and why did they not employ a real Londoner (cockneys very hard to find now) who would at least be credible? I know this film is over 10 years old and maybe things have improved, but just needed to vent my spleen. The movie is however very watchable and apart from the aforementioned, there are good performances by allNeed another few lines, so only reason watching now this is that we just came back from Las Vegas and spent a happy evening at the Bellagio.

Over-rated Big Time,"This movie is about a punk ex-con who is bitter about losing his girlfriend to someone more successful than himself.I personally didn't care for anyone of the characters.  Carl Reiner was the best of the lot.  They were way too bland and because there were so many involved in the heist they didn't have enough time to develop the characters.I expected more.  There was hardly any action or suspense.  Basically a dialogue movie.  And the only dialogue was ""are you in?""  ZZZZZZZZZ. Did any of you think for one second the plan would fail?  Personally I wished it did.  Clooney's character was a punk.  Get over it you are a loser ex-con and lost your girlfriend to someone who was more successful than you.3000 Miles to Graceland was a similar movie that didn't get the positive reviews this movie got and was far more intense and action packed.  The performances were better too.  NO ONE can say that Clooney was better than Costner.  NO ONE.  This movie got great reviews because of two things:  an excellent cast and Soderberg the director.  In my opinion go rent 3000 Miles to Graceland if you can take a lot of violence and foul language (the only reason for poor reviews).",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Soderbergh's own razzle dazzle,"A movie with suave undeniability, Steven Soderbergh's 2001 'Ocean's Eleven' remake of the 1960 Frank Sinatra film is nothing but cool. It's not, however, Soderbergh's most advanced film, in terms of story. But the film is unquestionably entertaining in many segments, and the great cast, headed by faces like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts and more, do highlight the otherwise entertaining but emotionally hollow Soderbergh effort, not achieving the best of his so often brilliant complexities. It's more of an example of style over substance, except the substance, this time, is present. It isn't a great movie: entertaining it sure is though.The film follows Danny Ocean (George Clooney, looking as suave as ever) as him and his ten accomplices (Ocean's Eleven) make a plan to rob three high ranking casinos simultaneously at the same time.Soderbergh is clearly being flashy here, and it works tremendously. His cast is excellent, the screenplay is good, and the directing style is fun. Heist movies are always fun, I think, and 'Ocean's Eleven' makes the original proud.If you like heists, robberies, and glamor in general, this is a film to see.Ocean's Eleven (2001)3 STARS (OUT OF 4)Directed by Steven SoderberghScreenplay by Ted GriffinStarring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt DamonRated PG-13116 minutes.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

There are things in this film that don't occur in low budget films with a crap cast, direction and writers.First of all an EMP (""The Pinch"") would not just wipe the city out of power it would cut out pretty much every different electronical device. I mean cellphones, computers slot machines. etc. etc. The only way it could be saved is if it was switched off! Most importantly the robbery couldn't be viewed from inside Benedicts office! How do the flyer's end up in the vault? I mean the little Chinese guy can't have snuck them in in his pants could he? I admit that I'm not the only person to have noticed this because on the DVD Steven Soderbergh states that he has no idea how they got there.Furthermore, the casino manager is supposed to be with Sol taking his briefcase into the vault and escorting Frank out of the building at the same time!

Cool Cast + Complex Heist = Fun Flick,"No matter how many times I watch this movie, it never gets old. Steven Soderbergh has remade a classic and updated the style for the twentieth century. The movie centers on freshly-paroled Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his plot to rob three Las Vegas casinos in one night. The movie grabbed me at the first scene and I was entertained until the end. The two components that make this movie what it is are the spectacular cast and the intricate heist plan.For a movie with thirteen characters, Soderbergh and screenwriter Ted Griffin did a great job of giving each enough screen-time and personality to make them each interesting. Clooney and Brad Pitt are charismatic as usual in their roles as the heist's ringleader and primary accomplice. Andy Garcia is cold and calculating as the owner of the targeted casinos. Though, some of the best performances come out of the supporting cast. A lot of the movie's best scenes feature Bernie Mac, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and Elliot Gould. Julia Roberts is a bit under-used in her role as Tess, Danny's ex-wife, but makes for a pleasant distraction. Playing just as large a role as any person in this film is the setting, Las Vegas. We are treated to great visuals of Vegas and it gives the movie a grander, flashier vibe.The heist in this movie is definitely complex, and there are still parts I'm not too clear on. I also felt that they got a little too high-tech during the vault break-in (i.e. the little ""knock-out"" disc and the getaway van). Other than a couple hiccups, the heist was fun to watch build up and come to fruition. Soderbergh did a great job revealing little details throughout that seem insignificant until you see the end result.Steven Soderbergh's remake of a classic caper makes a great popcorn flick. It's got sharp humor, great performances, and an intelligent design that almost makes you think, ""That just might work..."". There may be a couple plot holes but that never slows the movie down. So, check this out if you haven't already...and keep an eye out for the cocktail waitress that gets clothes-lined during the chaos. It's probably one of the funniest images in the whole thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Terrific - Thrilling and Funny,"Soderbergh brings together a brilliant set of actors in this remake of the Sinatra classic. Filmed on location, any Vegas fan will fall in love with the ""action"" that's happening off the blackjack and craps tables. Danny Ocean (Clooney) is a criminal (and a liar, ha ha) who's just been released from jail. He dreams up a convoluted scheme to take down 3 of Vegas' largest casinos, all, incidentally, owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Danny needs money to fund the operation and a crew. Danny goes to Reuben Tishkoff, who'd love to see Terry go down. Next, Danny brings together the eclectic crew of criminals, from actors to bomb makers to a tiny Chinese gymnast.The plot is fairly solid with a traditional twist at the end reminiscent of many suspense murders / robberies but it's the chemistry of the cast that really makes the film sparkle.The subplot is Danny's romance of Tess, his ex, who is now with Terry.Will Danny's pursuit of Tess endanger the pursuit of cold hard cash?",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

FUN! FUN! FUN! most entertaining movie of 2001!,"Ocean's Eleven is a very entertaining movie, one that I have been looking forward to seeing for awhile, the movie has gone up and beyond my expectations, It is probaly the best of 2001 so far.. First of all the acting was just great in this film, George Cloony (Danny Ocean) gives us problay one of the best performanes of his career, Brad Pitt (Rusty) does a great job with his charecter as does Matt Damon, you can tell that both of them put in alot of time trying to perfect there perfomances... Oceans Eleven tells the story of Daniel Ocean just released from prison, who set's up a casino hiest, 3 casino's in one night, impossible? maybe but with the help of his Right-Hand man (Brad Pitt) he figures out every detail of every casino and sets up a team of 11 men to try to pull it off. The story is great, no visible plot holes, no scenes that could of been left out, and no cliches involved. The movie is probaly the best hiest film ever made. Steve Soderbergh has out done himself here, giving us the most entertaining movie of the year. He does a fantastic job capturing the beauty behind Las Vegas, and the overhead shots of the city or some of the best I have ever seen. The only thing that really got to me though is Don Cheadle's irish/british acsent it gets annoying real fast, but that is one thing I can easily forgive and forget, and overall Ocean's Eleven is the most entertaining movie in years. I truly recommend this film to anybody that love's film making at it's best, and acting at it's best.... This is by far the BEST movie of the year (Next to Lord Of The Rings) it's so much fun to watch, It's not an easy task for movie to receive a 10 from because I am very STRICT with my rating system, but this and LOTR were the one's that captured me the most therefore they both receive a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great film.The greatest thing about this film is that it is so cleverly written. It never bores you and allows you to live the fantasy of pulling the biggest steal in history. To think that they are actually going to do what they do in the movie is just outrageous, but they make you believe it is so possible. Brad Pitt and George Clooney make that happen.

Thief who robs thief,"This is maybe the best hold-up movie I've ever seen. The plot including the hold-up planning, is not very detailed to avoid holes, feeble points and illogical situations.

The acting is excellent and serves the plot very well. And last but not least there is a moving romantic touch concerning the relationship between the chief crook and his ex-wife now dating the owner of the held-up casino. We finish to sympathize with the crooks and consider the owner of the casino the villain.  As a Portuguese proverb says: a thief who robs a thief has a 100 years pardon.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of my Favorite Heist Movies,"I really liked this movie. I've figured out that I love heist movies recently, so my expectations for this were really high. As you know the outcome was me really liking it. It had good characters, a good story line rapped around the heist of the casino, and awesome, intense parts of the movie. It was very enjoyable, but I was starting to doubt it at the beginning...For almost an hour the movie, was very slow, and I didn't like that. It actually bored me for a while. I understood that it was a buildup to the big casino-robbing scene, but I still thing they could have done it better. Part of the first hour was the main characters getting some people to help them rob the casino. That was of it was a little entertaining, but still kind of boring. At the beginning of the movie, it kind of illustrated why Ocean wanted to rob the casinos, and that was interesting. I'm glad that they did that. But, all in all, the first half of the movie was pretty boring, so the second half really had to make up for that. And... It did.The second half was pretty much just awesome. Almost all of it was the casino-robbing scene and the scenes where they practiced for it. Even the scenes where they practiced for it were pretty cool and interesting. You figure out why Ocean decides to use those people. And they really do practice for it in those scenes. They make sure they'll get it right. Now for the casino-robbing part. The first about 10 minutes of it were interesting, but I think could have been a little better. At that point I had no idea what the rest of the movie would be like. It could have started to be really bad, but it could have gone to be awesome. It went to be awesome. I loved the casino-robbing scene after the first 10 minutes. Even though the first 10 minutes had some cool tricks that Ocean and his people used to get past things, the rest of it was completely awesome. I loved what they did at the end to finish robbing the casino, but before that...There were several clever tricks they used, even more clever than the first few tricks, and even some things went wrong. I don't want to talk about the ending too much, but at the end there's one of the coolest and most intense twist at the end that takes brain power to understand. So 8/10 in my rating system means I really liked the movie. I thought it was really good.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

To be fair, the second half of the film picks up some steam and Soderbergh has some great moments towards the end of the film (and Thank God he didn't carry on the actual end of the film beyond its natural conclusion - too much, as has been the case lately in Hollywood).

"Joyful Ride, But A View Bumps","I can confidently say that ""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of my favorite movies of the year.  This movie's heist and suspense made it a gem of 2001.  The humor was at an appropriate level for this film and was done with skill and success.  The great acting by Cloony, Pitt, and Garcia is a thing to remember.  But this movie did have its flaws, the major one being Julia Roberts.  I give a lot of credit to Julia Roberts for ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Pretty Woman"", but she is a hit-and-miss actress, and she scored a big miss in ""Ocean's.""  Her presence in every scene was a unwanted one, not because the character was bad, but that she wasn't at her ""Erin"" best.  The relationship between George and Julia also added to the problem.  The one thing I could not see between them is the spark.  That is what makes a great onscreen relationship, i.e. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in ""Sleepless in Seattle"".  Cloony and Roberts do not belong together and this was not their mistake, but their director's.  I have given credit to Steven Soderbergh on his past two movies ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" for the great casting and the superb acting.  But his remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" lacked those tow elements in Roberts and her performance with Cloony.  Even though this was an unnecessary element to an already full to capacity film, ""Ocean's Eleven"" still turns out to be one of my favorite movies of this lack-luster year.

One of the best heist film there is,"Ocean's Eleven is a remake of a Rat Pack 1960 movie of the same name that starred Frank Sinatra. This movie is just graceful, that is the word. It features one of the greatest ensemble cast that you can find and having them come together for one purpose and one purpose only to take down a casino. And the merging of these talents was well done by Steven Soderbergh, who was the director and cinematographer of the movie.Daniel Ocean and his crew made robbing a casino look easy, since all you need is some background cash and a crew of different people with unique skills. If you have these people in your back pocket then you, ""the robber"" are game enough to take down anybody.Steven Soderbergh and Clooney came together with the aim of putting this film together and after the wonderful display of acting from all the cast, let's not forget Julia Robert and Andy Garcia were also in this movie, the movie was well received and led to a trilogy.The movie is about Danny Ocean (George Clooney), who just got out of jail and the first thing on his mind is to perform the perfect steal. After Danny got out he started to recruit the team members for his heist, they were:In order of recruitment: 1. George Clooney as Danny Ocean 2. Bernie Mac as Frank Catton 3. Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan 4. lliott Gould as Reuben Tishkoff 5. Casey Affleck as Virgil Malloy 6. Scott Caan as Turk Malloy 7. Eddie Jemison as Livingston Dell 8. Don Cheadle as Basher Tarr 9. Shaobo Qin as ""The Amazing"" Yen 10. Carl Reiner as Saul Bloom 11. Matt Damon as Linus CaldwellThe job looked impossible but Danny believed they could do it, so together they formed the master plan to take on the Bellagio, The Mirage, and the MGM Grand casinos, these casinos were owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).There is also a catch to this heist; Danny's Ex-Wife (Julia Roberts) is now going out with Benedict.This movie was extremely popular and the movie grew from just a fun movie to watch, to having a huge fan base that led to the release of two other Ocean crew movies that also had the same cast from here and featured new popular cast. This movie cost nothing less than $85 million to make, due majorly to the cast, but it made its money back and over in the box office and it stands as the best of all the three in the franchise.My favorite take from the movie is that 50% of the time when Brad Pitt is on screen he is eating something.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Oceans Twelve,"I really really really enjoyed this film. Ok, its not profoundly moving....not even profoundly well made. It is, however, brilliantly paced. Forget all that Mission Impossible split second precision. Forget the high tech hullaballo of the James Bond films. This film nods graciously in those directions ...and takes on a direction entirely of its own. I'd love to say the pace is ""gentlemanly"" ...but that may point the way of ...yuk ...Evelyn Waugh novels and scones with clotted cream. George Clooney is slick ..yet not super slick. The odd wart manages to come up above the surface. Brad Pitt finally manages to look vaguely his 37 years ...which may not be such a bad thing. Clearly, casino lighting is to be avoided after 35. The music is brilliant. Predominantly kitsch lounge music. Good enough for me to go out and buy the CD. The inspiration is clearly the brat pack ...plenty of Frank, Sammy and Dino ..and ..err whoever else was there at the time. But slickly packaged. The Low Tech era is here .

"Cool, slick and entertaining","This is a heist movie that is slick, cool and entertaining. And doesn't rely on the grittiness of the heist or the violence. But the clever and intricate way the team works together to pull off the heist. Although some parts don't seem plausible, it doesn't get to the point where it gets dumb and irritating to watch. The movie is directed by Steven Soderbergh which is why some top well known actors and actress at that time decided to be part of this movie. It may seem like it just has top actors and actresses combined to make a movie. But this movie is actually cleverly constructed with each character playing a part and crucial to the story. Well at least for a movie that has over a dozen characters in a time frame of around 2 hours. The team for the heist where they are planning to steal from not 1 but 3 casinos. Is composed of Danny Ocean who is the leader aka The Idea Man. Rusty Ryan aka The Pro or Danny's right hand man played by Brad Pitt. He sort of reminded me of Tyler Durden in this, well Tyler Durden who is trying to steal from casinos and not just fat to make soap out of. And these two are the two cool guys of the bunch. The rookie or the pick pocket guy is played by Matt Damon. And these three are like the main characters of the bunch since they are also the most well known actors on the team. The team is also composed of The Getaway, The Basher, The Bankroll, Eye in the Sky, Inside Man, Grease Man, and The High Roller. And than there is The Target, the man they are trying to steal from who is played by Andy Garcia. He plays a character named Terry Benedict, who runs the three casinos and is very good at what he does. And is one of the main conflict when it comes to pulling off the heist. I think it's kinda cool for a guy that is passionate about his job and there really isn't anything that makes him the bad guy. Besides him appearing and working like a machine. But he has Danny's wife who she is with on her own freewill and that woman is played by Julia Roberts. Yeah she was a popular actress at that time but she just didn't seem to fit this role well. Maybe it's just me since I never really found her attractive. And a really attractive woman was needed for this role and I rarely say this. But some parts I just couldn't buy into because of her. Overall this is a well crafted and slick heist movie that has some cool dialogues and is worth checking out.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's okay,"""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) is a stylish heist film that combines a stellar ensemble cast with clever plot twists and slick direction from Steven Soderbergh. George Clooney leads a charismatic crew of con artists, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts, as they plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously. The film is a masterclass in entertainment, blending humor, suspense, and sophistication seamlessly. Clooney's effortlessly cool demeanor, Pitt's laid-back charm, and Damon's youthful exuberance create a dynamic on-screen chemistry that keeps viewers engaged from start to finish. Soderbergh's direction is sharp and stylish, making every scene visually engaging. The script, written by Ted Griffin, is clever and full of witty dialogue, while the soundtrack adds to the film's overall atmosphere. With its twisty plot and unforgettable characters, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a timeless caper that continues to delight audiences with each viewing. It's no wonder this film has become a modern classic in the heist genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The film that beats the original yet stays true to the theme.,"Ocean's 11 is a film that truley beats the Original with Frank Sinatra, Dean martin and Sammy Davis Jr. Although Soderberg out does himself with this film, and totally changes almost everything about the story (from the Original) he does stay true to the original theme and overall feeling of the picture. Its a fantastic film with a great plot. The action is wonderful, the comic timing is impeccable, and the acting and scenery is absolutely superb! I highly recommend seeing this film.

This movie is fun!,"While it's true that this film is not likely to be nominated for an Oscar, who cares. Not only is the premise--knocking off three Las Vegas casinos--a great escapist story line; but more importantly, the story telling is interesting. The pace does slow a bit after all the characters are introduced, but it picks up again rather quickly, and the second half of the movie--planning and executing the heist--is just plain fun. Julia Roberts fans are likely to be disappointed--first, because there wasn't more of her, and second, because she had only one good line in the whole film. On the other hand, ""mature"" movie-goers will probably get a kick seeing some faces they haven't seen for awhile (Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner). Bottom line: Not as exciting as the last two minutes of a Chicago Bears game this season, but definitely worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"There's nothing remarkable here, but Ocean's Eleven is very entertaining nonetheless.","In this eagerly awaited, star-studded remake of the 60s rat-pack crime-caper of the same name, Soderbergh manages to combine his dry sense of wit, beautifully stilized camerawork and a few enjoyable performances in a very pleasant way. Admittedly, Soderbergh ignores the fact that his plot doesn't really hold together at times, also the insertion of various catchy one-liners feels fabricated and forced on a few occasions, but all things considered there's a lot of fun to be had here if you don't take it all too seriously as some critics have. Granted, Ocean's Eleven doesn't tacklesocial problematics (nor did Soderbergh aim to in the first place of course)  and it certainly isn't a masterpiece but it creates a very uncomplicated, laid-back vibe that is really enjoyable most of the time. This must be largely accredited to the dialogue which is very witty most of the time. The actors all seem very at ease and it is easy to sympathise with these charming crooks, a special notice goes to Versace-clad ex-casino bigshot Elliot Gould. Which leaves for a few minor mishaps which I will address briefly. First of all the character of Julia Roberts isn't very essential to the plot, nor is her appearance special in any way. Therefore it's a shame her storyline with George Clooney takes up so much time in the later part of the story, which concludes in an unnecessarily predictable and well rounded ending. I believe a cameo-appearance would have been more than enough and I'm afraid the scribes were forced to squeeze Roberts into the story. Secondly there is very little character-development or motivation for that matter. Also, no effort is taken to bring any nuance to the 'villain'-character of Andy Garcia, whereas it would have been more interesting to see any redeeming traits in his personality. Garcia delivers a very unremarkable performance that won't raise any eyebrows. Just don't expect Ocean's Eleven to change cinematic landscape for the years to come and you will be fine after two hours well spent.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Editing and soundtrack were superb. Brad Pitt is really picking his roles well - and here he bounces off Clooney brilliantly.

I haven't seen the original so am glad to say I didn't suffer the problem of comparisons through this film and enjoyed it for what it was. The only criticism I have is that the plot does get a tad tangled in the climax and I would imagine that you might need a second viewing to pick up on everything...having said that - I'd be happy to watch this film a few times anyway.

11 Reason to See Ocean's 11,"1. Its Funny.  The banter between the characters is sometimes labored at being clever and cool - a fallout from Pulp Fiction.  Some of the discusion is funny and the quirks and talents of its players will bring a smile to your face from time to time.2. Brad Pitt.  The ever-eating, sharply dressed brain of the outfit is played well by Pitt, who serves up a couple of laughs and cool handed tricks to make ladies eyes dilate.3. Clever twists.  The typical moviegoer will applaud the antics and mastery of these elite thieves, and just when we think we have everything figured out, there is one more trick to make us applaud again.4. George Clooney.  His dry and cool maner is great in his role as the lead idea man.  His suave moves and slick lines are enough to win back a reluctant ex-love-interest, and fool the tough alter-ego alpha male.5. Cameos.  There are more than a few cameos of A and B list movie stars who appear in small supporting scenes in the film.  Most of them however, are probably just happy to say that they were in a movie with Pitt, Clooney and Roberts.6. Matt Damon.  A chameleon of an actor who joins Ocean's crew as a young inexperienced, yet talented con artist and spy.  Damon brings a nice prescence of awkward overconfidence to the all-cool cast of experienced thieves.7. The Music.  The bright lights of Vegas would be nothing without the big sounds and shows of lounge singers and classic vocalists.  The soundtrack mixes these old school showstoping numbers, with exciting, tense classical music for the more intense robbery scenes.8. The clothes.  Almost every player in this movie is a picture out of GQ or Cosmopolitan magazine.  Its a wonder if designers lined up at Steven Sodderberg's door begging him to let his glorious cast wear their latest chinos and hipcat suits.9. The gadgets.  New technology gives way to more ingenious and exciting ways to illustrate a hiest.  In the way that James Bond and Mission Impossible uped the anti with cool gadgets, Oceans 11 finds ways to move the plot along by introducing cutting edge technology.10. Andy Garcia.  Where has he been all this time?  Well, he's here now and does a fine job being the film's lead antagonist.  A greedy casino boss with a nose for scams and a few dollars for his main squeeze, Garcia is great as the headstrong guy you love to hate.11. Steven Sodderberg.  Coming off is last film - the masterpiece Traffic - Sodderberg summoned Hollywood's best and most popular actors to recreate the Rat Pack from the 1960's.  He keeps the story moving along, twisting it to a predictable outcome.  Gee, what did you think was going to happen?You know what you are going to get, but it's an enjoyable meal none-the-less.  Julia Roberts is in the film also.  She is good, but had too small a role to be a reason to see it. Final Rating = 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Extremely re-watchable,"One of the better action/comedies going around.The movie revolves around a couple of thieves (Clooney and Pitt) who conceive a brilliant idea of how to rob a casino of millions. Danny Ocean (Clooney) needs another 9 men though to pull this off (get it, Oceans 11) and goes about finding a group of specially skilled cons to help pull off his elaborate plan (great cast including Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac and Matt Damon).For the genre the action is fantastic, and there's no guns. The chemistry, thanks largely to the writing, between Danny and Tess (Julia Roberts), is excellent.

Well done fluff,"This remake of the Rat Pack original is about what you'd expect out of the material and director.  It possesses a good pace, isn't too indulgent and has a certain style to it.  That it's almost completely predictable is beside the point.With Pitt, Clooney and Garcia in this film, my wife couldn't have been happier.  The one with whom she's most enamored, Clooney, smirks a lot, can't act and isn't believable.  Luckily Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould and Brad Pitt CAN act, and along with Andy Garcia they put on quite a show.  Reiner, in particular, hits just the right note, and given that he was hired to replace Alan Arkin just days before they started shooting (Arkin had become unavailable due to illness), it's all the more impressive.  Gould, fitted with the perfect wardrobe, was born to play this role.  Years ago Pitt met the fork in his career path and chose ""actor"" over ""movie star"", and that choice is evident here.More could have been done with the screenplay, particularly the dialogue. It doesn't percolate the way you'd expect it to in a film like this.  Even so, the story telling is tight, and the editing paces the film just right. Soderbergh directs with a sense of style, particularly the post-caper seen in front of the waterfall which is a clever, if incongruous, way to let the actors take a bow.  Basically, this film is fluff, but it's well done fluff.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I found it a little self-indulgent as well.Overall, the best in the trilogy that shouldn't have been a trilogy at all.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Big stars having big fun,"It's all too rare that a film packed with big stars is any fun. When major studios put A-List, $20 million talent onscreen together, they don't want to take any chances on the movie- there's so much money at stake, the final product is boring, but safe. The good news about Ocean's Eleven is that a studio did not put these stars onscreen together- Steven Soderbergh did. Since making a big splash with his debut Sex, Lies, and Videotape in 1989, Soderbergh has earned the respect of actors with smart, classy, and sophisticated projects like Out Of Sight and The Limey. With the one-two punch of Erin Brockovich and Traffic in 2000, major studios are now willing to trust him with big budgets. However, the studio's bankroll didn't get all these names on the marquee- Soderbergh did, and he did it at a bargain.Soderbergh set out to make a fun, popcorn flick involving a casino heist, in the spirit of the Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack movie of 1960. The new Ocean's Eleven stars George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts. Clooney, with Pitt, scheme to steal $160 million from Andy Garcia's casino. They enlist ten con men and hustlers to make it happen. The Eleven of the title pull off the heist, Mission: Impossible style- no guns, no violence. Hardly anyone even gets their hair mussed. There are plenty of kinks in the plan as we go along- but are they kinks or a part of the plan we're unaware of?The great casting continues below the title, with Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould as old-school Vegas cronies looking for one last hand; Don Cheadle as the bomb expert, Bernie Mac as the inside man at the casino; plus Casey Affleck and Scott Caan as the bratty, feuding footsoldiers of the gang.Everyone took pay cuts to join in the fun, and it shows; the set must have felt like a class reunion as it seems everyone has worked together before. Soderbergh has directed Clooney, Roberts, and Cheadle before; Clooney worked with Cheadle in Out Of Sight; Affleck and Damon were in Good Will Hunting, and Gould is on Friends with Mrs. Brad Pitt.You'd think with a big cast and a fast-moving story, that there wouldn't be enough screen time for all the principals. With such a long list of stars, you might expect some bruised egos as some of the cast could get short shrift. However, Soderbergh does a nice job of giving everyone at least one scene to shine. For example, Cheadle (Traffic, Boogie Nights), in some ways, is barely in the movie. But he gets a few brief moments to be noticed which count for a lot.A few of the great moments: Pitt's first and last scenes begin with his character eating junk food. We just watch him eating nachos for 5-10 seconds. How he can look so cool and yet funny while eating nachos is beyond me. Clooney has a scene where he plays with his wedding band. His character is not aware he's doing it, but he fiddles with his ring finger while talking to his ex-wife, and it says more about his feelings that any dialogue can.I had some problems with the Roberts/Clooney relationship. Clooney played a similar role as a thief in Out Of Sight and squeezed out sexy sparks opposite Jennifer Lopez, including a pivotal scene at a secluded table in a dark restaurant. In Ocean's Eleven, Clooney and Roberts' big scenes take place in a similar setting, and suffer by comparison.Without giving too much away, suffice it to say her character is supposed to harbor a grudge against Clooney. She does unleash some sharp jabs in their snappy dialogue. However, we need more romantic magnetism underneath to develop her character arc.It's rare when all the pieces come together for a fun and exciting film these days. Hollywood seems to have forgotten that movies can be thrilling without gunplay, explosions, and car chases. We can only hope that the rest of Hollywood follows Soderbergh's example. This film is not genius, it's just first-class entertainment. On the whole, Ocean's Eleven will be the most fun you'll have at the movies this year.Rated PG-13 for language, and one brief scene with a strip show in the background (no nudity). Hardly any violence (a few punches are thrown); no gun violence. Hardly any smoking. Hardly sounds like a Vegas movie, does it?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

It is entertaining enough, very slick, with well-known actors who seem to have fun, but of course also rather shallow and predictable. Even most of the ""surprises"" are rather unsurprising to viewers who know the kind of calculated plot twists typical for such movies. Therefore I don't quite get the high praise received by ""Ocean's Eleven"" as some kind of outstanding and most original movie; these are not its qualities.

Okay I'll admit that there's are a few twists, but after the woman turns up then it very easy to see where the plot is going. However even with the lack of plot, director Steven Soderbergh manages to produces another great movie. One reason is the one liners, they're nearly all funny and there's something for everyone's taste, at times when thinking about the movie, it would do well as a stand up comedy act. Then there's the cast, WOW how much money went on the pay roll is my question (I could list them but there's no point). Everyone plays their part very well, there are no weak performances, although I have to point out Matt Damon for the best performance. Yes I think it's the fact of the cast and the humour in it that makes this film very good. This is another go and see movie, especially if you want a good night out with some fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Exhilarating, Delicious, Super-charged Fun","""Ocean's Eleven"" is the kind of light-hearted, enjoyable crime caper which becomes better, more enjoyable, and more intelligent upon multiple viewings. My initial overview of this film was that it was too much technicality and seriousness to be enjoyable and worthwhile. Now, having seen this film over and over again, I become bemused by its charisma, sophistication, and suave enterprise on a most exciting concept. The film plots parolee thief Daniel Ocean (Clooney) and ten of his selected ""instruments"" in the brilliant, if precarious scheme of robbing three prestigious Vegas casinos in the hopes of collecting on ""eight figures each"". Sounds enticing, yet how could such a scheme be executed, especially considering that nobody has ever succeeded in pulling it off? This film chronicles the endeavor and style of this cool, unerring gang to succeed in the impossible, to score magnificently, and to salvage certain losses (Ocean rebounding his wife, Tess, from the man he is determined to rob). The beauty and genius of this delightful, smart crime caper is its palatable premise (diverse characters working toward individual goals), its confident conviction (detailing every aspect and technicality of its theme), and its eventual denoument (which I can attest is the most consummate and rewarding conclusions in my knowledge of cinema). Every character shines, the script is smart and witty, and the style is more cool and suave than any scenario out of James Bond or Shaft. Glorious, triumphant execution of the most delicious of concepts. How cool can any film get? **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Didn't really engage my attention,"After seeing this movie, I thought, ""This guy directed Erin Brockovich?!? What HAPPENED??!!??""  With a cast like this, I thought that it would have to be good, but I came out of the theater with a greater liking for the original Rat Pack version.  I thought that this version just never seemed to get off the ground, or maybe I just didn't care if these people pulled off the job or not.  I did like Andy Garcia's performance, but it required not much more than looking dark and threatening.  Matt Damon was a big blah and the Cockney guy drove me nuts.  Who the heck is he?  He reminds me of the balloon pilot in The Mummy Returns and he drove me nuts too.  I was impressed by Brad Pitt, however.  I can't stand the guy in every movie I've seen him in, but in this he wasn't the brooding or smirking jerk that he usually is.  And for this George Clooney fan, I was disappointed that he didn't really make me get involved in the movie.  Oh, well.

Very Good PG-13 but....,"Very good comedy thriller movie that does not try to take itself seriously or try for any story depth.This movie was deliberately done in a PG-13 style which is ok BUT the story genre demands a grittier rated R style production.The acting was nothing intense at all as they seemed to just go on cruise control.Roberts showed a little more acting effort than the other main actors but it only made her seemed a little out of place.The last few scenes of the movie was also very messy.The movie producers really tried too hard to water this movie down a tag too much. This remake is definitely better than the wasted 1960 effort but I can only imagine if this newer version was done rated R style,with a little more depth and plot attention to detail in the mold of PULP FICTION or SNATCH.Still,if you are into Las Vegas setting comedies of are a big fan of any of the lead actors here and you don't mind your crime caper movies done in a PG-13 style,you will get your money's worth with this one........",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Depending on the plot,"A movie that just screams ""plot twist"" but the real trick was trying to find it.Oceans eleven is one of those films that is just crammed with Hollywood superstars, bound to success at the box office. The plot is what I would argue to be okay, but I sometimes get the feeling that the movie is one step ahead, leaving the viewer in the dust behind. Maybe this was an artistic choice, but it gave the movie a bit of trouble to connect to.The thing that was bugging me the most was probably the tone. Lines are presented with a nonchalant tone, and characters are not down to earth, giving almost nothing to find relatable.While Oceans11 was a start, I don't know if we needed eleven more movies after it. Sure, Ocean have some good characteristics, but trying to find a Cruise in an Ocean is like finding a frog in a pond.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Impossible.,"Bust out the popcorn and leave all of your realistic criticism at the door and be prepared for some good old-fashioned entertainment. We all know Soderbergh can make a very gritty and realistic film as we saw him do with Traffic, so it's a little hard to rip this movie for it's lack of realism since it's safe to say that it was never meant to be so.An ensemble cast with mostly decent actors definitely helps OE, although there are a few that I think we could've done without. Maybe it's just the fact that Julia Roberts makes me want to gag, or maybe it's the fact that Don Cheadle can't pull off a British accent that well, but something about the characters annoys me. Overall though, they're fairly decent but could've been a tad stronger. Andy Garcia and Brad Pitt are the definite standouts.The premise of the film itself, the scheme to rob three casinos simultaneously, is let's face it, completely impossible although entertaining. And some of the tools this crew uses are straight from James Bond's workshop and are very unlikely to be available to anyone. But hey, it's not trying to be realistic and really doesn't need to be. It's simply a fun popcorn caper that never expects the viewer to take it too seriously. The plot to the heist itself is fairly amusing and clever. Overall great entertainment even if not a great film. Don't expect too much, especially realism, and you won't feel disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Retro Meets Techno,"The original ""Ocean's Eleven"" starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack was a classic of coolness.  The remake starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and a host of others tries to shoot for something close to that.  The movie uses a retro cool jazz score, and has a lot of gimmicky camera shots (like the rear view of Clooney and Pitt as they drive).  And it was interesting to see new technology added to the story, bringing the 1960 original into the 21st century.  But, all in all, I must say the original was better.  It had a certain charm to it.  The remake was done adequately, but if not for names and premises, it just seems like a completely different movie altogether.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

However, common sense and past experience should have told me that there was no way sufficient time could be given to the development of the several characters without shifting emphasis from the plot; it seems that when a film bills this many well known, talented actors, the best for which one can hope is either a well developed plot or a well developed cast of characters--in this case we get neither.

The two fit like the last piece of a jigsaw puzzle. Everyone else plays their part to the T. Soderbergh has himself another gem. You cannot say enough about the cast though as they make the film.

I've never been a fan of George Cloony, but I'll admit that I liked him better in Oceans 11 than in anything else so far.  I usually like Brad Pitt, but his performance, along with that of Matt Damon's, was less than noteworthy.  Julia Roberts was entirely inappropriate for the supposedly-dazzling ""ex-wife"" role, as she was most definitely not dazzling.  The whole technical aspects of robbing the casinos were interesting, but not enough to support the entire film as much of it was contrived and unplausible.

attack of the heist movies,"Let me confess something straight away - I hate heist movies.  As my Dad is fond of pointing out, in real life people hate thieves - yet Hollywood insists on turning them into heroes, time and again!  I wonder why.  Could it be that Hollywood loves underdogs?  That can't be the case in ""Ocean's Eleven""; somehow I can't see Clooney, Pitt, Damon and co. ever qualifying as ""underdogs.""  They're rich pretty boys who want to steal some cash so they can become richer and prettier.  Yuck.Here's a few disturbing elements to chew on: we've got a full range of stereotypes on display here, from the Funny Asian Guy (defined exclusively by his physical ability) to the Angry Cockney Guy (defined exclusively by his accent and his anger!).  Julia Roberts, the only woman on display - and boy, is she ON DISPLAY - is defined exclusively through her relationships with men.  What, can't she have a subplot that doesn't involve romance?  No, of course not - she's a female character in boys' own rubbish.Still, somewhere in the depths of my cynical being, I am mildly entertained by these gaudy proceedings; some deeply-buried part of me enjoys watching the white collar crime antics of these People magazine celebrities.

A lot of times, there may simply be too many stars in a film to make it work. But despite all the big name actors in Ocean's Eleven, it works out well. All of the actors gave excellent performances, and it makes a big difference in this kind of film. In fact, the acting and characters are done so well that it's easy to root for the crooks in this film, rather than the ""good guys.""

Very good heist movie.,"George Clooney and Brad Pitt lead a fantastic cast in Ocean's Eleven. The plot is also very interesting and the movie and characters, even though there are a lot of them, develop rather nicely. My favorite character is probably Don Cheadle's though. He plays the role of reckless British explosives nut flawlessly. I thought there were a few plot holes but none that actually affected the critical plot points regarding the heist so they are easily overlooked. I think they could've spent more time on the actual heist/planning process but the movie would've probably been too long if they did.

The Heist of All Heists,"This is a very fun movie that could have been excellent without Julia Roberts dragging it down. Now, normally I am a fan of Ms. Roberts, but here she is miscast and her part is poorly written. Unfortunately, said poorly written part is meant to be the linchpin that holds the entire motivation and structure together. Her character is treated as a stunning beauty, but we all know that Roberts's appeal is not beauty but prettiness -- she is a nice girl, not a knockout, and that's why her beauty -- when it does shine forth -- is so startling. Roberts looks like a pretty girl who, when she smiles at you, shocks you with her sudden radiance. But her character is the kind of woman who Makes an Entrance, and it just doesn't work. Without either the looks or the dialogue, she creates a mushy center to a movie that needs to be sharp straight through.Still, the rest of the movie is diamond-edge sharp, the heist is entertaining, and the cast mainly sparkles. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A lifeless cash cow that could have been great,"Ocean's Eleven is a boring, smug, lifeless film.  The real shame is that it could have been oh so much better.  All the elements of a great film are there: intriguing premise, incredible cast, and an Oscar winning, stylistic director.  So what went wrong?  The premise really is never interesting as it seems.  The heist goes off so smoothly that the film never builds any tension whatsoever.  The bad guys are never as bad as they are made out to be and stealing from Vegas seems to be as easy as taking candy from a baby. The cast is all star, however they have all been better elsewhere or they aren't given much to do.  Clooney has played this role before in Out of Sight (a much better Soderberg film).  Brad Pitt is cool but he never adds much to the film other than a handsome set piece.  Andy Garcia is the much feared baddie who does nothing but turn the other cheek when his fortune is being robbed.  Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, and Elliot Gould are woefully misused as set dressing rather than full fledged characters.  The film would have been much better had it focused on these characters rather than Clooney and Pitt.  Julia Roberts' skeleton has a mere cameo role and really adds nothing to the picture.  That said, Ocean's Eleven is not a bad film.  It has a few moments of genuine cleverness and a couple of chuckles. But it could have been so much better.  Mamet's Heist, Richie's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, and Soderberg's own Out of Sight are much better at the robbery game.  I really hope this is a minor stumble in the career of Soderberg and it isn't the Oscar curse that is overtaking him.  We shall see.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
