A well developed movie for adults and kids,"Every so often I watch a film with limited enthusiasm, simply because I have time me to kill. On these occasions I sometimes stumble across a true delight and am pleasantly surprised...a film that maybe had ""mixed"" reviews or that received little attention upon its release. Megamind is such a film; a great work of animation and character development.The film should delight adults and children with enough in it to satisfy all tastes. There is also plenty of amusing and hilarious satire with regard to superhero movies and super villains.Many superheros and villains are often depicted as wholly good or wholly bad, having at best some traumatic event setting them on their inevitable and unchangeable course. This film actually highlights certain sources of inner turmoil and insecurities of the characters in a very entertaining way and develops the characters as they work these out.There's also plenty of rip roaring action on the way.Great stuff! Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Brilliant and Incredibly Underrated Superhero Satire That was Truly Ahead of its Time,"A faultless and incredibly charismatic little superhero film, Megamind may stand on the shoulders of other superhero flicks before its time, but it also provides such unique and creative differences that raise the bar higher than ever before. I have been a fan of Dreamworks Animation for a long time, I grew up watching it, and I always would prefer it to Disney flicks and other animated adventures that would come out throughout the years. Megamind is easily one of my favorite, and one of their most underrated films to date. Yes it relies on the Clark Kent vs Lex Luthor type of formula, as really most superhero films do, but it took a chance with its ambitious ideas and made it work so well, you can't help but forgive it. The film was largely overshadowed at the time by its animated competeter, Despicable Me which was a delightful surprise, but in my opinion no where near as close as smart and funny as this film. The film has such a great character with Megamind, who isn't just a bad guy, but someone who turns to bad to find a purpose- to feel fit in the world around him, even if it means being feared. The animation is fantastic and the voice work is tremendously on point, Will Ferrell (as he does with so many of his characters) brings so much life to Megamind- in a performance you will truly never forget. The soundtrack is fabulously done by veteran composer Hans Zimmer, and the script is incredibly sharp, with so many moments looking back upon that were truly ahead of its time. In the end, I feel we don't deserve a film like Megamind, but neverless we got it and it came with flair to spare. I love this film, and I encourage anyone who doubted its genius, to give it another try.My Rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Emotionally complex,"This film is about a villain who loses his sense of purpose after his enemy, the hero, dies in a battle.""Megamind"" tells the story of a wounded boy who turns villainous to build his identity. The plot continues to be emotionally complex throughout the whole plot, as he struggles with the lost of identity after the death of the superhero. ""Megamind"" is probably the most emotionally complex animation I have seen.There are also much for kids to enjoy. The film is exciting, with lots of superhero action and fighting. The characters are well designed but I don't see them as being very cuddly, which may not bode well to merchandise sales.",,Anonymous,Animation
Villain as hero,"The blue-skinned, bulbous-headed, shape-shifting, malapropism-spouting space-creature known as Megamind (Will Ferrell) prides himself on being the baddest bad guy around. His arch nemesis Metro Man (Brad Pitt), also a creature from beyond this world, is a squeaky-clean, universally beloved superhero who literally walks on water and keeps thwarting the plans Megamind has for ruling Metro City (which he mistakenly pronounces ""metrocity""). When Megamind, much to his own surprise actually, manages to do away with Metro Man in a contentious battle-to-the-death, he begins to realize that being a villain isn't all it's cracked up to be without a worthy hero to call an opponent. Thus, Megamind hatches a plot to clone another Metro Man figure out of some remnants of the dead hero's DNA. But Megamind gets more than he bargained for when his creation comes to life.Though ""Megamind, "" directed by Todd McGrath, has the distinction of being one of the only family-oriented animated films ever to feature a bad guy as its main character, the movie may be too cerebral and esoteric to completely enthrall children and too undisciplined and gimmicky to appeal all that much to adults. Still, the movie has a clean, sparkling look, filled with a whole host of futuristic devices in the foreground and stunning cityscapes in the background, and it moves fast enough to keep its audience focused on the screen for the duration. It also features the voice of Tina Fey as the Sweet Polly Purebred-type TV news reporter who is a constant bone of contention between Metro Man and Megamind - and Jonah Hill and Ben Stiller add their own vocal support in minor but key roles. And the script by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons contains an interesting subtext about the rewards and sacrifices that come with being both a hero and a villain, a subtext that brings an added dimension to the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Possibly The New Shrek!,"I don't remember the last time I enjoyed an animated movie this much! One reason being the gorgeous 3D animation-I mean...look at Minion's dome! I was gee-king inside and out on how detailed this movie is from the characters to the scenery. Every time I watch the movie, I always spot something new! Megamind shouldn't have been advertised as a full blown comedy, because this movie held plenty of deep lessons to be learned and so laughter was a little on the offside at times, but those tender moments were probably the best part of the movie! Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and especially David Cross impressed me with their voice acting talent!

A Fun Surprise,"The supervillain Megamind finally defeats his nemesis, the superhero Metro Man. But without a hero, he loses all purpose and must find new meaning to his life.Of the animated films in the last ten years, ""Megamind"" does not seem to get a lot of love. Which is a real shame. Because although it may be basically a Superman spoof, it is a very clever and very funny spoof. And with Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, it's hard to beat. (Jonah Hill could have been replaced.) Is it too late for a sequel? Because there really ought to be one, even if it seems that ""Despicable Me"" has the animated villain market covered.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I Love Megamind!!,"I tend to watch all the new animated movies that come out nowadays. It's simply amazing to watch each new advancement with each new movie. Megamind truly was enjoyable to watch, all the details and small touches made it a wonderful show. Just the right amount of humor and seriousness, with a strong love interest. It's everything I was looking for in a movie. The character, Megamind himself, voiced with Will Ferrel makes him seriously lovable, how can we not love a silly underdog trying his best? Music for the movie I felt was perfect picks for each type of scene, they seem to give the movie much more power! I want to see much more of these characters, I've already seen it a few times in the theaters, 3D and normal, each time unforgettable!Please Dreamworks, keep going with this one, its a true winner in my book, I would just love to see more!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was so ahead of its time,"Megamind together with The Incredible (2004) are movies that would fit in today with the superhero deconstruction that is very much in now. It's interesting to see a movie like this being so ahead of the curve and serving a delightful comedy at the same time. It sadly falls into some DreamWorks tropes that make it stagger a bit at times, but overall it's a solid and very impressive movie that really wants to take the superhero mythos and ask questions about it in the most mature yet simple way possible. Throw in some great voice acting and okay animation, and you have an overall strong animated movie that definitely deserved more praise than it got.After the super villain Megamind finally accomplishes his goals, he is left without purpose. He determines a superhero adversary is the only way to regain it.What this movie does best is analyzing and deconstructing the superhero and villain mythos in the best way possible. It does it in such a simple and unproblematic way, compared to all the over the top and edgy deconstruction we have now. The modern trope is that it's funny the superheroes are doing all the things they are not supposed to do, and that's more or less all they end up doing. This can still work and be entertaining, of course, but having an animated movie more or less do it better than they ever could it, and that's somehow hilarious to think about. The movie tackles the superhero myth in the best way people, asking about the choice of the hero and the villain and what it really means to be both. The 3 characters Metroman, Megamind and Titian are all great analysis on what great power can be used for and who wields it matters a lot. Furthermore, it raises questions about classic roles and comes together to make a great superhero movie.The movie is sadly hit by a lot of studio vs creatives. From the opening, to the pop songs, to the at times cringe dialogue to the end dance party, this movie could have been a classic if it didn't have these pandering elements to them. A more mature yet fun story would really have elevated the movie.While the soundtrack is fun, it can feel out of place and awkward at times. In general the songs feel like a part of the movie, but at the same time it seems added to add the ""Shrek effect"" which all DreamWorks movies tried to replicate when they found a successful formula and that also is in terms of the elements mentioned before. What I'm trying to say is that I see so much wasted potential here to make a truly incredible movie instead of just a great one.The voice acting is pretty good all around, being both fun and energetic. The humor and emotions are voiced well, and the actors really blend into their roles. Will Ferrell, Jonah Hill and especially David Cross delivers some really great performances. Sadly not everyone do, I felt that the character Tina Fey sounded more read, but that might also be the lines at times. The lines are overall okay and the humor lands for the most part, but sometimes it doesn't, and sometimes the dialogue can sound a bit out there.But you are getting a fun and simple story here. Not overstaying its welcome and having the fun twist and turns it needs to have an enjoyable movie. It could have had more runtime, in my opinion, but it's really not necessary for what it tries to do.Megamind was as said ahead of its time, and it's sad to see that the DreamWorks producers might have tried to make it more marketable, since I really think it could have been a perfect animated movie otherwise. With such a great take on the superhero myth, with great voice acting, humor and story, you get a really solid movie all around.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Watched this in a hotel room - still bangs,"Watched this for the first time a few months ago rough as hell, and I never watch children's movies, however I was getting well into it.Watched it again last night,l to see if it actually held up. It was funny, easy to watch. And the A-list voice casting made it entertaining. The animation is fantastic, the soundtrack rocks and the story is compelling.I would watch this again in a few years or if I had to chose a movie for some kids. This movie is entirely suitable for adults and kids and does teach a few lessons. For example Jonah Hill's character gives off incel vibes and the film discourages his insecurities. It also goes into how riches won't make you happy and how you need a purpose to feel satisfaction. And how good and bad aren't always black and white, life is full of surprising compromises.Just chuck it on and see for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't miss it...,"I have read some reviews here and see it being unfairly compared to some Pixar's... I would rather rate it on its own merit. When I am sitting in a theater I would rather watch the current movie than try and compare it with others I have seen before. I guess that is just me! So here goes.It is worth a watch (or two if your kids want you to). The story is built up on a traditional superhero concept inspired heavily from the first ""Superman"" movie to the ""Return of Superman"". However, the jokes are often original and some can get an LOL out of you. All in all, there is enough good humor sprinkled throughout the movie to keep everyone smiling.If you can, do watch the 3D version. It has some good action scenes which look great in 3D but if not, you aren't missing a lot. This is not one created specifically for 3D pleasure - unlike Dreamwork's ""How to train your dragon"". Do watch out for some great dialogs by Megamind, and even some cutesy ones that seem right out of a Dilbert strip (office humor, if it wasn't clear enough). My favorite is ""He is still not used to positive feedback"" :) (probably funnier in context.All in all an entertaining package.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

'Megamind' vs. 'Despicable Me'!,"'MEGAMIND': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The second CGI animated blockbuster this year to revolve around a super villain learning to be good (the other being 'DESPICABLE ME', which I watched the same day). This one comes from DreamWorks Animation and is directed by Tom McGrath (who also directed DreamWorks' 'MADAGASCAR' and it's sequel). It's written by two first time writers, Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons. It features a large voice cast of A list actors including Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, David Cross, Ben Stiller (who also served as an executive producer on the film and was originally cast in the title role) and Will Ferrell as 'Megamind' (after both Stiller and Robert Downy, Jr. backed out of the role).The film opens with an 8 day old big headed blue alien boy being sent away from his planet by his parents before it blows up. In space he crosses paths with another baby boy being sent away from another planet and they both crash on Earth. The blue alien baby lands in a prison as the other baby lands at a rich couple's house. They both attend the same school, in Metro City, with equally impressive powers (one's a genius and the other has super strength and flight) but due to the one babies rich upbringing and good looks he grows up to be an idolized superhero named Metro Man (Pitt) and the other (the blue alien) grows up to be a despised mastermind villain known as Megamind. The two have constant duels but when Megamind kills Metroman (early on in the film) he takes over the city. Although Megamind has everything he thought he ever wanted he's unhappy. He longs for a beautiful reporter (Fey, who voices one of the most attractive animated heroines ever put on film) and for the rivalry of a competitor. So he decides to make a new superhero to challenge him.The film is surprisingly witty and clever; it's filled with several laugh out loud moments and Ferrell gives another classic Will Ferrell performance. It has a slight 'INCREDIBLES' feel to it but never quite reaches those heights. It is better than the other super villain animated film this year though and is one of the best animated films of the year as well. Besides being funny it does have great social commentary: about the people we become because of the advantages and disadvantages were given at birth. It also has some pretty cool animation and action scenes. All in all it's a pretty fun and amusing animated film, better than most.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqNUf10kuk",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

IMAX 3D Review: Megamind... will blow your mind!,"IMAX 3D: *** out of (****)Going into Dreamwork's latest concoction of laughs and slapstic, entitled ""Megamind"", I quite frankly didn't know what to expect. Typically, Will Ferrel has been a hit-or-miss actor who's mostly followed the latter, Tina Fey can pull one-liners out of her sleep and her delivery will still be humorous, and Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill get on my every nerve. Furthermore, while Dreamworks can pull a winner from out of their hat here-and-there (""Shrek"", ""How to train your dragon""), they're also notorious for pulling out cliché, by-the-numbers, family junk- food entertainment that reaches for the lowest common denominator on every level (""Monsters vs. Aliens""). There was simply no attractions that sparked my interest or reached above a thirty on Rotten Tomatoes at the time so I thought what the heck. It turns out, ""Megamind"" isn't so formulaic as I thought it to be. Now don't be fooled, this isn't any ""Shrek"" by any means (in fact, it's about 1/4 of its quality), but for what it was, it was pretty good.Since everyone is pretty safe with the whole ""superhero vs. supervillian"" concept, I'll save my breathe and time. How are the performances? Pretty much how you'd expect them to pan out. Tina Fey is great as always, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill still got on my nerves, and Will Ferrel was a hit this time. Everyone did what they had to do and did neither better nor worse than the viewer's average expectation. To top it off, while the story is not entirely inventive, the director throws the audience a few twists and turns. And since this is Dreamworks, even the trashiest of the trash are entertaining. However, the movie does start out a little slow. Oh and how can I forget the incredible action sequences? The action may be animated but it delivers. Explositions, fire, etc. This movie has it all.Now what about the little bumps in the road? Megamind, while labeled as a comedy, didn't make me laugh as nearly as much as I had hoped for. Furthermore, like I previously stated, the exposition is kind of slow. Moreover, while there are twists and turns, it can get predictable in some spots. To top it off the ""body switching"" segment got old very fast.Out of all the independent mind-provoking, in-depth character studies that don't see the light of day, how could a movie like ""Megamind"" slip under the rug you might ask? While this is very devastating to hear, a movie like ""Megamind"" could have been a lot worse. To go an extra mile, ""Megamind"" is actually good. It won't win any Oscars but it wins a place in my heart. Superb 3D, decent performances, and a good script makes me recommend this comedy-action 3D extravaganza. Recommended.IMAX 3-D MINI-REVIEW: Seeing ""Megamind"" in IMAX 3D was certainly no waste of money. The picture is as clear and detailed as if it were seen on a 1080p LCD HDTV, unlike standard digital 3D projections. The 3D was a notch better than non- 3D IMAX films and actually is as good, if not better, than viewed on a 3D film. The 3D has so much depth and occasional gimmicks to quench the audience's thirst. If you are seeing ""Megamind"", see it in IMAX 3D. Had I not seen it in this format, my score would probably be a ""6"".",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Megamind - 3.5 AStars,"A city without a hero is indeed a bummer, but for the villain, it could be a catastrophe. Why formulate a nifty plot that will overtake the world if no one out there is good enough to challenge it? Where's the fun in building an enormous, vicious, dancing machine if no man of equal awesomeness will stand up to it? Megamind (Will Ferrell) knows this feeling all too well.When he was just a little infant, with skin as blue as an Avatar's and with a head as large as a papaya, Megamind (Brad Pitt) was sent to earth by his parents right before their planet was obliterated by a natural calamity. Just as we humans are about to complain again about the typhoons and global warming in our planet, we see theirs get sucked into a black hole.A neighboring planet had the same idea, and a second infant, soon to be famous as Metro Man, travels with small baby Megamind. The two aliens grow up to be rivals in Metro City, and battling each other has become an almost outlined routine. Villain kidnaps the girl. Hero shows up. Beats up villain. Sends him to jail. When villain inevitably escapes, the cycle is repeated. Each citizen seems to enjoy this, except for TV reporter Roxanne (Tina Fey), who is reasonably tired of the clichés.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/megamind-movie-review/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sort of like ""Despicable Me"" but for an older audience...","I think that the timing of the release of ""Megamind"" hurt it quite a bit. If you look at the revenue for this film, it really is not that impressive, as it cost nearly as much as it made. However, ""Despicable Me"", which came out shortly before ""Megamind"" made a ton of money--many times what it cost to make. Now this does not mean one film is necessarily better that the other. I really think that ""Despicable Me"" stole ""Megamind""'s thunder and people were just not interested in seeing two films about an evil genius.So what's my verdict? Well, frankly I think both films are about equally good but have a slightly different audience. ""Despicable Me"" is clearly marketed more to kids and has cuteness as its advantage. The minions from ""Despicable Me"" are magnificent and adorable. It's also a tad formulaic--but not bad at all despite the predictability. ""Megamind"", however, is more a film for teens and adults--as cuteness is not really something I'd associate with the movie. It also has a few more surprises and a more adult sense of humor. My wife and oldest daughter preferred ""Megamind"" while I preferred ""Despicable Me""--but we all agreed that both were really nice films.I could say a lot more about the film, but since it's now out on DVD and already has a ton of reviews, I'll pass. Suffice to say it's well worth seeing and is excellent entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Doesn't carry its intriguing premise as far as it could've, but solid work from Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and David Cross makes Megamind an enjoyable film.","Following the destruction of two alien planets, both simultaneously send single escape pods carrying infants who are the last of their respective races. Both escape pods head to Metro City with one pod carrying a humanoid with eye catching hair crash-lands into a life of privilege and luxury and grows up to become the superhero Metro Man (Brad Pitt), while the other lands in Metro City's Prison for the criminally gifted and its bald blue skinned occupant is raised by criminals in the way of villainy to become Megamind (Will Ferrell) alongside his talking fish with a robot body, Minion(David Cross). The two become archenemies with Megamind repeatedly launching failed attempts at either world domination or destroying Metro Man often by kidnapping reported Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey). When Megamind's plan against all odds actually manages to kill Metro Man , Megamind's victory lap turns into existential ennui as his villainy loses its appeal with no-one trying to stop him. Megamind, against the advice of minion tries to create a new superhero to fight against, and finds what he thinks is a suitable candidate in Roxanne's geeky and emotionally clingy camera man, Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill). Megamind begins a relationship with Roxanne after stilling the identity of museum curator Bernard (Ben Stiller) and begins to question villainy, but Hal's obsession with Roxanne and jealousy soon leads to him becoming a threat that only Megamind can stop.Megamind was one of three films released by Dreamworks in 2010, along with Shrek Forever After and How to Train Your Dragon. While 2010 was a very crowded year for animated films that featured not only two other Dreamworks movies, but also Toy Story 3 and Tangled, the biggest fly in Megamind's ointment came from Chris Meledandri's upstart Universal based animation studio Illumination which scored a breakout hit with Despicable Me 5 months before Megamind's release. Due to the fact that both movies were essentially ""inverted takes on The Incredibles"" where the focal point was on Supervillains, Despicable Me ended up with a massive first mover advantage leaving audiences feeling they'd already seen the concept by the time Megamind hit theaters five months after Despicable Me. As a result Megamind was on the lower end box office wise for an animated film, doing well enough with $320 million against its $130 million budget, but not to the level expected for a film of this ilk. Megamind boasts a solid premise, but it doesn't take full advantage of it.Will Ferrell is having a lot of fun playing the alien supervillain Megamind and there's a good amount of humor mined from him being a technologically advanced genius but also bungling at basic social conventions or his frequent mispronunciation of words such as calling ""School"" ""Shool"" or ""Metro City"" ""Metrocity"". Will Ferrell's scenes with David Cross' Minion are rich with pitch perfect comedic timing as the two form a memorable comic duo with entertaining and engaging banter. Tina Fey is also quite good as a grounding agent playing a Lois Lane analogue who reacts to Megamind's plans with scoffing derision and boredom or mild annoyance at being kidnapping fodder. We also have a really good villain with Jonah Hill's Hal Stewart whose positioned as a socially inept creep with boundary issues with an undeserved sense of entitlement to Roxanne and it's a solid villain.What holds Megamind back is really in the lack of any real gut-bustingly funny moments. The movie's an easy sit with solid characters and a decent story, but it is played more for pathos than it is humor with Will Ferrell considerably more dialed back in his performance than you typically see him in live-action work and his existential dilemma is played fairly straight. There are also some moments with Hal Stewart's character where it seems like he's blaming Roxanne for him becoming a supervillain with him saying things like ""You never took the time to know the real me"" or things to that effect and the movie never really counters them and feels like it finds Roxanne at least somewhat responsible for Hal becoming the monster he becomes, which is one of the bigger sticking points. The movie also brushes off Megamind's lies to Roxanne without much acknowledgment on Megamind's part for taking advantage of Roxanne's unawareness of him in disguise.Megamind isn't one of Dreamworks' finest, but it's a solid superhero dramedy with engaging dialogue and solid performances from its core cast. It tries to do for superheros what Shrek did for Disney fairy tales, but doesn't quite strike that balance of pathos and comedy that made Shrek such a cultural phenomenon, but Megamind still works really well even if it didn't reach the standard of Dreamworks' other works.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Decent drama and spectacular action animation,"Yeah the movie doesn't pull any real surprises or THAT original, but overall I enjoyed a lot of aspects of this movie than disliked. I avoided this movie when it first came out in theaters cause of what some of the critics were saying about it, so I passed on it. And when I saw it at a dollar theater in 3D it was really worth watching, the action sequences and stuff constantly going on was a lot of fun to watch. The animation is also very well done from the facial expressions to the action. The movie starts off pretty well and got a bit dull later on, but overall it really is a enjoyable movie. It was pretty cool to see things in a villains point of view as well in a 3D animation, even if ""Despicable Me"" has done it as well. I didn't really like Jonah Hill in this cause the voice sounds just like Jonah Hill and thought it didn't fit that well, but every other voice actors and actresses did a very good job. It really is a enjoyable animation film for kids and adults and I recommend anyone that likes animation films to check it out.

"Megamind Over Despicable Me, Any Day","I may have judged Megamind wrongly, due to its main character's unexciting, smurfy appearance. This Dreamworks animated picture was actually pleasantly entertaining, with effective comedy rooted from the film's knack of poking fun on the entire superhero genre & drench it with practicality, tearing down familiar archetypes with plenty of sharp jokes. Of course, the stellar voice cast contributes to these enjoyables, with the likes of Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt & Jonah Hill infusing their characters with a magnitude of charm. Apart from the well-executed satire, Megamind's animation and soundtrack deserve praise as well. Visually, the film dazzles with vibrant animation and imaginative cityscapes. The soundtrack, peppered with classic rock from Guns N' Roses to AC/DC, adds to the picture's energetic and rebellious spirit. In spite of these diverting feats, Megamind succeeds as well in conveying a sincere message where anyone, even the most uncanny & unexpected, can become heroes too.Overall, Megamind may be an animated picture that was has long been lost in cinephiles watchlists, BUT DESERVES TO BE SEEN. Yes, the criticisms against its ""we've seen before"" premise are warranted. But from a filmmaking standpoint, this Tom McGrath creation is definitely an upgrade compared to the films it supposedly copied. Ahem Despicable Me Ahem.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

More Creative and Worthwhile Than I Might've Suspected,"DreamWorks delivers its own twist on the golden age of pulp superheroes, staging an ongoing struggle between one extreme (noble but cocky muscle) and another (selfish but grounded intellect). Pretty paint-by-numbers stuff until the villain abruptly succeeds in offing his nemesis, surprising even himself, and the whole world turns on its ear. Unprepared for the responsibility and scrutiny of rule, Megamind immediately yearns for simpler times, concocts a new heroic foil and drastically worsens the situation.In that it's a CG family film, centered around superheroes, from the villain's POV, it's only natural that Megamind should borrow from / compete with The Incredibles and Despicable Me. And, while it doesn't benefit from those comparisons - lacking the energy of the former and the heart of the latter - it still finds room to surprise and do its own thing. The plot's main thrust is an inspired take, a sort of ""What If"" tale about Lex Luthor finally tackling Superman, facing some difficult realities and ultimately growing as an individual. It acknowledges and corrupts a number of recurring tropes from the genre, twisting overplayed scenarios in fresh and interesting new ways. Unfortunately, the visuals are dated and low-grade, even by 2010 standards, and the humor doesn't connect as often as it should. Will Ferrell has zero room for improvisation in the lead role, and turns in a rather dull, workmanlike performance as a result.All in all, this isn't great, but it's certainly good enough to merit the ninety minutes. Which, honestly, is a lot more than I was expecting.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fun but not Pixar,"Saw this at a test screening. It wasn't completely finished in terms of animation, much of it was in storyboard phase, but from what I could tell the animation is top notch. Jonah Hill is perfect as Titan. Will Ferrell was decent as Megamind. Brad Pitt was good while he was in it.Its half spoof half turn the genre on its head. There are some pretty good jokes and some decent set ups. There's no real heart here though. Everyone's likable but you know it'll all be OK.Several scenes were very well animated, there is one of the biggest explosions ever animated in this film which was pretty cool. Go take the kids, especially the boys, who'll most likely get a kick out of Megamind.",,Anonymous,Animation

"A Witty and Visually Spectacular Animated Marvel, Unleashing a Fresh Take on Supervillainy with Humor, Heart, and Stunning Animation","""Megamind"" is an animated film that subverts conventional superhero clichés, centering around Will Ferrell's character Megamind. Megamind turns as an unexpected hero after vanquishing Metro Man. The movie is renowned for its bright animation, sharp satire, and intelligent scripting. It creates an amazing world with oddball characters and creative set pieces. With lovable characters like Megamind, Roxanne Ritchie, and Minion, the movie strikes a good mix between fun and sincere emotional moments. It stands out in the animated superhero genre and is fascinating for both adults and children due to its captivating storyline, endearing voice cast, and examination of identity and redemption.

Some villains are born to be heroes.,"Megamind, the big-headed alien always picked the last and took for granted while his rival Metroman was the school popular and the handsome boy who everyone wanted to be his friend are always in a conflict and everyone favoring Metroman, Megamind takes this chance to be a villain and extract revenge upon his rival.Seeing the cast was quite the surprise seeing Will Farrell, Brad Pitt and Tina Fey, while i'm a huge fan of Farrell i went to this movie and it was really good, voice acting is top notch, the comedy stands out and i really liked the soundtrack since most of the songs are old-school.This movie is recommended for everyone you will laugh and Will Farrell will draw smiles on the audience, if you get the chance to see it in 3D then go for it since the action scenes are powerful and breathtaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

more serious without the cute minions,"Villain Megamind (Will Ferrell) is an alien sent to Earth growing up alongside good guy Metro Man (Brad Pitt). While love and support showered Metro Man, Megamind was despised growing up in a prison. Then in one of his evil schemes, Megamind surprisingly kills Metro Man by accidentally discovering his copper weakness. Megamind loses his reason for being when he doesn't have a good guy to oppose him. So he sets out to create a good guy hero. Only it completely backfires, and Megamind must figure out how to save the day.There is some fun in this. The evil schemes should be more silly and less deadly. To start off the movie by killing a character is a little bit morbid and a little bit too serious. The twist is great. It takes the whole superhero genre much more seriously than the usual kiddie fare.The biggest problem is that this followed the much cuter Despicable Me. This is a more serious themed movie while the other villain led movie is a wacky cartoon. Even though both have minions, the Despicable Minions are super cute and super hilarious. Megamind just doesn't sell as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Will Ferrel turns his Mugatu voice into more undeserved $.,"Megamind deals with a pair of arch-enemies that have been pitted against each other since birth. Megamind (Ferrell) is blue and wiry with a water dispenser for a head and a little goatee. Metroman (Brad Pitt) is your muscular Dorito shaped All American type – brave, handsome and well spoken and willing to do anything to maintain the peace and safety in the city of Metro City.In their respective youths they each were forced into different pathways, Metroman found a more privileged and loving upbringing, and Megamind unfortunately found himself in different, less favourable surroundings, that of prison since toddlerhood. After a decade or so of being rivals with Metroman and failing, Megamind decided that rather than growing up an outcast he should embrace his circumstances and go all out as a bad boy makes sense I guess.(In this vein Megamind has unavoidable similarities to the recently released Despicable Me, both featured wannabe supervillains planning global conquest and oddly enough both having sidekicks named Minion! In this film Minion is a talking fish who drives an invisible car and uses an automated body to get around. Given my opening statement it should surprise no-one that I liked Despicable Me more, and given the option would pick up that DVD every time in future.) On and on for years the two battle, Megamind hell bent on implementing his various nefarious – but this is PG so not so scaryious – plans, and Metroman forever there to foil them. A frequent bargaining chip in such battles is cute n spunky young TV reporter – and presumed love interest of Metroman – Roxanne, something that infuriates her young cameraman Hal (Jonah Hill: playing a cartoon character looking surprisingly like Jonah Hill).Megamind and Hal similarly resent Metroman, Megamind as he continually thwarts his plans for global domination, and Hal as he presumably thwarts Hal's plans for Roxanne domination.At the conclusion of one of many Good Vs Evil battles Evil finally triumphs to the surprise and shock of everyone not least of which is Megamind himself. After the briefest of possible ""Yay we won!"" montages featuring both the villains, bystanders and innocent civilian reactions to this unexpected development Megamind rapidly comes to the conclusion that getting exactly what you crave all the time is no fun apparently – sounds pretty good to me. It seems that without his archrival and nemesis Metroman that being the undisputed ruler of all he surveys has lost a bit of fizz.Without the ying to his yang, his ""you complete me"", his ""you had me at Hello"" – OK I went one too far but you get the picture – Megamind lacks a sense of purpose.Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww.With this in (mega)mind a plot is devised to simply create a new nemesis from scratch, so that Megamind and co can have someone to battle against. To exact his new diabolical scheme Megamind must through necessity don various disguises to move undetected through Metrocity. It is while in mufti that he runs into both Roxanne and Hal (separately), due to Megamind's not being 7 foot tall and blue they are none the wiser at who they are conversing with. As they interact and get to know each other better past biases and hatreds are forgotten and friendships are unwittingly forged.Of course as this is a movie Megamind's carefully laid plans are always doomed to inevitable backfire, leading to further conflict and unexpected developments that amaze and astound us all – but not really.I can't go further without flubbing what little plot exists, suffice to say that it was reasonably straightforward and that the twists were seen coming from a mile away. The voice acting was as mentioned simply horribly lazy, Ferrell was the only one who even had a crack at creating a different voice for the role, only as it was one from his limited repertoire it grew annoying swiftly.Pop culture references and catchy songs frame the more memorable or hooky scenes, and precious little of the remainder was either memorable or amusing. I normally find at least one character even in the most lazy animated feature to like – in the pointless and plain bad Monsters Vs Aliens it was Bob, in Despicable Me it was the Minions – but here I found nothing and no-one.The shame here is that because Megamind and Despicable Me are so similar were released so close together that comparison are inevitable it means that we must unavoidably play the two films against each other, and that scrutiny basically shows just how derivative and unnecessary BOTH films actually are.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. Animated comedies featuring big name stars. Welcome to the successor of the B horror film. It doesn't matter if you're lazy, boring or just plain bad – until people stop going to every single one in mindless drones the quality will inevitably get worse and worse – leading to films like this.And what is it with the ""everyone dances over the end credits"" thing? It isn't bad, just reeks of ""same"".",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"You'll probably laugh, and you'll probably wish it were better.","You'll probably laugh, and you'll probably wish it were better. Megamind is nothing more than a amiable-enough adventure about atonement, about choosing to be the person you want to be regardless of what others expect of you. I'd love it a lot more if the Pixarian themes had been developed with greater care; as it is, they come across as an reconsideration. The jokes range from the modestly amusing to the mildly dumb. It's a harmless, inoffensive, moderately likable throwaway of a cartoon that you will probably start forgetting as soon as it's over.It may be difficult to find uniqueness in Megamind but it's also hard not to like.",,Anonymous,Animation
Decent film but seems to try too hard,"Megamind is a decent/average film in my opinion. Its pretty straight forward and gets to its plot right away. The story is predictable, but also seemed a little force and awkward at time. The animation is good and so are the effects. For a super villain, I thought Megamind was rather weak and not very convincing. He wasn't very evil at all, just insane and very sensitive. His character should have been done better, they should have made his character a little more likable yet bad-ass at the same time. Though Will Ferrell's voice work was spot-on, good job on his part. The other character's I didn't really care for, specifically Hal/Titan. His purpose wasn't very good, and I found him annoying. Metro Man was okay but he should have been more interesting- he seemed boring to me.Though, the biggest disappointment character in the film was definitely Roxanne. I know she was designed to be a regular person, but that doesn't mean they had to design her to look so uninteresting and plain. I was amazed with how expressive Megamind's face was, yet Roxanne's character looked so bland. Tina Fey's voice work added nothing to the character. Roxanne was supposedly to be a very pretty and likable character since all the lead males were tying to get her attention, yet I felt like her character was the weakest link and not exciting.I didn't see why Megamind, and Titan were really fighting for her- it didn't seem worth it. The ending of the film (the final showdown) was pretty good, but they should have made it less predictable. Overall, Megamind is a decent film but I was expecting more. As a rewatch 07/22/19' Megamind is quite liked more on this second viewing than the initial viewing. Although the comedy isn't that funny, it is refreshing seeing a villain turn hero type of animated superhero film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's not like they have the same story. Still while one found a unique way to tell the story, this here relies on the jokes alone. Not a bad thing, since they are pretty good in general. And the voice cast is doing a great job too.Kids will not mind either (no pun intended), or care if and how clever this is. It's good family fun with a little message.

"Good Story, Great Characters, Big Laughs","This movie is not as good as other Dreamworks animated movies, but is still very good. I don't think the kids will like it as much as the adults. The themes explored are a little ""dark"" and the characters are quite layered and complex (for an animated movie), which is what I really liked about it, but I think it's a turn off for younger children. The humor is also geared more towards adults (probably 35+), as is the music. For me, I was vigorously laughing and slapping my knee during a ""tribute"" to Marlon Brando. I don't think many kids are familiar with the reference. It made it funnier for me having recently seen the Bluray version of Superman 2, with never before seen footage of Marlon Brando.I do have to mention, as someone else did, that I was disappointed with how much Megamind looked like Gallaxhar (from another Dreamworks movie: Monsters vs Aliens). They are both blue with giant heads. You would think that if you are designing an alien, you basically could get as creative as you want, so why simply replicate another character? Still, Megamind is a great character. The best villains are always the ones who have things about them that you like or can relate to. There is plenty of that in this character. As a matter of fact, all the main characters have something about them that is unexpected, except for one.The biggest disappointment in the film was the character of Roxanne. I know she was designed to be a regular person, but that doesn't mean they had to design her to look so uninteresting and plain. I was amazed with how expressive Megamind's face was, yet Roxanne's character looked so bland. Tina Fey added absolutely nothing to the character, which is exactly what happened when she voiced a character in Ponyo. This woman is supposedly so funny, yet that hasn't been seen (or heard) on the big screen.

Bring your little middle aged guy!,"Easily the most humorous moment of an often hilarious film involves a reference to Marlon Brando's performance as Jor-El, Superman's biological father in the movie of the same name. The parody is as potent as Superman's heat vision with Brando's mumbled, near-incoherent delivery, Conan O'Brien bouffant and ridiculously cheesy costume captured exactly. The interesting part of this involves realizing that the reference exceeds 30 years of age meaning to get it you likely need to be at least 40 years old. The other visual references include 1989's ""Say Anything"" and the 10 year old ""A Beautiful Mind"" suggesting a writing staff firmly in middle age. However, kids will enjoy the film for the rapid pacing and multi-dimensional action sequences and perhaps the best use of the 3D gimmick in this incarnation of its rediscovery. Will Ferrell, whose career can generously be described as hit or miss uses the exaggerated emotion in his voice-work as Megamind to excellent effect. While Patrick Warburton would have been a much better choice, Brad Pitt effectively nails the self-aggrandizing Metro Man by basically being himself. Also in the good but not great voice work casting category, Tina Fey has to be smart but sincere rather than sarcastic in the Lois Lane/Vicki Vale role called Roxanne Ritchie. Reese Witherspoon from ""Aliens vs. Monsters"" would have been a better choice. The excellent ""Aliens vs. Monsters"" represents the closest cinematic cousin to this film with less entertaining ""Despicable Me"" a close second. In short, this is not quite ""Monsters, Inc."" or ""The Incredibles"" but a very, very good time at the movies.

Beauty And The Beast,"It is a scenario which we see in numerous films, the underdog falls in love with the beautiful woman, proves himself as the hero but it doesn't matter because she falls in love with who he is underneath. We have seen this a lot, but not so much in animated films. It is not often we see the ugly animated character get the gorgeous girl, but you do in ""Megamind""! The film does fit into the animation trend as of late of the bad guy becoming the good guy, but gives it the twist with this unsung hero getting the girl, which will do good things for peoples self esteem. Even if you are blue with a massive forehead and alien looking you can still get the one you love by being yourself! Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) has never been good at anything besides being bad. The means of his existence is to fight with Metro Man (Brad Pitt), but when he actually defeats Metro Man, he is completely confused by his new found dominance and lost for what to do next. He decides to create a new super hero for the town, Titan (Jonah Hill) so he will have someone to fight. One thing he didn't count on was failing in love with Titan's crush, news reporter Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey) and bringing out more bad in Titan than Megamind ever had.""Megamind"" is a great, fun family film to watch. It is not just a film for children as their are many themes there for adults as well, such as the romance theme which children will of course be unable to relate to. The graphics are amazing in the film and it is one film which is worth seeing in 3D while it is in the cinemas. It is well written and has a lot of great laughs throughout. However, the ending won't be a surprise to anyone and will be something most people will see coming from the very beginning.""Megamind"" has some big names which have contributed their vocal talents to the film. The one thing that is obvious with this is that with each of the cast members, they do not seem to go the extra mile with their characters voices. Each of them, bar perhaps Will Ferrell , plays the type of character they would normally play in a film which they would physically appear in and it is easy to pick who's voice is which. For example, Brad Pitt plays the good looking hero, Tina Fey plays the businesswoman who has too little time for her personal life and Jonah Hill plays the overweight nerd who can't be taken seriously. Will Ferrell does definitely do a good job at providing the voice of Megamind and, unlike the others, you can often forget that it is Ferrell's voice you are hearing.If you are taking your children to see ""Megamind"", you will probably find that it is more a boys movie than a girls movie. Children aside, it is a film that all ages will enjoy. The graphics are great to watch and the script is witty and funny. Overall, besides the romance, it isn't the most original film to come out in the last few years and it is quite predictable, but definitely good for a laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A movie way ahead of its time that has aged like wine,"Megamind feels like a movie a major studio could release today as a response to the increasing superhero genre burnout, but it's not.Even though superheroes in movie theatres wasn't something new by 2010, the genre was still years away from its peak in popularity, so the fact that Megamind subverts a lot of the tropes from the genre to deliver a very smart twist on the formula, at that time, deserves a lot of credit.The movie isn't perfect, sometimes it falls into stereotypical Dreamworks jokes or setups (not to dunk on Dreamworks, because if there was a movie studio capable of delivering a movie like this, it's precisely them), and it can be pretty predictable.

Megamind could very easily be just another 3D animation film. But it has enough originality to thoroughly entertain any audience!,"Megamind is the most polarized film I have seen. At times, it overflows with the kind of originality that I've always admired in Dreamworks films. Twists in the story, unique visuals and the way everything fits together could make this a 9/10. And then Dreamworks try to make the film more commercial, and the film suddenly loses 2 points! Within a single minute (watch it yourself, you'll agree) it deserves to stand alongside Toy Story 3 at the Oscars, but quickly seems eligible for a Razzie. Nonetheless, it exceeded my highest expectations. The voice cast is flawless, the music fitting and the proportion of the storyline ideal. As computer-animation improves every year, it becomes harder to tell what level of technical excellence a film possesses. In order to stand out, the visuals now have to be more original than ever before. Megamind has these originality's in small, frequent bursts.

Quite Entertaining and good movie.,"Megamind is a anti-hero type of a movie, with some moments of humour, and excellent voice acting by the impressive cast, along with great animation from the work team. It is a bit like a parody of superman with the first scene showing Megamind landing on earth quite similar to how superman was shown landing(but much more funnier),and also the actions and gadgets in the movie is quite good, showing how a mind of a supervillain works.This movie is about an Alien Supervillain named Megamind, who finally defeats his arch enemy Metro Man(protector of Metrocity) after years of trying to defeat him and those tries always ending in defeat and Megamind in prison. But when he defeats Metro Man, , he becomes sad and bored because of no superhero to fight against.

Ferrell's comic talents push this into the positive,"Yes, I know, another stunt-cast animated feature that's sure to appeal to adults as well as to kids. But it's because of that supposed stunt casting that Megamind works, at least to some degree. Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, along with Brad Pitt, own their roles and imbue them with purpose and personality. The animation itself is standard, and the story is simply steady, but everyone involved appears to be having a blast.Megamind (Ferrell) is an evil mastermind whose plotting never pans out. He lives in Metro City (which he amusingly pronounces ""Metr-ocity,"" rhyming with ""atrocity""), which is defended by the saint-like Metroman (Pitt). Both hero and villain came to Earth from faraway planets but diverging destinies, and they've been fighting each other almost since their arrival. But every battle ends the same – Megamind is captured and jailed, and later he escapes and begins the feud anew. Until, that is, the day when he finally does defeat Metroman and thus loses his purpose in life. I'm sure we can all sort of relate to that.Other characters include a chirpy reporter named Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey), who's close to Metroman, and Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill), a cameraman who wants to be close to Roxanne. They make unlikely allies and adversaries, and not always with each other. They are also played to opposite degrees of success; Fey is as likable and adorable as always, but Hill is just flat as the doting cameraman. You'd think that would be right up his alley, but a change in character midway through doesn't feel sincere, and it's mostly because Hill himself lacks the poise and panache to pull it off effectively.Fey and Ferrell work very well together here, which shouldn't be too surprising. They're both comic talents, and they know their timing well. But there's this, too: there's a fine line between being funny and being hammy, and it's easy to jump over that line for most comic actors. Give them too much rope, they chew the scenery with it, to mix two completely unrelated metaphors. Each actor has a lot of fun with his or her character (it wouldn't surprise me if there had been some improv involved) without running amok with it. That helps the so-so script and plot devices. Also helping: David Cross as a fish-like alien who came to Earth with Megamind and has been his loyal sidekick ever since. He's named Minion for some reason.

Presentation!,"Megamind's basic concept of telling a superhero story from the villain's POV is an appealing one - and it's one that has been done many times before. It would have been shocking and original back in the 70's, but unfortunately for Dreamworks, the movie's biggest potential target market - fans of comic books and superhero comics in particular - have seen this already, including, notably, Joss Whedon's ""Dr. Horrible's Singalong Blog"" and Kurt Busiek ""Astro City"" comics, both of which had more spark than Megamind. As a result the movie has to rely on the most basic of genre-based jokes, and the parody it attempts of superheroes and their psychology is one that has been explored to death.That basic premise is milked for all its worth though, and while it doesn't serve for any real insight about the genre, about good and bad or about destiny, it does make for a lot of good jokes. And while the premise itself runs out of fuel about thirty minutes into, and at that point the genre savvy viewer will be able to figure out just how the rest of the story goes, there's enough hilarious dialog and visual gags to make it enjoyable throughout; just like the animation is slightly behind the times, but still solid enough to get the gags across. Megmind is very well edited and paced, with some very memorable scenes and a great soundtrack. It's not one of Dreamworks' best but it's terrific entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Megamoot,"What makes a hero? Upbringing, genetics or some cosmic mix of fate? As two pods with infants near Earth they collide.

The other one, carrying Metro Man (Brad Pitt), lands where Megamind was destined to be before the ill-fated collision: straight into luxury and the loving care of a high-class family. Thus their fates seem to be set from the start with the privileged and indestructible Metro Man destined to be a hero, while Megamind always pigeonholed as the offender, the bad guy, the villain. During another of their countless confrontations, Megamind seemingly destined for an n-teenth defeat, the inexplicable happens, as Metro Man suddenly meets his demise. Thus Megamind has managed the ultimate victory and is left to control Mega City unchallenged. But no challenge, means no fun, so Megamind soon ventures to create himself a new super-foe (while simultaneously falling in love with journalist Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey))...The animation genre has a knack for extremely well-written narratives, possibly due to the immense budgets for creativity, which are necessary for their development. ""Megamind"" feels well-polished as a nicely wrought satire on the superhero genre with some hearty commentary on the human nature (although lets not get overly philosophical on the impact the movie aims to make). Nonetheless ""Megamind"" falls foul to high expectations of the genre, lacking a strong backbone of likable characters, instead featuring an extremely irritating and plain unfunny Jonah Hill as Tighten as the ultimate foe. Megamind, Metro Man and Roxanne each have limited appeal with none of the secondary cast captivating interest. Limitedly humorous ""Megamind"" fails to be truly entice, and as it is above all entertainment, deserves low grades in this regard. Despite some admirable underlying themes, which should be applauded by parents for their significance, the frontal narrative lacks enough inspirational impact to truly linger on the mind.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Megamind a must see!,"From the creators of Kung Fu Panda and Monsters vs. Aliens comes Megamind! I got lucky and was invited to see a test screening of this movie. It is a great movie. Yes it is animated, but it is fun and entertaining for kids and Adults. Sort of like Shrek, with that good humor that adults get. Its a fun superhero/villain movie, with good morals and lots of laughs. I think everyone would enjoy this movie. Brad Pitt does a great job. Will Ferrel is hilarious! I usually don't find him very funny but he is in this movie. If you choose not to see this movie in the theater, do yourself a favor and still rent it when it comes out on DVD.

Famous voices Animation Superheroes Crazy comedy antics Who could ask for more?,"This is another of those blockbuster animated films that uses the voices of famous stars to sell it. Well that's what I was led to believe from the hype anyway. At the end of the day I decided it wasn't all that bad. As far as I'm concerned, anyone could be supplying the voices in this one; it's the writing that makes it (for me). I'm sure contributions were made by those involved, but the basic storyline would have remained the same and it's the story that holds the thing together. Of course I was also immune to the 3D because I watched it in exactly the same number of dimensions the screen has. But I digress, here's a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.With their planets doomed, two babies are sent towards Earth. One lands at a mansion and is brought up in a privileged home. He has superpowers and grows up to be the good guy: Metro Man. The other, well he lands in a prison, has no superpowers, but a genius mind and he becomes the bad guy: Megamind. The pair have many battles over the years with Metro Man always finishing with the upper hand. But this time it would be different; this time Megamind has a particularly evil plan. He kidnaps Metro Man's girlfriend, reporter Roxanne Ritchie, and lures Metro Man to his doom. But will the destruction of Metro Man give Megamind everything he wants? Well, I'm afraid the Spoiler Police would really not like me telling you that and anyway, they've threatened me with the 'forget-me stick' if I tell.The animation is up to DreamWorks' usual standard, nothing particularly extraordinary about it really. I love the soundtrack, but then again, put AC/DC, Ozzy Osbourne and Guns 'n' Roses in there and I'm yours! (I saw at least two of them in the same bill once). Performance wise, well everyone did a decent job, so I'll give honourable mentions to the voice talents of; Will Ferrell as Megamind, Tina Fey as Roxanne Ritchie, Brad Pitt as Metro Man, Jonah Hill as Hal Stewart/ Titan, David Cross as Minion and Ben Stiller as Bernard.The whole story is told from the point of view of Megamind which makes for an interesting dynamic. You end up sympathising with the bad guy and that, I guess, is what makes the whole thing work. I liked the storyline, but I suspect it may have been a little too complicated for younger members of the audience. They also fall into the trap of putting little nods to older films so the parents don't get bored, I suppose, and this is all getting a little cliché Hollywood. Still, it's pretty entertaining over all and one that's worth a look 'Recommended'.My score: 7.3/10.IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 50,452 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 72/100 (based on 170 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

"Very good, and surprisingly so","Megamind, a super-intelligent alien villain, at long last destroys his nemesis, the super-hero Metro Man. Instead of being satisfied, he feels empty, so creates a new super-hero. Unfortunately the super-hero turns out to be a super-villain, and Megamind has to assume the role of super-hero in order to stop him.Very good, and surprisingly so. I thought this was going to be another comic-book-hero/animated kids movie. Kids will certainly enjoy it, but so will adults. Good plot, snappy dialogue, very funny, unrelenting pace.Action sequences are a prop, not the main idea, which is always good, and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.

This movie came so ahead of its time!!,"His commentary about superhero movie cliché is in the level of South park! If the movie came out in the last 3 years or so, it would have been considered as an amazing movie! The animation still looks really good, the jokes land, the emotional moments land, the soundtrack is awesome, all of the main characters have unique and different personalities and arcs, and the voice actors are doing a fantastic job! The movie's themes of nurture vs nature is very well executed, and a lot of the times, the movie doesn't take a side in some of the more controversial decisions some characters make, they let the audience make their own mind, which is great because both sides have solid arguments, so letting the audience decide themselves was the best coarse of action the writers could have taken. The movie has some very minor problems with the pacing, but overall, what a masterpiece!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
it didn't suck and I enjoyed it overall,"So I watched 2010's CGI cartoon flick ""megamind"". Well was it megagood, well for a kids flick I say it was good. Now as a flick just for adults it get's an ehh. However, if I had kids I could sit through this film and enjoy it which I did overall, and I think kids will love this movie. The animation is just standard fare here, nothing special but then again everything CGI to me at this point is wonderful, it just doesn't stand out here like it did in say ""rango"". The plot is interesting enough, two aliens crash on earth at the same time one destined to be a superhero and one destined to be a super villain, or perhaps not? The acting is solid and comes from some of the industries best Ferrel, Fay, Jonah Hill, David Cross, Stiller, and Pitt (hey my second review today with him). In fact, the character that Ferrel developed for this film was memorable, not Ron Burgundy memorable but good. It was interesting if I had to compare it to say ""the incredibles"" it is not in the same league, but it is good for a kid's flick. And I said most adults with the exception of my best friend who hates anything that isn't completely obscure should enjoy this ""popcorn"" flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"An amusing, albeit unspectacular, diversion with a great voice cast.","I recently saw Dreamworks animation's Megamind, a film about a failed supervillain who discovers he makes a better good guy than bad guy. A plot like this hasn't been tackled at since... last Summer with the release of Despicable Me. And out of these two movies, Megamind is funnier, much more finely fleshed out, and just a better movie in general.Will Ferrell voices Megamind, the blue skinned, bulbous headed title supervillain. His evil schemes to take over Metro City are frequently foiled by his nemesis Metro Man (Voiced by Brad Pitt), a superhero who always saves the day, and the Lois Lane of their hometown, Roxanne Ritchi (Voiced by Tina Fey). But when Megamind accidentally defeats his nemesis, he falls into a slump. But decides to alter that by creating a new superhero out of a nerdy cameraman (Voiced by Jonah Hill), and in the guise of a museum curator, strikes up a relationship with Roxanne, all the while, his cold heart begins to warm The idea of taking the clichés of superhero movies, and turning them into quirky and unfamiliar territory is really nothing new, especially to those who've seen Pixar's The Incredibles, but what you'll get is a pleasantly surprising animated feature, albeit an unspectacular one. The characters tend to hop between emotions sporadically, and the story isn't all THAT inspired, (Plus the film's third act kind of drags) but the humor of the film, which ranges from witty one-liners and tickling sight gags, made me laugh a great many times, especially an homage to Marlon Brando's character from the Superman movies.The film also has a great voice cast, Ferrell, Pitt, Fey, and Hill are all given great material to work with, and their timing is effective, though one of the more interesting mentions is David Cross, who voices Megamind's scene stealing fish henchmen named Minion. The animation is slick, and dazzling, and the sound design by Ethan Van der Ryn and Erik Aadahl is some impressive craftsmanship.I can't quite say Megamind is a ""Three Star"" movie, because it just isn't. It doesn't completely nail down the tone it wants of itself, and to be honest, it might be a tad forgettable, but It's really enjoyable for what it is.I give Megamind **1/2 out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

ironic portrait,"touching, amusing, seductive, different by many other contemporary animations. because it not propose entertainment, has not ambition to impress and the story is almost too honest for many tastes. its great virtue is status of precise portrait of contemporary society. about the ambiguity of values, about old heroes/models , about self definition in a competitive society. and, sure, about love. its purpose - to reflect about every day themes. its good point - a strange, fragile bad guy who becomes hero against obstacles. Megamind could be the icon of the resistance against chaotic manner to discover life. and that does this film special. because it is invitation to courage to be yourself. because propose an ironic portrait of solid determined things in new light. because the romanticism makes not so bitter a story who balance between Oliver Twist and retreat Elvis Presley.because it is inciting invitation to think yourself.",,Anonymous,Animation
Mega-Fun,"The comedic twist on the superhero genre is nothing new, nor is the take on seeing a super-villain in a new light as seen with Despicable Me. So the main question was could DreamWorks make an effective blend of the two with Megamind? I think they succeeded. It is nothing that other films of this type haven't touched upon before, but the smart script and fun characters really help make the film stand-out. It has plenty of laughs, it gets its references spot on and it has a surprising amount of dramatic moments.So what is the plot? Well a super-villain named Megamind has an ongoing battle against superhero Metro Man, constantly being defeated. One day Megamind actually manages to defeat his nemesis and take over the city, but quickly realises there is no fun if he has nobody to face and tries to create a new hero to do battle with. It's a relatively straight-forward plot, but what really makes the film work is its excellent characters. Along the way Megamind develops an attraction towards a reporter he usually kidnaps and the hero he chooses turns out to be not so ideal for the role. I was interested in the romance that developed, I enjoyed seeing Megamind train this new hero and I found that the interactions between the characters were always engaging.Megamind (an excellent Will Ferrell) has all you want in a main character. He finds being evil fun and it's hard to disagree with him at times, but you feel for him throughout and his transition into a more heroic character feels very natural. Roxanne (Tina Fey) is a fantastic female lead. Sure she is something of a damsel, but it is always played for laughs and she is just a well-balanced character. She's feisty and intelligent, but she's also gentle and vulnerable in a very human way. Minion (the always solid David Cross) is an enjoyable foil for Megamind and Metro Man (Brad Pitt) turns out to be a fun twist on the superhero. I found Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill) annoying and too goofy at first, but the more he grows into his superhero role the better he gets.The animation is fantastic as usual from DreamWorks and all the characters have interesting designs. There is just something about the way they animate that simulates motion and movement especially well. Whether it be for some slapstick or for the action scenes it just looks excellent every time. Something that impressed me was how well music was used in the film. The score by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe is aptly heroic and upbeat, but it was also fantastically integrated with songs by the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, AC/DC and Guns N' Roses. Frequently this method falls flat or the songs date the film, but they are all used smartly and in suitable scenes when they appear.The comic references were very good. The similarities to Superman are done well and I especially enjoyed Megamind pretending to be Marlon Brando's Jor-El during the training scenes. The script and the dialogue really shine here, I was invested in Megamind's various dilemmas and I was intrigued as the how everything was going to pan out. I found the connection that developed between Megamind and Roxanne to be very believable, when I was initially worried that it would come off as forced. There are also some smart changes to the typical superhero formula, especially towards the end, that worked to the films advantage.It may be a touch predictable for some and I don't think it breaks any new ground, but I found Megamind to be really enjoyable. The plot is just different enough to be engaging, the animation is very impressive yet again and it's more serious moments are just as effective as its comedic ones. But I believe that it is the characters that give the film its biggest strength. Everything from the voice acting to the designs to the interactions they have just worked to near perfection. Megamind is definitely an entertaining take on the superhero/super-villain genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not my favourite Dreamworks film, but smart and very entertaining","As far as Dreamworks movies go, I do prefer Prince of Egypt, Shrek and How to Train Your Dragon, but Megamind is one of the studio's better movies. While the film loses its way in the story just towards the end, and slackens in the pace a tad at that point, it is still smart and very entertaining. In general, the pace is fast and furious, while the story is original and exciting. I also enjoyed the voice acting, I don't care for Will Ferell but still thought he was brilliant as the zany and very lovable titular character, while Brad Pitt also entertains and Tina Fey is suitably sassy. The characters all add a lot to the movie, Megamind for me is one of the better title characters in a Dreamworks film.The film is also hilarious, the dialogue is funny and smart and the sight gags and references come by thick and fast. I particularly loved Ferell's Marlon Brando impression, one of the better laughs of the film. The music is memorable and energetic, with some nice song choices, while the animation is fantastic, very crisp and smooth with some amazing colours. All in all, this is not Dreamworks' best, but it is one of their better and funniest movies. I do recommend it, it is terrific fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's...okay,"Megamind is actually kind of a neat idea, and might even be taken as a contemplation on the nature of good and evil (""can there BE evil without good?""), but it's a victim of its own timidity.The great cast is pretty much wasted here. Will Farrell shows uncharacteristic restraint in the way he voices Megamind, and while Tina Fey, David Cross, and Jonah Hill are all very funny people, the script doesn't give any of them much to work with.The funniest scene is probably the one where Fey's Roxanne has been kidnapped by Megamind, who eagerly anticipates Metroman's rescue effort. Except Megamind has done this so many times that Roxanne is not only not afraid, she's actually bored, and challenges Megamind to be more original. It's cute. The trouble is, this is an early scene, and nothing in the rest of the movie really gets back to this level. The other BIG problem is that the best gags from even THIS scene were used in promos for the movie.Yes, there's an irresistible urge to draw comparisons. I spent much of my time watching this movie lamenting on how good Pixar's The Incredibles is. And, yes, a comparison is valid, considering that the story in The Incredibles covers a lot of the same territory. I felt remarkably similar feelings about Sony's Despicable Me, too, but part way through that movie at least took an odd turn into improbable family comedy and actually went somewhere.Perhaps most unfortunately, I'd just seen How To Train Your Dragon earlier that day on DVD, and Megamind seemed phoned-in by comparison.Dreamworks can do better, and has, many times.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

It sends a clear message to the audience that there lies a good in every bit of bad as well. And even good cannot be that good after all, as it lies surrounded by the bad. Watch it if you haven't.

Not Great But Pretty Good,"I took my entire family to the theatre tonight where we watched this movie, the kids really enjoyed this a lot at least for the first hour of the movie, and even better my partner and I were not completely bored like we are at most ""kid movies"". The action scenes were pretty entertaining and well done for a kid movie too. My partner enjoyed it almost as much as the kids, more so than they enjoyed the lame Alpha and Omega which I thought was awful and I could barely sit through. This movie got really boring for me really fast but at least I could sit through it and there were a few funny parts through the whole movie, enough to keep me awake at least :) I guess most of you know what the plot is, so I guess there is no need to go into it. It is just campy superhero fun and involves super powers and the super heroes who wield those powers. The only problem is there's been way too many superhero and animated superhero movies especially as of late so it got kind of boring quick for me and my partner, and the kids just got tired by the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fabulous Evil Fun,"""Megamind"" is one of the better animated movies to have made it out of 2010, end of story. It is right up there with ""How to Train Your Dragon"".The story told in ""Megamind"" is one that everyone can relate to, both children and adults, and that makes it so much fun. Because there is something in this story for everybody. The classic tale of good vs. evil, but with a funny twist. And you can do nothing but love the plans and schemes Megamind comes up with and the way he carries them out. Total genius at work here.As for the animated style of the movie, well I loved it. It had this really cool cartoonish touch to it, though it was superbly and beautifully drawn at the same time. The colors were plenty and splendid and the animation itself was amazing.The cast of voices in the movie was amazing as well, with great names like Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, Justin Cross, Ben Stiller, and more. Everyone here did a really good job with voicing out the characters on the screen, with so much passion and soul. It worked so good.And the characters in the movie were lovable, though some were quite stereotypical. But oddly enough, I found that to be quite a fun approach to the archetypal superhero genre. So it worked out well. And my favorite character was Minion, he rocked!This animated movie is wholesome entertainment and fun for the entire family. Kids will love it, adults will love it, heck, even your pets will love it. This movie is a definite keeper. And I think it is also the type of movie that you will take out and watch again at a later time, because it just has that much appeal and watch-value.And it was a refreshing touch to actually have the 'badguy' of the movie turn out to be the light of the day. Thumbs up for ""Megamind"", way, way up!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too cheesy,"I realize that not every cartoon movie can be of the same quality as ""How to train your dragon"" or ""Wall-e"", but come on. They recruited such high profile actors as Will Ferrel and Brad Pitt for the voices, so animation and jokes must be accordingly funny as well as touching elements of the plot. Besides first part of the movie - the idea of super villain beating super hero, looks nice, but afterwards it looks down the hill. Animation is mediocre at very best. It can't be compared to previously mentioned cartoons neither by quality of animation nor by the level of interest of it's characters (beside megamind himself). On the plus side, it's a nice cartoon to take the kids to.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Cute,"I really really really hate Will Ferrell. Usually just the fact that he is in a movie is enough to turn me off from the film as a whole.It's a good thing I didn't actually know he was in this when I bought the ticket.All in all, I was expecting to kill an hour and half with a light-hearted ""kid's movie"", which would have been fine, but instead I got a well made comedy for all ages.A good family movie, has multiple levels of humor, simple sight gags for the kids, snappy banter and one-liners for teenagers, and maybe not ""sophisticated"", but more nuanced jokes for adults; things that a kid would miss. This film uses different characters and their interactions to make that work.For the very young, the highlight of the film will be the interactions between Megamind (Ferrell) and his sidekick Minion (David Cross) as well as Megamind's frequent mispronunciations of common words; ""School"" is ""Shoool"", ""Spider"" is ""Speeee-yder"", and ""Metro City"" is made to rhyme with ""attrocity"". Teenagers will likely find the awkward humor of Hal/Tighten (Jonah Hill) their own cup of tea, largely as satirical reflection of the modern, (sub)urban teenager's view of the world. And adults are more likely to see the most humor in the way the plot is both an homage and gentle parody of comic book staples like the bad guy always losing, and their seemingly endless supply of elaborate weapons and traps (they come from a surplus store in Romania), as well as the developing love story between the Lois Lane-esque Roxanne Ritchi (Tima Fey) and Megamind, turning the romantic element of many classic superheroes on its head.The CGI, while not quite Pixar quality is good and crisp. The soundtrack is a fantastic mix of the best of classic rock (Ozzy Osbourne and AC/DC always make a movie better). The jokes fly quickly without becoming obnoxious, and it is one of the really few movies marketed toward kids, but actually equally (if not more so) enjoyable to adults",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Vidiot Reviews...,"MegamindThere are three things one needs in order to be a true super-villain: arrogance, aggression and baldness.Fortunately, the malefactor in this animated movie suffers from all of the above.Soon after thwarting Metro City's muscle-bound protector, Metro Man (Brad Pitt), for the first and last time, evil genius Megamind (Will Ferrell) becomes bored with no adversary around to antagonize.Therefore, with the help of his minion, Minion (David Cross), he transforms the mild- mannered news cameraman, Hal (Jonah Hill), into a super-hero.But when hotshot reporter Roxanne (Tina Fey) enters the picture, Megamind is too distracted to pay attention to his now corrupt, caped creation that's running amok.Although it does contain a few choice chortles, the bulk of Megamind is simply a retread of other-–better–animated super movies.Furthermore, why would a super-villain waste time constructing a super-hero, when they could be plundering pocket universes for dark matter?

"Brad Pitt's Voice Work Excellent, but Overall Just Satisfactory","The posters and previews did not really attract me to watch this movie. However my sons made me see it with them, so I did. I am wary about Dreamworks animation projects. I was just hoping that it would be a pleasant surprise, like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or ""Kung Fu Panda"" were before this.It all starts with a Superman scenario when two babies were sent via rockets to Earth, when their planets were destroyed. One was raised in the lap of luxury and grew up to be the superhero, Metro Man. The other was raised in a prison, ostracized all his life for his big head and blue color, and grew up to be the super-villain, Megamind. As fate would have it, they became arch-nemeses. One day, one of Megamind's hare-brained schemes to destroy Metro Man actually succeeds. However, after he experiences his ""success,"" he finds his life empty without someone to fight against.Regarding the artwork, the characters (with no exception) were really very unattractive and unappealing, as they were drawn. I see this as a problem with all Dreamworks projects like ""Dragon"", ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", and ""Shark's Tale"". The character Hal/Titan is the worst and most annoying of all. Their Metro City backdrops and special animated effects though were very well-done.As for the voices, the best one belonged to Brad Pitt as Metro Man. It was noble yet cheesy, very on point. Will Ferrell sounded like he had a good time with Megamind, but it was just OK. Tina Fey's voice as the feisty reporter Roxanne did not really reflect her funny personality. These two could have been done just as good by any other voice talent.Overall, this movie was satisfactory, not spectacular. As you can deduce from the short synopsis, this movie is not exactly for kids. There were stretches in the middle when my kids were restless. The success of the jokes were erratic. The script was surprisingly quite adult in its analysis of good and evil, even contemplative at times. I appreciated this and I liked the twists and turns that the story took. I am not sure though if the kids actually got what the movie was really all about behind the silly action sequences.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
one of the greatest superhero stories that deserves a sequal,"I remember watching this movie as a child and did not like it but as an adult this is great. I still hate the style of the animation but the expressions and character design within the style is masterfully done. I loved the jokes more now that I know English. Humor like this doesn't deliver well in dubs. After 10+ years this movie holds up in every way except the setting feels a little empty. I find megamind to be kind of like iron man except better. Ironman in my understanding is exactly like what the Scarlett Witch told Dr. Strange: ""when you make mistakes you are a hero, and when I make mistakes I am the villain"". In that case Megamind is so much better than Iron man in that he doesn't pretend to be things he isn't and doesn't have his head up his ass. Megamind did not make his mistake because he is cocky and think he knows whats best for everyone else. He created his ""ultron"" because he wants to be the bad guy, not because he wants to be the savior. Anyways, Megamind is great.Also if there is ever a second film or even a short, please make megamind better at music than metroman since he has a better brain. I would love to see megamind be better at metroman at something.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great story,"While re-watching this movie it brought out the inner child in me and how I enjoyed watching Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. Not only does this movie have things for kids but it also has stuff for older audiences to laugh about. The movie is funny and meme able for all audiences, while this is often said about a lot of animated media no movie does it better than Megamind. Similar to Kung Fu Panda the movie has some hidden and deeper meanings but they are not as outwardly present as in Kung Fu Panda.

Megamind: 6/10,"With an easy blend of comedy and action, Megamind doesn't stand out as one of the animation of the year. But it does however, convince its audience that they will like it coming out of the theater. It is not as slick as The Incredibles and the 3D scenes aren't amazing as How to Train Your Dragon, but you'll enjoy it. Megamind is about a supervillain and a superhero battling since they were born. Megamind, a blue guy with a big head, spends his whole life trying to kill Metroman (Brad Pitt). While the city hates him, he's convince that when he kills Metroman, the citizens will obey him. But when he finally ""killed"" Metroman, he found out that his life no longer has a purpose. He has nothing else to do rather than stealing stuff from the city. At this point, I think the movie is trying to get out the message that you have to live life with a purpose, or something like that. But in the end, we know Metroman is alive and Megamind gets locked up again. (There is a whole other subplot that's I'm not going to get in.) Will Ferrell's voice as Megamind is irreplaceable but Tina Fey and Brad Pitt were just unnecessary. Jonah Hill was way better than the two combined but that was because he was one of the big character. They tried to do a lot of stuff in 3D that weren't suppose to work in 3D. But at least they tried. 3-dimensional effects isn't that hard, but I felt like it took them forever in this film and get those effects going. Megamind isn't bad, it is great to say the least. But it lies between the it's-so-bad-that-it's-good type of movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining & thought provoking,"Very well paced and highly entertaining animation movie which aged surprisingly well; you wouldn't think that this movie was released ten years ago.Why is that? As with most of the better productions in animation it's not only the animations per se but foremost all of the many timeless learnings you could gain from this: friendship, choosing the right thing, stick to the ones who stick to you, telling the truth and don't judge books only by its covers. And there's more.But the best part is that you could also just forget about those deeper meanings and let yourself sink into the humorous as well as adventurous, all in all positive approach on superhero movies. And although most of the characters probably won't make it to the hall-of-fame of animation history, the voice acting (especially - which is very surprising - Brad Pitt, who fits Metro Man perfectly) really adds great dynamics so I'd recommend to watch this in its original language version.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dreamworks Worst.,I bought Megamind at WAL-MART and I must say that I didn't like it. I personally think that it's the worst animated movie that Dreamworks has made. The plot was kinda weird the villain wants to take over the world but then turns good after falling in love with a girl. The characters weren't very funny and the animation wasn't great. All in all I believe that this is just a rip off of The Incredibles and I don't think that Dreamworks should of ever made this movie! It's definitely their worst! It's nowhere as good as Shrek or Madagascar. So if you're a fan of Dreamworks I suggest that you don't see this movie because you won't like it and you'll just be wasting your money. Thumbs down for me.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I made you a hero, you did the fool thing ALL BY YOURSELF!","Supervillain Farrell seeks purpose after fulfilling his only focus in life defeating his nemesis, superhero Pitt. The bad guy is painted as the protagonist and the good guy as the antagonist in this interesting little outing from Pixar, but the laughs are few and far between--and some of those are complete misses. Most disappointing is the lack of energy it imparts for an animated action-packed family film. You'd figure there'd be something a little more philosophically humble when the person you're supposed to be rooting for is driven to chaos, no matter how light-hearted or comedic especially when children are the target audience! No doubt this was just a paycheck for the A-list actors.**½ (out of four)",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Megamind with the voices of Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Brad Pitt is a wonderful parody of the superhero genre","On the day of its premiere, my movie theatre-working friend and I decided to watch computer-animated Megamind this afternoon. The story seems to be another Superman parody/tribute as we see the origins of Metro Man (Brad Pitt) and the title character (Will Ferrell). Then when they've grown into the hero/villain they become, a reporter named Roxanne (Tina Fey) gets mixed in. But after that, many twists and turns come that take many humorous and even touching scenes entertainingly through a, what seems, a naturally organic plane. And they mostly seem to earn every highly amused and heartfelt emotion I got out of it all. And watching all those action scenes in 3-D added immensely to the experience. Kudos to all for a such wonderful experience provided to my friend and I. So yes, I highly recommend Megamind.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Flying Cinema,"The trailers of ""Megamind"" is like your same old typical Dreamworks Animated Movie. Slapstick comedy, simple story, less heart. But the movie turns out to be good. It's a solid entertainment, a lot of action and laughs. The best thing about this film is the flying sequence. You don't need to watch this in 3D because in 2D cinema you already feel like you are flying. ""Megamind"" is fun and non-stop entertainment. Like I say, 2010 is the best year for animated movies.The story is like ""What will happen if the villain defeated the hero?"". Without the main superhero, the main villain will be a good guy. The story is interesting but it's predictable sometimes. At least the movie is fun. The jokes were funny (duh it's Dreamworks). The entertainment quality is great. I'm not against 3D but you don't need to see this in 3D. It's already exciting and fun in 2D.It's not like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or ""Kung Fu Panda"" that it's very heartwarming. ""Megamind"" has a heart but not as big as the movies i have mentioned. The filmmaking is decent. Hans Zimmer's music is always great. The action and flying scenes are very exciting. Also the voice acting was pretty good. Will Ferrel's voice reminded me of Rainn Wilson's Gallaxhar on last year's ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" and also the appearance of the character. But his voice acting was good though.Overall the movie is very enjoyable. It could be one of the best animated films of the year. It's not your typical Dreamworks except the trailer. The movie is short but it's undeniably entertaining. It's a movie you can repeat all over again like ""HTTYD"", ""Shrek"", and ""KFP"" but not as heartwarming as those three. It's like ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" with heart.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, but also very predictable","I have a problem with the way Dreamworks animates... well... everything. All their recent productions look almost identical. OK, so they have different stories, but the characters' movements and facial expressions and eye twinkles and explosions and all of that, they look the same. Even the dialogue. And the stories are not that dissimilar either. When Megamind starts with the villain's sad backstory I know it's going to be yet another Despicable Me thing, and it IS! Do you know what happened to Felonious Gru? Who, you ask? The guy from Despicable Me! Because if you somehow remembered the name of the film you certainly did not remember his name. All you remember are the minions now, if that. And this hero has a dumb but good hearted minion, too!I am not saying that this is a bad film, it was quite entertaining and I bet kids love it, but it was so obvious from the very start and through all of the ""twists"". Instead of identifying with the fun supervillain, the audience identifies with the reporter kidnapped at the beginning ""Cliché! Juvenile! Tricky! Seen it! Garish!"".Bottom line: there is something to be said about pure emotions, but as Inside Out showed us, they are much better when they are mature and complex. Megamind comes off as childish, even compared to other American animations, and that's saying a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nice little subversion of superhero tropes,"Comic books have sometimes hypothesized what would happen if a supervillain actually won against their heroic nemesis. Often these stories are of rather dark variety. Not so much here, keeping in mind that this is still a Dreamworks film aimed primarily at children.Still, the protagonist of the film is a supervillain and he does win, defeating his archrival, Metro Man, through sheer stroke of luck. And he takes over the city. And rules over it with an iron fist. And as you can imagine, he ends up being not quite as content with it as he might have imagined. So much so that he starts to yearn for the ""bad old days"".The concept works, in my opinion. Will Ferrell has a lot of comedic chops and in his hands Megamind can be diabolically scheming, sympathetic, pathetic and even kind of a lovable goof. I also really like Minion, his main enforcer. Clever design, good voice acting from David Cross and some of the best lines. Tina Fey's Roxanne Ritchie (gotta love that comic book alliteration) is perhaps a bit too by the book damsel in distress, but she has a personality despite that, and could have been a lot worse.The thing that rubbed me the wrong way is the character of Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill), initially a co-worker of Roxanne's. I get that he was supposed to come across as sleazy and to practically scream the concept of bad touch. I just think they took it a tad too far. This was an uncomfortable character in all the wrong ways and I think they could have gotten the character concept across without making the audience collectively pull their collars.Then again, keeping in mind how many women still get needlessly harassed by men who just don't seem to get the concept of ""No!"", perhaps it's a good thing that the younger generation has such a bad example as Hal.Megamind is a refreshing take on the superhero genre. Definitely worth a watch for all wanting another take on the usual clichés.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Will Farrell's Personal Avatar,"The release of ""Megamind"" on the first Friday in November marks the beginning of the winter blockbuster season and shows that Will Farrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, David Cross and Jonah Hill know how to draw a crowd to the box office. ""Megamind"" is the latest DreamWorks animation story that incorporates different aspects from Superman. The basic plot concerns the epic rivalry that began when a blue super villain alien named Megamind (Will Farrell) and his arch nemesis superhero Metro Man (Brad Pitt) were babies. They both were saved from the destruction of their respective planets by small spacecrafts destined for earth. Their rivalry continued as they both grew up living very different separate lives fighting periodically through the years. All of these battles resulted in the defeat of Megamind up until one day that changed both of their lives forever and Megamind's perspective of good versus evil.The character Megamind is an exact replica of what Will Farrell would look like if James Cameron made him into an Avatar. With this being said Will Farrell is funnier than ever and is able to carry his humor over from his movies aimed at an older audience and transform it into humor appropriate for younger kids. The film also has a special guest appearance from the film's producer Ben Stiller as the voice of the character Bernard. Tina Fey (""SNL"", ""Date Night"") is also in the film playing the voice of news reporter Roxanne Ritchi who is involved in a very interesting love affair with Stiller's character Bernard. David Cross's and Jonah Hill's characters join the party as well playing the characters of Minion and Hal respectively in very different and dynamic performances. Despite the voices of these actors, the best part of the film is the entertainment value that Will Farrell brings to the table.Brad Pitt's character Metro Man is also animated to a T, depicting exactly what Pitt would look like as an animated superhero. However, Pitt is almost nonexistent in the film after the opening ten-minutes of the movie. Where did he go? The disappearance of Pitt hurts the film and complicates the story line that should have been simple and straightforward. The film suffers from animated movieitis stemming from plot holes, discontinuities and lack of substance. Characters that should not have been very important to the film are developed into main characters, while making the film ""Pittless."" Therefore, the movie as a whole does not succeed in creating a compelling story.Overall, the film is a very entertaining, fun family film that everyone can enjoy. However, you can wait for DVD to see it. Also, don't expect a film in the same league as ""Toy Story 3"" or ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" instead expect a film that relies solely on the humor of Will Farrell as he succeeds in stealing the spotlight on the animated screen once again as he did in the 2006 film ""Curious George.""",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Perfect Example of Why You Do Not Judge a Book by its Cover ...,"I know I am many years late in writing this, but I LOVE this movie !!!I collect all movies staring the FratPack ... and had this movie not stared any of them I would probably, honestly not have thought to watch it, I wont lie I did not think it was going to be a good one, good guy yayee bad guy yayee and the lady of course ... a typical movie. But I Love that I was proved wrong - Megamind is just absolutely great - Will Ferrell as Megamind, there could honestly have been no- one better for this role. Jonah Hill Fantabulous, Titan is just a total looney but this movie teaches us to care and love even those who who might not be who you normally like.I could honestly go on forever - this not just a must watch movie, this is a must own !!!Great for for the whole family and entertaining from start to finish -this is a movie for you if you just need a good laugh :)",,Anonymous,Animation
Playing with Good Guy and Bad Guy Characters,"It was the best movie in the world since I watched it as a kid. The way it shakes up the bad and good characters, the bad character winning, etc. Let's admit it. We all admired bad characters when we were kids. For example, I was a relentless Ryuga and Spectra fan. The good guys' good tricks really adored me, even when I was a kid, imagine how much I love it now. This movie actually tells exactly that.The good guys living their goodness to the fullest, even if not as much as Jesus. The way they say pithy words as if they were giving public service announcements of goodness. Their being flawless. Their being far from human. In other words, no matter how good they are, we can't be that good. That's why they seem distant to us. So what's the point of these guys? Naturally, they distance themselves from us. Metro Man is actually such a good guy. He's a perfect guy in every way. He's exactly like the guy I hated when I was a kid. But the movie quickly changes direction on this issue. Megamind, who is the exact opposite of him, is bad because he has to be. In other words, he's not a Judge Holden or anything like that. It has to be bad. He got used to it. It's a system that goes like that. It's not that he's bad, I mean he also has human emotions, but what can you do? Oh, and the fact that these two are actually thrown from the same place at the beginning of the movie, but even the capsules their families threw them into, the place they landed after coming into the world, etc., and the wink that the distinction between good and bad is also related to upbringing and socioeconomic status is sweet. After all, this is an animated movie and children will watch it. They didn't philosophize for a long time, they just wrote a subtext and moved on.Things go wrong in the movie in a short time and Megamind kills Metro Man. After that, he takes over the whole city, but that's it. He gets so bored of this situation that he thinks about it. And he decides that he's in this situation because of Metro Man's shortcomings rather than him not being bad. Because there's nothing else that can be thought of other than him being the bad guy. He creates a new Metro Man, but this time, Metro Man is really bad. In other words, we think that people with superpowers and lasers coming out of their eyes should have ideal and extremely good selves, Megamind, and we don't. Hal's only goal is to get the girl, but he learns that she's been hanging out with Megamind. Then they find Metro Man. He's not actually dead, but he's also tired of this cycle. Now he refuses to return to his duties. He's also aware that his fight with Megamind was in vain, that there's no such thing as good or bad, and that only social roles are filled in a way. However, he can't help it and Megamind defeats this bad guy all by himself. This sentence sums it all up. Megamind defeats the bad guy. He's not bad anyway. He's never been bad. He had to be bad. He was given such a role. And he fulfilled it. Now, portraying bad guys as idiots doesn't cover up their badness and showing a little conscience doesn't humanize them, but Megamind is exactly an example written for this type of character. In other words, he's not really a bad person. He's just someone who's been playing his role for a long time. In the last scene, at the ceremony where Megamind will receive the key to the city, what Metro Man, who is hiding in secret clothes, says to Megamind ends the movie. ""Way to go little buddy. I knew you had it in you."" Thus, we learn that Metro Man is not a hero like Homelander, but deep down he wants Megamind to be a good person, and we end the movie with the happiest ending we can get.The animation quality was good, but I wish it was a little better for 2010. At least those interesting effects. It seemed a little old to me. But the movement effects of the characters were very good, I liked them. The character designs are also very good. Metro Man and Megamind characters are great characters in terms of design. The fish was also very cute. I think the animation quality was good. The music is also good in general, but it seemed a little bit lacking to me. Maybe that's why they are good. The movie wasn't so music-heavy, but there are still some good pieces. It just doesn't have that iconic piece that is in almost every animation.Brad Pitt's voice acting of Metro Man was great. I think it's very sweet that he is a premium friend in every field. William Farell did a very good job too. The other characters don't talk much anyway. The voice acting was generally good.Megamind is not a feature-length philosophical film that re-examines the concepts of good and bad, but it is a sweet film that re-examines the good and bad character types at a children's level, and at the end of the day, it is a sweet film that ends happily. Although it is behind the animated films I have watched so far for adulthood, I think it is quite ahead in terms of the importance of showing it to children. There is even a small ""be yourself"" themed love story in the film, what more could you want.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the most underrated films ever,"Megamind is genuinely funny, entertaining, and emotional. It appeals to adults as much as kids, as some of its jokes are actually clever as opposed to the stale fart and butt jokes of ""Minions"".

Rise of the Villains?,"Let's be honest- we all love a good villain. Not one of us can say there hasn't been a movie where we have like the villain more than the hero. A classic example would be the Disney animated movie cartoon. Which of us hasn't fast forward through ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" to get to ""Be Prepared"" or skipped ""Part of Your World"" in order to see ""Poor Unfortunate Souls""? Villains just always seem to put on a great show that we, as the audience, love to watch. In recent children's movies, directors have taken an advantage of this love. Movies in which the villain is the main character have begun to surface. I loved this idea when I first heard it mentioned, but my excitement was ruined with my viewing of Despicable Me. This movie was alright, and there were some pretty funny scenes, but overall the movie was cliché and mediocre. I watched Megamind with hesitancy, wondering what I would get, but to my pleasant surprise I really enjoyed this movie. The movie had a great plot and perfect voice actors to match the characters. The story was basic yet enjoyable, a perfect balance found in successful family films. All in all, this movie has me yearning for more movies with the villain in the forefront.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A worthy contender,"This was yet another clever animated feature that had a unique storyline and good entertainment quality.

Will Ferrel portrays an interesting and yet hilarious voice for the lead character Megamind, and the rest of the voice cast are just as well entertaining for this movie. The high-flying camera scenes are quite a thrill and the movie doesn't tend to lose too much interest.

"Noisy, wild, hyperactive, crazy...  pretty good!","Noisy, wild, hyperactive, crazy... depending on how you interpret those words will likely determine how much you like this movie. The comparisons to ""Despicable Me"" (which came out a few months earlier) are inevitable, as is those who will line up behind one or the other as better. Personally I go with Despicable Me for its extra heart, wittier dialogue and more laughs.One thing that Megamind has in abundance is dazzling animation on a grand scale. The destruction is phenomenal in some scenes, and the battle between Megamind's Monster Machine and his Monstrous Creation (Titan) has some of the hardest hits I've ever scene in any film. I also liked the insights into the superhero genre and seeing the caricature hero & villain both evolve in the course of the movie.It did start to get predictable in the last half, to the point where I started guessing lines of dialogue (much to the amazement of my boys) and correctly foresaw plot twists. Also, many scenes in the movie are backed-up by raucous 80's & 90's metal, and there's a lot of noise and high-intensity action throughout the film. While I do like this stuff, it has to be balanced for the right impact and here it just felt like an assault of the senses. Last of all, there is a lot of exposition, (starting from the opening intro) and I think it would have been a better film to follow the old adage, ""Show, don't tell"".Overall, it was enjoyable and entertaining. Some good laughs, some hard actions, great special effects... worth watching. But Ohlo, not for small children!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Megamind uses his super villainous cranium to create an unoriginal scheme.,"Dreamworks animations are hit and miss for me. Will Ferrell is usually boisterously unfunny. And superhero fatigue started to develop back in 2010. With all that being said, Megamind was fine. However, it trails behind similar animations 'Despicable Me' and 'The Incredibles' by recycling specific plot points that unfortunately makes this story mega uninspiring. A large headed villain of Metro City finally prevails and destroys his nemesis Metro Man, only to realise that his life now has no purpose. The beauty of this family-friendly animation is its reversal of typical clichés often found in renowned superhero comics. Megamind's origins mimic that of 'Superman' and a certain creepy crawly is a reference to 'Spider-Man'. It adds light hearted humour to what is a predominately overly familiar plot. The plan to make everyone superheroes and an army of disposable minions (although less annoying) are two clear plot details that were utilised more efficiently in superior films. Consequently, this leaves poor Megamind overshadowed. What also does not help is the abnormally slow pacing during the second act as it attempts to balance several subplots, including a romance. Fortunately though, newly created Titan goes power hungry and the third act saves the entire film from being a total disaster. Increased emotional stakes, exhilarating action and a good message regarding fate. The voice cast were decent, Ferrell was surprisingly charming (although occasionally shouts his lines) however Pitt was vastly underused. The animation felt unfinished, lacking polish on specific textures and character models that did take me out of the story. Its visual and literary humour tried too hard and unfortunately missed the mark on several occasions. Still, for a family-friendly animation, it's watchable and will keep the kids quiet. However nothing stands out, lacking in originality, humour and visual flair. Wasn't for me I'm afraid.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
http://theojreviews.blogspot.com,"Megamind came out in 2010 and is based on a villain in the usual Hero VS Villain world. The story line went a completely different way than I expected though the trailers didn't provide too much story. The film itself was quite good although some parts I did feel were a bit stupid. The hero, known as Metro Man, looks as though he is a main character in the plot but he only really appears at the beginning. It all centres on Megamind himself who realises he isn't really a villain. So he does some things (not to spoil) that backfires and that creates an even badder villain. A love story is sort of intertwined but it wasn't really needed. Over all I would probably watch it again if it was on TV but its not the best film I've ever seen.",,Anonymous,Animation

After more and more studios jump on the computer animation bandwagon, you will soon be lost in the onslaught. That's still a ways off in the future, though.""Megamind"" is the newest minion in DreamWorks' army of family animation films (""Shrek"", ""Madagascar,"" ""How to Train Your Dragon""). With an A-List cast, it delivers humor and enough action to keep the audience entertained for the most part. Not a lot of inside jokes for Mom and Dad but the soundtrack (familiar songs by AC/DC and Guns 'n Roses) will provide a nostalgic trip for them while the kiddies are watching a couple of superheroes destroy a city.The film has the essential plot elements of the antagonist and soon-to-be protagonist Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) and his desire to become an evil super genius. In Ferrell's best Vincent Price voice, he narrates to the audience on how he became such an evil mastermind. He also explains his modus operandi on why he wants to be the bane of Metro City (as a running gag he mispronounces the name of the city). We find that he spent his childhood in a prison (one of the world's only fun prisons by the way) and having to compete with Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt) in school (another word Megamind can't pronounce).We follow Megamind's growth into adulthood where he chooses the path of evil while Metro Man chooses the path of good. When Metro Man is accepting an award for being, well, Metro Man, Megamind kidnaps a local news reporter, Roxanne Ritchi (voiced by Tina Fey). A few things go wrong and unknowingly Megamind kills Metro Man. This was not part of the plan. As most of you know if you kill off your nemesis there will be no more adventures. There will be no more extravagant duels. More importantly there will be no more money to be made off of the franchise. When Metro Man ""dies"" and we are left with Megamind and his Minion (voiced by David Cross) to rule Metro City.Megamind quickly decides that it would be best to invent a new enemy so can cure his overwhelming depression. He needs a yin to his yang, someone to fill the void that Metro Man left. He unintentionally injects super serum into Roxanne's camera man's nose (voiced by Jonah Hill). Megamind trains his new protégé, Tighten (which is a misspelled moniker of Titan), to become a superhero so they can have an enormous duel and then Megamind can become the super villain that he once was.While exacting his evil plan, Megamind is falling in love with Roxanne while he is posing as a nerdy museum curator. And while doing that he ... you know what? It is already too confusing. For a kid's movie, the story is about as clear as mud. The exciting final fight scene (which imitates the ending fight scene of Pixar's ""The Incredibles"") is what the kids will remember the most. You will see some exceptional 3D fight scenes through out the film. If you liked the animation DreamWorks did with ""How to Train Your Dragon"" then you won't be disappointed here.Should you see this movie? Are you a kid ages 4-12? Sure, then go see it. Don't try to follow the story too closely, leave that up to Mom and Dad to try to decipher. Eat your popcorn, drink your soda, laugh at some of the crude jokes, try to relate to Megamind when he was a kid and ride it out to the end. Then wait for Pixar to come out with a story that we can all follow.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Scripted Hollywood checklist pleasure; nothing out of the ordinary,"This movie felt like it was scripted with a ""hollywood checklist"" and if you had read what you are going to see (supervillain turns superhero) you knew the rest of the story: The supposedly surprising personal makeover of the four main characters, the main character pushing away his best friend for love, reunited in battle, the dead yet undead hero, blablabla. There is virtually not a single surprise in the storyline! It's a dead movie, even though the animation technology is supreme and there are a couple of laughing moments.

A real show,"Nice, strange and new. Ironic image of super heroes and interesting metamorphose of evil. Few slices of love story and an adorable character. Bleu,intelligent, childish and fragile, with an unhappy childhood, Megamind is perfect icon of our time. Behind him, rock-star Metroman, a kind of Elvis Presley or bored Charming Prince.Few fight scenes,a museum inauguration, a surprising victory and question of life sense.A Frankenstein creature. The error. In final, the clothes of Charming are perfect for new hero of town. Movie ad usum delphini, like every cartoon, tale about values and entertainment,Megamind is more. Game with rules and reflection of few ordinary crisis. Modelation of old definitions and replacement of marginal character.

A Fairly Decent And Unorthodox Superhero Movie Let Down By Poor And Lazy Plot Decisions,"Pros:
1. The animation is fantastic which allows for some incredible shots to be shown.
2. The soundtrack is great as it adds a fun and lively feel to the film.
3. Will Ferrell (Megamind), Jonah Hill (Tighten) and Tina Fey (Roxanne Ritchie) deliver really good voice-acting performances.
4. The comedy is utterly hilarious and produces many memorable moments and interactions between the characters.
5. The costume design is well-detailed and they perfectly represent the aforementioned heroes and villains.Cons:
1. The character of Metro Man (Brad Pitt) is not fleshed out enough for his death to be impactful, and the sympathy for his character is limited by the fact that he's introduced to the audience as a bully which sent Megamind on his way to super villain.
2. A lot of the humour is inserted inappropriately into supposedly serious moments which dilutes their impact.
3. The love story between Megamind and Roxanne Ritchie feels rather forced, and seems inserted to serve as a cheap way for Megamind to undergo a moral transformation, as well as for Tighten to take the role as super villain.
4. David Cross (Minion) gives a stale voice-acting performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Reversal of Classic Superhero tropes,"Megamind tries to present the viewpoint of the classic arch-villain in superhero movies. It is self-deprecating and very original for the genre. The protagonist (the person you should root for) is presented as the arch villain against the perfect ""goody two shoes"" hero adored by society.What makes this cartoon special is that there is no 'switchback' where the hero suddenly demonstrates bad intentions or the 'antagonist' suddenly finds some higher meaning to be redeemed. That is the amazing Yin and Yang to experience in this cartoon. One exists because of the other, and has no purpose when isolated.We get to know why MegaMind has grown up unfairly to be a underprivileged dick, but we also realise that he might have been a pretty productive member of society without the degradation that he received from the privileged 'hero' from kindergarten days.I have to credit the characterization in this film. No black and white setups.The characters are totally believable in their inner conflicts and character progress. Even the main baddie is understandable in his own, self-gratifying way.Well made, humoristic and worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Quite different from other superhero animations,"I saw this the other day, with my two kids and wife at the cinema, this is a great movie, even though it's quite different from other superhero animations, you can't help compare it to them.

I don't mean this in a bad sense, that's good that it's main focus is on the kids and can really entertain them.It is entertaining all the way through, a bit chaotic at times and seems to jump or leave out some scenes, but all-in-all it works very well.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stereotypical and unconvincing.,"Just came across this tonight and kind of hung on, all the while not being really amused.Annoyed, that's what I felt.Apparently now every film needs minions. Don't ask me why, I can't say I ever saw one I liked, but there you go: the main protagonist has a minion. I guess they take the place of what used to be called the sidekick.Everyone who has seen five movies, five tv shows and read five novels, must have noticed, especially not being American themselves, how ALL the writers seem to draw from what must be something like the collective American source of truths, half-truths, myths, legends and assorted misperceptions.One example of this, see if it rings a bell: every film or show has at least one character with a crippling fear of clowns. All over the world they are viewed as funny, sometimes acrobatic, but in the collective US minds they should be feared.Another standard prejudice comes to the fore in this movie: everyone on the wrong side of the law listens to hardrock or metal music. Here we hear ACDC and Guns & Roses when Megamind is being evil. I listen to classic rock, hardrock, metal, and I can assure you: metal fans are the most relaxed, tolerant, openminded people on the planet.In another way the female protagonist behaves real lifelike: she prefers the bad boys. Women seem to get aroused by men with a rough edge, and then complain that there are no good men left. There are, but they're not wanted.Lots of fast action, good guy turning bad, bad guy turning good, all in all pretty unconvincing.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Although it was not your average Super-Hero movie, which was what I was expecting, it was much cleverer then that, and it even managed portray some great morals. You become very attached to the characters and very interested in the plot, it is very eye-catching and keeps you locked in till the very end.It is definitely a movie for the whole family, enjoyable for all. A great success.",,Anonymous,Animation
Megamind can even raise the discussion of what makes a person become a criminal and for children is nothing more than a great and fun game,"We all love a good villain. Ask any actor if he prefers to play Othello or Iago as they will all say ""Iago"" at the same time. But, what happens when a villain achieves his goal? This is the question proposed by ""Megamind"", an interesting and fun animation by DreamWorks.Metro Man and Megamind have been enemies since childhood and both ended up on Earth as babies, running away from problems on their planets. Metro Man, by a series of random factors, managed to park his ship in a luxurious house, grow up in a prosperous home, have a good education and be admired by everyone for his superpowers. Megamind (due to the same random factors, but which always seem to be unlucky in relation to him), he parked in the prison yard and was ""educated"" by the detainees. The reunion of the two extraterrestrials, years later, at school, would mark the official beginning of the rivalry. Megamind, after several unsuccessful attempts to win the attention of the gang (who were totally focused on Metro Man, the ""Mr. Right""), he decides that being bad is his true specialty and from then on he becomes a great evildoer to whom Metro Man needs to stop, especially from the dream of dominating Metro City.Adopting a narrative structure based on a long flashback as we see Megamind falling towards certain death, Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons' script is happy to introduce us to a story that gets it right on different layers - as did the excellent The Incredibles. So, in addition to a good adventure, the film works as a criticism of prejudice, and a poster of Megamind saying ""No, you can't"" reflects this by immediately referring to the campaign that elected Barack Obama as president. In addition, good elements about the culture are also added to the exceptionality and the pressure that the population exerts on the differentiated ones.However, the tape wouldn't work if it didn't have charismatic characters and everyone loves a bad boy. As we've known Megamind since his childhood and barely followed Metro Man's trajectory, we became more sympathetic to the azulão, we understood his motivations, laughed at his nonsense and even became fond of him, just like his sidekick, Criado. In this sense, when a new villain appears in the city, we are not rooting for Megamind just because he is ""less villainous"" than the newcomer, but because we really like the character. Looking at it this way, ""Megamind"" seems to be a very serious work, but it deals with these themes with a very welcome lightness, never wanting to be more than an uncompromised cinema session, presenting such dense conflicts more as a backdrop, without trying to hammer them. Them on the viewer's head forcibly. The participation of the creative consultant Guillermo Del Toro, who specializes in presenting heavy questions without losing his tenderness, is welcome, see the great features of the ""Hellboy"" series.Aside from the unidimensionality of the reporter Roxanne Ritchi and the Servant, a comic relief that reveals a generous heart, Megamind, Metro Man and Titã make a great trio of formidable characters. The first reveals the loneliness of someone who for years wanted to be just accepted and the sadness that grips him when he discovers the emptiness that Metro Man's death had caused him is palpable. This, in turn, achieves the feat of being much more than a Superman, belching his superpowers arrogantly and recognizing the burden of carrying the entire population of Metro City on his back. Finally, Titan shows why great powers should not be given to people with complex and low self-esteem.At the same time, director Tom McGrath still finds time to develop great action sequences. The flight scenes, with the help of 3D glasses, were superb and the confrontations that take place during the narrative, always absurdly megalomaniacal, are very fun to watch. The script presents a good balance between denser components and pure fun, although the tape clearly puts more emphasis on this second side. The photography of the film is also a good point to be highlighted, leaning towards lighter and more illuminated tones.The animation still manages to have a fluid rhythm through interesting raccords and a spectacular visual in the creation of the city Metro City and in the headquarters of Megamind. Exploring the concepts presented, a watch that steals identities or an invisible car ends up conveniently returning instead of being discarded after its use. McGrath is still subtle and intelligent in making a multitude of references to the universe of superheroes, even earning his own version of the Jor-El incarnated by Marlon Brando in the 1978 film! More attentive comic book fans will also notice subtler references, such as the alliteration in the girl's name (RR) and the Metro Man museum, a clear homage to the Flash Museum. Even the concept of Captain America's super-soldier in creating Titan is used here.Amid the comedy, some moral and ethical discussions (based and deviations and remission of conduct) give a more serious and less childish air to the film. This seriousness, in turn, is accompanied by a soundtrack that definitely amazed and enchanted viewers of classic works such as Crazy Train (Ozzy Osbourne), Highway to Hell and Back in Black (AC / DC), Welcome to the Jungle ( Guns N'Roses), Bad (Michael Jackson), A Little Less Conversation (Elvis Presley, in a very good remix version) as well as moments of pure scenic-musical comedy, such as the accidental reproduction of Lovin 'You (Minnie Riperton), in front of the entire Metro City, as Megamind takes full command of the city. What we do not have in aesthetic difficulty in building the image of the film (despite the great graphic), we have in compensation through the sound field, whether in sound editing or in music (original or not).A work like Megamind comes to theaters and draws a dividing line between these two audiences: part of the film only understands adults (like the joke with the ""good father"" of the ""good hero"" Titan: what child would know that it was a imitation of Marlon Brando?), and for containing an extremely dynamic and less childish narrative (including in the message that passes), it also receives the effusive applause from the child audience. In addition, sequences that touch the sensitivity of all the viewers make some scenes absolutely unforgettable: who hasn't been enchanted by the Servant's ""needy gaze"", or who hasn't laughed at Megamind's language mistakes? Friendship, love, good and evil are the pillars that support Megamind and the figure of the anti-hero has won a noteworthy job here. In an unusual world, bizarre situations and outlandish plans gain the grace of the absurd.In addition to being a fun movie, with good jokes that makes laughing easy in all situations, some interesting questions are raised, since the character's characterization at school for being different and how it affected his whole life, raising that idea that others have turned you into a villain, making us reflect on how our relationship with others can affect you, the evils of some people can be an answer to what they have experienced. In addition to the classic ones, whoever you are, the destiny is up to you, everything depends on your choices, and what defines the human being is not his appearance, but his attitudes. Anyway, a beautiful film, with good intentions.Megamind can even raise the discussion of what makes a person become a criminal: are they born or is the character shaped according to the influences they receive? To what extent are heroes good and virtuous and villains evil? Too philosophical for young children? Okay, this is even for adults. For children, Megamind is nothing more than a great and fun game. It's a cartoon that entertains all ages and has some surprises, from comic books and cinema references, to a soundtrack that is extremely consistent with the film's premise. Dreamworks' creative minds leave nothing to be desired compared to the incredible minds of Disney / Pixar.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A good movie, even if it's not brilliant.","This film follows the trend, of the ""good villains"" in animated films, more and more evident since ""Despicable Me"". In fact, both films are from the same year and its difficult not to make comparisons, but I will resist this temptation. The core of this film is a hero vs. villain fight, where Megamind, the villain, manages to finally win, which puts in question the purpose of his life forward, without a good guy who fight against him. Its clearly thought out for teenagers and young adults and action is a fundamental part of the fun, along with good humor. Drawings and animations were really well made, the plot is good and pace is perfect, with no dead moments or annoyingly boring situations. But it lacks that spark of brilliance that you see in films that last forever and become classics. This spark, this film does not have, not being remarkable or memorable.

It's Despicable Me + Superman,"2010 has seen many animated movies with the same 3D treatment which include March's ""How to Train Your Dragon"", May's ""Shrek Forever After"", June's ""Toy Story 3"", July's ""Despicable Me"" and the recent ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"" which blasted on September. While October sees none, November's first animated film (the second one being ""Tangled"") is ""Megamind"", a similar movie to ""Despicable Me"" but in a Supermanalized version.""Megamind"" uses concepts from Superman such as a foreign planet is on the way to destruction while one little young of the species is hoped to survive and live in another planet. That's what has happened to Megamind. But the twist is that there are two outer-spaced people and the other one is Metroman, the more Superman-like person compared to Megamind.Just as Megamind was about to arrive at a royal, happy house on Earth, Metroman gets the spot first and bumps Megamind's capsule causing Megamind to end up in jail. There, Megamind learns criminal stuff and soon, when he grew up, he faces off his nemesis Metroman. But, when Metroman has lost and died, bored, Megamind creates a new super-powered hero. But, the new super-powered person didn't want to become a hero but instead a villain. Megamind, for the first time in his life, becomes a hero.Megamind is a unique character. With the big blue head, his plans are actually ingenious but is easily tricked by other people. This makes him a funny criminal rather than a scary one. He has a friend named Minion which is a fish that has a robot body. He's like Dr. Doofenshmirtz in Phineas and Ferb but slightly more intelligent and better luck.By the way, you might be wondering what Tina Fey's character does in the story. Well, her character, Roxanne Ritchi is a reporter for a newscast who supports Metroman. After Megamind impersonates as a friend of hers, she starts to have a relationship with him even after Megamind was discovered of pretending to be her friend.Of course, what fuels animated movies is the jokes. That seems to be what lacks in ""Megamind"" as the original jokes are quite a few. But, one of them was ingenious.The 3D effects were satisfying enough for me and they were quite deep enough for an average 3D movie. The animation was not so stiff and the locations and everything was very much detailed.Voice performances were excellent especially Will Ferrel's who owns the part of the titular character. Tina Fey's performance was also well and seemed to sound confident. Brad Pitt shows his talent of voice acting too. David Cross who plays Megamind's pet fish is also well and satisfying. Jonah Hill's performance as Hal or Titan was also excellent. The acting was all good.Overall, ""Megamind"" is a perfect kid's movie even though a big blue headed hero may sound scary. But, kids will definitely enjoy the film very much as I do with the lovable characters especially Megamind himself who is funny and ingenious. ""Megamind"" is truly recommended.Prince AJB's Score: 8/10Thank you for reading my review on ""Megamind"". Hope it's useful.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Decent Movie,"Megamind was a fun movie to watch. It's basically in my opinion about looks. One character gets the best in life based on the way he looks, while the other has to resort to villainous ways to get attention. And Brad Pitt plays Metro Man, which is really cool to watch. I would recommend Megamind, but it does get boring after a bit. Perhaps try The Incredibles?6 Stars",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"OK but too much plotting without enough heart and character and, frankly, not as funny or as child friendly as it should be","I'm sure the recent subpar offering of Cars 2 eased their pain, but Dreamworks must feel the pain more than anyone else when Pixar give us Wall-E, Up and the like while Dreamworks give us solid animations that always seem to get close but no cigar. Reminiscent of The Incredibles (albeit in superhero theme only), Megamind unfortunately joins the ranks of ""OK but no Pixar"" films in my mind as despite its obvious cost, it fails to deliver on its full potential. The plot sees us joining the perspective of supervillain Megamind who has time and time again been thwarted by his opposite number (Metroman) only to escape his jail and try again.The first most obvious problem with the film is the plotting – because there is loads of it. I'm not suggesting that it needed dumbing down but it felt like there was almost too many scenes where developments were occurring or things were being laid out and it seemed to push out other things. Specifically it pushed out time for character and heart because it lacked both of these. It is hard to describe perhaps but most of the Pixar movies seem to effortlessly bring a sense of engagement that makes you care about the characters in the film, with Megamind I was following the story but had no real investment in them. The second thing that was weak was the laughs because I was surprised by how few of them there were. I laughed enough times to justify the film as a comedy but again there seemed to be too much time where ""plotting"" was happening and not enough ""asides"" or comic aspects were put in – when they were they were funny but it was not often enough.The plotting and the nature of the plot also limited it in its appeal to all audiences and, ironically for a cartoon, it felt like younger viewers would be the ones left out in the cold. Not only does the time spent on ""things happening"" push out other stuff but the plot itself is fairly dark and it isn't particularly made accessible for younger ones. The death of characters is the best example of this but there are others that were key to what was going on but would either be difficult or go over the heads of children – even my girlfriend turned to me during the film and said ""this better have a happy ending"" (she is guarded about such things since I upset her with the animated film 9 recently).The film is naturally loaded with names when it comes to the cast and this tends to be the way with Dreamworks. In the lead roles I understand it but the star names go all the way down to smaller characters with barely a word to say. Ferrell and Fey cannot help but disappoint because, although their delivery is good, they are nowhere near as funny as they have been elsewhere, just not even close. Pitt seems an odd choice for a voice-only roll and indeed I can think of others who could have done a much better job with the rather hammy, clean-cut hero type. Cross on the other hand is more than welcome and has the delivery and the material with his funny support character, while Hill has character in his voice and does well also. I'm not sure though, for the value they bring, why they bothered Stiller, Simmons, Theroux and others to crowd the place with names.Overall Megamind is a decent enough film. The plot is good in idea but lacks heart and characters to bring it alive and engage, probably in part because it has too much going on and not enough time to let us care about it. Laughs are compromised too and, while funny, it is only sporadically too and all three of the children (below 10) I know who saw this were pretty bored by it. Decent stuff but yet again one cannot help but compare to Pixar, and things like the Incredibles that simply highlight the failings of things like Megamind.",,Anonymous,Animation
MEGA indeed.,"Megamind is a fun film that mocks the conventions of superhero movies while simultaneously celebrating them. With an all-star cast of celebrity voiceovers (which seems par-for-the-cause in those days days in BIG animated movies) it's a tale of redemption, romance, humour and a MASSIVE TWIST that I never saw coming. Let's face it, neither did you. Liar.There's action-packed fights and gadgets galore, and while it may not be the funniest film around it has it's fair share of amusing moments. The story about how a born outsider with a bald head and blue skin turns from good to bad and then back again is an affecting one, and the soundtrack is full of random groovy songs you wouldn't expect to hear going in.So, to wrap it all up then, I recommend you watch this highly diverting CGI animation.

Mega fun!,"I don't watch many animation movies except the very famous ones that are recommended to be damn good, but I had a feeling about this one. And it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen - animation or otherwise. I would rate it on the same level as Kung Fu Panda and Ice Age 3 (9 out of 10, 10 being death by lols).The plot in itself is engaging - a supervillain get terribly bored after vanquishing his arch nemesis - the Superman-heavy character Metroman. So he goes and creates a superhero of his own in order to get back to his good-vs-evil bit. But things don't go as planned - of course - and the movie just takes of from there.The characters feel real, the humor is very refreshing and off the cuff type, not your boring predictable sitcom style based on silly exaggerations. The level of the animation seemed quite good and the voice actors are perfectly suited for their roles - Brad Pitt as the superhero Metroman, Tina Fey as the beautiful reporter who keeps getting kidnapped by the evil Megamind voiced by Will Ferrel. There's even a minion named, well Minion. Throw in a douche bag cameraman, a grumpy jail house warden and the mayor for minor bits and we have a pretty solid cast.The best part is that while the movie is constantly hilarious, the plot and the characters don't stagnate at any point. Even though some parts are predictable, they are few and you aren't really watching a thriller so that you would expect a half dozen plot twists.One final thing - the music is awesome. In fact, it sets the tone of the whole movie and the choices made go really well with the characters and the situation.All in all, a superbly made, hilariously funny, refreshingly original and enjoyable experience!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hang on tight and be prepared for mega fun!,"We believe that God is fair – what one lacks in a certain department is probably made up in another.

And that is why we feel for comedians like Will Ferrell. He is not the most dashing leading man around, but he is one hell of a funny man.This latest feature from DreamWorks Animation is a fine testament to that: The title character's over swollen skull and blue skin makes him one of the most disturbingly ugly animated characters of all time, but like the actor who voices him, he is one hell of a funny creature.We feel for you, Mr. Ferrell, we truly do.When we first meet Megamind, he is falling to his death. A voice-over then brings us back to the day he is born, right up to the predicament he is facing at the moment. You see, Megamind has been trying very hard over the years to conquer Metro City. You name the method, he has tried it. He fails every time because of the existence of Metro Man, a caped superhero who seems too perfect to be true. In an unexpected turn of events, Megamind defeats and kills Metro Man. To balance the equation of good versus evil, Megamind creates a new superhero Titan, who eventually becomes a super villain. Throw in a love interest in the form of a pesky news reporter Roxanne Ritchi, and you get 96 minutes of wacky and exhilarating fun.Trust the filmmakers to gather a brilliant cast of voice actors for this production. Ferrell is a certified fast talker who provides most of the movie's best lines. The Saturday Night Live alum puts his talents of impersonations and spoofing a range of characters to good use here. Listen out for the fast talking Megamind as he delivers line after line of amusingly entertaining dialogue. Tina Fey is adorably humorous as Roxanne Ritchi the news anchor who refuses to be the damsel in distress, David Cross is a hoot as Megamind's under-appreciated piranha Minion, while Jonah Hill's goofiness comes through nicely as the menacing Titan. Rounding up the ensemble is Brad Pitt as Mr Goodie Two Shoes Metro Man. After voicing Sinbad in the studio's Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas some seven years ago, the hunky leading man personifies his usual arresting on screen presence with a duly fun performance.The next thing audiences would ask is: Is this worth the 3D ticket price? It is with great pleasure we tell you that it's a positive yes. Animations have always been a more welcoming medium for studios to milk the cash cow that is 3D technology. But those which truly capture the magic of the additional dimension are few and far between. Director Tom McGrath has managed to effectively feature this somewhat overused technique with good eye popping effect. Watch out as Megamind's Brain Bots fly towards you, clap your hands in glee as Metro Man whizzes at the screen, and gape in awe as balls of fire explode after one another, no thanks to Titan's newfound super power.These enthralling sensational moments would not be what they are without a witty and dynamite script. You'd be entertained every other minute by the sharp writing, and kept engaged by the dynamic plot development. While the young ones are wowed by the dazzling animation, the older audiences will be having fun with the fresh and crisp jokes.As the movie comes to an end, we almost forgot how hideous Megamind is. The guy has gotten a special place in our hearts.www.moviexclusive.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Storyline Was Not Completely Original,This is a fine film for all viewers to watch. I did not fully enjoy watching it. The storyline was not real original. The crew did not put much into creating this film. The storyline sort of mirrors Superman. It was a bit predictable on where it was going to go. The storyline had no real direction.The cast selection was brilliant. They committed to the storyline and to their respective characters. This animated film reveals to viewers the bravery and strength that anyone can have. There are multiple dangers in the world and everyone needs to be prepared for the unpredictable at any moment. This is an alright animated film for all viewers to watch.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great movie.,"This past weekend Husband and I saw the movie Megamind. I wasn't sure how it was going to be, but I was pleasantly surprised that: 1) Our outdated movie theatre is finally offering movies, including this one, in 3D.2) The movie was hilarious! We laughed so much throughout the movie. I'd go as far to say that it's one of the funniest movies, animated or otherwise, that we've seen in a while.The only unpleasant thing about the movie was the family behind us, where every single one of them (including the baby!) coughed loudly throughout the movie and sometimes in unison. (If I had had any cough drops or hard candy in my purse, I would have pushed them on this can't-stop-coughing family. Also, I vigorously washed my hands after the movie in irrational hopes that it might keep me from getting sick.) But coughing aside, it was a great movie.Enjoy Mark HTTP://human-teeth.com",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hilarious,"This movie was the funniest cartoon movie I had seen in years! Not only did it have a good plot, but the jokes (however, cheesy) were funny and made me laugh out loud. Younger children may not understand some of the adult humor (nothing inappropriate) throughout the movie, but they'll enjoy the characters and animation.I typically either love or hate Will Ferrell movies and this one I absolutely loved. It was Will Ferrell's humor at it's finest, and on a family friendly level.The plot was interesting because it wasn't a typical superhero movie, so the plot didn't follow the same pattern as most of the ""hero"" cartoons out there. It also sends a positive message. One of my favorite cartoons of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good.... Standard Plot..,"It is extraordinary! When you this movie you'll wonder that the Megamind is the bad one and maybe it is a movie for ""the enemy"" perspective.I think it would be better if the movie is given a superhero soul, like The Incredibles. The scenes was not placed well, but it's still entertaining. My suggestion is that you have to focus on the plot and still have a purpose.I like it for my weekend and congratulation to all contributors.

A very entertaining animation movie,"Megamind tells a story about a supervillain named Megamind, who creates a superhero who becomes evil, forcing Megamind to turn into a hero.What I like about Megamind is that it is a redemption story told in a fun and entertaining way. The story itself pokes fun at some of the cliches of the superhero genre, which was pretty hilarious. Speaking of hilarious, the whole movie is pretty darn hilarious. Will Ferrell's amazing comedic performance can be felt through his remarkable voice acting. I thought Jonah Hill's performance as Titan was also very funny and comical. Overall, Megamind is a good and enjoyable movie that is perfect for both kids and adults. I definitely look forward to watching this movie again in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Nutshell Review: Megamind,"The handsomest and most evil genius of all time versus the hero who fights with well- coiffured hair and a smirk, and a hero wannabe who decides that his newly gained powers is an avenue for sloth and riches. If there's one thing consistent in Megamind the film, that will be the huge ego issues everyone seems to possess, from Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) to Metro Man (Brad Pitt) to Tighten (best kept under wraps in case the trailers haven't ruined the surprise).Megamind touches on the classic tale of purpose, destiny and purpose. I wanted to prefix those attributes with ""human"", but these two sworn enemies of Metro City actually hail from outer space, where their home planets get engulfed by a black hole, but not before both get to spiral out of their planets through their rocketships ala the mythos of Superman. Finding themselves landing on earth, one becomes a city's protector because of the good nurturing done, while the other got the shorter end of the stick landing inside prison, and through a series of misfortune decided that enough's enough, and throws his weight on the other side of the moral spectrum.The film turns the superhero genre on its head, and one of the most obvious spins the storytellers here have a field day with is Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster 's Superman, with Metro Man clearly modelled after the Last Son of Krypton with his do-gooder ways and blessed with similar superpowers of flight, strength and that heat vision, and Megamind that of Lex Luthor, but infused with a lot more comedy which also came courtesy of a fishy sidekick aptly called Minion (David Cross). Then there's Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) who is the equivalent of Lois Lane, the news reporter with whom everyone associates a love relationship with Metro Man, and Hal (Jonah Hill) her geeky cameraman for the TV news channel who clearly has the hots for her. You'll earn your ticket back with a penny for every Supes related element discovered in the film.It's the familiarity of the characters here that augments the enjoyment of this animated piece by Dreamworks, and clearly when done right like the film here, it's a whole lot of fun, and brilliantly animated as well with a decent romantic core the catalyzes the second half rivalry between Megamind and his creation. The film plays on the notion of how there has to be evil in order for good to triumph over, of how we prepare for war to keep the peace, and how heroes get defined by the villainy they go up against. That, as well as the usual never judging a book by its cover and the likes of the usual moralistic messages in Alan J Schoolcraft and Brent Simons' story, makes it rather preachy at times.But for comic book and superhero fans, this film probably addresses square on why villains appeal, because they make the heroes look good, and if there should be the disappearance of either side, the entire sense of purpose would probably vanish, and interest waned. It is this thought that gets played out in a lot of detail in Megamind as the anti-hero struggles to find his place in society, and discover good values that far outweigh what he has been conditioned for.An eclectic soundtrack of contemporary songs also fit in well into the film, and one from the late King of Pop naturally found its way into the finale. With a host of voice talents such as J.K. Simmons, Justin Theroux and even Ben Stiller at its disposal lending cameo appearances, Megamind has what it takes to entertain, and although I didn't watch this in 3D, none of the scenes witnessed do require that format, other than for a handful of deliberately created ones which I thought Metro Man's flight in the beginning of the film en route to his rescue of Roxanne, will probably take the cake.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mega entertainer,"Hollywood doesn't seems to be running out of creative ideas very soon. 'Megamind' is a good example.Good animations always has its place. And with several big time animation studios doing their best to get to the sweet top spot we seems to be treated with superior stories, characters and overall superior animation quality year after year. And while the live action movies take up on comic book super heroes, 'Megamind' goes on creating super heroes and villains of its own and deliver it with a punch full of super power.Megamind (Voice by Will Farrell) is a super villain. After he left his dying planet at infant age and hits the planet earth his big blue head realized only one big reality. That is that no matter how good he tries to be good world does not except that. So he turn villain and become 'the' pro at that. But his eternal pain is Metro Man ( Voice by Brad Pitt) who is a super hero who shares the same fate as Megamind from a distant dead planet. Well he can fly but Megamind can't. One fine day after years of battling each other Megamind succeeds in destroying Metro Man. And then he realizes that the world is not the same place any more with his arch enemy is gone and no one to battle with. So Megamind sets to create a Super hero of his own to battle with but finds that he has made a grave mistake doing so.'Megamind' is fast phased. The first few minutes of the movie quickly creates a strong base to the rest of the plot and its solidly done. And the plot stands tall. Creative, amusing and yet emotional where it should be. And the very kick ass animation does its part so well some time your will have a dropping jaw. Some of the plots bits and pieces may seem familiar if you're a routine animation fan or a comic fan. Especially when Superman left Krypton to find his new home in Earth.The voice acting is great as well. Farrell and Brad who we have never seeing together in a real movie just makes lot of sense in this animation.'Megamind' is a nice family entertainer. It will make you laugh and gaze at wonderful quality animation throughout. It will make you realize that a super hero is of no use without a villain and every villain has some good in them. And no matter what color you belong to white, black or blue some day you will have a change of heart when you fall in love.Read my reviews at www.flickshout.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than Incredibles!!!!!,"I was shocked at how much i loved this film, and thoroughly pleased! The Trailers initially, i didn't fancy this one at all. And Megaminds design from the trailers i didn't initially like. The trailers kinda made this look like B grade fare, like say Hoodwinked or similar.BUT, WOW! As a fan of most of Pixar and Ice-Agees, I personally think Megamind is my new favourite of the lot! Ferrel was perfect, the designs and animation was stunning, and the storyline was interesting. I speak as an adult fan with no kids, this film had everything! It was witty, smart and well written/acted and spectacular.Toy story 3 was fantastic, but Megamind for me was more entertaining and funny. Incredibles was my number 1 pixar for a long time, and I wanted/want a sequel to that, but in Megamind, it bettered incredibles, and provided me with enough similar substance that it quenched my thirst as a sequel/spinnoff of sorts. But instead of following the Hero, we followed the villain. (As did Despicable me) But again, Megamind was much better.I only hope THIS gets a sequel. I'd actually rather a sequel to this now than incredibles.I love Pixar, but with Megamind/Kung Fu Panda and How to train Dragon, and cloudy meatballs, the other animation companies are seriously catching up!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not a masterpiece.,"This film offers two characters whose strength lies in the skill of their voice actors. Will Ferrell offers a good job in his character while Brad Pitt is not far behind. Megamind is a villain who, despite being successful in his evil plans, finds himself without love and that is the premise of the film. With the passing of the minutes we are taught that love redeems the wicked and that passion can turn a clumsy person into something absolutely harmful. With an idea as simple as this, a film is sustained that offers some laughs and weak entertainment that, compared to what is done now, deserves to be on a pedestal. The film never tolerated a sequel and it is good that the second part never took place.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
By far the worst animated movie I ever seen in 2010...,"since Madeline: Lost in Paris. While I didn't want to watch Legends of the Guardians or Shrek Forever After, I found this to be extremely unimaginative.First of all, it has brief references off of other movies. The whole thing made me want to watch Monsters vs. Aliens and I'd never thought there was going to be a redemption in this. It copied off a little musical piece from Up (2009). It copies off of 'Cloudy With A Chance of meatballs"" somewhat and all in all, it copies off of anime such as Full Moon o Sagashite. Where aliens/spirits turn into humans... WAIT! Aliens versus Spirits? O.K., that could be the weirdest thing I ever saw. This movie is a copycat.I've been wanting to see this movie for months now and I asked my mom to borrow her money to check out this movie and I nearly walked out of the theater during half of the movie. When you see the part where Megamind releases Roxanne, walk out of the theater and ask for a refund. It isn't worth it. Not even twenty minutes could make people get in touch with the movie.I came home and told my mom that I hated it and started writing on sidewalks ""Megamind Sucks"" like a mischievous boy.Please avoid this movie at all costs and wait until it comes out on Blu-ray and DVD. And I also forgot that this movie probably literally copied off of Despicable Me while it was in progress (Bad turns into Good). Anyways, please do not watch this even if I do write on your sidewalks. Ignore it! And watch Jackass instead,",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Megamind is a fun and entertaining film that doesn't try to feel or look real,"¨All men must choose between two paths: Good is the path of honor, friends, and family. Evil, well, it's just cooler.¨Megamind is a very fun animated film that doesn't have to be taken seriously like other recent animated movies. It doesn't try to look or feel real, it knows what it is: a cartoon. Megamind will be fun for both children and adults alike (unlike recent animated films-like Rango- that try too hard to target adults and forget that kids want to have a fun time as well). This isn't a movie that has deep meaning to it, or a strong message, or a lot of heart, but it does entertain audiences thanks to the strong voice acting and funny one-liners. The characters are rather simple and one dimensional, but fun to hang around with. Director Tom McGrath has already had success with these animated films as he directed both Madagascar films, and just like those two movies, Megamind should be enjoyed for what it is: an animated picture that is fun for the entire family. I thought that the writers, Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons, did a decent job with the script making it really funny at times thanks to some witty one-liners. With Will Ferrell and Tina Fey you really don't know how much was scripted and how much was really improvised, but the final result is what matters, and the movie was able to entertain all audiences. This isn't an original or memorable film, but it does manage to entertain and I really had a fun time with the movie.While Megamind (Will Ferrell) is going through a near death experience he tells us the story of his life from the very beginning. The blue creature with a giant head was born in another planet. This planet was being destroyed when his parents decided to send him to Earth as a baby in order to save his life. Megamind is travelling through the galaxy along with his talking fish named Minion (David Cross), who lives inside some sort of robotic suit. But Megamind is not the only alien headed for Earth. Another baby is headed this way with a normal human appearance; his name is Metro Man (Brad Pitt). Somehow destiny plays a joke on Megamind who ends up being raised by prisoners from a local jail, while Metro Man is raised by a rich family. Both kids grow up and become nemesis: Metro Man turns into the hero of Metro City, while Megamind finds his calling in life as a villain because it is the only thing he seems to be good at (although he doesn't do a very good job at it because Metro Man is always defeating him and sending him to jail). The people love Metro Man and declare him a local hero, while Megamind unsuccessfully tries to destroy him by being the Super-Villain. Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey) is the local News Reporter who is covering the inauguration of the Metro Man Museum when she is kidnapped for the hundredth time by Megamind. Against everyone's unbelief, including Megamind's, he destroys Metro Man and is successful for the first time in his life. But without an enemy, Megamind gets bored and loses his purpose in life so he decides to create another hero using Metro Man's DNA. This hero happens to be Titan (Hal), who actually turns into a villain himself instead of saving the city, so now Megamind will be forced to become the hero.The plot has several similarities to many superhero stories, and we might be reminded of other similar animated films such as The Incredibles, but Megamind still works as an entertaining animated film because it has an excellent voice acting cast. This film will have you entertained for 95 minutes and at the end you will leave the movie with a smile in your face. It doesn't try to be something that it isn't and that is why it is so fun. You don't have to remind yourself that you are watching a cartoon like in other movies that try to fool you by making these animated films look real and authentic. You can just sit down and enjoy Megamind for what it is, a fun and simplistic cartoon. Another plus is the soundtrack which just adds to the overall feeling and mood of light fun the film tries to convey. The vocal wit makes up for the lack of originality the movie has. This film should be taken lightly, but it does have a pretty positive message for those who like searching for meaning in movies: it reminds us that heroes are made and not born. We don't have to let our past and our surroundings shape our lives, we can change the course of our destiny and improve our past actions. It's not an original or strong meaningful message, but it reminds us that it's never too late to find our purpose in life in a very light, fun, and entertaining way.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Never Thought I Would LOVE This Movie!,"I saw this on a whim at my school. I did not know anything about it and had no idea what to expect.WOW! I have not laughed this loud in theaters in the longest time. It is hard to be laugh out loud funny without being offensive or crude these days, but Megamind exceeds with flying colors.Will Ferrell and Brad Pitt have a fierce villain/hero rivalry that escalates quickly. The plot thickens with not your average anchorwoman Tina Fey tries to figure out what the two of them are all about. Add in Jonah Hill as the dorky camera man in love with Tina Fey and you have a hit.The animation is great, the music is wonderful, and the dialogue is the best. The dialogue is creative and hilarious. I hope to see more from the writers of this film!Despite any prejudices you hold against Dreamworks or Will Ferrell etc, you should really go see this movie.

"""Bad guys always LOSE!""","Superheroes typically win the fight and get the girl in the end, but what happens when a supervillain succeeds? We see maybe a little bit of that scenario with ""Despicable Me,"" but ""Megamind"" throws superpowers and heroism in the mix to more effectively lampoon off of the ""Superman"" mythos. As a result, we get a rather intriguing premise, gracious amounts of action and eye-candy, and quite a few amusing laughs. The comedy's nice and slappy, with plenty of funny lines. Will Ferrell's style of humor works well for the movie. It's quite fun overall, and I'd put it on the same level as ""Monsters vs Aliens.""The story's pretty unique; it borrows a little from other sources, but once it gets going it develops a brilliant tale of deception and dramatic irony. The middle of the movie drags maybe a little, and the film overall feels a little hectic as it jumps from one mad situation to another, and then tossing one or two bizarre twists. But it all works out sublimely in the end. It also helps that the characters receive decent treatment with some solid emotional depth.The film shows strong animation quality. Movements are smooth, textures rendering and lighting are great, and the overall designs are stylish. It's similar in style and quality to ""Monsters vs Aliens."" Voice-acting seems good; Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, Ben Stiller, are all decent. Music features a lot of rock songs, which seem a little arbitrary, but usually do fit their given scenes.4/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Which is great for a kids' movie, as it explores the nature of good and evil, and the choices we all make. Also good for adults to engage with, since we also need reminded to consider such choices that are open to all of us.There are a few plot twists you might not see coming too, which serve the narrative brilliantly.Good story.

"Another cartoon.  How about a ""real"" movie?","This movie is just OK--but my general dissatisfaction has little to do with the plot or characters--but more on that in the last paragraph.The plot is about two babies from a planet that develops creatures with strength and powers beyond that of humans. Two of these creatures are jettisoned from the planet, and by pure random chance of where their spacecrafts land on earth, the Pitt character (Metro-Man) ends up in the home of a loving family, and the Ferrell character (Megamind) ends up in a prison for the mentally insane. This charts their future course in predictable ways--Metro Man becomes the hero of Metro City, while Megamind, after release from prison--the terms of the release and his upbringing at the ""S Chool"" (as humorously pronounced by Ferrell)--are never fully explained.Anyway, so it's made clear early on that Megamind isn't truly evil but is in it for the sport of it, while Metroman is a bit more full of himself as the hero than than, say, mild-mannered Clark Kent. As part of the plot a third character joins the mix as another super-human hero after a major battle between Megamind and Metroman. This adds a bit of complexity to a story that really has no business being complex--cartoon or not. It also adds dead time to the movie, as this new character isn't really very interesting. Anyway, in the romantic mix for all these characters is Tina Fey, who is the funniest part of the movie--she is a plus for any movie but as explained below--this movie's mediocrity has little to do with the talent.So without spoiling anything, we have an ending meant to satisfy us and bring closure to the characters. But this movie, and increasingly *every* animated movie lately, does not satisfy me--and it's not the plot or characters that fall short. It's that I'm tired of CGI animation. I don't care how ""good"" the quality is, how ""realistic"" it is--it's not real and frankly it's creepy. If I'm going to see a cartoon I'd prefer a real, hand-drawn cartoon. This CGI, in my opinion, is just wrong. It's too 'real' to be a cartoon but so completely unreal that I never get a true feeling for the characters--no matter how well-voiced or well-written they are. In the early days ""Toy Story"" was popular but I think the popularity had more to do with the novelty of the Pixar animation--the 'wow' factor. It's ho-hum now--even though the resolution, shading, texture, etc has improved. Ironically the more all of that technology improves the creepier these movies get. I could go on and on about how the newer Star Wars ""movies"" with Jar-Jar, et al., were soul-less bores, but I'll close here--and hope that those who agree will let their feelings be known to Hollywood. I'll take a real, filmed movie any time over this animation.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
cute,"I saw a commercial for Megamind just after seeing Despicable Me and was quite confused; wait, are they making the same movie twice in the same year? It was unfortunate for Megamind, which was both not as funny as Despicable Me and came out later, creating a been-there-done-that impression.But putting aside that other supervillain movie, Megamind is pretty good. It's an amusing little film with good performances, particularly from Tina Fey and David Cross, some nice action, and a charming but implausible premise.While it would have been better to have had a little more space between them, there is room in this world for both movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Megamind is the Best Animated film since Shrek.,"This is one of the best movies i have ever seen, despite it been animated the story line is awesome and creative, coming out with a brilliant trend to swap the villain, mega-mind in place of the long lost hero, metro-man.

Got to say i mean you have to get bored having to be used to seen the continues superhero, villain story line, but this movie is certainly unique in its kind.

Interesting take on some sort of Superman story.,"While not my favorite DreamWorks movie I can say with certainty it is a refreshing take on the superhero formula. Not being just a comedy that makes a parody out of the well known trope of such movies, Megamind actually takes its time to be a little thoughtful about the hero/villain duality.Because what would it be like if the villain actually won and took over the world? Empty and meaningless, if you ask the man himself, but he tries to make it meaningful again by means that go in all different direction and can make the movie seem a little crammed at times and a little unbalanced in how it wants to present itself.But overall it turns out an enjoyable result with the usual DreamWorks splendor in animation, casting and a killer soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I've even based an entire religion around this film. If you want to hear about it we will need to communicate through backchannels; the CIA has ordered me to stop. What more can I say?

"The real evil, is not seeing it just because you don't have kids.","It's tempting to say this tried to do for the superhero genre what Shrek did for fairytales. But I guess the difference is that Shrek was really a misunderstood hero and Megamind is the real deal villain which is a pretty bold move.It's not like he's not nuanced. During the opening origin story spiel it's hard to sort of shed a tear for him so that he is actually a remarkably sympathetic character and I was so rooting for him when he makes his jail break, so bad ass!What we have is a self conscious subversion of a very familiar formula that asks some very intriguing what-ifs about the hero-villain dynamic sort of reminiscent of the artists villainousness of the Joker.The pacy, always developing plot is most diverting and WIll Ferrells extravagant villain is just a delight against the smug do-gooder hero character. David Cross and Tina Fey also really bring as this movie proves itself worthy of our attention and avoids all the most obvious routes.A lot of the animated movies targeting families often don't set the bar high for themselves as they indulge in lavatorial humor and too many pop culture references but here we have something solid. It's not less mature than Ferral's other work (yeah, I know); it's just a story with a real substance and developed characters that is animated just because that's the easiest way to realize what it wants to do. Though animation is never quite easy I know...If you want something that can appeal to a wide section of the generation spectrum, something accessible to people who can't spell but yet totally isn't excruciating, despite it's off-putting poster and title, you could do so much worse than this.I also kind of liked the depiction of later in life romance and a sexy older woman in the prime of her life that unusually rocks the short haired look.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

It was more or less a film about an outcast looking for friendship.Brad Pitt's name was put up high on the list of actors to attract you but he as at the most 10 minuets of screen time.Will Ferreal gave it his best but he seemed out of place to me. Kids will love it because to them any Dream Works film is amazing (Maybe not one like Saving Private Ryan). But really if you only have kids like 6 or 7, this is good for them. If you've got kids in that age group and older kids like 8 or 9 then only the young kids will enjoy it. Pick one that will appeal to all ages.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ollo?,"Given how great a movie this is I don't find it gets enough love. It came out during a time where movies about the villain wanting to become a hero were quite common, some examples are Wreck it Ralph and Despicable Me. Both of which are good but I find Megamind tackles this trope the best. It plays a lot on well known superhero cliches in both a comedic and serious way but not so much that it's predictable. Given it's a movie aimed at kids the comedy is such that it can be enjoyed by all ages. My only issue is the pacing, it's paced well given its short runtime however it could afford to be a bit longer. Other than that, it's one of the better movies Dreamworks Animation has produced.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

There are few films that I will watch over and over again. However, this is one of them.

Skip this one,"This movie is very uninteresting, the main character is boring and it's not really funny either, why people find this movie so ""profound"" is beyond me, it might have something to do with brain damage. This movie has not really anything important and anything meaningful to say, in fact it gives very negative life lessons, like to judge people by their appearance and to let women do whatever they want without consequences. I didn't find any of the characters relatable, but by the end I was routing for the villain, because the writing is very bad. It being a superhero movie makes it even more bland, supp heroes have been done to death even back when this came out, it doesn't really do anything new with it either, since the powers in the movie aren't interesting and again the writing is very predictable and bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

The storyline was good, the ending was pretty undpredictable and the characters weren't overexaggerrated. It was a harmony of characters and emotions. And emotions it made me feel, were a lot. DreamWorks has never just made an animated movie, they have made memories, feelings and something to remember. The stories are very memorable and the characters, who are likeable, they always are extremely likeable, and the characters who were made to be unlikable, well, they are extremely unlikeable. Cinematic masterpiece. 10/10, would watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

In all fairness I'm watching this in 2024 so maybe some of the jokes haven't aged that well. Still, I don't think that explains it.

A story that never gets old,"I recently re-watched this movie because I hadn't seen it in a very long time and I sort-of forgot the story. All I have to say is....WOW. What an incredible movie. There is a very good and powerful message about choosing your destiny/your actions and it sticks with you. This movie knows exactly when to be serious and when to be funny. All the characters are very dynamic and you care about them and what they do. Even though Megamind is a villain, he has likeable qualities that make you root for him. There is strong character growth and it has a very natural/realistic feel to it (even though it isn't a realistic setting). The humor in it is more mature that a lot of other Dreamworks movies. It doesn't just rely on fart jokes so kids will laugh. It genuinely has some good humor to it. I honestly find this to be one of the best Dreamworks/ animated movies out there. I have found myself re-watching it a couple times. It never gets old.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Megamind,"Let me begin this review by saying that I was very pleasantly surprised with 'Megamind.' I was not expecting much beyond what we've all seen in the trailers: cheeky laughs, slapstick humor, and the like. While it is certainly all there and accounted for, I was very surprised by the level of humanity and realism underneath the misleading facade of colorful, CG images which might have implied this would be a kid's movie and nothing more. Some of the great parts of the movie are present in the first few minutes of the film, where we see how Megamind came to be a villain. We see a baby Megamind being carried by his parents, who tell him that he was destined to become something, though he doesn't remember what. He is sent to Earth at the same time as Metro Man, his opposite and future rival. As fate has it, the baby Metro Man crash lands in a rich family's house while baby Megamind crash lands in a prison. They are raised in their new homes, causing them to become what their environments expect them to become. This bit in which the babies are seemingly thrown into a place where they seemingly 'belong' sets the stage for a great exploration of the theme of identity and destiny, and begs the question of whether we have roles to play or whether we directly choose our own paths.Not much later, we see an older Megamind dealing with another problem that we should all be able relate to--the desire to be accepted by society. It is especially difficult for Megamind, being a the only blue alien among his many peers at school, while his rival, Metro Man, seems to always be the object of favor. As we get to understand Megamind's reasons for being a villain, there's an excellent example of role reversal--we perceive the 'bad guy,' Megamind, as the good guy, because we can relate to his problems and understand the motivation behind his actions. We also see the 'good guy', Metro Man, as the bad guy, because he is, ironically, less human than Megamind--Metro Man is without flaw, and is without any understanding or sympathy for Megamind. A good example is one of the earlier scenes, where Megamind accidentally starts a fire when he attempts to use a ray gun to pop corn for his classmates. Metro Man saves the class by extinguishing the fire, and he is praised while everyone shuns Megamind. Metro man and the class look past Megamind's intentions to be good, and only at the fact that a fire has been started from his attempt. They see Megamind in an unfortunately prejudiced way, and they don't consider the motivation for his actions, but only results of the actions themselves.At that moment, Megamind feels that he and Metro man are destined to have specific roles as the bad guy and the good guy. The whole beginning sequence on the earlier years of Megamind works for well, packing a lot of humanity into first the few minutes. This is great for several reasons--we are immediately to connect to and root for our main character, Megamind, and none of it feels rushed. We immediately understand his jealousy and his desire to be accepted and have his own role--he decides that if he can't be perfect like Metro man, he will try to be what he is 'good' at--being bad. It also enables the rest of the film to explore the development of Megamind's established character and whether he is really stuck with the 'role' he's been given--and it all plays out very well as he discovers the path to one's destiny and identity with his rival Metro Man and his love interest, Roxanne. The film is also legitimately funny on multiple occasions! In short, I believe Megamind is a mega-masterpiece, and that it is also very thoughtful, putting the 'mind' in MEGAMIND.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty dang good,"Watched it recently. Probably my favorite Dreamworks movie. Entire film is excellent and entertaining outside of a caricature used to make an ableist joke early in the film that I really didn't care for. Great for all audiences otherwise. Lots of clever jokes, great characters and character writing, and I like that Megamind flipped a lot of superhero tropes on their head in enjoyable ways.Megamind originally fell under the radar for me. Didn't know of its existence until a few years ago outside of a few memes, and didn't sit down and watch it until very recently. I heard this film was criminally underrated and overlooked, and while I haven't seen its reception myself, I can at least vouch that it's a great watch and I highly recommend Megamind to any fans of animated films, superhero-style films, or just fans of comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very entertaining,"When one thinks of Animation studios, the first 2 names that come to mind are, probably, PIXAR and DISNEY ANIMATION. Coming in 3rd on that list is probably DREAMWORKS with such hit franchises as SHREK, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON and KUNG FU PANDA. But Dreamworks also made a few, fun ""one-off"" films (animation films that spawned no sequels), most notably OVER THE HEDGE, SHARK TALE and the animated film I'm reviewing today, MEGAMIND.What? You don't remember MEGAMIND? Well, you should. Spooffing SuperHero films by focusing on the villain, Megamind stars some incredible voice talents - Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, David Cross and Johan Hill - and tells the cautionary tale of ""be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.""Ferrell, of course, stars as the titular Megamind, a Super Villain who after years of failure, finally defeats SuperHero Megaman (Brad Pitt). He realizes that without his arch-nemesis, his life is empty and begins to search for meaning in his life. Along for the journey is a reporter (Tina Fey), her Cameraman (Jonah Hill) and Megamind's Minion (long before Despicable Me), David Cross.Sounds like pretty standard stuff, huh? But in the hands of comedians like Ferrell, Fey, Cross and Hill it elevates itself to something more. The comic sensibilities make a little more sense to me when I realized that Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux were the Excecutive Producers - both very funny men. They, smartly, turned the Direction of this film over to Dreamworks Animation veteran Tom McGrath (REN & STIMPY, some of the MADAGASCAR films and THE BOSS BABY), he keeps the events of the film moving swiftly and simply, being really clear of the events and motivations of the players while not getting too clever and complex.I caught this film on HBO, and am sure you can stream it elsewhere. If you're looking for a fun film for the whole family this Holiday Season - especially one without Princes & Princesses in it - check out MEGAMIND, it's a fun way to spend a few hours.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A superhero movie with a mind of its own,"There are quite a few DreamWorks movies that you can call one of their best films, like their great movie Kung Fu Panda (2008), but another DreamWorks movie I would say is one of their best would be the film Megamind (2010); this movie is just a great animated film that plays with the tropes of superhero movies and gets quite a bit of humor out of it, with how the hero and villain act towards each other and how the city they live in works when it comes to good and bad events. The DreamWorks movie Megamind (2010) is a very funny animated movie that has excellent voice acting from the great voice cast, the 3D animation is well-done, the action is fun, and the way the movie plays with superhero movie tropes is well-done; the premise of a villain defeating the hero and losing his purpose in a superhero-free world can be funny if it has fun with it, and they do, making this movie fun to watch.Will Ferrell is excellent as Megamind, making the character smart and funny on how he acts out his evil plans from the start, how he defeats his nemesis, and how he decides to make another hero for him to fight because of him not having a purpose anymore; the way he acts, the way he says certain things, and how he grows as a character is entertaining and funny to watch. Brad Pitt is great as Metro City's hero Metro Man, giving the character that heroic feel and funny personality when he is saying funny but weird dialogue; the reveal of why and how he is defeated was funny, and the back and forth between him and Megamind is funny to watch because of them having a hero vs villain dynamic. Lastly, Tina Fey as Roxanne Ritchi was great with her not just being someone that gets kidnapped all the time, because she is smart when certain events occur, and she must eventually team up with Megamind; the other character is Minion voiced very well by David Cross who works with Megamind on his evil plans, and can be funny with how they both interact off each other.The normal person turned to hero turned to villain Hal/Tighten voiced well by Jonah Hill was not bad of a villain, with him having a crush on Roxanne Ritchi that can get weird, and he can be funny when he goes from being turned into a hero to turning into a villain with him being too destructive to the city; you might say he is a weird villain for the movie, but I think it works well for Megamind to figure out who he is and for him go through character development. The movie has great 3D animation making the action scenes fun to watch and investing on how they play out, along with the backstory to both Megamind and Metro Man being funny on how similar it is to other superhero backstories; also, I will add that the many gadgets Megamind uses in the movie are used in lots of ways that can forward the plot or for a funny joke.The movie Megamind (2010) is a fun and funny animated superhero film from DreamWorks that makes it one of their best films, which is why I recommend watching this movie whenever given the chance, which is also why I do not think this movie needs a sequel because it works great on its own; a great voice cast, memorable characters and dialogue, lots of memorable funny scenes, and great 3-D animation. I like DreamWorks and their many other movies like their movie Kung Fu Panda (2008) or How to Train Your Dragon (2010), but I like this movie because it can play with and make fun of superhero movie tropes for its own premise; this makes this movie fun and entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic,"A fantastic movie, that's full of nostalgia. The jokes are great and the characters even better. What I don't quite understand is why people think this movie is ""sooooooo cliche"" they do realize that's the point of the movie right? I mean for a movie trying to make a spoof of a genre that's still aimed for children I think it's fantastic. Dislike Roxanne Ritchi all you want, complain ""that she needs to be saved by a man"" to your hearts content then maybe re-watch the movie and realize she really doesn't need to be saved by a man. That's kind of the point of the movie. Also ""Tighten"" is way to funny to me.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
My favorite animated movie,"As a note, I can ONLY watch the Spanish version of this movie. There is something in the English cast (in comparison) that drags it down.. which is a shame. Normally, I prefer original language above any other, but the Spanish one is just superior! And more importantly, doesn't lose any details in the translation process.. it might even elevate it.This movie is animation gold. Has memorable and fun characters, ones you completely like! A world you'd like to be a part of. And the plot, from beginning to end, that is just a creative masterpiece. Every time I watch it (which is at least once a year or so), I have fun. I repeat the lines because they are so memorable! And it doesn't feel old. Not every movie gets to feel new every time you sit down for a rewatch.If you like animated movies, fast and action-y and you haven't watched this.. you should do yourself a favor.

God's word!,"Children of the faithful, Megamind is the best movie ever made. It is a revelation to all viewers. Aside from having the hottest characters ever made (looking at you Hal), Megamind is a masterpiece. The story of Megamind is a work of art, it should be shown at film schools. If you don't like Megamind, we can't be friends. The holy story of Megamind against Tighten is a battle of the ages and the movie needs to be common knowledge, and I'm talking word for word. It could be a religion at this point, in fact it probably already is, and I'm gonna follow it devoutly. Will Ferrell should win a medal for his performance in this treasure.TL;DR: Megamind is the best movie ever made and should probably be a religion, if not I'm starting one.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"With character-driven dialogue, clever humor, and excellent voice work, Megamind is a severely underrated DWA movie","Megamind, a super intelligent alien supervillain, after having spent years fighting against Metroman, the most beloved superhero of Metro City, he finally kills him. However, he finds that his villainy has no purpose without a superhero and decides to create one to serve as his nemesis. Unfortunately, his plan backfires as he instead created a new supervillain and with Metro City going out of control, Megamind has to fix his mistake and find his new purpose.It's been 10 years since this film came out and I remember seeing this in the theaters back at 2011 months after it premiered and on my 17th birthday. To my surprise, I loved it. It's not only hilarious in it's clever humor, but it also has mostly character-driven dialogue which is a nice touch. Yes, it does it's unoriginality, but that doesn't matter since it's well-executed in it's premise.The story is superbly written with moments of great drama especially for the characterization of Megamind as he struggles to find his purpose without a superhero only to find a new one as he becomes a superhero. The other characters are also likeable and entertaining especially Minion, Megamind's sidekick, Roxanne Ritchie, and Metroman as they also provide some great comedy and drama very well. The voice work is excellent the best coming from Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, David Cross, and Brad Pitt while Jonah Hill also gave a good performance as Hal/Titan. The pacing is great to the point where it doesn't have a dull moment and the music score from Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe is perfect as they gave the right balance of comedy/drama. And at least but not the least, the animation and it's breathtakingly gorgeous with superb visual asthetics and expressive character animation (especially a scene where Roxanne finds out that Megamind disgused as Bernard and calls him out for everything he did as a supervillain).Overall, Megamind is a severely underrated DWA movie that deserved better 10 years ago. It has clever humor, a well-written story, gorgeous animation and an excellent cast of actors. I liked Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon, don't get me wrong. It's just that this film deserves a lot more recognition. Thumbs up.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

That is no small feat for DreamWorks. Because the story is so well thought out and the characters so complete, they keep you caring about it all as the story takes its course.

Underrated Dreamworks flick,"Dreamworks was fairly popular in the 2000's and early 2010's with films like Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. But one film that seems to be overlooked is Megamind. Released in 2010, Megamind was directed by Tom McGrath (The Boss Baby movies and the Madagascar movies) and stars Will Ferrell (Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, The Lego Movie series), Jonah Hill (The Lego Batman Movie, How to Train Your Dragon series), and Brad Pitt (Mr. And Mrs. Smith, World War Z, and Happy Feet Two). The film was a box office success and was decent enough with critics and audiences. The film did see some stiff competition with Despicable Me which came out the same year and fared much better with critics and the box office.Megamind (Will Ferrell), is a villain who goes through the same old schtick with the Metro City superhero, Metro Man (Brad Pitt). Kidnap the same girl and have his (Megamind""s) plans thwarted and Metro Man is celebrated. Well, one day, Megamind seemingly destroys Metro Man and realizes that there is no happiness in his success and seeks out to create a new adversary (Jonah Hill) which may go wrong....Megamind is, simply, a parody film of the superhero genre and is fairly clever at the same time. But this has been done a few times with the whole ""villain becomes good guy"" deal. The film does have some great character transformations throughout the film that are written fairly well. In fact, this whole film has some great writing behind it from said character transformations to the comedy which gets funnier with every viewing. I typically like to go in depth with the characters to try and give people an idea about a film but with the way the characters are written, I could not do it justice what so ever. What I can describe is that if you have seen the film Despicable Me, and see how the characters transformations work there, you will have a great idea as to what is present in this film. Chances are, you might like the characters here more than in Despicable Me. The characters are likeable enough (at least the ones that are meant to) and do have some great exchanges and interactions with one another. But all of this has been done before in films like The Incredibles and (once again) Despicable Me. So this film lacks in originality but in a way that you will go ""I have seen this a million times already"". Again, there is a great voice cast, characters, and comedy that do hold up this film fairly well. The animation is nothing to ooh and ahh about. It seems pretty standard. There are a few effects that come off as really neat (example being any sort of dust/particle effect). The film does have a really good soundtrack that hits home the message about being bad. Do expect to see songs by AC/DC, Ozzy Osbourne, Electric Light Orchestra, and Michael Jackson.Megamind my not have any new ideas but has some fantastic writing that has to be seen to be believed.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Megamind"" has Mega Laughs and Heart","DreamWorks' animated ""Megamind"" benefits ironically from Will Ferrell's hysterical voice rendering. Ferrell voices the slender bulbous headed blue complexioned super-villain Megamind. His usual goofy oafish persona is not a glaring distraction as the diminutive misunderstood leather clad evil genius. Ferrell is uncharacteristically restrained, and self aware as Megamind. At a story arc, his Megamind confesses, ""Bad guys don't save the day, and they don't get the girl"" In the plot twist of the original story by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simmons, the super-villain must transform into the superhero. This is no surprise. What is surprising? ""Megamind"" does so hilariously and poignantly.Director Tom McGrath seamlessly and simultaneously parodies the superhero genre and embraces it. Beleaguered Megamind apparently destroys his arch nemesis Metro Man (comically pompous Brad Pitt), anointed defender of Metro City. No one is more shocked than Megamind himself. Equally bewildered is intrepid reporter Roxanne Ritchie (spunky and composed Tina Fey): How could Metro Man die? Even if you haven't seen the movie trailer, you can kind of figure this one out. Anyway, Megamind institutes his evil reign of Metro City. However, he soon discovers there is little joy in evil, all alone. He realizes that eternal paradox: There is no evil, without good. Megamind was the Yin to Metro Man's Yang—the universal balance. Schoolcraft and Simmons eloquently pull a ""Kung Fu Panda"".Determined to restore the fun in evil, Megamind and his sidekick Minion (hysterically obtuse David Cross) embark to create a new hero. Leveraging Metro Man's DNA residue, the two select Hal (brilliantly geeky Jonah Hill) as their candidate. Hal creepily grips a torch for Roxanne. In horrendous miscalculation despite Megamind's Brando homage tutelage, Hal emerges as Titan-- ultimate super-villain. Unintentionally, Megamind places Roxanne in jeopardy. Meanwhile Megamind finds himself appreciating Roxanne. So Megamind must cowboy up: Reclaim his innate greatness, and become the hero he is destined to be. Flashback to the infant his parents secured in his spaceship bound for earth from their dying planet. With his father's words obscured Megamind screams, ""Destined for what? I didn't catch that last part!""The 3D in ""Megamind"" is spectacular. 3D envisioning in animated features seem to fair best. The 3D is not really integral to the story. The effect of Metro City is a monolithic and futuristic version of Los Angeles. That context does work. What also work are narrative backdrops for both Megamind and Metro Man. Both share similar origins: Advanced alien parents of separate dying worlds send their sons to Earth as its saviors. Chaos literally collides as the baby, who becomes Metro Man, lands in the wealthy estate of Lord and Lady Scott. While the baby, who becomes Megamind, lands in a State Prison, and raised by its inmates. Their paths cross again as toddlers in a School for the Gifted. Megamind playing to his strong suit makes the life altering choice to be evil. Amazingly, we catch up with Megamind serving 8 consecutive life sentences, but from all accounts he has not harmed anyone. His sole punishment seems consequence of being the big loser in his battles with Metro Man.McGrath effectively enrolls Megamind's underdog empathy. His is a solitary and misrepresented existence—as in a failure to be. So when he accidentally impersonates gentle and kind Metro Man Museum curator Bernard (charming and clumsy Ben Stiller) and befriends the beautiful Roxanne (Fey), we pull for him. Megamind is more himself as Bernard, than his evil genius self. Roxanne is genuinely falling for Bernard as well. Here Ferrell displays a deceptive subtle charm. Fey is funny and vulnerable as the unflappable independent woman relinquishing her guard. Brad Pitt is hysterical in self effacing parody as Metro Man. The narrative twist involving his Metro Man completes the movie with his aloof and touching turn. ""Megamind"" is predictable only in structure; otherwise it is abundant with surprise. ""Megamind"" has big laughs and a big heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Has Heart and Entertains,"While this may not be as cute as ""Despicable Me"" in my opinion, it contributes more to the entertainment of the masses than ""Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs."" ""Megamind"" is one of those ""superhero"" films with every necessary element to insure its eventual place in the ""classic"" category. This one has a rich story, a few twists, and a nice (although unexpected) resolution. The voice cast is most excellent, and I found the story to be compelling.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Megamind. I particularly like the level of character development, which was nominal but enough to endear the characters, leaving more time for story and less time for wasted film. That's always a plus, in my book. As I said, the story is rich, well written, and smartly executed.I'll probably own this as no Will Ferrell collection could possibly be complete without it. ;) All in all, this is a good flick for the kids with a good overall morality. It's fun for adults, too, but probably not for Friday or Saturday night viewing unless you're into the new cartoon revolution (which I seem to be LOL).It rates a 7.8/10 from ...the Fiend :.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very Entertaining Movie.,"Megamind is not only funny and entertaining to watch, but its also touching and 'smartfully' written. I love how they've shown the good versus bad throughout the story.There's not a moment when I was bored watching it. The humor is superb!It also shows emotional connection with the viewers. At certain mushy parts, I was actually able to relate to some of the lines and spiels of some of the characters.This is not an average family movie. It is masterfully created to cater to all ages.I give it - 10 Stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Presentation is all the makes it stand out!,"Megamind is a movie that shows that good exists everywhere, even in bad, i.e. bad is not totally bad but contains a certain amount of good in it and some trigger is required to grow and bring it out. Moreover, the movie shows victory of good over evil (in the beginning, Metroman over Megamind and in later when Megamind changes, Megamind over Titan) and try to give a positive message to all. Presentation makes everything stand out, of course it does, as Megamind says in the movie, the movie really stands out and I hope it has and will stand out due to its presentation. Kudos and all the best for the success it has gained over time and hope everyone likes it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great,"I love this movie. It's funny, it's sweet, it's dramatic, it's clever and it has great pacing. The soundtrack is old school and classic. It does suffer from bad marketing (being released in the same year as Despicable Me, another superhero movie) but it's ten times lighter on its feet, and more clever--with the kind of SNL gags that I think Tina Fey had a hand in writing. It also has a real ~heart with its hapless hero. Some of the gags (an unshaven Music Man) really point to some great scriptwriting and animation, with inside jokes for parents that abound. I love the cute sidekick Minion, which is a v adorable and smart fish. And the invisible car effects and the deranged superhero-turned-villain mixes the lines of motivations and human nature and gives us a fun plot to hold on to. Great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Movie,"The movie is like a parody of Superman and Brainiac. Megamind being the Brainiac, and Metroman being Superman's caricature.I throughly enjoyed the movie. The concept is great. I didn't know that you could put a villain in center stage, and pull off a comedy spoof of super hero. But the whole thing works, and it's an amazing movie.All the characters that appears in this movie are some of the best ever created (maybe except for Titan). The comedy and the comic nature of the characters works hand in hand and makes one of the best comedic moments in animation history.It's one of the best animated movie to be made in recent years, and recommended for viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The greatest animated movie I have ever seen,"This movie is criminally underrated. I only tuned into it for the ""And I love you random citizen"" meme but it was so much much much more enjoyable than I expected. This isn't a movie for kids as much as it is for teens and adults. There's a surprising amount of emotion in there and I really grew attached to the characters in the film. The story is brilliant, the animation is fantastic and the sound track is equally as good.Honestly I struggle to find a single thing to critique about this movie. It was a 10/10 from start to finish. If anything it might have gotten better throughout it's runtime, and that's difficult to comprehend because I was hooked from the first minute. Animated movies don't get much better than this.If anything, the lack of success this movie had must be due to the fact that it's not as appealing to kids as other blockbuster animated titles. Nevertheless, if you're a teen or an adult, you'll enjoy it so much more for that reason alone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really good,"If you like watching animations, you really need watch this movie. I can clearly advice this movie without any doubt and stars like Brad Pitt, Will Ferrell dubbing the movie, and i can clearly say that they did some kind of awesome job because, dubbing is really good. Story of the movie is out of ordinary it can really make you surprise, it looks like a ordinary story but it is much more different from ordinary ones. Graphics are better than a average animation, musics of the film is well selected, they can really put you in mood.

Absolute perfection,"I do like an animated film that is well drawn, I also like a badly drawn animated film as long as the story line and characters are good, i.e. Emperors New Groove. However this film has everything, beautifully drawn, excellent story line, and wonderful characters. Throw in the bonuses of non-stop humour and bangin' tunes and you have the perfect animated film.
Why was it not the big hit it should have been? It's all about merchandise, the Minion of this film wasn't cute or cuddly like the Minions of another vastly inferior animated film.

Megamind,"Note: The original text is in Portuguese. I use the Google Translator to translate. I revised the text and I think there are no problems.DreamWorks Animation has reached its peak this year with How to Train Your Dragon. A sublime animation, visually stunning, with a touching story and not lose anything to rival Pixar. Now comes Megamind, that despite not having the same quality of How to Train Your Dragon, has a great history and is extremely fun.Directed by Tom MacGrath (Madagascar 1 and 2) and written by Alan J. Schoolcraft & Brent Simons, debuting as writers, the history begins with two aliens being sent to Earth. One becomes the town hero, Metro Man. The other chooses evil a becomes the villain: Megamind. After countless battles and failures, Megamind finally defeat Metro Man and takes city power. And then the villain comes to a crisis. After all, without someone to deal with, and having already turned the city inside out, what else a villain has to do?The film has fun references to Superman, from its origin to the Jor-El, Superman's father, played by Marlon Brando in Superman - The Movie 1978.In technical aspects, while not having as many details and textures how How to Train Your Dragon, the film nonetheless has a beautiful sight, with an excellent animation and expressive characters.The soundtrack is great. Ozzy Osbourne, George Thorogood, AC / DC and Guns'n'Roses are part of the selection and make the sequences even more exciting.Megamind let sentimentality aside and focus on fun, and at no time sounds forced. It is obvious that there is no comparison with Toy Story 3 - Pixar animation also launched this year - or the aforementioned How to Train Your Dragon, but Megamind fulfills its proposal and is one more hit of the studio.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is so good.,"Every element of this story is fantastic - comedy, story, drama, characters, and animation. This story is entertaining with extremely well-written characters and perfect pacing. This is now one of my favorite animated movies. I have no complaints with this movie, and would highly recommend it.Anyone who is annoyed about the obvious Superman parody is just a DC fanboy who's annoyed that Metro Man is a better written character than most versions of the actual Superman.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bad for good,"I'm a bit of a comic buff and have enjoyed most of the glut of action and animated super- hero features since ""Superman"" blazed the trail back in the 70's. Of course in Toon land even more things are possible, including 3D action as in this highly amusing spoof comedy- adventure which neatly inverts the good guy and bad guy stereotypes we're so familiar with.Here, the good guy, Metro Man is a pretentious, vainglorious super-smoothie, who quickly tires of the status and responsibilities his powers confer on him, while the so-called bad guy Megamind turns out to be a sensitive, conscientious loner, looking for love and female companionship. In the middle of them stands feisty Lois Lane-type reporter Roxanne, who despite herself finds herself falling for the adopted persona of the baddie.The film makes subtle points about being true to one's self, not judging by appearances and overcoming prejudice but never at the expense of some spectacularly drawn action sequences or hilarious verbal and sight gags, the best of which was probably the mickey-take of Marlon Brando's Jor-El in the afore-mentioned ""Superman - The Movie"". The 3D content only enhanced my enjoyment, especially a replica scene of the famous James Dean ""Boulevard Of Broken Dreams"" poster.For me, this sharp-as-a-tack production joins the hallowed ranks of ""The Incredibles"" and ""Mystery Men"" as thoroughly enjoyable send-ups of a still burgeoning cinematic phenomenon, as witness the continuing graduation of DC and Marvel Comic heroes to Hollywood blockbuster status.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, Animated Superhero Spin-off!","Megamind is not the most spectacular animated film I have ever seen but it still is highly entertaining. This film has a few things working in it's favor. It has a highly-talented voice cast, has great, bright animation, and it reminds me of many great superhero films I have seen.This film is about a villain with that weird-looking blue head who conquers the city's hero. When he gets lonely because he has no enemy, he creates a hero so he would have someone to fight. But, this ""hero"" is more than Megamind expected. He has to deal with that and there is that newscaster lady he is interested in.....Megamind excels with a brilliant, talented voice cast led by Will Ferrell and Brad Pitt. Those two were really great and we even get to hear Brad Pitt sing. I also liked the character connections between Megamind and his fishy friend, Minion. I really liked the fishy guy.Overall, this is a solid film that most kids will enjoy. It is obvious that this film recycles plot points from better films such as The Incredibles, Superman, X-Men, and Despicable Me. But that did nothing to stop me from enjoying the movie. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I love it! What else can I say?,"Usually I take my reviews relatively seriously through many a paragraph, but in this case, I'm just going to keep it quick and to the point. ""Megamind"" is a thrill to watch! With a healthy dose of animated action fun, lots of good humor, and even some adorable sentimentality, I enjoyed every second of it.Probably my favorite feature of this film was the animation. While I still think 2D is the best way to go, this was undeniably a gorgeous film to look at.Especially the eyes! Wow! Beautiful.Also, the voice acting was quite good, and the story was both funny, exciting, and heartwarming all at once. While it may not be the most original thing to ever hit the screen, there's no denying its quality. This is a film that people of all ages can enjoy - without the need for hidden innuendos and hinting towards 'naughty' words *cough* Rango *cough*.

A philosophical Nature VS Nurture debate masquerading as a hilarious kids' movie.,"Oh, this is the stuff! What a tremendously enjoyable movie MEGAMIND turned out to be. Sure, the origin story is profoundly unlikely and the denouement is positively unbelievable, but who the hell cares? This movie is fun, fun, fun. And Will Ferrell, as the misunderstood supervillain at its heart, is funny, funny, funny.The star-studded MEGAMIND tells the story of a criminal mastermind who finally defeats his archnemesis, Metro Man (defender of Metro City -- or, as Megamind styles it, Metrocity) and therefore takes over the running of the town they call home. Of course, there is a reporter in the mix, one Roxanne Ritchi, who is an obsession with our supposed villain, full of moxie and earnestness and voiced ably by Tina Fey. Jonah Hill plays her infatuated and infantile camera man, Hal, with consummate blabbering skill, and his transformation into a spurned sadist by the movie's end is delivered with great relish. David Cross is superlative as Megamind's fish-like minion, the aptly-named Minion, and Brad Pitt is perfectly serviceable as Metro Man.But the star here is the petulant and accident-prone ramblings of Ferrell as Megamind. His mispronunciations are unendingly amusing, his megalomania is kind of adorable, and his unbridled arrogance is somehow charmingly endearing. He's a lot like KIM POSSIBLE's Dr. Drakken, actually (who is also, I would point out, blue), but is a far more sympathetic character. I mean, he's mindboggling brilliant, but doesn't seem to understand what a ""code"" for something is. That is SO CUTE. The writing here is top notch, and it is mostly the dialogue he is given that makes this movie really pop, but there can be no doubt that Ferrell brings an instantly likable tone to proceedings that makes MEGAMIND a treat from the very outset.How tragic, that Ferrell's best performance since Ron Burgundy should come in a movie in which he doesn't even make an appearance.The underlying theme here is one of Nature vs. Nurture, as one of those Here's the Moral, Kids voice over wrap ups at the end makes all too clear. Redemption is possible, everyone makes mistakes, don't judge a book by its cover, we should all follow our bliss, yadda yadda yadda. Whatever, dude. This year's DESPICABLE ME also sang that song, and it's hardly the first; the anti-hero is certainly nothing new in genre. From The Punisher to Riddick to Dr. Horrible (a debt to whom Megamind surely owes a thing or two; Metro Man, certainly, is at least a spiritual heir to Captain Hammer, with perhaps a little Roger Ramjet thrown in), the trope has been very well explored. What MEGAMIND does is to elevate that concept into the kind of What Next? scenario superhero stories rarely address: what happens when there is no bad guy left to battle anymore? And what if the bad guy wins? What exactly makes a bad guy? And if bad guys don't get the girl, can being a good guy maybe get you some action? (In cartoons, the answer to that is apparently -- and perhaps a little misleadingly -- yes.) Produced by Ben Stiller, this movie also features his voice in a brief cameo as misanthrope Bernard, whose guise Megamind takes on as he woos the oblivious Roxanne. (At least it's not just him with glasses on; and we never do discover if Metro Man has an alter ego. That's a refreshing change!) Some of the movie's most enjoyable moments come about as we watch our blue-skilled supervillain begin to live his own life instead of try to control everyone else's although, none of that can hold a candle to Minion's Oscar-worthy comedy death scene.I have to say, I've not been previously too enamored of Dreamworks' other animated features. SHARK TALE, MADAGASCAR, KUNG FU PANDA, the recent HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON I didn't hate any of them, but neither did they really win my heart. (And SHREK: blech.) But with this one, I am suddenly a convert to the SKG fold, and can only hope they hold true to form and decide to put out a sequel.Called MINION.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The villain becomes the hero,"Superheroes are all the rage these days, comic books are incredibly popular and since 2000 there has not been a year where there no tent pole film that is not a superhero film. In 2008 we got a superhero parody in the form Hancock but ended up becoming more like an action blockbuster. Dreamworks have also attempted an superhero comedy in the form of animation with Megamind.Megamind (Will Ferrell) is a blue, super-intelligent alien send to Earth as his home planet is sucked into a black hole. His archrival Metro Man (Brad Pitt) home planet also suffers the same fate. Both have very different upbringings, Metro Man growing up in wealth, luxury and always the golden boy, Megamind ended up in a prison of criminally gifted and because he is unable to impress of people ends up becoming a villain. In the city of Metro City (or Metrocity to Megamind) they have elaborate battles, with Metro Man being hailed as the hero. But one day Megamind some how won, killing Metro Man. The problem is that Metro Man had no plan to what to do afterwards and ends up depressed because he has no one to battle with. Megamind decides to create a new hero to battle with, making Titan (Jonah Hill). But Megamind also starts to fall for reporter Lois Lane, I mean Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey).Like most Dreamworks films the animation is excellent and the action sequence with its camera movements were exciting. It is an action packed, inventive and will please people of all ages. Director Tom McGrath made sure that Megamind zipped along at a very quick pace and when the score did make some of the moments truly epic.There was some good ideas in Megamind, like Megamind become evil because of his surrounding and that all good in his world is taken by someone else. It is the classic nature vs. nurture argument and there were ideas like the villain actually needs a hero to challenge them. It is like The Joker in The Dark Knight where he is only happy and motivated to do anything if Batman is there to challenge and what would a villain do if they actually win? What would their post victory strategy be? But the Megamind is a missed opportunity because instead of trying parody superheroes, they made a more physical, slapstick heavy comedy. There were some funny jokes, I did laugh but I wanted more verbal jokes and less of Megamind and Minion getting hurt. I wanted more observation humour, picking at holes that might happen in comic book and Saturday Morning Cartoons, which this film was good at.There is a recurring joke that Megamind can not pronounce some words, I thought it was more a pointless quirk then a funny joke and I personally do not like Jonah Hill: I do not think he is very funny and his performance was pretty weak. I also thought the parody vision of Marlon Brando's version of Jol-El was unfunny, poorly written and just felt very forced by Ferrell.The similarly themed The Incredibles is a much better film, but Megamind is an entertaining enough film, especially for children who enjoy superheroes.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Finally, he just rented it and told me we were watching it. And I so glad we did watch it, it's so good. It's hilarious, and it's so nice to see a movie with a villain as three dimensional as Megamind. (By three dimensional, I mean the character had real depth, I'm not talking about the animation.)

No thanks..."". Nothing compelled me to watch it what so ever.But I was today shocked to find out that this movie is so excellent, so well written and so well directed that I'd dare say it beats somewhat 50% of my beloved Pixar movies.Not once did I grind my teeth because of plot holes, not once did a joke fall flat, not once was I bored.

Megamind kicks Despicable's butt,"Having a 2nd supervillain themed animation film in the same year might have been thought of as overkill and ill-timed. Overall, though, that this movie, Megamind, came after Despicable Me, was apt because I would have simply been disappointed in Despicable Me if I saw Megamind first.Megamind has all the right combinations, a decent plot, a couple of twists, an over the top villain who eventually evolves into a likable guy, couple of good supporting characters, an homage to Marlon Brando, a couple of FB-esquire pokes of fun at Superman (including a Lois and a Jimmy Olsen), humor (lots of witty ones, too), and a couple of nice action/fight scenes.Most of all, it has a lot of heart. For a guy named Megamind, he sure shows some heart in this film that you can't just help but root for the guy (even if he was evil by design or by fate). Didn't recognize the voice talents of Ferrel, Fey and Mr. Pitt, though I could tell that Titan had to voice of actor/comedian Jonah Hill, so at least I can watch again the movie and see some snippets (if ever) of the real actor's or actors' speaking habits coming out in this movie.I'm not sure if this will be a classic, but it sure will be something I can keep watching when it comes out in DVD a few months from now. Good follow up from Dreamworks after How To Train Your Dragon earlier this year. Keep up the great works your Animation division is churning out.ADDENDUM - saw this in 3D. Like Despicable me, you may not necessarily be missing out if you watch it in 3D so watch according to your preference.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One day captures news reporter Roxanne(Tina Fey),in hopes of luring Metro Man in a trap to destroy him, when his plan does work, Megamind quickly feels he is lost without someone to battle with. so he quickly gets a sample of Metro Mans DNA, and puts it into cameraman Hank(Jonah Hill), but Megaminds plan quickly goes down hill, cause instead of creating a hero, he ends up creating a villain, worse than him. How will Megamind put this too an end?Not quite as good as The Incredibles(2004), but still good, Ferrell, Pitt, Fey, and Hill are all good in there voices. It was a funny superhero like send up.

Everyone loves him and every time Megamind and Metro Man square off, the latter wins.But Megamind doesn't give up and keeps trying to be the best villain of all time. He keeps kidnapping Roxanne Ritchie, a journalist and keeps challenging Metro Man. Later in the story, Megamind feels the void that the absence of a hero has left in him, and he decides to create another hero to challenge.The movie was funny and the writing was well thought-out.

The Greatest Subversive Animated Film of the Decade,"Before your eyes scroll through this, eliminate every thought you had of me being credible. Lying to you about being an avid movie watcher or comic reader isn't necessary. This movie is amazing to anyone and thus I will review it from the perspective of the random high-schooler I am.The movie Megamind is a very well done exploration and subversion of genre tropes culminating in a beautiful movie that holds up to this day and beyond. The hero loses; The incompetent villain takes over; The love interest is for the villain; Cats and dogs living together, it's mass hysteria! Nothing makes me want to deep dive into movies more than surface level subversions, because in good movies always lead to more and more subversion hidden just under the surface to make the story work reasonably. Sometimes the subversion isn't even clear until much later such as with the supposed weakness of Metro Man to copper and his slightly more reasonable aversion to deadly laser weapons. This movie works very hard to make sure you know its subversive and it does one hell of a good job at it.The story of this movie all starts with the violent ejection of two babies from two planets that proceed to explode. They become rivals immediately. Both land on earth, the blue bulbous-headed Megamind lands in a prison, and the beautiful super baby that grows into Metro Man lands in a mansion. Both grow up going to the same school where their rivalry buds once again. The movie picks up later with Megamind's escape from prison and crashing of the Metro Man Museum opening, as well as Megamind's new plot to finally end Metro Man. The clearly poorly thought out plot involves luring Metro Man to an abandoned observatory and firing a deadly laser cannon into him. Ironically Metro Man reveals his weakness to copper (the material the observatory dome is made of), and thus Megamind actually wins.I love this movie because right from the start it throws your ideas about what a superhero film should be out the window and shows you this movie will be different, and that is prevalent throughout the film. Many classic character motivations are examined more closely and revealed to be shallow or so self serving they are harmful to those around them. Such as when Megamind's motivation for getting rid of Metro Man gets called into question as he starts falling into depression after taking over Metro City or when the (super)villain Tighten kidnaps Roxanne Ritchie, or pretty much anything he does in general throughout the movie.The subversive nature of this movie doesn't go all the way to it's core though. The story of the villain winning has become a trope in and of itself now, and the story of a villain going after a more harmful villain has also been seen before.

Up there for me like Up movie,"Up movie is a classic, it made many adults love animated movies. For me this movie, which was criticised for lack of originality, right there with Up for one simple reason how delightful and charming this movie is, title character was very interesting, plotwise nothing to write about, but it is about story sequence, interesting characters around, goofups, comedy littered around. Not many animated movies you can rewatch, this one you can, infact I want to rewatch after many years just to relive the delight.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This Film Deserves More Attention!,"Okay, I'm not going to act like this is the best Dreamworks movie ever made. I believe that title goes to one of the How To Train Your Dragon films. But no one really seems to remember this movie, and that's a shame. On the surface, Megamind looks like a spoof of the ""superhero genre."" But when you actually watch the film, it actually has some pretty well done character development and asks some interesting questions. It is also full of twists and turns (which I won't spoil here). The best part of this movie, by far, is Will Ferrell's performance as Megamind. Not only is he (and the animation department) able to produce some really funny moments, but when things get serious, Ferrell actually pulls of those more dramatic scenes as well. The rest of the cast are great as well, particularly David Cross and Brad Pitt. The movie also has a very cinematic feel to it, almost like it was meant to be a live action film at first, but they then decided to animate it. This especially shows during the action scenes. All in all, I think this is a very solid film that deserves more recognition. In time, who knows? Fingers crossed that we'll get a sequel!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's got everything love, romance, action, comedy and everything else you want to see in a movie. Every characters part has been perfectly written out with no loose ends.

Must see movie,"I will write this as short and simple as i can. Firstly. Old story said in a new way (best way till now). Secondly. Excellent voices, excellent visuals, excellent sound! Thirdly. If you watch this closely, you can see some ""eastern eggs"" in there. I'll spoil one for you: The inspector dancing with the guards like in the movie ""Night at the Roxbury"". There is one even in the first 5 minutes of the movie. There are many things that you can like in this movie, not too many to dislike. I do think that ""Megamind"" is better than ""Despicable me"". I like the humor, the jokes, the whole script, more than the other one. I don't like.... almost nothing. Maybe there are a few flat jokes, but not enough to ruin the movie. I hope this will convince you to at least rent the movie if not, go to the cinema and see it.(3D or not)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beyond Good & Evil (Chapter 1 Adapted),"This cartoon engages the Will to Truth, which continues to tempt Megamind to many a hazardous enterprises and continues to bring him into engagement with seemingly singular escapades with the famous Metro Man of which all citizens of Metrocity have hitherto spoken with respect.What questions has Megamind not laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! The story of his existence is a long one yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced when we meet our protagonist in the the bad guy place. Is it any wonder if we begin with distrust, impatience, and turn away from this maniacal pseudo-genius? We may compare him with the Sphinx who will teach us at last to ask questions? Who is it really that puts questions to us here? What really is this ""Megamind"" before us?In fact we make a an hour-long discovery of this Megamind—until at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. From the beginning we inquired and were told about the value of this Megamind. Granted that we want Metro Man: why not rather Megamind? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of Metro Man is presented to us—or is it the viewer who presented the self before the problem? Which of us is the Metro Man here? Which the Megamind?Megamind, the movie seems to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and risk raising it. For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no risk. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

MegaMind - The Funniest villain ever,"An underachiever his whole life, when realizes that he is not good at doing anything noble, also comprehends that he is pretty darn good at being ""BAD""!!!, thus came into existence ""MEGAMIND"", which according to me is ""the"" funniest villain ever. MEGAMIND and his best friend MINION, did remind me of the duo of ""SULLY and MIKE"" from Monsters Inc., but the bone-tickling comedy does make sure that the sometimes goofy ""super- baddie"" wins hands down. The scene where MM corrects TITAN by explaining that the difference between a villain and a super-villain is PRESENTAATIIOOOOONNN!!!! , was the best of the lot for me.Amazing animation by Dreamworks yet again. Brad Pitt is too good as METROMAN, but Ferrell steals the show for me. Snappy scenes and witty dialogs make it a must watch for all age groups.

"Not DreamWorks Animation's Best, But Still","Reviewed on April 22, 2011.Megamind was a really underrated DreamWorks movie. I watched it online in February 2011, and it was great. It's not the best DreamWorks Animation movie, but still underrated. Not as good as How to Train Your Dragon, but I like this movie more than Shrek Forever After. The animation is still amazing, the story is really good, the characters were great, the voice acting was really good (including from Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, and David Cross), the soundtrack is good, and the humor was pretty funny.Megamind was a good DreamWorks movie. I recommend it. While it's not the best movie of 2010, which that position is held by Inception, it's still a fun movie.Rating: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A subversive achievement,"Megamind was one of my favorite films throughout childhood and watching it years later, it still holds up.The characters had plenty of personality, and I pretty much liked all the characters here plus the comedy was great, surprisingly strong emotions, there were plenty of scenes where I actually felt emotions but the strongest aspect of this film has got to be the messages.I've watched tons of DreamWorks films in the past and a lot of them had amazing messages but Megamind might just have the strongest message out of all of them. It was clearly told and the ""Always have time for yourself"", ""There's always that good in you"" etcBut I have just one tiny problem, its pacing because Megamind constantly switching sides will confuse some people and sometimes it is slow-paced but thats fineRating: 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Really Funny Actually,"One of the most creative animated films in recent years, in my opinion. A great play on the ""Superman"" mythology with Will Ferrell, Brad's Pitt, Jonah Hill, and Tina Fey all playing really funny and quirky characters. This got a lot of good chuckles out of me, and it also includes a heartfelt, if simplistic, message to kids about not necessarily having to be what the rest of the world perceives you as. I really liked a lot of the soundtrack picks for this movie, something a dorky supervillain would play. Jonah Hill's character, Tighten, is so funny, I laughed in nearly every scene that he's in.Great movie for the whole family to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious !! / What drives many people to the Evil side ??,"The movie thrives on the fast-paced wisecracks and ironic asides, making fun of most of the superhero movie clichés. The plot is predictable at times and unpredictable at other, but it works for the movie.The soundtrack is good, bringing back memories of classics like Highway to Hell, Back in Black, Crazy Train, Welcome to the Jungle and Bad.Will Ferrell as Megamind is simply awesome; flawed but lovable, we pity the guy for all the crap he took that drove him to villainy, we appreciate his intelligence while still laughing at his screw-ups and flamboyant nature. Surprisingly enough, what could've easily just been a purely comic protagonist became a 3-dimensional character, and you find yourself actually rooting for the so-called 'Bad-guy' or Super-villain. David Cross as 'Minion' is simply superb. The movie makes us realize what drives many people to the Evil side; it's just craving for attention.One of my favourite scenes from the movie is the one in which Megamind takes the form of a short stout teacher-like figure with a Don Vito Corleone (from 'The Godfather') face-cut and does a 'Godfather' imitation.

Megamind: A Blue-Skinned Alien With a Giant Brain,"""Megamind"" is a visually stunning and cleverly written animated film that offers a fresh take on the superhero genre. The story follows the titular character, a blue-skinned alien with a giant brain, as he becomes the world's newest super-villain after accidentally killing the only hero in town. However, when his nemesis is replaced by a new, clueless hero, Megamind must re-evaluate his life choices and ultimately becomes a unlikely hero himself. The animation is top-notch, the voice acting, particularly by Will Ferrell as Megamind, is excellent and the film's witty script is sure to entertain both kids and adults alike.

Easily the greatest animated film I've seen yet.,This movie wad great from the first moment I watched it as a kid to even now as an adult. Everything in this movie was so ahead of its time and it will forever remain as one of my all time favorite animated films ever. It was so genuinely ahead of its time I will never be able to fully put into words how much I genuinely love this movie. Also i have to say this is easily oke of my top Will Ferrell performances. He was able to capture the character of Megamind and perform it perfectly. He is such an expressive and interesting character that's able to keep my attention throughout the entire movie. I was able to genuinely start rooting for him towards the end because of how genuine his development felt. I love whenever a character has such genuine and admirable growth even in something like an animatrd movie. 100000000/10.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I'm afraid Megamind does not save the day.,"Now it is time for DreamWorks to have a stab at a cartoon hero, and after Pixar's brilliant The Incredibles this film can only be doomed to failure. I am pleased to announce that although nowhere near as good as The Incredibles it is still half decent.Megamind is an alien, sent down to Earth as a baby due to his planet being destroyed. Along with Megamind another baby is sent down to Earth from an opposing planet. Megamind lands in a prison, being raised by criminals and the other baby lives the life of luxury in a manor house. As they grow up they become rivals with Megamind adopting the villain persona and the other adopting the hero, Metro Man.The two battle out with Metro Man always coming out on top, until Megamind finally succeeds in killing him. After this he then realises that life is no good without a hero to fight, so decides to create one for his own, Titan. Although Titan doesn't work out according to plan and due to jealousy becomes evil, leaving Megamind to become the hero and save the day.The story does work and there are several hints to outside influences such as Superman, the vulnerable reporter, and Frankenstein, the creation of a monster. The film is very much a super hero in reverse and at times does employ the tired tactics but seeing as this is a children's film at heart, it was never going to go any deeper. The premise is good and, although recently Despicable Me took a similar premise, seems original but I think a lot of that is done through the voice work provided by the actors.Ferrell is very good as the voice of Megamind, delivering his typical comedic role which I'm sure most was ad-libbed. Jonah Hill is fantastic as Titan, really bringing the character out into a three dimensional world and Fey is fine as the reporter, Roxanne Ritchie but the star of them all is David Cross playing Megamind's sidekick Minion. The character has some of the best lines and considering he is a fish in a helmet attached to a robot, his facial expressions are brilliant.The film employs a lot of comedy but unfortunately I never really found myself in hysterics. Many of the gags used have been played in the trailer and others were more aimed at kids. Considering other brilliant animated films like Shrek also appealed to adults perhaps a superhero film could have done to. This film does not live up to its predecessors from DreamWorks and Pixar, so if you are going to the cinema to see another Toy Story than you will be disappointed. I know you shouldn't judge movies on others but with so many fantastic animated films out there than we can't help but. The problem with this movie is it doesn't live up to the hype of any other animated film at this time, which is a shame due to the great cast. It just feels like something is missing from this film as I could only connect towards the end. The end scenes are great but the ones leading up to it just seem a little dull at times and it's hard to empathise with Megamind until the end, so he will never be a remembered cartoon character like Shrek. There you go comparing again.The film is worth a watch for some light hearted entertainment and I think kids would love it but for me it was just a mediocre cartoon alongside some brilliant animated films.",,Anonymous,Animation
Good Strong Family entertainment :),"I just got back from seeing ""Mega Mind"", and have to say that I really enjoyed it. Even though it was in 3D, the glasses did not darken the image. At least not too much anyway. Did this need to be in 3D? Not to my way of thinking, but it didn't hurt the film either.This film has strong quick witticisms that will have a full packed house laughing through much of the first 20 minutes. We have a basic story with a psychological twist, that only gets better as it goes along.There are parts that are a bit over the top, even for a CGI super-hero comedy, but the film doesn't suffer too much for it. I think it's good solid entertainment, but I think I would only take in another showing if I was with a group of friends and family.Beyond that, ""Mega Mind"" offers a new twist on the super hero craze over the last several years, and should delight most family audiences. Please note however that the music can be a bit loud, and some smaller ears suffered for it in the form of crying and tears in the theatre. Not a big deal. That's what parents are for :) The rest of us without kids should be tolerant given the venue.All in all a good watch. If you have a space $14 burning a hole in your pocket and a free weekend afternoon, give it a shot.Enjoy!p.s. one critique, one of the characters at the end should have made a bigger showing than he did.p.p.s. some of the writing is almost too clever. I got all the humor, but thought it was almost surreal as to how intelligent witty some of the characters were portrayed as being.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Mega, Mind you don't miss it","'Megamind' is Dreamworks latest animated film to be released into cinemas. It is a story about your typical Villain and Super-hero who constantly battle each other with the Super-hero always winning. Megamind (Ferrell) is the protagonist and the villain who repeatedly gets defeated by the heroic Metro Man (Pitt). Although this film puts a turn from what is usually the norm and gives us the story from the bad guy's perspective. The plot of 'Megamind' is that after many battles with Metro Man in which he keeps getting defeated he still comes back for another battle but this time he succeeds in destroying Metro Man (by accident). Though first pleased with his victory Megamind soon realises that his life has no purpose with no super-hero to fight. He creates another super-hero to do battle with but things go hay-wire when that super-hero Titan (Hill) goes bad and it is up to Megamind to become the good guy and save the day. This is a refreshing change to the conventional super-hero, good vs evil and allows for a more interesting storyline. Megamind is primarily a super-hero movie spoof and does to super-hero movies what Shrek did to fairy tales. Spoofs often fall flat on their face but 'Megamind' pulls it off with a good deal of comedy, it is cleverly written with some of the funniest elements of the movie being dialogue between characters, one of my favourite being between Megamind and Metro Man via a large television screen. The character of Megamind was extremely well made, he is instantly likable despite being the villain as he is a loser whose plans go wrong and makes mistakes easily. His lines are clever and funny and delivered wonderfully by Will Ferrell whose recognisable voice is instantly funny. Though Metro Man has only a small part in the film he is still a fun character being very typically super-hero. Brad Pitt's voice fits in well for the role as his voice is what you imagine a super-hero's voice to sound like. Jonah Hill as the 'dorky' cameraman and then as super-hero turned bad Titan is less funny than Metro Man and Megamind with only a few funny bits that were down to him, the rest of the time is mostly him destroying things. Tina Fey as the reporter Roxanne and the love interest of Megamind is an important character but not necessarily a funny one being mostly a character for others such as Megamind to bounce funny lines off. She is the love interest of Megamind and this 'love' sub-plot was one of the only aspects of the movie I had a problem with. Megamind is a super-hero movie spoof but fails to poke fun at this romance as there are times and especially towards the end of the movie where there moments that are not meant to be funny of romance between Megamind and Roxanne but can be exceedingly cheesy and cringey and I feel it would've been better if they had made fun at this along with the rest of the movie. Overall 'Megamind' is a fun and entertaining movie that is worth a view as it is guaranteed to get a few laughs out of you at the least a good cast brings the movie together and a clever new storyline cements over some of the relatively small flaws that the movie has.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Okay, but doesn't really stand out in a crowded genre.","""Sorry! Sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback.""Megamind is a mixed bag in almost every way. The idea of a super-villain turned superhero would have been novel, if the superior and similar Despicable Me wouldn't have been released around the same. The movie tries it's best with abundant slapstick humor, but it's only sporadically funny. Some of the character designs are great (say what you will, but Roxanne is one hot computer animated character), but others are lane and not memorable (Titan, or ""Tighten"", I'm looking squarely at you). The settings and background as a whole are clean, bright, and colorful, but also very generic and uninteresting. The voice cast is full of big names, but they get very little opportunity to shine.Megamind is by no means a bad movie, but with how competitive the genre of family computer animated movies has gotten in the last few years, it doesn't do nearly enough to stand out. It was decent enough to give a rental and I quite enjoyed some parts of it, but seeing it once will probably be enough for most people over the age of seven or eight.",,Anonymous,Animation
