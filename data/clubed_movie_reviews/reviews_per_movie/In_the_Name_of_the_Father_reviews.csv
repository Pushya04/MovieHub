Guilty Until Proven Innocent...,You're left wondering how many people over the years have been through the legal system in the UK and have been framed by those we place the ultimate trust within. It really does shake your confidence in a system and the people responsible for implementing it. Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite bring this story to life with two magnificent performances and allow you to forgive those slight variations that misalign with actual events.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disquieting great film,"The movie is based on a true story. Belfast guy Gerry Conlon is suspected of being one of the IRA terrorists responsible for a bomb in Guilford, London, in 1974, which killed several people. He spends 15 years in jail, fighting for his innocence and for truth.After working with Daniel Day Lewis in ""My left foot"", director Jim Sheridan teams again with the actor for this drama. The strong cast is completed by Emma Thomson and Pete Postlewaite. The result is a brilliant, passionate feature which tells about injustice. It's a disquieting film.This is doubtless the most achieved collaboration between the director and the main star. The other pictures as well are very good, but here we have a film of accusation -the story is more involving. Day Lewis performance in ""My left foot"" was awarded with an Oscar, but the actor could have been given the same prize for his play of Gerry Conlon.Strong screenplay, actors and soundtrack -with music of Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer and songs of Irish stars Bono and Sinead O'Connor.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Extremeley Powerful, With Superb Performances","A film fully deserving to be in IMDb's top 250, Jim Sheridan's ""In The Name of the Father"" is an excellent piece of work. Based on a true and very touching story, the film recounts the story of Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis) who is wrongly accused as an IRA terrorist. Not only are the police bending the facts to prove their case, but in the process they also implicate members of his friends and family, including his father Giuseppe (Postlethwaithe) whose health condition is rather frail. Gerry is a rebellious and mildly delinquent boy who does not seem to have grown up, and his attitude toward his father is not the appropriate one; however, as they start to go through the ordeal together, Gerry gradually matures, and starts feeling a deep affection and respect for Giuseppe.The story is heart-breaking and shocking at the same time, all the more so when one realizes that these things actually DID happen. Although there have been some minor modifications for the purpose of the film, the backbone of the story is left completely intact.The two protagonists, Daniel Day-Liewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are delivering powerful performances, and they both deserved the Oscar hands-down. However, it would be unfair not to mention that virtually everyone in the film is great in his/her role.Jim Sheridan's direction is also very good, giving the plot a fair and balanced perspective; although the film might initially appear as pro-Irish / anti-English, in fact I consider it as quite objective. Granted, it vividly shows that some key figures in the London police were profoundly biased and manipulated maliciously the case against the Conlons; yet, it also shows that English public attitudes turned highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for the atrocities they had been charged with. We have always to remember that the film depicts a period of big tensions, with emotions running high to levels of hysteria, so we have to understand the events within this context.Of course, what happened to the Conlons is totally deplorable and unjustifiable; and it is real shame that the people who conspired against them have not been punished yet for their crimes. Still, one should understand the hostile attitude shown by those who were not part of this conspiracy (such as the judge, for example), who were influenced by the climate of terror and the outrage of the public. The Conlons had the terribly bad luck to be at the wrong place, in the wrong time, and with the wrong nationality; the also have the great misfortune to be captured by people who in their quest to show results were shamelessly willing to risk indicting people who could possibly be innocent.""In the Name of the Father"" is a fantastic film, which one should not miss. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning.,"Words cannot accurately describe how affecting this movie is.The story itself is harrowing, but the way in which Day Lewis portrays Gerry Conlon is heartbreaking at times.  Several scenes in the film may be hard to take for those with a sensitive nature.Captures the mood and the time perfectly for someone like me, who is not Irish, lives nowhere near Guildford and wasn't even alive at the time of the pub bombings.I really wasn't expecting anything special when I sat down to watch this. I could not have been more wrong.The soundtrack is great without exception too!A total and utter classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perhaps a bit too black and white but still very impressive.,"Even though this movie seems a bit too black and white from time to time I must say that it still is an impressive piece of cinema. Too black and white because I sometimes had the feeling that they had left out some parts to make it all a lot easier for the viewer. I can't help believing that Conlon and Hill weren't the nicest guys either, but the movie shows them almost as saints (except for the fact that they steal some lead from the roofs, they never really do anything wrong). Does that mean that this movie isn't any good? Certainly not! It still remains very impressive and the idea that injustice in the name of protecting the country should be allowed is awful and so it is good that at least some movie makers aren't afraid to protest against it.The movie tells the story about Gerry Conlon and his old school friend Paul Hill. They both are small time criminals and because of their own safety they have to live in London for a while. Otherwise they might get shot by the IRA. In London they stay in a community of hippies, but aren't welcomed by everybody. As a bomb explodes in a pub, one of the members from the community goes to the police and accuses them of the crime. They are immediately apprehended, together with Conlon's father, his aunt and her family. What follows is a process full of corruption and false accusations, putting them in jail for many years even though they haven't done anything wrong.The film is very good. It's well acted, well paced and well directed. The story is touching and I never got bored when watching it. Therefor I give it an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An Involving, Sometimes Brutal Story","I might have rated this higher had Emma Thompson had a bigger role. I am a fan of hers, plus I think most people would agree she's an excellent actress, so it was disappointment to see her appear much until the last 15 minutes of the film. That's especially misleading when she gets second or third billing in this movie.Nonetheless, it's an involving true-story of an Irishman, his dad and some of their relatives who are all sent to prison for a bombing they had nothing to do with. Filmmakers LOVE these kind of stories in which they can make their country and police into the bad guys. Here, the British look bad - very bad - as they railroad ""Gerry Conlon"" (Daniel-Day Lewis). The latter makes a convincing hot-headed Irishman, but he's no killer. The tone of the movie softens not in the last half hour as Lewis' character begins to appreciate his father. Until then, it's a rough film that is not always easy to watch and hear because of the accents, some police brutality and corruptness and general group of nasty characters.By the way, despite the billing, Pete Postlewaite is the second star of the film. He doesn't get the recognition he deserves for his acting contribution in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful and Touching,"Name of the Father came out one year before The Shawshank Redemption and is bar none the better film.   Shawshank is a great film but Name of the Father has more of human story to it.   Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor with more potential now than he did when he won his first Oscar for My Left Foot and since then he has never starred in a film which he has acted badly in.  Some of the stories have not been amazing but his acting makes up for it.   This was the second time That Daniel Day Lewis and Jim Sheridan have come together to make a film. In all they have done three but Name of the father is by far the best.   Pete Postlethwaite is another example of fine acting as he is the best actor in England since who ever was the last greatest actor.Daniel Day Lewis plays Gerry Conlon who is a seventies hippie who doesn't want to grow up.   He has had so many troubles at home his fatherGiuseppe  played by Postlethwaite decides to pack him off to London for his own safety and not become a lost soul amongst the troubles in Belfast. But when Gerry gets there he might as well wish he never went there in the first place as the trouble from Belfast follows him and before you know it a bomb goes off in a pub near to where he is staying and is not long arrested for the bomb along with his friends and family including his father.From there we are taken into this grieving story of strength, hope, tragedy and family. The story between father and son in jail is more touching and compelling than any love story you will ever see because these two men who have never really seen eye to eye are forced to confront each other's feeling and face up to where they stand in the world.   Also Pete Postlewaite reminds me of my own father and my grandfather and yours two. He plays Giuseppe so well so would have thought he was the old guy living next door to you or the man you look up to as a father and spend time with as a granddad.   What you have to remind yourself is that the movie is a true story of the Guilford Bombing and the men who paid the price for it. Whether or not you believe Gerry and Giuseppe were guilty of the Guilford Bomb is not the case in the film as it's more about the characters and there trials and tribulations.One film that will always be remembered in my mind about making a difference with your life not matter where you are in the world.",,Anonymous,Biography
History and Court Drama,"A man (Daniel Day-Lewis)'s coerced confession to an IRA bombing he did not commit results in the imprisonment of his father as well. An English lawyer fights to free them.This film is a great combination of history and court drama. Sometimes both mix very nicely (as with the Nuremberg trial) and sometimes they do not. Here, we get a nice glimpse at the IRA in Ireland without dwelling on it too much and also get the true story of a family that was wronged by the state for their alleged involvement in terror.Ireland today is not the same place it was a generation ago, but it is not so far removed that this story is ""distant history"" and not important. Heck, Americans should probably know more about it than what they pick up from a U2 song.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Terrorism hurts everyone.,"In watching this fine film, on idea kept running though my mind. That being terrorism often hurts the innocent much more than the declared enemy. In the Name of the Father is a powerful, well-acted drama about terrorism and injustice. And also the love one man feels for his father. Some of the events in this film are factual, and others are not. Despite some liberties taken with history, the film still makes a strong point, however.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry Conlon, a young man falsely accused along with several other friends and family members, of bombing a London pub in 1974. The bombing, performed by the IRA, killed a few persons and wounded several others. Conlon and his friends just happen to be near by when the bombing takes place. Through police torture, Conlon and his best friend confess to the crime, thinking a trial will exonerate them. Trouble is, there had been so many recent bombings that the legal system in Britain was just crying out for a scapegoat. Conlon and four friends are given life sentences. Several members of Conlon's family are also given stiff jail sentences. Even his own father who seems to be the most righteous and kind person imaginable and who never set foot in England at all during the time of the bombing!The film starts out like a shot from a cannon, as we see just how violent and chaotic Blefast was during the early seventies. Just living a normal life looked impossible. If the British troops weren't after you, then the IRA members were. The film also scores when we see Conlon head off to London to presumably make a better life for himself. He and a friend force themselves into a commune and enjoy a brief period of free love and decadence. The film gets very heavy once Conlon is arrested and tortured. And the last hour detailing his time behind bars is just plain somber. We watch his father just sort of waste away with him behind bars while an aggressive lawyer (Emma Thompson) fights to get them out. Pete Postletwaite is exceptional as Gerry's father, and seeing him grow sicker and weak is very difficult for the viewer.The film tries to shift gears down the stretch and show how Conlon has become determined and more radicalized, but these scenes are nothing spectacular. Even the conclusion seems a little anti-climatic, but at least we see some justice finally get done. The acting is very, very good. Lewis is as good as ever, and nobody looks out of their league. There are some historical liberties taken. Gerry and his father never actually lived in the same cell, for instance. Overall, this film will stick with you, though.In watching this film, one cannot help but feel for the victims of terrorism. I have personally not much knowledge of the conflict between the IRA and Britain, except to say that I'm well aware of how long and deep the scars run between the English and Irish peoples. That said, there is simply no excuse for terrorism. Look at how many victims that pub bombing created. Not only those who perished or were injured. That act of terror sent several innocent people to jail and ruined their lives! The British legal system is certainly to blame for sending the wrong people to jail, but would this have even happened if the IRA had not bombed that pub? A similar situation can be seen in the Middle East today. Radical Muslims look to strike out at Western interests, but their actions often hurt scores more other Muslims than any actual Western interests! Will we ever all learn to get along on this planet?8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Underrated,"I have read many reviews before i watched the movie. After i finished it seemed like English people don't like this movie too much. At some point i understand them, but most of them tried to bring some historical ""facts"" and rumours to damage this movie. There were some others who was trying to catch some mistakes in the movie. The were saying things that doesn't change anything really, for instance: It doesn't really matter where Gerry and Hill met, it doesn't matter if they were at some time in some groups or how they have become the suspects. These things doesn't change the whole idea, but when you sometimes make movies you just have to make some changes.There were some other people who was trying to state they were not innocent, they did some other things, robbery and so on. They are wrong too, it doesn't matter what else they did in any other place. This movie is focusing on Guildford Bombing, this movie is focusing on people who ere jailed that have nothing to do with that bombing. So, they were innocent in this case. The stayed in prison for 15 years. That is very unfair and the such an embarrassing story for England. I am sorry, but it is.For my point of view this movie is underrated because of people who didn't like it. They rated this movie considering many other things that have nothing to do with this movie. When i rate movie, i only consider movie. This movie is well directed with great performances! I was not bored when i was watching the movie. This is all i can ask from movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

very good movie,"Before seeing this movie I thought it was more about the crimes committed by IRA during the ""hot"" period, a sort of documentary. IRA plays indeed an important rule in the events, but the main thing is that this movie is the true story of a family that has been destroyed by the madness of the time, by the need of a scapegoat to pay for all the crimes that were committed. Very well directed. A very famous prison in Dublin, that had an important rules during the independence from England, has been chosen as setting.

About the dangers of giving into your fear and anger,"October 1974, London. Young Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) gets arrested by the police. They claim he is an IRA (Irish Republican Army) terrorist and to blame for the bombing in Guildford that killed five people. Gerry maintains that he's innocent, but the police and the people of Britain are hungry for blood. The film is based on real events.As you can imagine, the film is anything but congratulatory towards the society and the justice system of the 70s. The film focuses heavily on Conlon's own personal experiences before and after the bombing, but the film takes it time to get the licks in.Daniel Day-Lewis has earned a reputation as one of the great names in cinema and watching this movie you can certainly see why. It all feels authentic, from the quiet rage to desperation to just giving up, if not outright snapping. I also really liked the performance given by Pete Postlethwaite as Giuseppe, Gerry's father.A heavy movie and makes one appreciate how one has managed to grow in relative peace and quiet. Sure modern Europe has had its own upheavals, but nothing quite like this.If I had to name a negative, I would say that the film is a bit episodic, like many biographical films tend to be. It's better than most I've seen, but the film has to jump around in time a lot and these transitions are not quite as graceful as they perhaps could have been.Still, an interesting movie and a great watch for all fans of historical drama.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful Cinema!,"A powerful intro and a stylish ending! The story is so well told and so realistic that you're bound to get involved in the conflict and the case. The direction is superb and the acting is superior. Daniel Day- Lewis is a true chameleon, he's flawless in adopting to Irish culture & accent in the same way he's unflinching as native American in Gangs of New York.

"Not great, but good.","In The Name Of The Father is a good movie. Not great, but good. After all, it has a lot going for it: great acting (particularly from its headlining stars: Day-Lewis, Postlethwaite and Thompson), solid and assured direction as well as, obviously, a thought-provoking story about four individuals who were wrongly imprisoned for over 15 years for a crime they did not commit (as well as seven others sent to prison on separate charges). But belying these good aspects, is an over-simplified, poorly-paced and sometimes confusing version of the truth. The story that's being told of the 'Guildford Four' can be perplexing at times, largely because of the pacing and editing of the film. Characters are introduced in some scenes which leave you going ""Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?"", before it clicks much later on in the film who they are and what those scenes were about - and not in a good way. I'm sure a second or third viewing may clear up some of those aspects for me, but it usually doesn't speak well of a film if you're going back to watch it just you can understand what happened fully - rather than re-watching it to try and catch details you missed and/or analyse the film more closely.In addition, despite the lengthy run-time, the story is dreadfully slow and out of balance at times. For example, Thompson barely seems to appear in the film, and seeing more of what she did to try and get the Guildford Four out of prison would have been compelling. The out-of-kilter pacing also led to some strange moments i.e. we're told about Guiseppe, Gerry's father, leading a campaign to try and get them free; the result of which we only see in the last 15-20 minutes of the film. Much like Thompson's rare appearances, it would have been nice to see more of this, rather than merely being told it, and how it came about rather than seemingly going from 0 to 100 in the blink of an eye.In short, the over two hour run-time should have been cut down and streamlined, and could have almost definitely benefited from adjusting the story beats significantly. There are other issues with the editing such as (at least) two noticeably dubbed over lines, and (on a lesser note) unimpressive and boring opening and closing credits (not really that much of a negative, but I thought I'd point it out regardless). Because of these aforementioned issues, I can't give this film an overwhelmingly positive score despite its merits. I therefore sentence 'In The Name Of The Father' to a 7/10, with a possible re-review in the future to consider any other possibilities that may have been missed.Court is adjourned.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolutely dreadful.,"Many reviews say that words cannot accurately describe this movie, and they would be correct. I, however, will give it a try. I first saw this movie some 20+ years ago and I found it to be a long, plodding, go- nowhere film where the outcome was predictable from the start and unraveled so formulaic it could have spewed from the powerbook of the laziest Hollywood hack. It was over-acted at numerous times, some of the conversations were simply not believable (did George Lucas write some of this dialogue?) and there were too many unnecessary close-ups for dramatic effect. Having not read the book (as I was unaware at the time I first viewed it that there was one) and no knowledge of the individuals or events that would comprise the film, the filmmakers needed to do a better job of having viewers care about the characters, their struggles, and their fates. Instead, I found the film to be preachy (can't stress that enough), one-sided and ultimately boorish.Fast forward 20 years.Recently, I had the opportunity to view this film again and thought that maybe 20 years of maturity on my part would let me see this film through a different lens and possibly appreciate (at the very least) the intention of the filmmakers. This time was, indeed, different. I was in my house and in control of the remote. After 20 minutes, I just couldn't take it anymore. Daniel Day Lewis and company - you all owe me 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life and I want it back.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
In the Name of the Father and the Truth,"Jim Sheridan's astonishingly fantastic 'In the Name of the Father' tells the brutally direct story of a wrongfully accused family who are tortured into making a false confession and imprisoned by the British justice system. Sheridan has a way of telling his stories where he gets straight to the point and does not fear to show the reality of the situation while keeping us viewers at the edge of our seats. The film is based on Gerry Conlan's autobiography where Daniel Day-Lewis plays the central character. Sheridan effectively portrays Gerry and Giuseppe's struggle and fight against injustice and his portrayal of the corrupt British justice system is frightening. Just the idea that people could get away with such things in a country like the UK is chilling and Sheridan skillfully brings that across on screen. Terry George's brilliant screenplay with rich characters and solid dialogues forms a good backbone for the film. I also liked how the humour was infused in a modest dose as not to interfere with the intensity of the story. There are some excellent performances. Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a suitably explosive performance as he breathes fire into the role while Pete Postlethwaite is sublime and equally outstanding as Gerry's father, Giuseppe. Though father and son do have issues to fight over, it is Giuseppe who is Gerry's conscience and Postlethwaite's heartbreaking act really touches the heart. Emma Thompson holds her own and she is simply excellent. The rest of the cast do a superb job (watch out for Tom Wilkinson in a bit role). The soundtrack fits the mood of the film and the cinematography is good, especially in the prison sequences, where it creates that feeling of claustrophobia which gets stronger after Gerry is alone in his cell. I have liked all of Sheridan's ' films that I have seen so far and 'In The Name Of The Father' is another remarkable film from this fine director. It is a difficult movie to watch due to some disturbing themes and scenes (though most of them are rather suggestive it is the idea behind that sends chills down the spine) but it is definitely worth watching.",,Anonymous,Biography

Beautiful and Unforgettable,"We are all more sensitive to this or that film, which for whatever reason become remarkable, are indelibly imprinted in our memories and accompany us throughout our lives. For me, one of those films is In the Name of the Father by Jim Sheridan (1993).Among so many different and exquisite works that Daniel Day-Lewis has already accustomed us to, it remains one of my favorites, supported by a touching Pete Postlethwaite, the father of the title, both (deservedly) nominated for Oscars for best representation.More than 25 years later, the final words of the protagonist still echo in my head - ""in the name of my father and of the truth"" - as if it were an appeal, towards a certain meaning of life, according to which injustices were easily annihilated and the confusion of the world fixed, thus preventing the good from experiencing ""great torments"" and the bad swimming ""in a sea of contentment"" (Luís Vaz de Camões).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible father and son story,"It's 1974. The IRA bombs a pub in Guildford, England. Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an aimless petty thief. His father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) is a straight-arrow soft-spoken man. He and his friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) are in London staying with hippies. They leave the flat when the pub bombing happens. A prostitute drops her keys and Gerry breaks in. The parliament passes the Prevention of Terrorism Act which allows for suspects to be held for 7 days. Gerry, Paul and others are arrested and coerced into false confessions. Giuseppe and other relatives are also implicated. The actual bomber Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) is arrested and tells the police. However the police refuses to admit its mistake. Gerry befriends Joe in prison while ignoring the peaceful faith of his father. Joe becomes the leader of the prison as Giuseppe declines in health. British attorney Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson) works to free the falsely imprisoned. After Joe burns the lead guard, Gerry saves him and turns on Joe.This is a meticulous telling of a compelling life wrongly convicted. It's a bit up and down at times. The first trial is not the most compelling. The results are preordained and not that compelling. The most compelling is the father son relationship. When Joe get into the middle, it's a great turn in the story. These are two great performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite. The two of them in prison is a terrific movie filled with emotions and character growth. The final court case is theatrical as heck.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A denounce film showing the darker corners of the British legal system,"An interesting film in which politics and family life in prison cell share the focus as director Jim Sheridan captures superior acting from Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite , regarding the wrongful conviction of the Guilford Four . Competent story of Gerry Conlon and the Guildford Four illegally imprisoned in 1974 by British officials after a tragic IRA bombing near London . Falsely accused. Wrongly imprisoned. He fought for justice to clear his father's name. In the name of truth... In the name of justice... In the name of love.Stirring and intriguing British Prision movie mostly located into a prison and the facts , of course , speak for themselves . So it is based on real facts , resulting to be a moving and intense flick picture that packs straightforward pace , thriller , tension , sober drama , violence and denounce about the repressive laws existent in the United Kingdom. With an excellent cast , including sensational acting from the magnificent starring Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite . Daniel gives a splendid lesson in how he is able to withstand the weight of the flick by playing an innocent prisoner . And Emma Thompson was accused of pro-IRA sympaties in the British press for her character as the lawyer at law who believed in Conlon's innocence . Adapted from ¨Proved innocent¨, Conlon's prison memoirs ,reunites Sheridan and Daniel Day-Lewis after ¨My left foot¨. Not only were the Four , led by Gerry Conlon sentenced to 30-year terms for the bomb of a Guildford pub in 1974 , but Conlon's father served several years
of a 12-year term before dying in prison . It's a good film but your attention may wander more than once en route to its explosive and exaggerated finale . There's a long time of the film dealing with prision life , including some atrocities , cruelty and excessive use of force by the guards enjoying impunity for committing any act of violence and torture against the prisoners, these happenings -despite a few thrilling incidents- convey boredom rather than suspense .Provoking and thrilling screenplay by Terry George and Jim Sheridan himself , with some regular stereotypes about prison genre . Appropriate cinematography by cameraman Peter Bizious who photographs splendidly the cold and dark interiors from prison. Sensitive and rousing musical score by Trevor Jones , including a tense leitmotif , adding original songs by U2's Bono and a haunting song theme sung by Sinead O'Connor . This dramatic gripping yarn was stunningly directed by Jim Sheridan . This good professional has directed notable films, such as : Brothers , Get Rich or Die Tryin' , In América , Secret scripture , The field , 11th Hour and My left foot . In 1995 he wrote and produced Some Mother's Son, which was directed by Terry George. In 1997 he wrote, produced and directed The Boxer and in 1999 he produced Agnes Browne, directed by and starring Anjelica Huston. He was also executive producer of Borstal Boy, On The Edge and Bloody Sunday. And he has directed seven actors into Oscar-nominated roles: Brenda Fricker, Samantha Morton, Djimon Hounsou, Pete Postlethwaite, Richard Harris. Emma Thompson, and Daniel Day-Lewis. Rating : 7/10.

Unimpressive,"The Troubles is a recurring subject in Irish/British film making and one can't say In The Name Of The Father is the pick of the bunch with regards to this matter. It even is a bit surprising that it receives such raving critics when the movie has such little impact on the viewer.The plot's introduction doesn't augur anything good and you wonder where Jim Sheridan wants to take you to. The script then shifts to a prison chronicle — which turns out to be the real nature of the film — that blatantly lacks intensity and most importantly rhythm, a lot of scenes being not that pertinent. It is also regrettable that the movie is sometimes caricatural, for example with the trial scenes which aren't that well depicted.What to draw then from this film ? not much, only the good performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and especially Pete Postlethwaite, already dazzling at the time, manage to save the day.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
a timely reminder,"I do not see this film as being political nonsense at all.Rather it serves as a warning of what can happen when blanket stereotyping is allowed to influence the course of justice.As Gareth Peirce (impressively portrayed by the excellent Emma Thompson) points out, the only reason Giueseppe Conlon and Co were tried in the first place was on the shaky premise that ""they were bloody well Irish"". As Irish people living in England in the 1970s, they must therefore have been terrorists.Logical?I thought not.The authorities never thought for a second that they might actually have been trying to escape that nonsense through carving out a new life for themselves in England.With a British public baying for blood, the police capitulated by picking up the first ""paddies"" they found and making an example of them, without making any serious efforts to root out the real perpetrators and ensuring they were rendered incapable of causing more harm through doling out lengthy imprisonments to them, as opposed to ruining the lives of an innocent family.Ironically of course such actions could well have served to make terrorist sympathisers out of the Conlons through the horrific treatment meted out to them!It didn't of course but there is always the danger in that type of case that a person could become embittered to that extent.Obviously given the unstable climate of the time Irish people in England were sometimes regarded with suspicion,yet the fact remains that the events portrayed in the film were unacceptable in a supposed western democracy committed to the rule of law.While neither side was entirely innocent the fact remains that England was undeniably culpable in this instance, and the judiciary involved in the case must bear full responsibilty for the devestating effects of their knee-jerk ruling, given to appease an irrational and hysterical public.In this respect the Conlons and Co can viably be seen by some as ""Irish martyrs"". While I am no fan of Hollywood fare which seeks to glamourise Irish terrorists at the expense of England who is invariably portrayed as the cold and unrelenting oppressor (inaccurate and unfair in the present day I feel) I strongly believe that in this case the criticism and negative portrayal of the English legal system is justified to a considerable extent.The film has especial resonance and significance for us today in the wake of al-Quaeda and the resultant perceptions of Muslims as a whole as being ""the enemy"" in certain quarters.The recent incarceration of an innocent Syrian who had lived his entire adult life in Canada, and who was imprisoned purely on the basis of his ethnicity, only serves to remind us of the perils of ""judging a book by its cover"" and making snap judgements, a danger which is admirably illustrated in this well-acted film.",,Anonymous,Biography
Very moving and exceptionally well acted,"In the Name of the Father... what a fine movie! This is a movie that really moved me and continues to do so. It has a stirring story, that carries a great dramatic punch, it is beautifully directed by Jim Sheridan and while a little over two hours it never bored me. The script is lovingly balanced, the film looks beautiful and the emotional punch is definitely there. I loved the acting best of all though. Daniel Day Lewis is highly impressive as Conlon, and while I have seen a few reviews saying Emma Thompson was miscast I thought her performance was fine, if anything I would have liked to have seen more of her. For me, Pete Postlethwaite gives the best performance, he is brilliant as the bemused and hapless father, and if there is a film or role he should be remembered for it is this one. Overall, a perhaps controversial but engaging, moving and wonderfully acted movie. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunningly well told story.,"In 1974 the Irish Republican Army bombed two public houses in Guildford, England-The Horse & Groom and the Seven Stars. 5 people were killed and 65 people were seriously injured. During the wave of public hatred for all things Irish, the police round up Belfast rogue Gerry Conlon and his mate Paul Hill and interrogate for 7 days with brute force to obtain a confession... This is Gerry Conlon & the Guildford 4's story.This is real powerful stuff that thankfully is directed with careful hands. Director Jim Sheridan is equal in his demonizing of the police and the IRA here because it's crucial for us to focus on the Guildford 4. Focus on the Conlon family, for they are victims of injustice when they have no political, or nationalistic affiliations. He centres in on the relationship between Gerry & his father Guiseppe as they find themselves both wrongly imprisoned. It's that family heartbeat that drives this film on, and it's testament to the makers talents that it never comes across as maudlin, it's all very potent and is the films major axis point.Based on a true story the picture has a finale that will not surprise anyone, but come the last reel you feel emotionally drained, you have come thru the mangler, and myself personally felt both joy and anger in equal measure. Containing brilliant performances from Pete Postelthwaite & Daniel Day Lewis as father & son Conlon respectively, In The Name of The Father is a truly great film that demands not only your head, but also your heart. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

For the sake of this film I sit on the British side of the line, for I've seen the terror and the immediate fall out even though I had nothing to do with the history leading up to it.  Regardless, the acts of a mindless few doesn't ever justify the gross abuse of power seen and portrayed in this film.The British who view it can't help but be appalled at the behaviour of their own because we do pride ourselves on having a fair and balanced legal system.  The Irish who view it can't help but applaud the rare nature of a film making a stand from their side.But one side shouldn't attack the other over opinions on a film such as this; neither the British for the inaccuracies or the Irish for the Brits apparent refusal to accept something very wrong was done in our name.Instead it should just be appreciated as a film that makes a very valid point, in a very effective manner.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite,"A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life.Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson).The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son.Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A good social critique, but not much more","Don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie. But it's a good movie, not a great one. And I don't even think it has intentions of being it, but rather making a statement on the Northern Ireland conflict, about the UK, and about democratic legal system's as a whole. And above all, it wants to make Gerry Conlon's story reach a wider audience. I seriously cannot believe what happened to him, it's completely outrageous and it really makes you think about the whole idea of Justice, judges, juries, laws, police and so on. Besides the story, which is good (and even better when you keep in the back of your mind that it really happened), the best of this movie is Daniel Day-Lewis' acting. He is probably the best living actor, I'd dare to say. Since it's the earliest movie I've seen of him, I seriously thought that he's actually Irish and that only later he learned to do other accents. Man, he really sounds Irish!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Remarkable and moving,"This is a moving film on many levels. Firstly, it recounts a case of terrible injustice on the part of the British legal system, during a time when relations between the British and the Irish were in chaos. Underneath this is a moving story of how a young man's foolishness and bad luck lands him and his family in the worst of situations, and how in that situation he grows and matures. There are moments of true pain and true tenderness, between Gerry and his father as they share the prison cell. There are also moments of goodness and evil on both sides of the ""war"", moments of weakness with terrible consequences. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an incredible performance as Gerry, with a vivacity that pervades the film, and his father's calm strength adds a perfect balance. In the Name of the Father is a film you will not regret seeing and will not soon forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A painful tale of injustice,"This movie tells a real-life emotionally devastating story about the politics and unlawful acts of the justice system.

Good but slightly reductive,"I'm not too sure In the Name of the Father fully deserves its 8.1 on IMDb, or whether it should outrank Sorkin's thematically similar Trial of the Chicago 7. Theo Robertson's review points out several historical inaccuracies (one correction: An appeals court overturned Hill's murder conviction in 1994 as his confession to the crime, which the entire case rested upon, had been forcibly extorted). The effect of these inaccuracies is a slightly skewed, touched up narrative. But given that the film's overwhelming focus is finding and doing justice to the truth, this feels indecorous. INF also transitions too quickly between structurally important moments in the film, which doesn't allow us time to reflect on those events, prevents certain characters (like Gareth) from being fleshed out, and gives the impression of piecemeal.Nonetheless, it's a compelling and important movie which more than adequately explores substantive justice and Giuseppe and Gerry's complex relationship. As viewers, we're challenged to overlook Conlon and Hill's murky characters and recognize the categorical irrelevance of those priors in determining their guilt. The inability of a justice system to do so, coupled with coercive and intimidating practices, has terrible consequences.A good movie overall, though it may not quite deserve to be on Top 250.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jim Sheridan's Tour De Force,"Few times have I felt such injustice portrayed in a film with such a pay off since Stanley Kubrik's Paths of Glory. This film is perfectly put together and establishes said portrayal of injustice from the get-go.The film follows Paul Micheal Hall played by Daniel Day Lewis who was wrongly sentenced for 'The Guildford Bombings' of 1974. This film shows him and his father from their time in Belfast to their prison sentence. Daniel Day Lewis gives an unsurprisingly good performance but the crown goes to Pete Postlethwaite in his role as Patrick ""Giuseppe"" Conlon, Paul's father. This is an easy film to compare to Shawshank Redemption which is at the top of the IMDb's top 250 and I think anybody who has loved that film should check this out.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Courtroom Classic,"Courtroom drama's are always prime for great cinema. In the Name of the Father is no different. It shouldn't come as any surprise with Daniel Day-Lewis as the lead, and he is incredible as Gerry Conlon, a wrongfully convicted terrorist in 1970's London. I have to admit I didn't know much about the bombings upon viewing, so this whole story came as a shock to me. But the film is a really good eye opener and reminder that no one is guilty until proved innocent, and then some.Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson were both nominated for supporting roles and they really do carry this film. I would almost say more so than Day-Lewis. I knew he would give a killer performance but i didn't know the other two had this in them, especially Postlethwaite. The film also closely deals with the relationship between Gerry and his father. The many ups and downs they go through as a result of being in a jail for so many years. Gerry is a scoundrel at best towards the beginning. They show him stealing right off the bat to give us the impression that this may be a character you may not be able to trust. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I could trust him up until he was being beaten by the detectives to sign the confession.I will say I wasn't a huge fan of the direction to begin the film. Jim Sheridan had a knack for choppy directing early on that was hard to follow. But once the film settles in and gets going as a true courtroom genre, the film takes off. I also like that the film tackles the issue of non-violent vs. violent protests and tactics in a fair way. It isn't clear to me that the filmmakers believe one way or the other is the way to go. And I think that's the right way to go about it.+All the performances+Tension built in the court-Choppy directing to start8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Amazing View of The Troubles,"Totally Surprising. Not at all what I expected from the subject and previews. It could have been a clichéd exploitation of a complicated horrible situation, but rather is exceptionally subtle, nuanced and original, and therefore, very powerful. Some people comment that it plays a little loose with facts, some of which are not so minor. That the film makes no mention of Gerry Conlon's possible, if doubtful, ties to the IRA does change things a bit. Including that info would only have made the film better, more subtle. But its omission does help us to see Gerry Conlon as unjustly accused, tortured and convicted, avoiding the distraction of our suspecting him a criminal terrorist. Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are riveting as living, breathing, flesh and blood characters, almost bigger and better than the story itself. As a period piece, it recreates the turbulent '70s vividly, while it constantly fascinated me with its British take on the Generation Gap.

A Parable on How to Respond to Violence - Based on a True Story,"IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (A-) is the second collaboration between director Jim Sheridan and actor Daniel Day-Lewis and scored seven Academy Award nominations (winning none of them). The film is based on the true story of how Gerry Conlon, his father, and other members of his extended family were wrongly accused, framed, and imprisoned for an IRA bombing in London during the 1970's. Rather than a examine the particulars of the IRA situation, the film uses the story of Gerry Conlon and the injustice done to him by the English government as a parable of vengeance and justice. Yes, the particulars of the story are important to inform and you do walk away with a general sense of what happened in this story, but the film is more pre-occupied with embodying the different responses we can make to injustice: should we just accept it (Gerry Conlon), violently react (Joe McAndrew), or peacefully protest it (Giuseppe Conlon)? Gerry Conlon is one of Daniel Day-Lewis best performances and I'm aware at the stiff competition that is. Daniel Day-Lewis becomes Gerry - an immature, ignorant, and unprincipled young man with no real direction or passions in life. After he's dumb enough to steal roofing metal in Dublin causing an IRA riot his father Giuseppe sends him off to live in London. It's there where he happens to be in the wrong place and time to be framed for an IRA pub bombing. I greatly enjoyed watching Conlon struggle to care in the face of injustice and though his father Giuseppe (who is imprisoned alongside him) starts a peaceful letter campaign, Gerry despairs. There's a wonderful mid-section of the film in prison where the real bomber, Joe McAndrew, winds up and showcases what it looks like to stand up and violently respond to injustice. The lessons Gerry learns here become the heart of the movie and move him to accept his father's (who is now dying) ways. It's not a perfect movie, but it is a moving story of injustice and how our responses can to it can either continue to perpetuate injustice/violence, or can seek to disarm it. Well written, directed, and performed, this is one of the best court/prison films out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Looking back,"When you are faced with enough material to make a mini-series and try to put it in a 2-hour film you have to make choices.Neither the British nor the IRA are depicted with any depth, the target is to establish both Gerry as a bit of a goofy, likable character and his father, an intelligent but downtrodden figure. Rock, humor and great lines complete the package.The better part of this movie depicts the relationship between Gerry and Guiseppe Conlon and true to life, never receives closing. Sheridan seems to realize this and gives the relationship time to grow naturally without forcing anything. A few lapses into sentimentality could be avoided but are successfully countered with humor.Since 1994 when I first saw the movie, the world, including Ireland has moved on.

Other reviewers have done a good job of establishing the real relationships involved between Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Paul Hill (John Lynch), so no use belaboring that point. The most disturbing aspect of this film is the idea that authorities won't admit their mistake in a high profile case, even when it means the disruption of families and it's impact on vulnerable citizens like Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), who died in prison serving out a senseless term for a crime he didn't commit. Adding insult to injury, the real terrorists, some of whom admitted their part in the Guildford pub bombing, never even got charged with the crime. It's just so infuriating, especially when you know there's no recourse for the injured parties.

An injustice that still reverberates,"""In the Name of Father"" is the one of the greatest movies ever to be filmed. It is based on a true story about an injustice of mammoth proportions committed against four innocent individuals. The corrupt roots of the law enforcement poison the lives and psyches of Paul Hill, Gerry Conlon, Paddy Armstrong, Carole Richardson popularly known as 'The Guildford Four'. Among others including Gerry' father , The Guildford Four are sentenced to imprisonment for a crime they didn't commit. The movie is a painful journey through the lives of these four until their kith and kin manage to garner sufficient public voice and evidence leading to their eventual release. Gerry loses his father to the cruelties of prison life which poignantly portrays the resignation of innocence. A determined lawyer , energetically played by Emma Thompsonm, finally manages to secure the release of the four after 15 years of suffering and trauma. But 15 years is a behemoth of a price for a little indiscretion on part of the judicial system.Although I will confess to being a self-absorbed individual , this movie made me wanna fight for The Guilford Four cause. Apparently, the events have been doctored only slightly to suit move making. The fact that a British Prime Minister offered an apology is but an epitome as to how entrenched the tragedy was. The bearing that the 15 years might have had on the psyche of the individuals is unfathomable. After I watched the movie , I spent hours contemplating on Gerry Conlon and the loss he suffered.Daniel Day Lewis is simply stunning . Not only does he carry the film, he makes it the masterpiece that it is. The supporting cast aren't far behind either. And Emma Thompson just bursts into the scene with great fervor. The soundtrack was pretty impressive too , particularly the score by Sinead 'O Connor. With all this behind such a stunning piece of art , the Academy' move in 1993 puzzled me. Schindler's List , however, I guess solves the puzzle.10/10 really",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
outstanding cinema,"This is a terrific movie and the acting is just outstanding.  Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the finest actors in the world and he never makes a misstep in a role.  He had just come off of making ""The Last of Mohicans"" and when ""In the Name of the Father"" was cast he suggested Pete Postlethwaite for the rold of Guiseppe Conlan.  Postlethwaite had a very small role in ""Mohicans"" but he he got an Oscar nomination for ""Father"" and his career took off.  No doubt he sends Day-Lewis a Christmas gift every year (if he doesn't, he should!).The movie has two parallel stories---the Conlans' fight to clear their names and the contentious relationship between the father and son.  I thought that the most powerful scene in the movie was when Guiseppe and Gerry are put into a cell together for the first time.  Gerry, who's already been severely tortured, is scared out of his wits and begins railing against his father, letting all of his resentments towards his father boil out.  Guiseppe stoically takes the verbal abuse until Gerry breaks down and falls into his father's arms.  In the end he is a frightened child, clinging to his father for protection.  Just a tremendous acting job by both men.An interesting trivia aside, Gerry's buddy in the movie, Paul Hill, later married one of Bobby Kennedy's daughters.  When he was tortured to confess he not only confessed to the Guilford bombing but to killing a Belfast police officer.  Of course he was exonerated of the bombing but amazingly the British gov't fought to make the police officer murder charge stick, claiming apparently that even though Hill was tortured to confess falsely to the bombing, that his tortured confession to the other murder was acceptable to convict him.  The higher court finally threw out the conviction and Hill was finally free.""In the Name of the Father"" is a movie that will make you angry.  And it will also move you as a tremendous portrayal of a relationship between father and son.",,Anonymous,Biography

He stays in the character, he does what he needs to do to be in the character and completely shows on screen which he has a very strong presence.At the same time, not to forget Pete who plays Gerry's father and they share the same prison cell in the movie. Something that which I had seen for the first time and it was a little difficult for me to digest that father - son sharing the same prison. Pete in his own way played the role model of the good father who wants to inculcate good habits in his son, but fails. Even his death scene who intensely dramatic and clearly showed that how this would change his son. Then the movie picks up the pace.on Emma Thompson, probably i was too enamored by the Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, her role was kind of over shadowed. Not saying that she didn't have a commanding role, she was the lawyer, defending falsely accused of terrorist activity.This movie is not for the faint heartened, its not horror movie. But at the same time, it is really good movie to watch out for, when you are hoping to watch good cinema. Don't let the intense look on the cover on the DVD cover dissuade from watching a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The steamroller of the British state security system flattens one Gerry Conlan and turns this unlikely petty thief into a radical.,"Director Jim Sheridan has crafted a finely nuanced cross-section of the ""Irish Troubles"" seen through the filter of a gradual father/son reconcilliation.The both of them, father and son, are clumsily, but brutishly sucked into the dark belly of one of Britian's maximum security prisons. Here Daniel Day-Lewis, as Gerry, the son, innocent of the terrorist bombing he's accused of committing, gets to first befriend a bona-fide terrorist, then see him commit a politically-motivated attack, close up.Here's where the story turns. Daniel Day-Lewis, despite his self-loathing and bitterness, rejects the violence of his friend and recognizes his ""Da's"" dogged determination to right the wrongs done to them as a proper outlet for his rage and grief stemming from his horrible misfortunes.Conlan's character does what all radicals do. He's able to remove himself and his momentary storm of emotions from a larger perspective, and see clearly what havoc the system has done to him. And he has done so in a stirring, contradictory and ultimately heroic way.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Well Told Story,"As a whole I enjoyed this film. It tells a true story, and well. The acting is all top notch, and the themes about standing up to injustice are great. Really, I think my biggest problem with this film is that I felt as if it was leading me by the hand emotionally. Every scene where something emotional happens, the music swells and the performances get more dramatic; there are impassioned monologues and tearful revelations... it just feels like everyone is trying so freaking hard to get me to care about everything. If they hadn't played up the overly dramatic parts of this movie I probably would've enjoyed it a bit more.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (DIDIER BECU),"I don't think there is anyone around who can dislike this movie as it's directed in such a magnificent way that there are times you wish every movie could have the same impact even if strange enough director Jim Sheridan never really would make it in the director-scene. This is the story about the Guildford Four, the story of four people who happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Once again London is haunted by an IRA-bomb and as the justice don't want to be blamed another time they must find some ""guilty"" and so it happens that some Irish outsiders are in the area of an exploded pub. The whole family of Conlon (even his father who must be so honest it reaches the laughable) are sent to prison at where they are absolutely hated and getting the hardest regime a prisoner can get. In the meantime the real terrorists are caught but the British government is too proud to convince that they made a mistake and little by little we see people torn apart as they are condemned for something they never did... Let's thank God this was a British production as never Sheridan chooses for Oscar-sentiment, it never goes over the top and it's just given as documentaryinformation, but mind you, the truth itself is shocking enough. Once again splendid performances from Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlewaite who plays the role of the father. Superb movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Would have Preferred Another Anthem But...,"Gerry Conlon, small-time Irish crook and some of his friends are picked up by the British government on slim leads and forced to take the fall for a politically-motivated bombing on a bar.According to the movie, they didn't do it and the police were just corrupt.Although this is based on a true story, I don't know anything about it and there seems to be things simplified. The movie makes everything look very black and white - Gerry is completely and utterly unrelated to the Irish Independence movement and the government is just completely, utterly, unredeemably, and cartoonishly corrupt.It's an important story to be told. Who knows how often the corrupt institution of law enforcement, which treats everyone it picks up as guilty scum, makes patsies out of innocent people for points in whatever sick internal merit system they have.The fact that it's based on a true story makes it more impressive than something like An Innocent Man (1989), which dealt with the topic of police overzealousness in a more dramatic and cleaner way, but sadly the delivery is not as effective. Gerry is not very likeable, coming off as a snotty ingrateful crook who doesn't really try very hard to get out of his situation (he doesn't want to work with the lawyer and it's never shown or explained why - the lawyer at his initial trial did seem to advocate well for him). He's sort of a ""well, if he wasn't in jail for that, he would have been in jail for something else"" type. Yet he's shown to lack a bit of spine when the real IRA member, Joe comes into the prison and he ill-judges him for his heavy-handed tactics. Joe is really the best character in the movie, by the way - a tough freedom fighter who would do anything for the cause and for his human rights.The other main plot of the movie other than the absolution of those wrongfully convicted is the father-son relationship between Gerry and his father Giuseppe. We get the feeling that it's supposed to be a tear-jerker, but there's not much substance there either. Gerry dislikes and disrespects his father for really no good reason. They sort of come to stand each other in prison but there's never a huge reunion or anything. The father's character itself is not fleshed out - he's a man with classical ethics - innocents shouldn't die, the law should be followed, people should work ""decent"" jobs and help develop their communities that way. Yet it's never explained why, never linked to any bigger themes, and it never really rubs off on Gerry or anything.6 because it was fairly well-acted and told an important story. The actual plot is patchy and seems to be a heavily dramatised and simplified retelling of a true story with lots of stuff left out or not explained properly.Honourable Mentions:1 - True Prison Stories: If they really want to do a movie about a guy who spent decades in prison for nothing, they should do a movie about Mandela's time in prison. He spent over 10 years in prison just for trying to get dignity for his people. I think they did make a movie about his life but it was very broad and not much a prison movie.2 - Father-Son Relationship: The Aquariums of Pyeongyang (a book) is a touching story about a father and son's relationship as the son grows up in a North Korean labour camp. I remember it being much more effective than this one. Haven't made a movie about it, but someone certainly should.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A true miscarriage of justice,"In the name of the father is an excellent film. It tells the true story of Gerry and Guiseppe Conlon who where jailed as members of the so called ""Guilford Four"" who allegedly where guilty of bombing packed public houses back in the 70's.Britain in the mid 70's was falling victim to many such bombings orchestrated by the Provisional IRA and the English Police where desperate for a result.Then along come Gerry Conlon and his friend Paul Hill, two Irish teenagers who have left Belfast for London after being banished by the local IRA for theiving. The IRA, especially in Belfast, look down upon criminal behaviour in their neighbourhoods as it brings unwanted police attention. These guys where chancers and thieves, NOT terrorists.The Police arrest them, again in the act of burgalry and charge them with the said act of terrorism even though they have a concrete aliby for their location at the time of the bombing. They are beaten and threatened until they sign blank confessions.Gerry's father, Guiseppe, made his way to London to help his son. On his arrival he is arrested by the Police as the Terrorist mastermind behind the bombings. His poor relatives, who lived in London who he was staying with, where all arrested as the police established the small house as a ""bomb factory"".The Police manufactured the charges and then got greedy. The family in the so called ""bomb factory"" ALL went to prison for 12 years, even the children went into young offenders prisons as terrorists. Gerry, Guiseppe, Paul Hill and a young girl they had met on the day in question, all went to prison as Terrorists for 30 years terms.About 15 years later, Guiseppe became terminally ill and the Conlon's where given permission to secure a lawyer (the first REAL legal representation they received under anti-terrorism laws). Gerry and Guiseppe convince her (played brilliantly by Emma Thompson) of their innocence.Then, as if by a miracle, she is issued a warrant to see the files on Guiseppe's case in order to appeal for his release for ill health. The warrant reads - G. Conlon. The clerk at the records office asks if she wishes to see Gerry's or Guiseppe's file. Seizing her chance she takes Gerry's file.In this file, she finds a statement confirming Gerry's aliby with a hand written note attached signed by the Police officer in charge of the case stating that this document was ""Not to be shown to the defence"".The case went back to court and all parties where freed because the case was thrown out in MINUTES. The Police officer who framed all involved retired from the service on health grounds and was never brought to justice.This film damns the British Justice system in a way seldom seen before on film. It does not in any way glamourise the IRA or is it ""out to get"" the British Government or the Crown Prosecution Service. It simply tells the story of people who where in the wrong place at the wrong time. These people had their lives destroyed just so the police could say that they had caught the Guilford bombers - who where never found.Serious stuff!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The UK... another fake democracy,"A Masterpiece, a realistic view of the British Violence and Regime.Emma Thompson is a superb actress, the soundtrack is huge and the movie is realistic and breathtaking.I just saw ""Sacco and Vanzetti"" and ""Born on the 4th July"". I then thought the US are the worst ""democracy"" on Earth. After this film I can say the UK is just the same, spoiled and dirty. Who started the Iraq war? USA and UK, of course. Bliar and Bush must have a feeling...A real teaching on the, so called ""British Empire"" and the ""Queen"", such a funny joke, filling up the UK tabloids with her family affairs. And the courts... looking more like the '700 (don't they look ridiculous with their blond wig) than a modern democracy.I am not saying this, the movie says ""Fucking Government"" (quoted) and they are right. 15 years of Jail and not a pound back, the poor father died and never proclaimed innocent, the corrupt police, using methods, not even imagined in the worst African dictatorships, not condemned for a week of prison.The film gives you an idea of how UK was and is today... a mass of ignorant people voting for the best looking candidate.As an European, I really would be happy if the UK went out, as this country has nothing to share with the real Swedish, Finnish, French, Italian and German democracies today.Just a slave of Bush, just an exploiter of its colonies, conquered with blood, with people slowly working 7 hours a day.What a beautiful country...

An antidote for those naive about the English and U.S. criminal justice systems,In the Name of the Father (1993)IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER is a college education for those innocents who still don't know the police make mistakes (and on a regular basis). There are good cops but also bad ones who either don't care if they arrest the wrong people or who intentionally do. There are bad judges and juries and prosecutors who want more notches in their legal belts more than they want justice.Both the US and England have seriously flawed criminal justice systems. It is hard for me to believe I ever believed otherwise. Good cops and good lawyers and decent judges need to challenge ones who are not. They need to speak out and dare to tell the truth about the corruption in the system instead of cowardly hiding their heads in the sand.From personal experience I know of a tragic wrongful conviction and have heard of others through my work and education.This film along with others such as Hurricane Hunters are wake-up calls to citizens who want some semblance of honesty in the judicial process. The US is in the grip of the best corruption money can buy from the top down so it's hard to be hopeful.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An addictive story with breath taking performances make for a quality film,"In the name of the father is the story of Gerry and Giuseppe Conlon, a father and son who along with nine other innocents, were wrongly accused and convicted in relation to the Guildford Bombings in 1974. Gerry Conlon became apart of a group that were known world wide as the Guildford Four and Giuseppe became apart of a group that were lesser known as the Maguire Seven. In the Name of the Father is set during the time that relations between England and Ireland were most strained.The film begins in 1974 Belfast and it immediately establishes Gerry's character as a tearaway. He is a tearaway for many reasons too many to list in this comment but it is evident that one of the reasons that he refuses to lie down and become like his father. His father Giuseppe is a likable man. A loving father whose hard work to provide for his family during a time where Catholics had no rights results in him developing severe asthma. When Gerry is blamed with his friends Paul Hill, Paddy Armstrong and Carol Richards for the Guildford Pub bombing, Giuseppe drops everything and goes to London to help his son. When staying with his relations the Maguire's he is also picked up and charged with them for being involved in Terrorist activity. They are found guilty and sentenced. Gerry receives life and Giuseppe get 14 years. While in prison the turbulent relationship between Gerry and his father worsens to the point where they are not speaking. Despite their natural stormy relation ship this situation is worsened by the arrival of Joe McAndrew who is the real Guildford Bomber. In McAndrews, Gerry sees the man who his father should be. A man that is a fighter and who does not take things lying down as opposed to quiet conservative Giuseppe who has turned his cheek all his life and has been repaid in bad health for it. But as time goes by and maturity sets in, Gerry revises his opinion on Giuseppe and discovers that he always will have a friend in his father. The final chapter sees Gerry discarding his troublesome persona in favor of one that is similar to his fathers and together begin to fight to clear their names.This film was Jim Sheridan's first in relation to the situation that had engulfed Northern Ireland and to be honest it is his best so far. Sheridan once again uses an addictive storyline (father and son in miscarriage of justice) to further investigate the theme of father/son relations. Despite it's political setting and use of ethnic sides to tell the story what Sheridan wants us to asses is the relationship between Gerry Conlon and his father and how Gerry's resistance to become like his father leads to his downfall but it is through the worst part of his life that he gets to know his father properly. Through the claustrophobic atmosphere of their prison cell Gerry realizes that he has more in common with his father and despite past arguments Giuseppe becomes not only his father again but his best friend.Day-Lewis is on form yet again with his performance and I have yet to see him in a film where he does not give a solid performance. This time he has the very strong support from Postlewaithe as his father Giuseppe. Postlewaithe is superb as the ill Giuseppe who never gives up hope. Emma Thompson is someone I have been very keen on. But in this film she delivers a spectacular performance and like Posthlewaithe it is worthy of the Oscar nomination they received and in both cases they should have won. Sheridan must also be praised for his script and direction of this film. He took a story that at the time was still sore on the minds of both the Irish and British people. It was also a time where the situation in Northern Ireland looked as if it would never stop and the films release could further the cause of fighting for both paramilitary sides. It did however make the world sit up and pay attention because every country has had at some time a severe miscarriage of justice.If you want facts about the cases of the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven I suggest you don't watch this film. At the time of it's release it was heavily accused of not painting an accurate description of the case but the reality is that if you want details the film would not run at just over two hours but it would run for 15 years. I suggest you ask your local television stations to commission a Docu-Drama. This story is about the Conlon's. If I had faults with it I would say that my biggest hate of this film is the republican bomber Joe McAndrews. It is a very wooden performance that is down to bad acting and nothing else. He is too open about the whole affair which leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. If all Republican terrorists talked and acted like this the troubles of Northern Ireland would have lasted 10 minutes. There is a saying in Ireland that those who talk about it, no the least about it. On a whole it is very unbelievable. But despite this the film is very good, hard going to watch and very hard to walk away from without having some emotions evoked inside you. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Almost great,"I was riveted by this film, until the meeting between Gerry and the Attorney (I don't remember her name) and the scene with the blow-torching of the prison guard.All of a sudden, the oppression of the Irish people is somehow made to be their own fault. In the meeting with the attorney, Gerry has ""an attitude"", and it is all his fault for not having ""faith in himself"". What on earth does this mean, in his situation?? Why must our culture always demonize people for fighting back and standing up for themselves?The performances were top-class by all players. But the caricature and demonization of the IRA man was this film's U-Turn into sentimental mediocrity, and an offense against the people who continue to suffer what it portrays.",,Anonymous,Biography
Quite enjoyed the movie but it needs a foward,"(1993) In The Name of the Father
DRAMAAdapted from the autobiographical book ""Proved Innocent"" by Gerry Conlon, produced, written and directed by Jim Sheridan. Based on a true incident whereas in 1974, an unfortunate London bombing happened at a pub permitted by Thatcher to arrest and detain people at random for 7 days (which is all the police needed to break someone down to get them to sign an untrue confession), suspected in connection in terrorists act! A movie that is longer than 2 hours, watching this film is more like seeing two separate films- where the main characters are interacting with each other while in the city, up until the second story is how the Danial Day Lewis character as he plays Gerry Conlon react through his experiences during his times in prison. Although, the cast is top notch which includes 2 time Oscar winner Danial Day-Lewis, Oscar winner Emma Thompson and the remarkable actor of the late Pete Postlethwaite, the film could've used some editing! Also, because viewers should be able to figure out about the satisfying conclusion of this true story, it'd be nice to see that those people who were wrongly convicted be properly compensated financially like some do in America.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
a fantastic film ultimately depicting why the death penalty is wrong,"This film is not backwards in coming forwards politically, and quite rightly so.

As a young man I remember well the tabloid publicity and rantings against the defendants - one lone journalist and belief in themselves as innocents led to justice for these poor people. NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN, FREE THE INNOCENT!As for the film - superb performances, Pete Postlethwaite is brilliant, and this is Daniel Day-Lewis' best role ever. Just brilliant.

Doesn't age well but decent story...,"Let's face it, most of us find it incredibly scary to think someone could go to prison for a crime they did not commit. The story is as old as we've been jailing people. The problem I have here is just that it hasn't aged well. This is about the level you expect to see on lifetime tv movies. It just doesn't translate well 20 years later but that's ok. While Day-Lewis' performance was one of the better in the movie, I didn't find him stand out in any way.As for the story, it's true, being a homeless, drug doing, mugging vagrant doesn't implicate you in a bombing. I'm not sure society realizes these types of behaviors will easily get you to the top of the list of suspects and given enough chance and luck you could also be implicated in a crime you didn't commit.

Chaotic and frenzied,"Daniel Day Lewis earned his second Academy Award nomination for his role in this film,which I feel is the closest the English-Irish Lewis ever came to playing himself. But that's just personal speculation. What is fact,however,is the importance of a good score. And except for iconic pieces like Star Wars or Jaws one never comprehends the importance of a good score until you've heard a bad one. Originally Chinatown had a different(and inferior) composer and after watching the film Robert Towne told Roman Polanski how his movie was being ruined by the score. Eventually Towne convinced him to change it and Jerry Goldsmith was hired to redo the music. Goldsmith's haunting score is so much of Chinatown's atmosphere and its contribution can hardly be overstated.
In The Name Of The Father could definetly have benefited from a different score too. But I will add that the music isn't the sole reason behind the film's chaotic and frenzied tone.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Excellent character study of a man wrongfully imprisoned and further forced to balance finding justice with finding solace with his father.,"In the Name of the Father is an epic tale of hope and mistaken identity, a towering achievement of sorts focusing on everyday and very likable central characters as they are put through an awful emotional grinder based on true events from the 1970s and 80s. The film is spoilt only very slightly by a quite woeful theme song from Irish band U2 and the fact director Jim Sheridan cannot much direct action, forcing the very early few scenes to come across as awkward and misjudged. The rest, however, is a dedicated study of a dedicated man forced into becoming a hate figure; a fall guy of sorts, as the British government struggle to come up with answers regarding the ongoing struggles in the conflict with the Irish Republican Army.The film is a tale of fighting for justice, a tale of independence and the duty one must go through in order to attain that independence. The road is long and the times get desperate; the characters face long stretches of prison time for things they did not do – years were incorrectly taken off their lives and the result of it all is condensed down into a two and a bit hour film that you can most certainly go out of your way to see. What is two hours of your time compared to thirty odd years of someone else's, after all?The film is essentially told in a flashback perspective, a story that is distilled through lawyer Gareth Peirce's (Thompson) imagination as she envisages the lead character doing what he does as he narrates to her exactly what went down through a cassette recording. But we are there as well, we are back in the 1970s and 80s with the lead character as they lead a relatively upbeat and happy-go-lucky life initially before the tragedy strikes. The lead is Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis), a young Northern Irishman from Belfast who is living a life surrounded by IRA-led activity in the 1970s without ever directly being involved, but he is the sort of guy who gets caught in the cross-fire; a sort of 'wrong place, wrong time' scenario-led life that will catch up with him in horrific ways later on. When we first see Gerry, the likable rouge attitude and relatively odd choice of song by way of Jimi Hendrix sees him get chased by British troops that mistake him for an IRA sniper – the scene has a fair amount of 'fun' to it; something that is brought back down to Earth later on.There is a sad irony and that is that it is proposed Gerry should move away from Northern Ireland following these scenes in order to get away from the troubles. Gerry agrees and takes a boat over to England with a friend named Paul Hill (Lynch), before briefly settling down in London. Initially, the film plays on Gerry being a bit of a misfit in this new setting; he mixes mostly with casual drug takers, hippies and devout, air headed female vegetarians. This unconnected and grounded realism driven segment in the film is impressive and mysterious. Having no knowledge of who these people are and what eventually happens to them will have you see the film as this wandering and series of supposedly random events in a specific time setting as Gerry wanders the streets; talks to tramps, thieves from the homes of those that accidentally drop their keys right outside the front door and looks for short stay accommodation here and there.But what follows is a change in gear and a change in study, indeed a change that encompasses desperation; mistaken identity; the hunt for redemption and the forcing of confronting issues regarding the relationship with one's father. A bomb is detonated within the vicinity of Gerry's general area one night and he is singled out by the police for his Irish roots and the fact he has only very recently arrived in England. He is jailed, with his father, as a part of the 'Maguire Seven', before desperately trying to claim justice. As a lead character, Gerry later embodies all the innocent and necessary traits for a victim just trying to survive. The film's point of attack takes special care in painting a wavy image for Gerry, one that sees him rob apartments of money, joke about with his mates and come across as quite antagonistic at times.Gerry and his father's, named Giuseppe (Postlethwaite), coming together in prison provide some of the more fascinating scenes in the film; a forced period of bonding during which they humblingly make peace and mend the past problems that they shared from years gone by. There is enough in the film to get caught up in, a sense of tragedy and mis-justice; a sense of pain and desperation. As far as prison set dramas go, this is one of the more impressive I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is how it was,"Having lived through this whole period as an Irishman in Britain I could smell the authenticity of the film, from the drug-addled squats of the early 1970s to the joy experienced by so many Irish people when the Guildford 4, the Birmingham 6 and all the other Irish people who were framed were finally released because the lies were no longer plausible enough.The acting is superb beyond belief and some of the scenes are so harrowing that they aren't easy watching, particularly if you have, like me, shared a milieu with people like Gerry Conlon. You get the feeling:""It could so easily have been me, since they were just looking for some Irish people to set up.""Despite criticisms that the screenwriters rejigged parts of the story to make them more dramatic (and to edit a few details that might have distracted attention from the main story - after all, real life is messier than the movies) I don't remember similar criticisms when history was rewritten to make it more dramatic in films like Zulu, Rorkes's Drift, Young Winston or Lawrence of Arabia, which tend to fit better into the British imperial self-image.A highly political film, but still highly effective on a personal level.

I rate this film 10 out of 10, for reasons I go on to explain:`In the Name of the Father' is an account of the true saga of an Irish man, Gerry Conlon, who is wrongfully imprisoned for life. He and his family are made scapegoats by the police and legal system for the bombing of the Guildford Pub of London in 1974. The film goes on to show the bitter trial of Conlon, his father and 3 of his companions accused in the case, and Conlon's spirit as he faces the brutality of unfair imprisonment, and his inimitable spirit as he attempts to reopen the case after 15 years with the aid of a lawyer, Gareth Pierce.One thing I absolutely love about the film is the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite. By virtue of being inspired from a true story, the film has a very strong theme and story line. The evolution of the relationship between Gerry and his Dad, Giuseppe has been shown beautifully. The evolution of Gerry from a quick tempered, riotous fellow to a person who has mellowed down and whom time in prison has transformed into a patient man, has also been depicted rather well. The fact that the guy wrongfully accused of a terrorist bombing is not a Godly and perfect sort of guy, but instead a riotous guy given to petty thieving, prevents the film from becoming didactic and overly dramatic. But I guess this is because the director and writer have been true to the real life story of Gerry Conlon.I have no hesitation in stating that `In the Name of the Father' is one of the best films I have seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic film that grabs you immediately and never lets go.,"Jim Sheridan's IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER tells the story about the Guildford Four, framed Irish people that were sentenced for life for being IRA terrorists bombing a pub in 1974. Gerry Conlon, accused for being the leader, an innocent, angry young man becomes roommates with his own dad (who got sentenced as an accomplice), and a heartsick relationship evolves behind the bars. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry, and Pete Postlethwaite his father Giuseppe Conlon, and both do extraordinary performances in capturing the relation between the two; the no-good petty thief Gerry sees everything he's demonstrating against in his father, a straightforward and careful elderly man who Gerry insists needs to start fighting back for all the unrighteousness in the world. The film is just as much about this father & son relationship as it is about the political war fought in Ireland, and it mixes those two ingredients masterfully and it makes for an engaging, provocative, tender and emotional experience in which we understand the many difficulties that faced the wrongfully accused convicts. The absolutely blistering Day-Lewis should have anchored the Best Actor statue for this, in which is possibly Sheridan's finest film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Man's coerced confession to an IRA bombing he didn't do imprisons his father as well; a British lawyer helps fight for their freedom.,"Jim Sheridan is an acclaimed film director and a good storyteller. Jim was born in Dublin, in 1949, and later moved to America in 1982. He directed the movie ""In The name of the father"" which was a hit all around the world.With an actor like Daniel Day-Lewis, how could this movie go wrong? The movie is based on a true-story that took place in Ireland. Daniel plays a character named Gerry Conlon, who is a small time thief from Belfast (England). Gerry is falsely implicated in the IRA bombing of a pub that kills several people while he is in London. The British police 'force' Gerry and the four of his friends to confessing their guilt about the bombing. Gerry's father decides to help his son, but ends up in prison as well. He ends up spending 15 years in prison with his father trying to prove his innocence with the help of a female British attorney.The genre is biography and drama. I really liked the movie because it had a lot of talented actors and actresses that had good chemistry. Even thought the movie was depressing, thanks to the acting from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite, they managed to draw at least a few chuckles in some sequences. The editing was well done, and matched perfectly. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie. It has a great cast, good story, good amount of effects (lighting/cutting/editing etc.) I'll give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"In the name of the father, in the name of the son","""In the name of the father"" directed by Jim Sheridan, not only takes you through a poignant journey of awareness in its political and social context, but also tells a story of an alienated father and son that only reach an understanding through their shared circumstance in a prison cell.After mass speculation, angry protests and the passing of the terrorism act on the wake of the Guildford bombing(October 5, 1974), Gerry Conlon(Daniel Day-Louis) and his friends Paul Hill(John Lynch), Paddy Armstrong(Mark Sheppard) and Carole Richardson(Beatie Edney), become the lead suspects following an inquiry by the British police into their whereabouts.None of the Guildford four fitted ""the bill"" in terms of being associated with the IRA because of their lifestyle. They were merely in the wrong place at the wrong time. Gerry Conlon was a petty thief from Derry, Northern Ireland and Patrick Armstrong and Carole Richardson lived in a squat and also had involvement with drugs and petty crime. There were many inconsistencies in the case against them, However with the enormous pressure on the police and the state by the public, they were tortured and threatened into signing confessions and later sentenced to life imprisonment on murder charges, along with Gerry's father Guiseppe Conlon(Pete Postelwaithe).Although it is emotional enough to be privy to the truth towards the innocence of these eight Northern Irish people, who are victims to perhaps one of the most profound miscarriages of Justice in the history of England or the world, we see the eventual bonding of a father and son who were once coldly distanced. After years in a Jail cell they reach a sought of understanding that allows them to communicate on a more intimate level.One of the most strong manifestations of this, is when Gerry is shown to be looking after Guiseppe instead of the reverse, before his death. When Guiseppe dies, the scene showing the fire tears dropping down from the prison windows is one of the most harrowing of the film. This Juxtaposed against the tears that are running down Gerry's face and the reflection of it in his eyes, is testament to the directing genius of Jim Sheridan to create a symbolic portrayal of his grief. In the name of the father visually enhances what the true story presents, through its imagery and dramatization.Another scene that is worth noting, is also in the opening. It is an adrenalin rush as we are confronted with the singular image of the pub exploding, which is then accompanied by the exhilarating dischorded sound of U2's Bono and Gavin Friday conveniently titled, ""In the name of the father"". The soundtrack though-out the movie is guaranteed to send shivers down your spine, as all scenes are imbued with nothing but the most appropriate music to accompany the deftly created ambiance. Whether it is the chilling, eerie sounds that scream horror in the confessions room, or the 70's Hippie rock n' roll in the opening scene at Derry in Northern Ireland at the start of the riot, the music is an excellent form of augmentation to the mood.Daniel Day-Louise and Pete Postelwaithe do an excellent job of carrying out their roles as divided father and son on bad terms. In all Gerry's delinquent, childish swagger, Daniel Day-Louise is able to reach beyond this to show his honest, emotional side rendering him a more sympathetic character. Similarly, Postelwaithe does an excellent job of conveying a paragon of what is honest and decent as well as a father who is extremely critical but caring of his son at the same time.""In the name of the father"" reaches beyond the politically electric content of the true story, to the human issues behind it. We see the experiences of Gerry and Guiseppe Conlon in the face of extreme adversity and injustice. It is another influential tribute to the human spirit and another piece of evidence that truth tends to be the first casualty in such situations like the one the Guildford four found themselves in. But farther than even this, we share the moving experience of seeing a father and son come together amidst the torrent that was enveloping them, finding peace, courage and motivation in each other.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Themes of ""Terrorism"" and ""draconian laws"" resound loudly still","This offering of a movie is very much an Irish/English story: the not-very-well known story(At least here in the States) of Gerry Conlon and the Guilford Four is mostly a tale of how a stupid,impetuous petty thief,Mr.Conlon(played with unrelenting energy from DAniel Day_lewis)is railroaded,along with his friends,his father(played with great dignity by Pete Postelthwaite) and about five others,into confessing complicity in a London pub bombing in the early-to-mid seventies. The focus is almost entirely on Gerry,as he at first accepts his fate as a criminal,languishing in a very hostile English prison, only to be slowly won over to fight for his innocence by his very upright father,who never gives up hope in winning an appeal of their conviction. Emma Thompson's part as the ""Four""'s lawyer is not minor,but she really only comes into play more than halfway though the film.Still,she's as impassioned and stirring as ever.I use the title line of my review to say that even though the film's subject is very universal,it's themes are EERILY applicable to our war on terror in the USA. I feel like there's more than a little of this ""at all costs"" approach to finding terror suspects.Politics aside,this was quite a strong movie,co-written by Terry George(""Hotel Rwanda"",another very strong film!) and directed by Jim Sheridan(""My Left Foot""). I feel like,while this film may have special appeal to Irish Catholics anywhere(which I'm not quite one meself),I think it will work for the Irish(or non)in anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Review - In the Name of the Father,"There is not too much to say on this movie, the acting performances were good, overall the movie is really great, but when I put a 7, I usually found a flaws. In this case, the flaws is not that you know how it ends, yes it is base on an historical fact so you can check on internet to know the entire story, but in my case, I was able to predict it only because this is how ""redemption movies"" end.

"Intriguing, based on a true story","Some of you might comment, ""Who are the actors anyway?""  Well, to tell you the truth, I only knew Emma Thompson while  watching  this movie. And unfortunately, I only saw it  during second half of  the movie. But, how it touched me deeply. I was moved, I was crying by the time this movie ended. How could anyone be so cruel, to punish innocent people and they were jailed for more than 10 years? The evidence was so flimsy based!This is  based on a true story which make it more intriguing. The UK judicial system shook to  its core when the revelations about this innocent people come to the surface. The impact of the movie was also deepened  when the hero's father died because  of illness while serving his imprisonment(that's why I think they name this movie 'In the name of the Father').  Go watch this movie and you won't be disappointed. All the characters in here deserves Oscar nominations!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent campaigning film,"A real life look at the injustice meted out to the Guildford 4. It is superbly acted and shot and Daniel Day-Lewis is immense in the part of Gerard Conlon (one of the imprisoned).Pete Postlethwaite is my favorite actor in this film, he gives a measured assured performance as Giuseppe Conlon, the father of Gerard.The final score by Sinead O'Connor is haunting and moving.Excellent stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Realistic portraits,"Another user wrote this ""Too black and white because I sometimes had the feeling that they had left out some parts to make it all a lot easier for the viewer. I can't help believing that Conlon and Hill weren't the nicest guys either,"" I just have to comment this, because I just saw this movie again and I don't agree with this. Rather I found , and this is a good thing, the unusual fact that the main characters was NOT saints and NOT ""good guys"". Daniel Lewis small-town-criminal-loser guy is annoying, immature and not very nice. He is not very smart, he is steeling, starts a riot and think it fun, he steels a lot of money from a prostitute.. Not even the hippies like him and his friend, because these Irish criminal guys are a bit to rough. Also , in prison, Levis is arguing like a teenager with his father, most for the sake that his father is ""too weak"". Also, the main character do drugs. All together I find the characters realistic instead of ""saints"". Sure, after some years the main character starts to mature bit for bit, but this is described in a subtle way.This is also what I like with this movie - it is not so polished, the main characters is no saints, actually they are annoying criminals - but this also makes us understand why they was perfect as easy targets to blame for something they wasn't guilty for.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Shawshank Redemption failed !,"This film is similar to Shawshank Redemption esp in the case of Emotional angle. But it failed in that line so watch Shawshank instead. ITNF is fast paced but fails to give the grip of such tragedies in the name of Securities. Daniel Day Lewis is bad, very dissatisfied with the performance. The script and other casts are good. Postlethwaite is good too as the caring father who stood for defending his own son. So in average it deserves a rating ie 6/10.From the global perspective it remained undeveloped and also unappealing in some parts. It is an emotional episode where many youths were suspected of IRA bombing and were jailed. People of Ireland feels deeply about it and should be felt also. I have nothing against the Irish people but as movie on such an emotional issue it could have been better. Maybe in the case of technicals or in lead actors.

Rousing Film About the Triumph of Justice,"Following closely on the heels of another movie about the IRA, 1992's ""The Crying Game,"" came Jim Sheridan's effective and rousing ""In the Name of the Father,"" the true story of a group of men wrongly accused of participating in a series of IRA bombings.This film is fun to watch for its period detail and for the predictably excellent performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. But Emma Thompson, playing the attorney of Day-Lewis and his father (Pete Postlethwaite), though given a much smaller role, really brings some fire to the proceedings through her energetic performance. Thompson had just been discovered by American audiences in ""Howards End"" the year before, and was also winning acclaim in ""The Remains of the Day"" even as she was making her appearance in this one, and it was refreshing to see her in a more contemporary role.Though nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Day-Lewis), Best Supporting Actor (Postlethwaite), Best Supporting Actress (Thompson) and Best Director, the film was shut out.I'm not a huge fan of Jim Sheridan's movies in general, but I liked this one.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb Acting and an Outstanding Story,"What is so sad is that while some of the true events were played with, for the most part, this sad episode in British history actually took place. The issue of Northern Ireland has spawned numerous portrayals, some of them outstanding movies. This is about a man who is a bit of a buffoon and a free spirit who acts foolishly (unfortunately, he is unaware that his stupidity would be viewed as it it), and gets into big trouble. Not just going to prison himself but dragging in his entire family. New laws allowed a group of overzealous police to take the rights of a ""free"" people into their own hands. It's a bit like the Homeland Security act today. It was easy to torture, frighten, and taunt people into giving up everything. This included threatening to kill a good friend or even your father. This is a black eye. I never felt the IRA had a right to do what they did, but one can see how their hatred was hatched. Add to this the incredible performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and his cohorts and you have a superb film. See this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
It is shocking new evidence.,"With seven Oscar nominations, this film had the unfortunate luck to be competing in a remarkable year for films and won not a single one.It is a shame because director Jim Sheridan gave us a film that transcends the subject matter and was a delight to watch. The performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Emma Thompson, and Pete Postlethwaite were simply incredible, and I even got a minute or two of Saffron Burrows as a London hippie.What makes this film so much more that a slam at British injustice in the face of terror, is that it is also a portrait of American injustice against Blacks. In the haste to get convictions and convince the public that they are competent, both systems use the same techniques.What is also common to both systems is the fact that after gross injustice is discovered, the prosecutors and police escape unharmed; while the lives of their victims are ruined forever.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An honourable piece of cinema,"Being an account of a true story, this movie has to be assessed both as a film in it's own right and as a historical documentation which reflects the reality of the events.On the first count, it is excellent: Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis sympathetically portray the wrongfully imprisoned father and son and wonderfully develop their relationship from warring factions to reconciliation with love and respect for each other.  The film is clear in it's position and focuses on this angle, keeping many of the judicial complications to a minimum and works well because of it.  Demonstrating the closeness that can be between people achieved against tremendous adversity and condemnation.As a direct result of this, the film suffers from the factual angle, mainly because Gerald and Giuseppe were never actually imprisoned together. However, other than this, the story seemed to stay fairly close to the main historical facts surrounding the Guildford 4 trial and should be commended for trying to inform about this tragic happening, rather than glorify it in order to attract viewers.All in all, Jim Sheridan and everyone who worked on this film should feel proud of what they have created, a film which informs and entertains both as a factual account of events and as a tale of tolerance and acceptance both socially and within the family unit.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Terrorism and the Prosecution of the Innocent,"""In the Name of the Father,"" seen today, is a useful reminder of how a great democracy can besmirch its own ideals in order to identify, torture and prosecute suspects in a terrorist incident even if they are completely innocent. Gerry Conlon of Belfast just happens to be in London with friends when a bomb explodes in a pub, killing innocent Britons. Although Conlon is innocent and the police have found a witness who corroborated his story, he is convicted of murder and sent to prison along with his friends and members of his family, considered accessories. Gerry and his father Giuseppe, an Irishman with an Italian first name, portrayed by Pete Postlethwaite, end up in prison together, and much of the film revolves around father-son conflict and eventual reconciliation prior to the father's death, hastened by abusive prison treatment. Eventually, a British lawyer (Emma Thompson) takes up their case and, by luck, discovers a file ""not to be shown to the defense"" which confirms that police found Conlon's witness and had his statement confirming Conlon's alibi. The prisoners are ordered released after 15 years while the police who gave false evidence against them are acquitted. The terrorism committed by the Irish Republican Army was deadly. Mistreatment of suspects by investigators was routine. And violation of the Rule of Law was forgiven by British juries. Unbelievable? Unfortunately not.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Here we have a brilliant film: great acting (Daniel Day-Lewis at his best, but Pete Postlethwaite matching him every step) and Jim Sheridan's directing, and a great script.

I know that anything anti-English (eg Braveheart) does very well in popularity, but this is just as good, if not better.

The English shown up for racists in a film for a change,"Finally, something with Daniel Day-Lewis I didn't hate. As you look at the face of this man, convicted for a crime he didn't commit, you appreciate the qualities that have made him an Oscar-dominating actor.The Guildford pub bombing is a story eerily close to my home, but this isn't what I reacted to: more, the complete lack of morality and humanity of a legal system hell-bent on ruining the lives of a few people, just because of their nationality.Pete Postlethwaite is the standout: an actor I had only seen once (a brief but impactful showing in ""Inception""), he steals the show, playing the compassionate but conflicted father to Day-Lewis' roguish protagonist, an equally compelling character.The rest of the cast is decent, but sometimes stray into slight incredulity - this films is no doubt guilty for occasionally trying too hard for a laugh. Really, given a plot as sombre as this, I would expect slightly more gravitas to be afforded. The settings are unique: the courtroom is compelling (cramped but swelling with vibrancy), and the prison and Ireland both set a great scene. All are bright and give a bit of life, particularly in a genre that would so readily devolve to dark and pessimistic settings.Story-wise, the delicate balance of the IRA and a nervy England is palpable, expressed through the anxieties of the police and the public. This creates a consistent drama that explains the story's direction, but also makes the xenophobia even more disgusting.""In the Name of the Father"" is bleak. It paints England in a harsh, unforgiving light, such is the injustice it seeks to pile on Ireland, solely on the reputation of a violent few.This tension, probably representing the national sentiment of the time, is delivered effectively and continuously, in a film that is a slow but effective judicial burner.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
so much for civilized England,"We Americans often like to think of England as the most civilized place on Earth. ""In the Name of the Father"" shows that this is unfortunately not true. It's the true story of Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis), a rowdy Northern Irishman who got imprisoned by the British government for a crime that he didn't commit. Specifically, they tortured him to the point that he signed a confession. So, he was sent to jail with some other Northern Irish people - including his father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) - and forced to experience fifteen years of brutality from every angle.This is one of those movies that cuts right to the heart of a touchy issue. Regardless of which opinion you take of the situation in Northern Ireland, this is a movie that everyone should see, just to understand the cruel lengths to which governments can go when they think that they're right. I've heard Daniel Day-Lewis described as the world's most devoted actor; ""In the Name of the Father"" certainly backs that up, and I would definitely say that this is Jim Sheridan's best movie ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

WHAT A FILM !! A Staggering reality of Quick Injustice and Late Justice.,"In The Name Of The Father (1993) :WHAT A FILM !! A Staggering reality of Quick Injustice and Late Justice. In The Name Of The Father should be placed among the Most Gutsy films ever for so many reasons but one solid and unshakeable reason is that, it dealt with the Cruel politics of Legal System and Exposed the Government. I would have loved it even if had been a fictional story but believing that is actually happened is still scorching my nerves. Of course this might just be the half truth and it's still very shocking, the full cruelty mustn't have been exposed because of fear (i believe so). You can read the synopsis anywhere on internet if you wish to so i am not gonna talk about the script. Rather, I would like to tell my views how it is crafted. This staggering reality would have been shocking anyways but this film comes out better than what expected because of its incredible storytelling flow. From the beginning till the end every event is so accurately driven by the Director, every next thing follow up the previous one in tight linear equations and then we have a climax which will force you to shout out and scream out your anger. I actually screamed in the Climax scene and my Mobile fell down. Daniel Day Lewis what a Great Actor you are. I don't really have words to say. What a Top Class actor he is. A Legend. Philip King scores equally but of course 2nd best and Emma Thompson 3rd naturally. Dear Jim Sheridan where are you i want to salute you. Ok, wherever you are just accept my Salute.

Oscar for Best Duo Daniel Day-Lenwis and Pete Postlethwaite,"The movie tries to convey the horrors of injustice, investigation, and rulings under the pretext of emergency laws and terrorism, but the details of these laws make us laugh by today's standards, even not when the film was shown in 1993. The film exposes us to the shock that the terrorism law at this time could have exposed any innocent person for 7 days without charge, and I believe that it is still present in many countless countries on the globe.The film talks about the true story of the Quartet of Guildford and the Seven of Maguire, a very painful human rights story whose chapters begin with the arrest of the Irish young man Gerry Conlon in England and accusing him, along with three others, of carrying out a terrorist attack to bomb a bar in Guildford.Although Jerry is reckless and has criminal tendencies already, but through the events of the film we realize that Jerry and those with him are innocent, but the investigation and interrogation process shows that it has many impurities and corruption in how to accuse these innocent people.In the Name of the Father, on the surface, talks about justice and the feeling of oppression in the face of injustice. The events of the film are dramatic, revolving around other topics, the most important of which is the relationship between the son and the father and how it develops, as well as how an ugly place such as prison can constitute an opportunity for Jerry to mature in a way that would not have happened if he had not been subjected to injustice.The multiplicity and diversity of the dimensions of the film, in addition to manifestations outside the capabilities of the planet in two scenes and the performance of two actors, who gave the film great importance and a special place for me.If there was an Oscar for best acting duo, the Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite partnership would have given them blindfolded.The character of Giuseppe Conlon has no faults. Even the story of his name, which allowed a wonderful scene to be told, was charming and incredible. He had a strange state of coherence in light of the circumstances in which he was, and in light of his background full of downwardness, which made him follow the rules and laws strictly so as not to violate the law. This flatness made his son Jerry view him as a weakness. But when Jerry realized when he tested himself in facing the same challenges his father faced, he saw his father, Giuseppe Conlon, gain ground and respect in every situation.This movie is incredibly wonderful. It dazzled me and made me follow the events without getting bored.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
They can't block out the light in here.,"I am quickly becoming aware of the power that Jim Sheridan has behind the camera as well as in crafting genuine non-Hollywood films. As I watched In the Name of the Father unfold, I continually was impressed by the passionate camera angles, the conviction of the characters, and Sheridan's ability not to sway from his own personal heritage. From the opening sequences of this film to the amazing direction to the dedicated actors, I knew that In the Name of the Father was going to be more than just your typical political ""courtroom"" drama. It wasn't until the film was finished that I realized Sheridan's power. I speak very highly of him in the opening of this review because I believe that if any other director would have been at the helm of this project that the final cut would not have been as immaculate. Typically with films of this nature we, as audience members, fall prey to there needing to be some sympathy for the opposing country. The British did unfairly treat the Irish in this film, but I believe any other director would have chosen a neutral ground instead of forging headfirst like Sheridan chose to do. I believe any other director would have focused more perversely on the courtroom drama aspect of this film instead of the compelling family epic that was being forged within the walls of Gerry's prison. Due to Sheridan, the masterpiece known as In the Name of the Father was crafted with genuine passion and superb direction.For a film of this high of emotion and intensity to work, there needed to be key players involved that knew how to handle the truthfulness of it all. Sheridan hit a bulls-eye with Daniel Day-Lewis in the key role of Gerry Conlon (which I think most directors do when they choose to hire one of our greatest cinematic heroes), but it was the surprise performance by the typical secondary character actor Pete Postlethwaite that shook me to the core. I have seen quite a bit of films that used the talent of Pete Postlethwaite, but I must admit, this is the first time that I have seen him take control of his character and give it his full devotion. Perhaps it was the dedication that Daniel Day-Lewis had to his character that rubbed onto the other actors, or again, maybe it was just the skillful direction of Jim Sheridan, but I will be the first to say that Postlethwaite stole this film. He didn't just capture the individual scenes in which he was present, but he embodied this entire film. Postlethwaite's father figure was there for his son, he put himself in danger for his son, and most importantly he taught his son the truth of the world. He was phenomenal in the small role that eventually captured the entire film. It is the belief of this reviewer that Pete should have been awarded for an Oscar for this role, instead of Tommy Lee Jones. I was also impressed with John Lynch whom I had only seen in some smaller roles since this. He fully embodied the frightened youth that didn't know better than to finger his friends to save his life. Then there was Emma Thompson. She was subtle in this film. Her role was short, sweet, and to the point, which I think is another prime example of why Sheridan's direction is so acute.I have not read Proved Innocent, but I do not think that Sheridan went too far off course with his adaptation. The story is what kept me glued to the screen. I knew from the awards that In the Name of the Father was honored with that it was great in the direction and acting respects, but it wasn't until I watched the entire film that I realized the power of the story. We don't watch Gerry grow up. We don't see his dysfunctional relationship with his father. We don't see the impeding chaos in Britain. We don't see a lot of back items that would have taken this film into the three-hour zone. Instead, Sheridan crops the film into three distinct moments. Those are Gerry prior to jail, Gerry and his father in jail, and finally, Gerry gaining the wisdom from his father. I enjoyed the fact that Sheridan didn't focus so intently on the trial, but instead the growth of Gerry and the developing relationship between him and father. It was like watching a child grow before our eyes. The only disappointment that I had with the overall story was the quickness of the ending. I do believe Sheridan could have traveled it out for another twenty minutes to give us the full effect of the climactic courtroom scene, or those moments when Gerry decides to learn about British law himself. I just felt that the last half-hour seemed to fly by because there were so many loose ends to tighten.Overall, I thought this film (despite the quickness of the ending) was engrossing to watch and exciting to see. It frightened me to watch it in a post-9/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions. It makes you wonder about the detainees of Iraq and if we, as a nation, are not discovering that our government is jailing the innocent. Sheridan successfully brings the emotions of aggravation and frustration to the peak of the screen with the events surrounding the Conlon family. He makes you feel for these innocent bystanders living in a corrupt nation. It made me happy to have the father that I currently have and appreciate the wisdom that he has handed down to me. Family is one of the most important elements in your life, and I believe that what Sheridan was trying to demonstrate with this film is that until you accept that, you will never find stability and security.Grade: **** out of *****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Father and son,"The crucial events of In the Name of the Father are triggered by an I. R. A. Bombing. The movie also shows the disgusting methods the police officers use during interrogation and the incompetence of the legal system. Still, providing socio-political commentary is far from its main objective.Instead, it is mostly concerned with telling the story of Gerry Conlon, the man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and as a result was sentenced to a life in prison. More specifically, it focuses on how this experience changed him. Before all the chaos, he was a young, carefree man who would spend his time with some hippies, he was a small time crook with no real goal in life other than having a good time. The contrast to what happens after is as stark as it gets. After he gets dragged out of his bed and torturously questioned in what feels like a surreal nightmare, he ends up in a cell, where his state of mind goes through various stages. At first, he gives up any hope and all he does is hate himself, his bad luck, the system, everything and everyone. When Joe, a fellow Irishman arrives, one who is an actual member of I. R. A., he sees some light and believes justice can be earned through radical and violent means. That's until Joe resorts to extreme measures and Gerry realises there is another way, the one his father follows. And that's another massive theme of the movie, the father-son relationship. Initially, they are worlds apart. In the end, they are real family. Major props to Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite who made it work. Credit goes to Emma Thompson as well, who portrays Gareth Peirce, the attorney who goes all out to prove their innocence.The obvious complaint to be made is that the movie lacks a bit in historical accuracy.One could also argue the movie occasionally loses its focus, but there are many powerful and memorable scenes that more than make up for it. Examples include the opening scene, where Gerry gets caught stealing and all hell breaks loose, the prisoners paying tribute to Gerry's dad, Gareth's fiery speech, and of course most scenes between Gerry and his dad.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very sad and powerful film,"This one is a keeper, it is indeed one of the best films I have ever seem. It is in my top 50 favorite films and I think it will always remain there. Set in the British Islands in the 1970's, this film shows clearly how complicated was the situation of the poorer folks from Ireland relative to the rest of the Islands and how they suffered extreme prejudice from their ethnic background. Which I would think is rather absurd considering that the main way of differentiating an Irishman from an Englishman is the accent.There are some minor flaws in the film, however, but it doesn't detract from the viewing experience.Overall, a very touching film and I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The scenes of violence, including the riot at the beginning, the terrorist attack and the police torture, show just how big the stakes are.

The visuals are also great thing to see. The early Belfast depiction is something very attention grabbing. I watched '71 some time ago and now know where does the movie get their inspiration to depict the Belfast chaos. The acting overall is also a great job.

"A low-key, much-forgotten but well-executed film.","This movie is totally forgotten these days. Well, actually, if you're not native or very close to Ireland, I think the very existence and action of the IRA seems like something that ended many years ago, and it doesn't. It was a recent thing, and it still has marks on people and society. The film focuses, in particular, on the case of the ""Guildford Four"" and the ""Maguire Seven"", which was a group of people who were accused of a bomb attack and of collaborating with the IRA, later proving to be if they were all innocent. The acquittal, however, came too late for the family patriarch, who died in prison. The accused were, almost all, related to each other, family or friendship.I don't know the facts very well, although I did read something about the attack and the real case the film was based on, in order to better prepare myself to understand the film and be able to talk about it. As far as I can tell, the film obviously took a lot of liberties to make the story more appealing and dramatic, but nothing that is shockingly out of line with what happened.Daniel Day Lewis was still relatively young here, but he was already showing signs of great talent. He is a focused actor and very responsible with his work, who dedicates himself to what he does and commits himself to the character. And we can see how he adapts to the character, and makes it real and believable and human. I also really enjoyed Pete Postlethwaite's work. I think it's particularly notable the way he allowed himself to age in order to play an older, physically impaired character.Technically, the film is very worthy in its effort to portray the ordeal to which the convicts were subjected, and it does so in a very convincing and credible way. The choice of sets, filming locations and costumes contribute a lot to this. The film works very well on the environment and psyche of the characters, resulting in a dense drama, which may not please those who want a lighter film, but which works very well. The opening credits were well-introduced, even though I don't like the theme song.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

It's incredibly well- made, it's fast-paced, brilliantly acted, and very passionate and interesting.Standing out in the stunningly engrossing cast are Daniel Day-Lewis and Emma Thompson, who are both always wonderfully appealing, and though I'm not sure I'll ever see Day-Lewis in any performance that surpasses the magnetism and captivating charm of Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York, he wows here, conveying such a deeply felt character. Thompson, whom I just recently re-watched in Primary Colors as an entirely different character, proves herself a true chameleon, completely taking all forms of her role.It isn't approached from the angle of structuring the story the generally most appealing way, even though it seems like it, intercutting flashbacks with the present and such. It simply follows the characters through their own arcs, and the film becomes the most interesting and engaging film I've seen in weeks. The hardships they endure, the conflicts that fall into their laps, the drama that ensues, and the prospect of justice are all just so absorbing that you have to see it to believe it.

A classic tale of justice and determination,"The crowning achievement in Irish director Jim Sheridan's career to date, with his film nominated for 7 Oscars in the 1994 Academy Awards ceremony including one for Best Picture and Best Director, the based on the true story In the Name of the Father is an incredibly well acted and scripted drama that nowadays may feel more familiar to viewers than those that watched it with fresh eyes upon release but one that still holds a power over and grip on viewer's to this day.Based around the story of Irish based father and son Gerry and Giuseppe Conlan, two simple souls from Ireland who were unfortunately targeted by British police in relation to an horrific London bombing attack by the IRA in 1974 and alongside other innocent acquittances jailed for heinous crimes they never committed, Father clearly harbors a story Sheridan and his two leading men Daniel Day-Lewis and the late Pete Postlethwaite were passionate about as they bring the Conlan's story to life.As is too be expected from work by quality actors such as Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite, Father's power and memorability is helped along by their stunning work and it's sad to think that with Day-Lewis now retired from acting and Postlethwaite having passed away in the years following Father's release that these performers can no longer give us turns like this and watching the two industry stalwarts join forces as a father and son that at times are at odds against one another but at other times beautifully bonded in love, is the type of high caliber material moviegoers often seek out but rarely find.Unlike some of his other big turns in his most famous roles in the likes of Gangs of New York or There Will Be Blood where he chewed scenery and anything else that was in his path in the best possible way, Day-Lewis in particular is a lot different to how we usually expect to see him as the care-free, mischievous and ultimately likeable Gerry, a man who dabbles in petty thievery and partying but is anything but a cold blooded murderer and his turn here is easily up their with some of his best performances in a career that was littered with them.Allowing us to get know Gerry before he became a wrongly imprisoned criminal, looking for new opportunities in London as his country of Ireland is torn apart by pointless war and carnage ensures there's a lot of audience good will for him and his kindly father and while the film never strays off the well-trodden path of these type of fight for justice films that have become a mainstay of Hollywood and other cinema for some time, there's a quality and heart to Father that will ensure its place in the hearts and minds of audiences for years yet to come.Final Say -It never does anything in a way we wouldn't of expected from this type of story but there's an undeniable power in the Conlan's story and the performances of Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite are as good as you could possibly get from two leads.4 seat carvings out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A riveting depiction of historical injustice,"Led by magnificent acting performances and great direction, In the Name of the Father offers the audience a terrific reenactment of one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice in the history of Britain, as it portrays the story of Gerry Conlon and his father, and the false accusations made against them in regards to the Guildford pub bombings in 1974. By exploring a very controversial issue, this enthralling drama proves to be a very eye-opening and thought provoking viewing experience, one that is both politically and morally charged. Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite give extremely passionate performances, as they serve as the centerpiece for a film that strikes a strong balance between exploring the estranged father-son relationship and the surrounding political issues.

Sheridan is good at portraying Northern Irish situations to perfection, this is probably the best and the most haunting. And the theme is justice and prejudice.

Brilliant commentary that is 100% relevant today,"This is an exceptional movie, and a deeply political one. Not just for its discussion of Northern Ireland, but the very poignant statements it makes about torture, about the death penalty, and indeed about any system of justice that prioritizes attaining a confession of guilt.More than a decade since the film came out, all of these issues are highly relevant in, for example, the United States today.Guantanamo Bay, anyone? As this film makes clear, there is no justification for the torture of political prisoners (or indeed, anyone else for that matter).The Death Penalty? Had the UK permitted the death penalty for this sort of crime, the Guildford Four would almost certainly have been executed (both the film and the contemporaneous accounts of the case indicate this). There can be no justification for capital punishment, under any circumstances. Guilt is never 100% certain, even when accompanied by a confession.It's rare that a film makes compelling, timeless political statements, and rarer still to do so in the context of telling a great story. The story of Gerry Conlon, and the rest of the Guildford Four, needs to be told and retold. Especially in times when people are willing to sacrifice human freedoms and fundamental rights in the hopes of attaining a false sense of ""security.""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

It is all part of a nefarious plot by the British government to incarcerate any suspect to keep the British population content that something is being done about the bombings. Daniel Day-Lewis plays a complex character who is not entirely likable, but we do commiserate with his plight. At over 2 hours the movie never slows down.

Great Cast and writing makes for a wonderful  true film about injustice!,"It is no surprise that Peter Postlewaite O.B.E. was rated as one of Steven Spielberg's favorite actors. He gives an understated and well deserved academy award nomination for his performance as the father of Daniel Day-Lewis's character. You learn to easily accept them as father and son in this film. They work very well together. Emma Thompson also get a supporting role as the British lawyer who helps Gerry get out of prison and exonerated for the crimes. The film pulls no punches about the violent persuasion into making a false confession. It breaks your heart to see lies, propaganda, and innocent people going to prison for crimes they didn't commit in the first place but it does happen all the time which is why I am against capital punishment in my country for that reason. The film earned several academy award nominations including for best actor in which Daniel Day Lewis also became a naturalized Irish citizen. He would seem an unlikely candidate for British knighthood like his grandfather now. The film is more relevant today than when it was released. Terrorism has returned with a vengeance. People seem willing to put innocent people behind bars because of their ethnicity. We must learn a valuable lesson in not judging a book by its cover. In the meantime, prison life was not enjoyable but neither torturous. Both Gerry and Giuseppe Conlon are in prison together which makes the situation bearable. In fact the other prisoners are more decent and hospitable than the men who put the innocent men there in the first place.

More proof that Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time,"""I don't understand your language. ""Justice."" ""Mercy."" ""Clemency."" I literally don't understand what those words mean.""If I had to describe this film using only one adjective I would say it is an enraging movie. Jim Sheridan followed his successful directorial debut, My Left Foot, by teaming up once again with Daniel Day Lewis who delivers yet another superb performance. I'm ashamed to admit that I just got around to watching this film for the first time on its 20th anniversary, but it was completely worth it because I was blown away by this powerful and engaging film. I wouldn't call this a groundbreaking film because we've had plenty of movies dealing with similar themes. Films like The Hurricane or The Shawshank Redemption deal with the kind of social injustice that is presented here where an innocent man is incarcerated due to a corrupt justice system. In the Name of the Father differs a bit in that it doesn't focus so much on the hope of finding freedom, but rather on the enraging aspect of the injustice that the lead character and his family and friends go through. This is a genre that I'll always be drawn too, especially when it is based on a true story because I think these people deserve to have their voice heard after all they've gone through. I know that several artistic liberties were taken to make the film, but even so it draws attention to Gerry Conlon's autobiographical book. Sheridan's direction was solid, and I liked how he focused a lot of the attention on the father and son relationship. I don't know if this film would've worked as well as it did if it weren't for Daniel Day Lewis's brilliant performance. He is without a doubt one of the best actors of our time.Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day Lewis) grew up in Belfast in the 70's when the IRA terrorist attacks were at its peak. He was never involved with the terrorist group, but he was no saint either. As a young lad he felt forced to become a small time thief due to the lack of employment. While robbing some lead sheets from a roof of a house he accidentally leads British soldiers to a home that was hiding IRA weapons. Fortunately they never discovered anything, and the IRA members send Gerry off with a warning. His father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), with whom he's had an estranged relationship, sends him to London hoping he can find a better future there and escape from all the political turmoil. On his way to London, Gerry runs into his school friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) and together they decide to go visit their friend Patrick Armstrong (Mark Sheppard) who has been living in London along with a group of free spirited hippies. Unfortunately for Gerry and his friends, they end up being in the wrong place at the wrong time and are accused of bombing a soldier's pub. Bullied by the police officers they are forced into signing a confession and are sentenced to prison along with some of Gerry's family members. In prison, Gerry and his father continue to fight to prove their innocence with the help of an attorney named Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson) and the more she digs into the story the more corruption she finds in the police procedures.The film manages to draw you in and make your blood boil due to all the injustices suffered by these characters. It is one of those movies where the tension builds up with the passing of time, but at the same time you also feel a connection growing between Gerry and his father. The film becomes more than a simple social injustice tale and turns into a character driven story focusing on the relationship between father and son. It is a shame the film has kind of been forgotten because I thought it was really well made. It never won an Academy Award, but it did receive 7 nominations including Best Picture, losing out to Schindler's List that year. Daniel Day Lewis outshines everyone in this film, although the supporting cast was very strong, especially Pete Postlethwaite who shared great chemistry with Lewis.

",,I would caution you not to be swayed by emotions''","Well, I have to admit that I was certainly swayed by emotions, but not the kind of uncontrollable hatred the British state attorney was trying to arouse in the general population. What was ignited inside me were feelings of anger in front of such a corrupt system, resentment, disappointment, powerlessness, resignation, and then gradually a spark of hope, a sort of skewed belief in some sort of justice (or rather a satisfaction due to the just course of action being taken, given the tragic of the story), jubilation and in the end curiosity to find out more about this McCarthy Communist Witch Hunt with British and Irish terrorists instead of Americans and communists. This resurrection of a man on screen, even though a little bit hurried in parts, is quite memorable and I can hardly find a fault with the movie, excepting maybe a couple of historical inadequacies, but I am not a historian so I won't be a harsh on the movie because of that. Maybe I will re-watch it in a couple of years, I feel there are some hidden symbols and gems here that await to be found again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
a must see film........still.,"the film never overstated the reason why Conlon was imprisoned and never attempted to glorify what the IRA wanted to prove. the film concentrated on the plight of the accused accurately enough and never spiralled off on other tangents, there was obviously a lot of in depth research done for the film, one only had to look at certain parts of the film to understand how much had gone into it,i refer to the scene when Conlons solicitor visited the archives to retrieve files, if you look carefully the top file is headed Beirne one of Gabriel Byrnes relations from Elphin, Eire.Perhaps one day the whole truth will come out as to who really bombed the pub but until then we will have to wait. well done cracking film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Touches the Heart.  A great, great film","Tremendous film. Tremendously underrated. When I talk to my peers about ""In the name of the Father"" I often get, ""what?"" It's truly a shame. Yes, the movie is a older now, but it's a classic film about injustice and political oppression. And Dainel Day-Lewis, wow. It's my understanding that he lost out to Tom Hanks for Best Actor, which is unfortunate. Not to take away from Hanks, but because this is an absolutely amazing performance. He shines as Gerry Conlon, a man wrongfully convicted for a brutal crime. This is one of those rare films that allows you to feel the pain of injustice. I'm not Irish. I'm not English, and I wasn't even born when Gerry was convicted, yet I can feel as if I was there. I was in that prison with him with this movie.Also Emma Thompson, what an inspiration.

"Great performances, powerful movie.","It's funny how you can watch a whole bunch of movies, trying to learn more about film-making and how shots are constructed, how characters are developed, how music should be used and then all of a sudden a movie comes along and you find yourself drawn into its story and easily forgetting to pay attention to all of technical aspects. When it comes to In the Name of the Father, it was like being reminded of how powerful a performance could be and how films can truly reach into your heart and affect you.I don't know what makes Daniel Day-Lewis' performance so effective but I thought it was very much so. I think great film is often about capturing the great things that already exist in the world, not so much about creating a great work of art but recognising something that you find beautiful or simply interesting and sharing it with an audience. Perhaps the reason Day-Lewis' performance is so good is that he is so ""naked"" as an actor (as they say). I have a feeling this is probably some well known concept in film that critics rarely talk about because everyone understands it (except me). Oh well.I also though Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson were excellent as well, one gets the impression that everyone that worked on the film truly believed in it. As for the story, I have no idea how close it is to the truth but to some degree I don't think it matters. What matters is that it manages to engage and affect you, hence inspiring you to learn more about the actual events for yourself. I don't think films should have to be about capturing or creating realism only, by exploring fantasies you can make things more personal as well as achieve greater depth (I believe) hence expressing more than you could otherwise. This probably has little to do with this film in particular but as Roger Ebert has said (roughly), movies should be about emotions and ideas not facts.So, I think what makes In the Name of the Father so effective is that its a personal film with a very talented cast, a good story and a director that knows how to let the magic happen. Or something. I think that's an extremely vague and general statement but hey, I don't want to spoil the details of the story.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"I'm a free man, and I'm going out the front door.","From the hollow, perfunctory, ill-paced and overlong first act, that its only remarkable merit is giving us a glimpse of Gerry Conlon's frivolity and rebelliousness (well, plus one of the best opening sequences ever), to the not-so-convincing sense of time in prison, this otherwise heart-wrenching biopic is definitely not without its flaws. However, I can't recall that I have seen a troubled father-son relationship (brought to life by astonishing performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite) has been better depicted than in this. Just look at how the experience of imprisonment somehow matured Gerry up, whether by getting to know his father more and better (the dialogue between Gerry and Giuseppe is just phenomenal), or merely due to the incidents and mishaps that he had in prison. Not to mention the painful and provocative meticulous dramatization of a miscarriage of injustice, vividly portrayed by some of the most sensible, artistic, emotionally-charged scenery that Jim Sheridan's nuanced direction are responsible of.Happy Birthday to the greatest actor ever, Daniel Day-Lewis. I do miss him!(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very moving,"Very moving. As father and son Giuseppe and Gerry Conlon, both Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis give passionate and outstanding performances as they struggle with both their failed relationship and the battle to prove their innocence. Emma Thompson gives a strong performance too as lawyer Gareth Peirce, the woman who has taken up the appeal. All other cast members are impressive. Sheridan presents a highly charged, emotional drama which tells a horrifying tale in what is a black period in Irish and English history that continues even today. While he perhaps could have shown us more of the people's reaction and the feeling of the time, he instead concentrates on the Conlon's plight and their never ending fight for justice. Due credit must also go to Jim Sheridan for keeping what would have to be an incident and an issue that is close to his heart, very evenly balanced, as both sides are portrayed as equally guilty of terrible and unspeakable acts.Backed up by some very good cinematography, editing and set direction, ""In the Name of the Father"" is certainly a movie that will stir your soul and disturb you. It is truly frightening what men in power are capable of, and even more frightening are the devastating effects they can have on so many people's lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"a son, a father, and the damning of the Irish (or any damned group)","In the movie In the Name of the Father, we get a story involving injustice - people who are accused and found guilty of crimes they didn't commit - but why it works is centrally two things: even if you don't know a thing about the IRA (though it might help to know just a little) or the struggles in Belfast in the 1970's and how it involved the United Kingdom, people see injustice happening every day, with many races. If one were to put this on a double bill with the Burns doc The Central Park Five, the coincidences would be extraordinary: the rampant torture via police to the accused, the lack of any strong legal defense, and the tampering of evidence. There is that aspect, the US against THEM element, which is simple enough. But trickier, and what works greater, is the father son element of the story, where Daniel Day Lewis is Gerry Conlon is in prison for life along with his father (a very innocent man) Giuseppe, who is there for the simple reason of accused corroboration.In a way it's probably the most accessible film that has been made, that I can think of off the top of my head, about the controversies and ""war"" of the IRA over the years. I don't see Sheridan taking sides either way exactly with the IRA except for the fact of the killing innocent people, those ""innocent bystanders"" that die in that pub bombing, is very wrong. The context and framing of it is what counts; Conlon had no real political aspirations either way, and when we first see him, he's basically a young punk/hippie who gets chased by IRA guards as they think his stick is a sniper. He goes to London to cool off/find work/hang low, and it's actually in the scene where he first is going off - by the ship - that he and his father have the interaction that speaks to what will come: Giuseppe is a natural, loving father, maybe at worst a little awkward or 'normal', while Gerry is just a young, aimless youth, uncomfortable with any affection or care.The crime and arrest happen due to the sort of circumstances that happens with Wrong Man scenarios (not the Hitchcock sort, to be sure). The Wrong-Place-Wrong-Time thing, and it leads one of the most harrowing section of the film, where Conlon is interrogated. Day-Lewis here is explosive, charged, frightened, crying, under mental and physical abuse, but yet he keeps it all in check. Another actor might have gone over the top here, but somehow it always feels just right, calibrated even in the highly charged emotional range. Then he and the others are found guilty (oh darn that homeless alibi!) and sent off to prison.Apparently, according to Ebert's review, some facts were shuffled around to add to the drama - namely that the Conlon father/son shared a cell. Perhaps it is convenient dramatically speaking, and there's even a period in these years they're in there together, that Gerry spends less time with his dad, trying to escape through drugs and other (somehow friendly) prisoners. If there's one issue with this mid-section involving prison, it's that most everyone - with the exception perhaps until the other Irish man (no spoilers here) comes to prison - gets along and there's no real horror to go through. Maybe that's kind of refreshing in a sense, usually prison is shown in movies as a very rough place. If anything the political situation - the Conlons being innocent - makes it the most frenetic and harried for Gerry and his father.But, again, it's the tone of this personal side, just showing DDL and Postlethwaite together, that makes the film work so well. We may hope, and see it probably as conventional, that Gerry is set in these injustice-wheels and everything's spinning until he can get help (in the form here of Emma Thompson, in maybe the only one-dimensional role in the film, not that she is poor in any way acting-wise). But deep down, the bond between these two is what counts, and Gerry's own growth as a person is marked as he spends more time behind bars. So In the Name of the Father is successful on the fronts of what the story is about, but also how it's about it via its emotional stakes, especially in the third act when things become uncertain for the decent father. And if anything, as great as Lewis is (and that's a given, of course, look at his track record), Postlethwaite rises up to be his equal. In sort, an acting masters class in what is mostly a heavy film, with a lot of heart and (even once or twice, early on before the s*** goes down) a little light-heartedness.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Powerful Performances!,"If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well.Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom.Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait.Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A true memorable story of injustice,"Jim Sheridan made the movie ""In the Name of the Father"" based on the autobiography ""Proved innocent"" by Gerry Conlon. In the Name of the Father displayed the true story of the ""Guildford Four"" and retells there miraculous journey to freedom. The movie displays the process of innocent average Irishmen wrongfully accused for bombing a pub in Guildford.A bombing occurred on October 5th, 1974 in a Guildford pub in England. The head of the police force Robert Dixon (Corin Redgrave) arrested the accused bombers Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Paul Hill (John Lynch). Gerry's father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) helps Gerry find a lawyer but then gets charged for participating in the bombings.Gerry and Paul were sentenced to life in prison because there was insufficient evidence for them to be hung. The only chance for them to be set free was through a lawyer named Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson) who attempts to set them free by gathering scraps of evidence.The movie showed the actual story of the ""Guildford Four"" in many views. Jim Sheridan displayed views from Robert Dixon under public pressure, injustice towards the ""Guildford Four"" and also Jim Sheridan showed the development of Gerry and Giuseppe's father and son relationship. The development was shown clearly because at first Gerry and Giuseppe had a weak relationship but they then discovered they could connect and formed a closer bond.Gerry Conlon and Giuseppe form a great duo as father and son and perform a very convincing relationship. Many movies lack the actors to play a true father and son relationship but Daniel and Pete play it with perfection. Another memorable performance was by Corin Redgrave who played a firm and sly policeman determined to put the case away.The camera angles and shots of the movie were remarkable in presenting the scenes. When there was a riot in the beginning of the film, the camera used was hand held so that made you feel you were there. The lighting and music was very significant in the film by choosing the right colour and sounds to help set the mood to express the scene. Certain scenes such as depressing or dim scenes were shown with a dark blue colour and sad touching orchestra hymns to set the mood.The film In the Name of the Father successfully portrays the true story of the ""Guildford Four"" from different perspectives. Jim Sheridan accurately displays the events that lead to the freedom of the ""Guildford Four"". During their journey to freedom, the development of the father and son relationship is shown and society's views on the events that occur. The movie is based around injustice and proves to be a memorable movie which will be remembered by all.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
DDL and a history lesson,"Daniel Day Lewis. There is not much more to say about him, as the name speaks for itself. Superb as ever, DDL plays Gerry Conlon brilliantly.

And each character was cast perfectly. Even Peter Postlethwaite looks so much like DDL and, in addition to their fantastic on-screen chemistry, they are a very convincing father/son duo.Watch ""In the Name of the Father"" if you love great film making, acting, character development and accurate portrayals of significant historical events.

Jim Sheridan's Finest Feature. One of Daniel Day-Lewis' Finest Performances.,"Based on the true events surrounding the IRA bombing of 1974 in England, In the Name of the Father tells the story of Gerry Conlon; a small time thief who, along with his friends, is falsely accused of committing the heinous crime & after being coerced into confessing guilty by the British police during the brutal interrogation is sentenced to prison life along with his father who is also implicated in the crime during the trial. The story covers 15 years of Conlon's wrongful imprisonment during which he tries to prove his innocence with the help of a British attorney.This is the 2nd collaboration between Jim Sheridan & Daniel Day-Lewis after My Left Foot and presents Sheridan in complete control of his craftsmanship & Day-Lewis at the top of his game. The real-life character of Gerry Conlon is magnificently brought to life by Day-Lewis & he was simply at his best during the interrogation scene, making it the film's most intense sequence. Also, the scenes between Gerry & his father, played amazingly well by Pete Postlethwaite, are its finest moments and the two shared an amazing chemistry together.On an overall scale, In the Name of the Father is one of those films that leaves little to complain about and is a brilliantly directed, deftly written, tightly edited, strongly performed & elegantly composed cinema that also features best works in the directional career of Jim Sheridan & acting career of Pete Postlethwaite. Daniel Day-Lewis' contribution here often gets overlooked but, in my opinion, it's right there amongst his finest performances. All in all, In the Name of the Father is one of the best films of its year and is a must watch for anyone who appreciates great cinema. Strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,Biography
This film shows the real horror and hurt that Irish people have had to endure time and time again.,"During this film i am totally sure that you will have a lot of laughs and also a lot of tears.

This is so like many of the young men in Belfast trying to scrape a few pound to keep his ma happy and always falling into the traps of the law along the way. Pete Postlethwaite is a great actor as we all know and portrays the perfect Giuseppe Conlon, the father of Gerry, always trying to see the best in everyone and is let down time and time again.This is a film well worth seeing and i assure you that you will be on the edge of your seat at this moving story of one man trying to prove his innocents to both the world and his family.Unlike many films about Belfast this is set mainly in an English Prison and not on the Streets of Belfast.",,Anonymous,Biography

"Completely different genre than ""Green Mile""","First thing I wanted to address was that although it does take place in a prison, this cannot be compared with such movies as ""The Green Mile"" or ""Shawshank Redemption"".  Those two are completely fictitious stories, although they are entertaining.  You wouldn't put ""Stripes"" or ""In the Army Now"" in the same basket with such films as ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Shaving Ryan's Privates"", would you?   Oops, excuse me; I meant ""Saving Private Ryan"".Anyway, excellent film.  I don't see anything anti-English about it; it just Happened in England.  Just like ""Murder in the First"" Happened in The States.  Things like this happen in all sorts of places, so making a movie on them doesn't make it an Anti-(country of choice) film.Kinda funny how a previous comment mentioned Pete Postlethwaite and Tommy Lee Jones in the same sentence; I spent half the time debating to myself whether the actor was Tommy or not (until I read the credits, of course). Sometimes they're spitting images of each other, sometimes they're not.Anyway, very well done film and I look forward to reading the book sometime. Good soundtrack, too.",,Anonymous,Biography

Although the movie is based on Conlon's autobiographical book, this is not only a political film in the sense we would expect it to be; the tragedy of two innocents arrested and convicted serves only as a background for an intimate reflection on father and son relationship in a movie that finally lies midway between a prison movie and a family drama.",,Anonymous,Biography

A good view on the Irish problem,"The screenplay for ""In the name of the Father"" is based on the memoirs of a Belfast young boy who, along with friends and family members, was wrongly convicted by the British government in 1975 for the terrorist bombing of two pubs in Guildford, a town outside London.Imprisoned for fifteen years, the ""Guildford Four"" (they were called like that) finally won their freedom in a ruling that sparked controversy and shook the British legal system.""In the name of the Father"" tells a really moving story which will not probably remain indifferent to the viewers. In fact, all my impressions about the film were very good, both for the performances and for the interesting contents. Jim Sheridan, the director, knew how to turn his ideas into reality in a masterly way.I think, as a spectator, that this true story of terrible injustice provided a compelling basis for a moving drama: the problem in Ireland, family values or real facts made by the authorities en the 70s give a touch of reality that is felt throughout the whole film. In addition to this, in constructing his parable of good and evil, Sheridan was also inspired to explore some patriarchal concepts, including the British crown's involvement in United Kingdom. On the other hand, I also observed a certain allegory of a father and son in conflict which, actually, provides the most important argument in the film. In fact, a combination of values related to religion is a constant feature throughout the film.In conclusion, I believe that ""In the name of the Father"" has been one of the best films I have ever seen so I recommend it to anyone interested in social problems. A story about violence and love, about justice and injustice, all combinated in order to explain the crude reality about a harsh conflict which, even nowadays, goes on affecting thousands of people in a similar way of Gerry Conlon. And, obviously,for the Spanish people the film will mean a revival of a problem that affects us directly. So, come on, see it because it is worthy and it will help you to understand (or unless to try to look for an explanation) many life matters!",,Anonymous,Biography

Read the book,"In the early 1970s, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) went to London from Belfast to pursue a different life and later on he found work there. In 1974, along with friends and family, he was arrested and later accused of the Guilford Bombing.Conlon was to spend fifteen years in jail for something he had never done. His father, Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite) was also imprisoned and years later died in jail due to ill health and improper  prison medical care. Gerry Conlon was transferred from prison to prison and he fought for clearing his and his father's names. Throughout the initial interrogations he was heavily abused by the British police.With the relentless efforts of his lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson), finally, after fifteen years, the verdicts were quashed.The film is about one man's journey fighting against one of the most shocking miscarriages of justice in British history and undeservedly tortured innocent civilians. This is a moving, powerful story well told. However, if you like this film, don't forget to read the book. It's even more fascinating and you'll realise how much the film has left out.

At first viewing i didn't realise it was a true story until i read the ending and to find out that all this was true was just so astonishing. My favourite quote comes from Emma Thompson who plays Gareth in the court scene at the end where she says ""their only mistake was that they were bloody well Irish."" Did you notice that the people who said it was political nonsense and biased were all English? Yes it told the Irish account of what happened but the fact still remains that the English used the four Irish innocent people as scapegoats so as that they wouldn't have to find the real people who did it and even when they did find those responsible they didn't do anything about it. I think you just don't like being shed in a bad light. All in all it remains one of the best films i have ever seen and am likely to see.",,Anonymous,Biography

Themes like physical and psychological cruelty, distortion of reality, mind and spiritual growth, human redemption, and family love at its highest level, are treated with brilliance by Jim Sheridan whose wonderful direction allows the viewer to emotionally relate to every aspect of the story.The performances of Pete Postlehwaite and Daniel Day Lewis, as father and son and victims of a terrible misstep of the administration of justice, are astonishing. The scenes between these two actors are incredibly powerful and truly heartbreaking. Emma Thompson also gives a great performance as Gareth Peirce, the lawyer who represented the long awaited arrival of the truth after years of harm and legal blindness.'In The Name of the Father' is a great piece of film-making.",,Anonymous,Biography
best film ever made,"words cannot describe how i feel about this film. i am a great fan of true stories and also prison films such as the green mile and shawshank redemption. but this film tops the list. it has been my favourite film since 1993 and 11 years on and i feel as strongly about it. it still has the power to make me feel emotional by the end of the film. it is without a doubt the most moving, powerful film i have ever had the priveledge to watch.the story, in short, is about a man wrongly imprisoned for 15 years, along with his father and 3 friends, and their fight for justice. i would recommend that everybody buy this film on DVD and take great care of it as their are not enough films of this caliber in the world. 10 out of 10",,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty horrifying,"In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.",,Anonymous,Biography
Irish victims of the war convicted of something they did not do,"When i first saw ""In The Name Of The Father"" i was just 13 i liked the movie because it was very satisfying to watch at the end. But last night when it was aired on Terrestrial Televison i was totally shocked on the full traumatic experience this movie put across it was very frustrating to watch which hightend my emotions. And i thought that this surely could not of happened in Britian. But the truth is it did being only 15 i do not understand the true politics of the Irish problem but this showed a very good slice to any viewer what was going on.Pete Posthelwaite was as always excellent his Irish accent was perfect and he played the part brilliant when he passed away in the Prison i felt a lump in my throat because of that man being away from his country and his wife who he loved very much. I felt that it was horrible how he became the ones who did the Guilford Bombing in London. I cannot imagine the thought of being blamed of something those people did do. Daniel Day Lewis was also excellent and showed his true acting qualitys i honestly believe if you fancy a night in with just you and yourself i would watch it.""Im a free man im going out the front door""",,Anonymous,Biography
