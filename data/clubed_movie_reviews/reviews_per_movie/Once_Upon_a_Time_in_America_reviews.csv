Probably the best movie I have ever seen,"Make sure you watch the 220 minute version which is perfect. The butchered 139 minute version should never have been released and the added faded clips in the much longer 269 minute version aren't worth it.It's not an easy watch. The story builds patiently and jumps back and forth in time, spanning three generations. It's not the usual gangster flick, but a tale of forgiveness, betrayal, greed and nostalgia. The sets, the fantastic score by Morricone, De Niro at the pinnacle of his career.A beautiful epic swan song by the master Sergio Leone this is.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Reviewing the 230 minute version here...,"Because there is an even longer director's cut and a short 130 minute version which was the version initially released in America, and is incomprehensible.The film traces the lives of four Jewish gangsters from a New York City ghetto through 60 years of 20th century history in an odd way. It focuses on three time periods - 1920 when the gang is in their teens, 1932-1933 as prohibition ends, and 1968 when Noodles (Robert DeNiro) returns to New York as an old man after he gets a letter saying his true identity has been uncovered. Noodles has been living with regret this past 35 years, because he feels responsible for his gang having been killed by the police back in 1933. He wonders if someone is planning to settle an old score with him.The Godfather this is not. There are no family ties binding any of these characters together, and they are extremely unlikeable and only vaguely characterized. Only Noodles is humanized even a little bit, and then he ruins that by turning out to be a rapist as well as covering the requisite thief/murderer territory that comes with being a gangster.What does it do right? The cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli captures the gritty vibrancy of New York's Lower East Side, the glitz of the Prohibition era, and the melancholic decay of the 1960s. There is great attention to period detail, from costumes to production design, immersing the viewer in each era. Then there is that memorable score. As for the acting, De Niro shows the versatility that he always does, and James Woods as Noodles' best friend and gangster ally Max plays the part as ambitious and cunning. Plus Woods always injects just a little bit of crazy int his performances.What did it do wrong? Leone's last film has the same problem with editing that Scorsese has had with his later films. It's just too long and has lots of side stories about union bosses and strikes that add nothing to the narrative. Finally, there are a total of two rapes in this film, with one of them actually being played for laughs. Leone did this in ""Duck You Sucker"" and caused me to lose all sympathy for Rod Steiger's character as a result. Does Leone not get how such crimes are received in the United States?Overall this film actually transcends the gangster genre. It's not about family or the gangster lifestyle. It's about the passing of time, guilt/regret, memory, friendship and growing old. It's also just as much a mystery as it is a mafia movie, as there is much debate as to whether or not anything that happens in the 1968 segment is even real or is it a heroin induced dream of Noodles as he tries to forget his part in the death of his friends by getting doped up in an opium den. I'd say - You decide. It could go either way.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
How Should I Feel About This Movie?,"Oh, how to feel about this movie?I was mostly riveted by it, let's get that out of the way. It's gorgeous to look at with those Sergio Leone compositions, and gorgeous to listen to with that Ennio Morricone score. Like so many of Leone's films, it has a plaintive, nostalgic glow to it that makes you ache emotionally without even knowing exactly what you're aching for.And there's where I get conflicted with this movie. The character created by Robert De Niro is a repulsive human being. He murders, he rapes. The film cannot be forgiven for the way it handles rape. In one instance, the woman treats it like it was a naughty prank and comes back to fondle the rapist and his buddies in a scene played for laughs. In the other instance, the film at least has the decency to make it seem like something traumatic to the woman, but that woman is Elizabeth McGovern, who reappears later in the film and acts like she's full of regret over the relationship she and De Niro were denied, despite the fact that that relationship consisted almost entirely of him just stalking her and then taking her against her will in the back of a car when she tells him she's leaving for California to become an actress. We follow Robert De Niro both as a young man and as an older man looking back ruefully on his life, but we don't sense that he regrets any of the things he actually did. He just regrets what he lost. It's like he's sad that his days of murdering and raping without consequence are over, and that elegiac Sergio Leone tone left me wondering, what exactly are we supposed to be feeling nostalgic about?So I guess I understand both people who think this movie is something great and those who think it's reprehensible. I guess it's proof that things can be many things at once.Grade: A.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Last, butchered, unappreciated, work from one of the greatest...","... Directors of all time. Let's start with a story. Many years ago, when your grandfather was still a boy, a failed, beaten-down actor named Clint Eastwood packed up his horse and saddle (speaking metaphorically here), left Hollywood forever (or so he thought) and headed out to Europe to pick up cash wherever he could. He ended up doing a film in Italy for an almost-unknown director named Sergio Leone and an almost-unknown sound guy named Ennio Morricone. The film was (as history would later record) an ""Italian Western,"" that is, as the iconic western drama was all but disappearing in the US, it was being ""re-imagined"" by Italian writers and directors, and then filmed in Italy, using mainly Italian actors. On the set, Eastwood spoke in English and everyone else spoke in Italian. (Dubbing later fixed all that). Filming now over, Eastwood took his cash and left. Weeks later, in a bar in another part of Europe, he overheard mention that a certain film was the leading box office attraction on the continent. The name sounded familiar but, frankly, during production, a final name for the film he'd just done had not even been selected. He investigated. Yes, this was the film he had just completed, now titled A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. The rest is history. Sort of. Two sequels were done with Eastwood playing the same character. Monster hits.By this point the critics began to acknowledge not only Clint, but also the man behind the camera, Leone, who was one of the most promising directors of the era. HE DID THINGS WITH THE CAMERA THAT NO ONE HAS DONE BEFORE OR SINCE, especially his use of closeups, especially his ability to match powerful emotional orchestrals to key scenes. The fourth film in the series, done by Leone but by this time lacking Eastwood, was ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. (Eastwood meanwhile had returned to America as a major celebrity, formed his own production company, Malpaso, and over time became a director as well as the #1 box office star. Over the course of his career, Eastwood subtly voiced his distaste for Leone's work by scrupulously avoiding all Leone's trademark camera angles, even in his westerns!)Back to Leone. While he lent his name to a handful of oddball productions, the last passionate work he left behind as his legacy was this film. OMG. What a film. Showcasing not only Leone's talent behind the camera, but also his musical magic as well as his ability to tell a complex tale like no one before him. It was by and large produced in obscure locations in NA, and the performances of the players, especially James Woods, and also de Niro, could possibly rank even today as the best they have ever given. (Also a performance from a young and charismatic Jennifer Connolly that by itself is worth the price of the ticket)The film is magical. But here is the catch. Very few people have ever seen it. Even people who ""think"" they have seen it, really have not. The studio behind the film went berserk when they saw the length and, fearful of losing dollars when they could be changing reels and selling more tickets, they brought in a butcher to shorten it. Now maybe the new editor was not a butcher by trade, but he was sure one by disposition. The late Roger Ebert said that, in his career, this was the most abusive re-edit he had ever seen. The actual film, the one that Leone left, was not seen until years later when the director's version surfaced. It is astounding. It is magical. It is one of the best films ever made. It is a must see. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

Make sure you get the director's cut!,"Many people compare ""Once Upon a Time in America"" with ""The Godfather"". In my opinion these two movies can't be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don't compare a Picasso to Michelangelo's Sixteen Chapel either, do you?What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end.The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut.The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn't said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn't left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A wonderful epic that is really only about one man's regret - excellent,"Noodles returns to the New York of his youth in response to an invitation to come and meet.  His return is his first for half his life having fled New York to avoid being killed for ratting out his gangster friends.  His return is mysterious and he doesn't know why he has been summoned.  His return sparks memories of his childhood and adulthood growing up in the area with his friends and eventual business partners.A three and a half hour movie may not be everyone's idea of fun.  On the other hand, many people who see a running time over 180 minutes immediately assume it is an epic that must be `the greatest film ever made'. In this case the time is worth the effort, even if it a little luxurious and overlong.  The plot is too sweeping to go into detail, encompassing 30 years in the main part and a further 30 by way of suggestion.  Basically it comes down to Noodles memories of his life when he was growing up, up till the point we find him now, as an old man with little but those memories.  As a story this is moving and involving.  There are maybe too many lingering shots of Noodles staring into the distance but these don't feel as lazy as they have in other films.Noodles past and the misery of him now is involving enough, but the main thread is Noodle's past, both childhood and adulthood in crime and love. The sheer detail that must be covered is well done.  The film not only includes many major events but also minor things like the scene where the boy is tempted to eat a cream cake!  This mix is very rewarding and makes it feel a lot more detailed than it actually is.  The story is a real feel of several generations of crime and is very involving.The cast make the film and hold the attention during the scenes that are longer than they should be etc.  De Niro convinces as youth and bitter old man and holds the eye easily as both.  Woods is much better than usual even if his character is the same.  McGovern is good considering she has a minor role, but as an `old woman' she looks the same as she was when she was young.  Actors like Williams, Aiello, Forsythe, Hayden etc easily fill out the gangster etc roles without falling into cliché or caricature.  Just as rewarding are the child actors who carry the first hour of the film.  Not only do they actually look like the actors in question, but they also do a very good job.  There are some bum notes but they do mange the innocence of youth with the emotional basis for the rest of the film.The direction is excellent  both gritty streets but with an affectionate slant of Noodles' memories.  The direction is made almost perfect by the use of Ennio Morricone's score.  It is at once haunting but slightly warming and `Debra's theme' has become one of my favourite tunes.  The overall effect is one of a rich tapestry that eventually weaves into a very personal epic of regret and loss.An excellent film that deserves to be recognised as both one of the great crime epics but also a personal and moving film.",,Anonymous,Crime
A Profound Expression of Truth Regarding Friendship andBetrayal,"This film is a profound expression of truth regarding friendship and betrayal.  Noodles, played by Robert De Niro and Scott Tiler (during childhood), is a simple man and a thug with one credo: you can battle the entire world but you never betray a friend.  During the course of this film we experience various pieces of Noodles's life, from childhood, through young adulthood and old age. We learn what happens to his friends, his foes and the love of his life, Deborah.  The time span considered is long, including Noodles's childhood shortly after the turn of the century, through the prohibition era, and finally the 1960's.The film is about relationships; the many years Noodles spends away from his friends receive only a cursory mention. The film, like life and memories, unfolds slowly and reflectively. Sergio Leone's cuts are long and each scene is beautifully amplified my Ennio Morricone's haunting score.  The story is not told chronologically. Instead, the chapters of the story are slowly revealed like pieces of a great jigsaw puzzle. Each delicious piece might make us laugh, or cry, or smile, or feel shock.  But, as each piece falls into place, a mystery unfolds. When the final piece is revealed, the true essence of the story becomes clear and a sad and beautiful tapestry comes into view.This film is a true masterpiece, expressing a profound statement about friendship and betrayal, with fantastic acting, writing, directing and music.  There is a shortened, two-and-a-half-hour version of the film released that is a disaster.  It is like trying to understand a jigsaw puzzle with half of the pieces missing. The original four-hour film can be viewed and enjoyed several times and each time the viewer will see something new.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A masterpiece and an atrocity!,"This movie was a masterpiece. It ranks as one of the very best in film history, if not the best. At Cannes people yelled and screamed, couldn't believe just how good it was. The profound atrocity was a combination of two completely brainless acts, the first being Zack Stienberg's hatchet job for US release, supposedly requested by either Warner Bros or The Ladd Company (one blames the other now) and the second was the lack of anyone (and everyone)to post anything in this great film for Academy Award consideration, of which probably as many as 14 nominations and 4 sure- fire Oscars went down the toilet.These atrocities were perpretrated, I believe, with two reasons in mind, the first to preserve the dim hope of ""The Killing Fields"" (Daly & Semel's baby) of garnering any awards... and second, to try to boost up the non- foreign chances. Warner Bros knew just how good it was, that goes without saying. The problem was... they already had their share of cash cows and they wanted a real star- studded showpiece to point at. The small minds already had their showpiece but, alas, it was an ""eye- tallyan"" flick with a producer/director who didn't communicate well. The hatchet job was carefully planned, I believe... the so- called ""sneak preview"" was done in Canada and not well received, probably due to the fact that the sound system was over- amped and the film 'broke' 3 or 4 times during the showing, what a farce! The awards snub started with the GGs and carried right thru. What a myriad of stupid and utterly pointless decisions! Must have literally tore Leone's heart out when he learned what they had done.Morricone's score was a sure- thing Oscar, no question about it. DeNiro and maybe even Woods would have fought it out for best actor, Tuesday Weld as supporting actress, any one of 4 or 5 other supporting actors & actresses, most notably William Forsythe, cinematography, film editing, the list goes on & on... (best picture...Amadeus???? give me a break!!) Just what in the hell were they thinking?Saw it in a theater 20 years ago and then again on TV about 1998 and finally in its correct format(on DVD) about two years ago and again last week at a friend's house. Stirred up all those angry thoughts all over again... sorry about that, getting' old & crotchety.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Beautiful, elegaic storytelling","I decided, on Christmas Eve, to reacquaint myself with an old friend- Sergio Leone's heavyweight gangster epic, which I had previously watched in two sittings, 10 years previously, at Uni.I was rewarded with a movie of tremendous vision and creative style as well as emotional integrity. When you take an idiosyncratic, brilliant, stylish director like Leone, his composer counterpart, Morricone, and a cast including two of the foremost actors of their generation (de Niro and Woods) then you have an idea of the kind of quality this film has. In fact, the only gangster movie(s) I've seen that match it are the first two Godfathers (in fact Leone almost directed those too... now that would have been interesting).In contrast to earlier Leone Westerns, the characters are more fully developed- although the detachment of the characters in these movies made for a more rollercoaster, loose style of cinema, no one was ever going to win an award appearing in one, although they were all great movies.Although I could tell I was in a Leone movie almost from the beginning, what was different was the inner lives of the characters dictated the way the plot flowed in a pleasing way. I also think that the performance de Niro put in was the best of any film I've seen him in, and that includes any Scorcese picture. To make the audience actually care about a character who does such evil (including raping the woman he loves) is a towering achievement. The apparent effortlessness with which he achieves this is a mark of true greatness. Leone's style of filmmaking, with its long silences and pauses and (in this case) slow pace suit de Niro's style of acting perfectly. It's a real pity that they never had the chance to work together again.I think this a great film, and, at 3 3/4 hours, it kept me at least interested and often gripped all the way through. Why are Hollywood studios scared of movies like this? Some people out there love them.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A sprawling, deliberately paced, and generally a superbly crafted piece of work","It's been said that when one watches a ""spaghetti"" western (one of the ""Man with no name"" films with Clint Eastwood) filmmaker Sergio Leone's trademark cinema style and flair for clear storytelling is instantly recognizable. This is no truer than in his most ambitious effort, Once Upon a Time in America, in which his usage of close-ups, concise camera movement, sound transitions and syncs, and the sudden change in some scenes from tenderness to violence. And, he pulls it off without making the viewer feel dis-interested. Of course, it's hard to feel that way when watching the cast he has put together; even the child actors (one of which a young Jennifer Connelly as the young Deborah) are believable. Robert De Niro projects his subtitles like a pro, with his occasional outburst in the right place; James Woods gives one of his first great performances as Max; Elizabeth McGovern is the heart of the film; and Joe Pesci should've had more than just a one scene appearance, thought it's still good.It's a story of life-long friends, in the tradition of the Godfather movies with obvious differences, and the story cuts back and forth to Noodles (De Niro) in his old age returning from exile, looking back on his childhood in Brooklyn, his rise to power with his partners, and the twists come quite unexpectedly. The pace is slow, but not detrimental, and it gives the viewer time to let the emotions sink in. The story is also non-linear, and yet doesn't give away facts to the viewer- this is something that more than likely influenced Tarantino (and many others) in style. By the end, every detail that has mounted up makes the whole experience rather fulfilling, if not perfect. Finally, I'd like to point out the exceptional musical score. Ennio Morricone, as it says on this site, has scored over four hundred films in forty years, including Leone's movies. This would have to be, arguably, one of his ten best works- his score is equally lively, saddened, intense, and perhaps majestic for a gangster epic. Overall, it's filled with the same spirit Leone had in directing the picture, and it corresponds beautifully- there are some scenes in this film that would simply not work without the strings.

An operatic epic,"Once Upon a Time in America, which bookends Once Upon a Time in the West as director Sergio Leone's best work, is a powerhouse of a movie. A gangster epic told in a very different style than the standard of the genre, The Godfather, it is in some ways (at least to this viewer) even more emotionally compelling. Although the movie was sabotaged upon release by an edited studio version eliminating about 40% of its original length, the version now available for rental is thankfully the nearly 4 hour version intended by Leone.  The story is at essence a basic one about friendship among thieves, telling the story of a group of Jewish kids in New York near the turn of the century who grow up to become powerful and ruthless mobsters, while maintaining (or trying to) their bond with one another.  As was most famously done in the taxi scene between Rod Steiger and Marlon Brando in On The Waterfront, the movie again makes the point that bad people can have good aspects to them, such as loyalty, devotion, and even love. I think this movie includes one of Deniro's best roles, and far and away James Woods best film work. The score, by arguably the greatest movie composer of all time, Ennio Morricone, is incredibly haunting in its beauty and sadness (with no fewer than three separate themes that are breathtakingly beautiful).  The non-chronological manner in which the story is told results in a wonderfully effective narrative device:  the movie begins and ends with the same scene.  The first time you see the scene, it is a frantic jumble, without meaning or context, and you do not know why it is so important.  When the scene recurs at the end of the film, everything has become clear, and the scene has an incredible poignancy and sadness to it:  although it occurs in the middle of events chronologically, you realize that, in a real sense, life stopped at this point for one of the film's main characters.  There is no other event that matters anymore to him. This is not a simple movie, and it merits repeated viewings.  Indeed, in my view one cannot fully appreciate the greatness of the film until the second viewing, when the full story is known, and the  events of the film resonate with knowledge of where they ultimately, and tragically, lead.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Mesmerizing and haunting tale of love, greed, regret, betrayal and revenge","This is, for me, one of the finest examples of cinematic art. It isn't a simple, cut-n-dried 90 minute little package that gets wrapped up with a pretty bow at the end. You get pulled in by the enigmatic opening that unwinds the threads of the story to be found later. For many people having half an hour of purely visual story telling, of stories that are only mysteries at that point, before anything becomes truly linear is difficult to follow and discourages to many people. Our own memories are only snippets that only become linear as we concentrate on scenes from our lives. Once Upon a Time in America is like that as we follow Noodles through the `significant' part of his life - the times that formed him. When the story actually starts, we meet the girl that he always loved but could never have.David `Noodles' Aaronson (DeNiro) was a kid on the very mean streets of Brooklyn when organized crime was born in America and he grew into and out of it. That's the simplest synopsis of the plot. The reality is that this isn't a movie about gangsters. Being a gangster is the easiest way for Noodles to survive and get ahead, but it also alienates and ruins his one love. Whenever he is close to giving himself to Deborah he always gets pulled back into the gang, in some form or another.DeNiro's portrayal is of a gangster, through and through, who also has a conscience that, while not preventing him from being a ruthless killer, rules his life with regret, remorse and guilt. Leone takes a bit of poet/historic license by showing the Brooklyn Bridge being built in the background (the bridge had been built 40 years before), but it symbolizes Noodles' own growth. When the bridge is just pilings and incomplete towers, Noodles is just forming his future. By the time the bridge is complete, Noodles is nothing but a gangster and the bridge is majestic. When he returns 35 years later our view of the bridge is from under a freeway -- the world has moved along, but the bridge and Noodles are just as they were.The length: If you're looking for a brief distraction that you'll barely remember 30 minutes later, this isn't the movie for you. However, if you are prepared and able to be undistributed for the nearly 4 hours that this film uses to compress a lifetime -- you will be rewarded with many facets of thought and examination.",,Anonymous,Crime
A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Leone's magnum opus and a testament to the free spirit of Art,"In order to cater to their everlasting lust for making money, the movie production studios have always endorsed the motto of quid pro quo – ""A favor in return of another"". Every movie-maker capable enough to be called an auteur—by the virtue of his knack for eccentricity and novelty—has had to borne the brunt of this naked opportunism: be it D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Orson Welles or Stanley Kubrick. Sergio Leone too had to pay collaterally by having to make five Westerns in order to get funding for his dream project, Once Upon a time in America (OUTA). OUTA is a masterpiece of epic proportions and is consummate on almost every level. The uniqueness of the movie is such that it can be looked upon from various angles with each perspective adding immensely to movie's substance and profundity. The movie not only transcends genres by making simultaneous forays into the realms of Crime, Drama, Mystery, Suspense and Fantasy, but also crosses on several occasions the fine line that separates Dream from Reality.At the beginning of his career, Leone got widely proclaimed as a master of technique and style as he added new dimensions to cinematography and screenplay. Leone's directorial debut was 'A Fistful of dollars'. Movie's success was marred when Akira Kurosawa sued the production house for plagiarizing Yojimbo. Leone bounced back with 'For a Few More Dollars'. He single-handedly reinvented the Western genre by providing a completely different perspective to the Old West, which was hitherto portrayed as the battle ground for the epic battle of virtue versus vice in the backdrop of chivalry and machismo. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', Leone perpetuated what would become his trademark: Spaghetti Western. Leone's distinctive style included juxtapositions, super close- ups, long continuous shots, and the rotating camera shots. Leone's collaboration with master-composer Ennio Morricone gave cinema some of its most mellifluous compositions. Once Upon a Time in the West elevated Leone from the position of a showman to a serious movie-maker—an auteur capable of much profound works. Leone refused a multitude of projects, including the opportunity to direct 'The Godfather', in a bid to realize his dream project.OUTA is an epic crime saga based on the lives of Jewish gangsters from their humble childhood in the ghettos of New York to their rise in world of organized crime. 'Noodles', 'Patsy', 'Cockeye', and little Dominic struggle as street kids in the East Side of Manhattan in the early 1920s. They work for 'Bugsy', a local gangster, until they meet 'Max' and decide to start an independent operation, triggering a series of incidents which changes their lives for ever. Robert De Niro as 'Noodles' gives one of the most subtle performances of his career. James Woods is chillingly menacing as 'Max'. Young 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly as 'Deborah' serves as a pulchritudinous delight for the sour eyes, and I say this as a testament to her ethereal, nymphean charm that was evident even at such a tender age. The rest of the cast gives a great support to the actors in lead with special mention of Elizabeth McGovern, James Hayden and Joe Pesci. The music is composed by Leone's long-time collaborator Ennio Morricone, who once again works his magic by creating music that is so plaintively divine that even Mozart would be proud of it.The film poignantly explores the themes of love, lust, friendship, greed, betrayal and loss of innocence in the backdrop of the 20th century America. For the European release, Leone cut down his original version to 229 minutes to appease the distributors. However, for the US release, OUTA was ignominiously edited down to 139 minutes by the muddle-headed studio personnel against the director's wishes. In this short version, the flashback narrative was omitted as the scenes were put back in the chronological order. Many of the movie's most beautiful shots are not present in the shorter version, including the nigh magical sequence in which time-switching is indicated by the conjuration of a Frisbee. Movie's abysmal show in the US is attributed to this sabotage. Leone was reportedly heartbroken by the American cut, and never made another film again.The dreamlike screenplay of OUTA gives it a lyrical, almost hypnotic feel. OUTA is a tapestry of highly complex mesh work: the story depicts the lives of same individuals across three different timelines. The time-switching techniques used in the movie are so effective that the switching seems absolutely seem-less. The mystical ringing tone that the viewer gets to hear in the beginning of the movie provides a great subterfuge in unison with the dream-like finale, and adds surrealistic elements to the movie by raising doubts that the events depicted in the movie could well have been a part of a drug-induced dream that Noodles would have been experiencing under the hypnotic effect of opium. The movie has a multitude of unforgettable moments, which can be cherished again and again with the same levels of indulgence. The sequence in which little Dominic—caught between the want to satiate his newly attained puberty and the fundamental urges—buys a pastry to charm a neighborhood girl, but succumbs to the universal temptation and ends up eating it himself is pure gold. The scene which depicts Robert De Niro molesting his childhood love represents cinema at its most macabre. The make-up, set designing and costume designing are all top- notch. The make-up artists have gone about their business with such meticulousness that the actors seem to genuinely represent their character's age in each era.Overall, OUTA is a testament to Sergio Leone's dedication to the free spirit of Art. It succeeds at multiple levels and makes the viewer go through an entire gamut of emotions, keeping him engaged throughout. It is sanguinary and is surfeited with blood-cuddling violence that makes it unsuitable for the weak-hearted. OUTA, however, is as a must for the enthusiasts of the genre and the cineastes worldwide. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Epic,"Leone's beautiful vision met with an epic story to create one of the most beautiful movies of all time. Four hours long but time melts away as you are transported into New York. In a movie where the importance of time is stressed, and how it should not be wasted, it is pleasing that this considerably long movie does not waste, rather enhance your time. Instead of regretting lost time we are instead left exhilarated and wondering. Performances all-round are fantastic right from the child performances, 'Noodles, I slipped' to the aged De Niro with a look in his eye that he has seen it all before. His weariness is astonishingly realistic and applause should be directed at De Niro and his method. A true masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Ignore the bad reviews, I was once one of those","You know what, I have to eat humble pie here because once upon a time, when I first saw this film as a young adult I didn't think much of it.I'd have reviewed it saying it was overly long, not enough action and a bit boring.How times have changed! Where once I'd have rated Goodfellas was the better film I now most definitely think otherwise. Don't get me wrong GF is a great film but it's not one of the greats, I think Goodfellas is more of a quick gangster fix, definitely the first of a modern breed of blunt instrument Gangland films, ones which are full of brash characters, lots of gruesome killing and a hit parade soundtrack.Once upon a time in America is the opposite, a carefully crafted and honed (near) masterpiece of cinematic character storytelling. You feel part of what you're watching, transported back to a different era. Just half a step behind The Godfather in my estimation.This is a joy to watch again and no doubt I'll watch it many more times. Ignore the negative reviews stating it's boring, no doubt mainly Millennials with the attention span of a Gnat.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"I watched...I rewound and rewached. An 8.4, it ain't.","Perusing Netflix, I recognized this movie title and the names Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone; I particularly enjoyed the music of Cinema Paradiso, also the work of Morricone. The line-up of actors pulled me right in, but to what? After watching for a little while, I looked up the movie and noted how 10 hours of film were sliced and diced to a disastrous 2h 19m for US release, whereas the 3h 49m release was the one to make everything right. Well, at least I had that going for me.At the end, it was still a disappointment. A movie that forces you to pay fanatic attention to detail to ""get it"" is not the product of good direction. It is the result of a riding on one's own name to varnish a deeply flawed product as ""art."" Even at 3h 49m, continuity suffered. The flashback method of story telling was clumsy and not handled nearly as smoothly as in its inspiration, Godfather II. The fact that these were kids from a Jewish neighborhood was inconsequential. Things happen in the movie often for no apparent reason and go nowhere, the opening 10 or 15 minutes being a prime example. Even the music of Ennio Morricone seems worn out by the end, as the same theme repeats throughout scenes where it seems misplaced or simply gets in the way.You might will dismiss this review as the ramblings of someone who isn't sophisticated enough to realize what a masterpiece this really is. My guess is there is a coherent, thought-provoking story somewhere among the frames that made it to the screen and what was left on the cutting room floor. This still isn't it. To suggest that less than a point separates this move from The Godfather I just doesn't pass the sniff test.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Leone's ""Godfather"" Version, And About As Good","This Godfather-type film was done by Sergio Leone, of spaghetti-western fame, so you know you will see and experience several of his trademarks. Namely: (1) a lot of facial closeups; (2) some slow-motion or slow-moving dramatic scenes; (3) good overall photography and (4) a unique soundtrack.The period sets here are magnificent. You get a real feel of the time, whether it's 1910, 1933 or 1967. The colors are awash in blacks, browns and grays and the DVD brings all these out very well, especially considering the film is over 20 years old.Despite some of Leone's slow moments, this is a fascinating film to watch for the story, too. There are numerous memorable scenes, some of them involving some downright shocking violence, even for today's movies. However, the amount of violence is less than what you see today.The movie also sports an interesting twist near the end involving the two major characters, played by Robert De Niro and James Woods. The story is not always clear, either, so be prepared to be possibly confused about a few things....at least on the first viewing. Confused or not, this film always is fascinating to view, especially with intense actors such as the two men just mentioned, along with Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Joe Pecsi, Burt Young, Treat Williams and more.The child actors in here take up almost half the movie and are excellent. What an injustice they don't receive any publicity for their acting, especially the kids who played De Niro and Woods as youngsters. One of the girls has become a famous adult actress: Jennifer Connelly. She was 12 years old in this film and was already alluring.This is Godfather-type crime movie that ranks right up there with that famous film, not taking a back seat to it at all.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Stylistic epic let down by script and characterisation,"As a Sergio Leone fan, this 4 hour american crime saga with the eminent crime cast should have created an all time classic, taking its place in the new world, 20th century Hollywood cannon.Sadly - what should have been a dead cert, meanders its way into a confused, unrealistic tale of unsympathetic characters with next to no thematic development. A hard edged upbringing interspersed with bizarre episodes involving any and all female roles looks like Direction by Committee, and one bent on adolescent self-gratification and misogynist quota/ box ticking.Leone should have cut the script, tightly edited, cut the artificially inserted, gratuitous episodes, mapped character arcs, and found something (such as dramatic tension of gang members avoiding their personal demise) to drive the film on. Scorsese, De Palma or Coppola all understood this - sad to see such a missed opportunity from Leone.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Leone's ultimate film,"Sergio Leone's films are all love letters to America, the American dreams of an Italian who grew up at the movies, who apprenticed with Wyler, and Aldrich, signed himself Bob Robertson, and gave us Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Charles Bronson as we know them.  Sadly, America didn't always repay the compliment.  Leone's were ""spaghetti westerns"", money makers to be sure, but deemed  disrespectful of the great tradition of Ford, Walsh and Hathaway. Many critics and Holllywood insiders called his earlier Eastwood films cynical and violent bottom-line commercial exploitation.  By the time that they caught on to Leone's genuine popular appeal, the director had already moved on.  And, his Once Upon a Time in the West was damned as pretentious, bloated, self-indulgent: an art film disguised as a Western, the Heaven's Gate of its day. That film's canny blend of pop appeal and pure cinematic genius gradually dawned on the powers that be (or were), and helped give rise to the renaissance of American filmmaking in the early seventies. It is worth noting that The Godfather could have been made by Leone, had he chosen. Leone had been pitching a gangster film that would encompass generations, for a generation or two, himself.  Rather than do the Puzo version finally thrown back at him, he waited an eternity, and finally realized this, his last finished project.  That ellipse of a decade or so between conception and completed movie is paralleled in the film, itself, by Robert De Niro's (""Noodles'"") opium dream of the  American twentieth century, its promises, and betrayals.  Naturally, Leone was betrayed, once again, himself, by America, and this truly amazing film, with its densely multi-layered, overlapping flashback structure was butchered upon its release, becoming a linear-plotted sub-Godfather knockoff in the process. Luckily, the critics had grown up enough in the meantime to finally get a glimmering of what Leone was up to, and demand restitution.  Very few saw it properly in theaters, but the video version respects the director's intentions, more or less.  Ironically, Leone had foreseen television screen aspect ratios as determining home viewing of the future, and abbreviated his usual wide screen format for this movie, so this most troubled last project was the first released on video to most properly  resemble the true cinematic experience.  For diehard fans of the Eastwood westerns impatient with this at first, watch those movies till you want and need more.  This will eventually get to you.  For art film fanatics who don't get the earlier Leones, travel in the reverse direction, and you will be pleasantly surprised.  This is the movie that Leone spent a decade conceiving. It will deliver for decades of viewing to come.",,Anonymous,Crime
A cold masterpiece to warm your heart.,"This is one of the greatest stories ever told. Every time I see this wonderful movie I enjoy its special blend of melancholic romanticism and bitter, ruthless violence.Once upon a Time in America is neither fast-paced nor impeccably plotted, and it doesn't make you feel good, right then and there. The hero wins nothing, only grows old. This movie isn't easy to love. You see it once and you start asking yourself why Noodles doesn't make it back to New York before the late Sixties. How come he doesn't care about his money enough to track down his enemies. If it's really possible never to hear about Deborah becoming a famous actress and a star. These are the plot's shortcomings, the creases that should be ironed out. On the other hand, some character contradictions can be explained. You know Noodles dug a deep hole and buried himself in it for 35 years, because he tells you and you also get it from the tone of his voice and the way he moves. Then you see him young again, rejected by the only woman he's passionately loved. His woman, as Max still calls her in their final conversation. You see Noodles lose the friends who shaped his entire world and his very existence, and bear that responsibility upon his shoulders. He's alone and weary. He feels he can't shake off his ghosts with a gun in his hand, having had his fill of killing.Max always surprises Noodles. He soon learns what makes him tick and is secretly in competition with his partner in crime. Max's feelings haven't been straightforward since the day the two met. He terribly needs to put his life as a gangster behind him, to find success in the legitimate world. On the contrary, Noodles couldn't care less about all that. Our romantic hero is reasonably happy with what he's got or, better yet, he doesn't think there's a lot more out there for him to take. He's only aware that he can't have Deborah, the girl who never ages in his loving eyes. Nothing would ease that pain. Then he's cheated out of the money by Max, the sad, sad traitor. When the two guys meet for the last time, it's hard to say which one is the loser. Max has suffered more. He's horribly missed his old friend and now needs to show him his guilt and accept his penance. At that point, though, Noodles cannot be forced to rewrite his life history. He doesn't believe another version of the truth will help him. ""We're old men, Senator Bailey, all we have is our memories. If we lose that, we'll have nothing left.""We just learned a hard lesson. As our past poisons our present, truth doesn't have roots on firm ground. We'll live with sorrow and there's not a lot we can do about it. Are we ready to accept it?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Not simply the greatest of gangster movies,but one of the greatest movies ever,a multi-layered,melancholic masterpiece that demands repeated viewings","Once Upon A Time In America is the crowning achievement of director Sergio Leone. It's nearly four hours long,and demands total concentration from beginning to end. However,those willing to submit will find it more than worth it.Reminiscent at times of some very old gangster films such as The Roaring Twenties,one will find almost every gangster movie cliché one can find-one can imagine Leone half remembering bits and pieces from films he saw as a youth. However,he never glamourises his protagonists-he may dare us to like Robert De Niro's 'Noodles'-a murderous thug and rapist who always seems to make the wrong decisions-but that's different from glamourising him. The notorious rape scene is all the more hard to watch because its painful to watch Noodles try to destroy himself and his girlfriend by going through with it.What really makes this film different is it's overwhelming melancholy. Leone's favourite loyalty/betrayal theme is there,but the film is also a study of memory,of a lost soul coming to terms with his past. Therefore,starting in mid-plot in the 1930s,than flashing back and forth in time,was the right choice {if initially confusing!}. This is the culmination of Leone's increasing interest in the flashback structure-think especially of the parallel story told in A Fistful of Dynamite's flashbacks.There is action,but it's mostly quick and brutal,and there is also humour,such as a very funny scene set to Rossini's Thieving Magpie where the gangsters are loose in a hospital filled with babies. However,the broody,melancholic tone never really goes away,and towards the end,the film grinds to a virtual halt. Be warned,there is no action climax,just a series of somewhat oblique dialogue scenes and revelations.The expected Leone flamboyancy is hardly to be found,but the film still often soars most when dialogue is kept to a minimum and Ennio Morricone's gorgeous music takes over. Some of the most brilliant scenes just consist of Noodles seeing and reflecting. In one especially effective and poignant scene near the end,an old Noodles is leaving his love Deborah as her achingly sad theme plays,and he sees her son,who is the spitting image of,well,I try to avoid spoilers! As the music changes into the still sad but more majestic main theme,the camera slowly zooms,as it often does,into Noodles' sad eyes. We go to what is initially a blur,until we realise it's curtains. The person who holds the key to all this appears,like a ghost,through the curtains and goes onto a balcony,from where he sees the same 'son' with a girlfriend. Sheer brilliance,and not a gun in sight!Of course De Niro is great,but he's obviously very restrained and reflective. It's James Woods who really dominates,so dynamic here,this should have made him a big star. One must also mention Tonni Delli Colli,who photographs three time periods with slightly different hues but still subtly.Leone's original cut was five hours and if you want to be picky there are holes in the plot. Leone leaves a great many things ambiguous,but shouldn't all great art ask questions? Once Upon A Time In America is not necessarily easy viewing,but it IS great art,the final statement of one of the best filmmakers of all time.",,Anonymous,Crime

Extraordinary crime drama,"I have seen many movies, good and bad. One thing for certain, Once Upon a Time in America is more than good. It is amazing, a true milestone in the crime drama genre. The cinematography, images, scenery and locations are all superb and quite sweeping, while Ennio Morricone's score ranks up there with his very best. While the film clocks in at nearly four hours long, it never feels boring to me while the pace is quite elegiac everything else just compels you. I will admit, this is another film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it.Sergio Leone's direction is also superb, the story is always compelling and rich and the dialogue is very thought-provoking. The characters are wonderful if different. Unlike The Godfather(not a bad thing by the way), Once Upon a Time in America doesn't make you feel sympathy for its characters, these characters are actually quite nasty people but the way they are written and acted makes them compelling too. The two rape scenes are very shocking and perhaps brutal, but again that's no flaw in any way, because this slant on crime and the like is quite realistic if you put it in perspective.The acting is another strong asset. Robert DeNiro and James Woods, both are great actors, and both give brilliant performances. So overall, extraordinary, not only of its genre but of film full-stop. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Sergio Leone's grand ambition.,"After so many years of westerns, Sergio Leone made ""Once Upon a Time in America"", about several friends forced to abandon their loyalty as they age. This is one of those movies that's too hard to simply describe; you really have to see it to understand it. And you may be disappointed if you expect something exactly like ""The Godfather""; they are gangsters, but they're Jewish, so that changes things a little.If absolutely nothing else, this disproves the notion that we have nowadays that historical epics are always pieces of drudgery (blame ""Alexander"" for that stereotype). ""OUATIA"" is the sort of movie that could only star people like Robert DeNiro. It also stars James Woods, Joe Pesci, Elizabeth McGovern, Treat Williams, and Jennifer Connelly (in her debut), and they all do a great job. This movie is a masterpiece in every way.

Once a street teenager,"Years later, the desperate noodles returned to New York. In the bar of an old friend, loyal and foolish, he slowly asked him: ""How have you lived in these 35 years?"" Quietly answered: ""I just go to bed every morning."" It's hard to say a word, full of vicissitudes. His temples were covered with white hair. He was no longer a gangster on the street, and he was no longer a gangster in the sky. He was just a calm, stumbling old man. He had nothing but memories ...His life was about several brothers who were born and died, and a beautiful girl; about friendship and dreams, about youth and love, and about loyalty and betrayal. In those years, when a person was silently displaced and traveled far away, what was he holding in his heart? Is it the betrayal of the ringing phone reminder after years? Is it a girl who is ignorant of the angelic dance peeping through the teenager's doorway?
Years later, he finally realized that he had been guilty for 35 years, which was originally pure loyalty and friendship; the brother he devoted to and maintained for life had deceived him for 35 years.There is nothing new under the sun, and the key to good movies lies in the way they tell stories. The yellowish color of the film seems to be covered with a layer of mist, so that each lens is like an old yellowed picture; the high and distant pan flute is awkward. The music and the plot blended together to complement each other, and several transitions were made to happen. In the four-hour movie, the plot is clear when you see the second pass.

Friendship,"I have read several comments on this film across the internet ""Best movie on prohibition"" ""Comparable only to Godfather"". I believe the movie is really about friendship and sacrifice. What is remarkable about this film is not only the screenplay but the remarkable ability of director Sergio Leone to create three movies in one with disregard to any chronological sequence of events. I have seen the movie two times in one week and I still have to watch it over a couple of times to fully understand the message.The most dramatic part of the movie is towards the end, when Noodles decides to call the police hoping that Max would be arrested and therefore give up his plan to rob the Federal Reserve Bank, a complete suicidal act. Upon his call the police comes and his friends are killed, than Eve, his girlfriend is murdered by the police.The movie begins in 1933 and ends with the same scene, with Noodles played by de Niro smoking opium on the bed at the Chinese place. This led a number of critics to the conclusion that actually Noodles is fantasizing about his future and I think this interpretation is correct. His devilish smile at the end of the movie is probably one of the most enigmatic pieces in filmography. Why is he smiling about? He just called the police and gave-in his friends who died in a shootout. is he smiling because everything is over, like some critics argue? I don't think so. He didn't seem unhappy up to this point, or at least not that desperate to explain such an emotion. Is it because he failed? I think this could be a possible answer. He was telling Fat Moe"" You can always tell winners and losers"" and he thought himself a loser. So the hysterical smile can be connected to a resignation in face of his fate. Logically, the movie should end in 1968. In a way or another. But it ends, strangely in 1933 with Noodles on a dose of opium and with a mysterious smile on his face. I think he dies that night along with his friends, the rest being just a premonition of what would happen if he stayed alive. The fact that Max survives in his fantasy is only one more reason to see it as a fantasy. Max was more than a friend, they seemed connected in life and death and the fact that Noodles was seeing him again in 1968 is just a projection of this close relationship, his brain refusing to accept that he practically murdered his best friend along with his other two childhood friends and his girlfriend Eve.The fact is even more dramatic and striking as you see the friendship of these boys starting in a harsh neighbourhood in the 20s and you see them sticking together ten years later. Noodles tries to save them but instead he kills them. His smile is only an ironical resignation of his failure. In his premonition, he meets Fat Moe once again in 1968 and at a point Moe says: ""I would have bet everything on you"" ""You would have lost"" comes the reply from Noodles. This is the essence of the movie...and it is a true masterpiece",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Reflections on a turbulent life,"Stylish, perceptive and violent crime drama from director Sergio Leone, an epic-scaled adaptation of the book ""The Hoods"" by Herschel Goldberg (aka Harry Grey) about the lives of four gangsters in the years 1921, 1933 and 1968. Former street kids from the Jewish ghettos of Manhattan's lower East Side graduate from petty crimes and bootlegging to robbery and rape, to providing muscle for a union boss. Initially crippled by the film company's decision to hack the U.S. release print down to 2 hours and 15 minutes (the current extended director's cut runs 4 hours and 18 minutes), ""Once Upon a Time in America"" took many years to garner its now-sterling reputation among admirers of the gangster genre. Still, even in its mammoth original state, the wan subplots involving the ladies (Elizabeth McGovern as an actress and Tuesday Weld as a lascivious moll)--and a penchant for vulgarity and the exploitation of women in general--lessens the overall impact of the tale. The art direction, the score (from Ennio Morricone), the cinematography (by Tonino Delli Colli) and Leone's rhythm are each florid and outstanding in their individual respects, while the performances by Robert De Niro and James Woods (and, in a smaller dimension, Joe Pesci) are dynamic. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
disappointing,"Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (C'era una volta l'america) is often hailed as a masterpiece of epic storytelling, but beneath its sprawling runtime and lavish production design lies a film that struggles to justify its ambition. While undeniably ambitious, the movie's flaws in pacing, characterization, and thematic coherence overshadow its artistic merits, leaving it more of a slog than the gripping crime epic it aims to be.At nearly four hours, the film's runtime is an endurance test. Leone's decision to tell the story non-linearly, jumping across decades, feels more confusing than compelling. While nonlinear storytelling can add intrigue, here it dilutes the narrative momentum, making the film feel unnecessarily disjointed and cumbersome. Many scenes drag on for far too long, testing the audience's patience and diluting the emotional impact.One of the film's most glaring issues is its depiction of women. Female characters are either relegated to stereotypes-mothers, temptresses, or victims-or exist solely to serve the male characters' arcs. The portrayal of violence against women, particularly the graphic and exploitative scenes of sexual assault, feels gratuitous and undermines the film's supposed depth. These moments aren't explored with the gravity they deserve, leaving a sour taste that detracts from the story.While Robert De Niro delivers a solid performance as Noodles, his character-and the relationships he forms-lacks emotional complexity. The supposed friendship and betrayals between Noodles and his gang never feel fully fleshed out, leaving their interactions cold and unconvincing. Moments that are meant to be poignant, like the tragic ending, fall flat because the film fails to create a meaningful connection with its characters.The film attempts to tackle a multitude of themes-loyalty, regret, the passage of time, and the dark side of the American Dream-but it spreads itself too thin. Leone touches on these ideas without delving deeply enough into any of them, leaving the film feeling thematically unfocused. Instead of a profound exploration of morality or memory, we're left with a collection of loosely connected ideas that never fully coalesce.While the cinematography and production design are undeniably stunning, the film often feels like it prioritizes visuals over storytelling. Beautifully framed shots and Ennio Morricone's haunting score can't compensate for the lack of emotional resonance and narrative drive. The result is a movie that feels hollow, more concerned with its aesthetic than its substance.Once Upon a Time in America is a technically impressive but deeply flawed film. Its sprawling ambition and visual grandeur are undone by self-indulgent pacing, shallow character development, and problematic thematic elements. While it remains a landmark in Leone's career, it's far from the masterpiece it's often made out to be. For all its cinematic flair, the film fails to deliver a compelling or cohesive story, leaving audiences exhausted rather than inspired.",,Anonymous,Crime
Complex and Gripping.  The Definitive Gangster Movie,"This is an exceptional movie.  The progression throughout the lives of these people makes for a compelling, well-written movie.

This might be the best movie ever.,"Of course it's very hard to make up the minds of someone else. That's why there are always some rough discussions being held about the rating of a movie. Everyone has a personal opinion, and you have to respect that. Besides that it IS possible to rate a movie on technical aspects. You may not like a film, but in a good movie there are always things you do like.Once upon a time in America is a fantastic movie. At least that's my opinion. The story is fantastic, because you're following three different threads, which in a way has much to do with each other. The Godfather Part II, another favorite of mine, tried to amuse the audience with two threads, and it succeeded very well. The huge difference of the Godfather II is it's speed, it's rhythm. I know a couple of people that don't like it, and that's because it's too slow. But not by far as slow as Once upon a time in America. That's probably one of the main reasons it's not being loved as much as other great films.You have to like Leone's style, but his Westerns are admired, although they're very slow too. But in a way I think people didn't expect it in a Mafia film, and did in a Western. Leone plays with switching to another storyline in this movie, and he does a fantastic job. The way some remarkable objects (the missing brick, the wall at the station) are used to remark a flashback is extraordinary.Another good aspect of Leone is that his scores are composed by Ennio Morricone since A Fistful of Dollars. Good music is the thing that gives a movie more weight, and makes you remember it. And again in Once upon a time in America Morricone succeeded compose one of the best scores ever made for a movie.Unfortunately this movie was way too long for theaters, so they made the biggest mistake possible. Instead of dividing it in two pieces, they deleted an amazing amount of scenes, what raped this movie. The latest DVD release will hopefully give some of it's beauty back, because this movie is a masterpiece. The only movie I've seen that could compare with this is The Godfather Part II, in style and supremacy. If you don't like slow movies, it's a pity, because a movie like this will not be made anymore. And perhaps that's good, as almost every succeeded movie has an equivalent or remake. Once upon a time in America still is a unique performance.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"One of the few films to boast a near 4 hour running time, yet not to feel a moment of it...","This film is an amazing cinematic experience. Sergio Leones final film is in my opinion, also his best. The story is so deep, and so rich. The themes, love, friendship, betrayal, morality, memory, life, etc... are so poignant and universal that it is hard not to relate to the characters and situations in this film at least in some way. All the performances are exceptional, James Woods being the highlight in my opinion. I have watched this film three times now, and I plan on re-visiting it even more in the future, as I now own the DVD. To describe this film it is hard to know where to start, as the story is told almost completely out of chronological order; it is a film which literally requires you to watch it more than once. Basically, it is a film about the life of a man, played by Robert De Niro, from his boyhood, right through to his old age, and about the friends and enemies he makes, and all the major issues he encounters. But more specifically, it is about his relationship with one main friend, the adult part of whom is played by James Woods. I can't think what else to say but to recommend this powerful tale to you as strongly as possible, and to wish you several equally enthralling viewings of it!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sergio Leone's total masterpiece that makes a strong case for best film ever.,"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a total masterpiece and one of those films that is well-crafted in every possible department. The storyline is complex yet masterful, the screenplay is extremely well-done, the direction by Sergio Leone is top-notch, as well as the cinematography. What's more is that the music by the legendary Ennio Morricone is arguably the greatest in movie history, plus the editing is superb.For the superb editing, that is for the 229-minute European Director's Cut (which I own on both DVD and Blu-ray) and the 251-minute Restored Director's Cut (which I only own on Blu-ray), not the shortened, chronological-ordered American version that's 2½ hours long. The shortened American cut was a box office bust when it was first released in the U.S. in 1984, whereas the European Director's Cut was a big hit overseas in the same year, especially at the Cannes Film Festival. I've never seen the shortened American cut, but from what I've heard, it's a sham! Therefore, I don't think I'll ever watch that version, because it's impossible to find it these days. Despite the film's modern critical acclaim, the original shortened American release was panned by critics and audiences, plus it didn't receive any Academy Award nominations. If the shortened American cut hadn't existed at all, I suppose ""Once Upon a Time in America"" would've been nominated for some Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director (Sergio Leone), and Best Original Score (Ennio Morricone).Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" is regarded as the best film of the 1980s, but I pick this film as the best of that decade, with ""Raging Bull"" ranking in second place. Set in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1960s in non-chronological order, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" has its themes of life, love, memories, opium dreams, regret, greed, friendship, betrayal, revenge, and the rise and fall of a group of four Jewish gangsters from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York. Moreover, it has an excellent ensemble cast consisting of Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Treat Williams, Tuesday Weld, William Forsythe, James Hayden, Danny Aiello, and, of course, the very young Jennifer Connelly.I really love watching some gangster flicks, including ""The Godfather"", ""The Godfather: Part II"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Scarface"" (Al Pacino version), plus Sergio Leone movies, including ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", but ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is the best and my favorite, plus it never gets old. It's one of those films that is hard work and not for children to watch, because of the R-rating, but ultimately a very rewarding experience and an epic gangster tour de force.Regardless if I like the European Director's Cut or the Restored Director's Cut better, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" holds a special place in my heart and makes a strong case for the best and my favorite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is NOT a gangster movie,"This is NOT a gangster movie. This movie is about love, friendship, childhood, nostalgia, loyalty and betrayal, and about how good or bad decisions determine our success or failure in love/life. And YES, all this in the context of a group of friends and Gangsters of the 20/30's.Hence, it can't be compared with classic gangster films such as the Godfather or Goodfellas. It won't have the same amount of action of such movies, because OUATIA is not about that. The Gangster mood is just an attrezzo used to explain a really sad story (the life of the protagonist), full of good memories and success, but with an unfortunate -and too early- ending.For those rating 1 and 2..., they were probably looking for a typical gangster movie, with plenty of shots, blood, gangs fighting, etc, etc, and they probably didn't realize that the movie is not about that. Otherwise they're just offended haters and depraved after seeing some female nudity.If only looking at the graphic aspects, the film is a masterpiece. Every each frame is meticulously and thoroughly thought. The deliberate extremely slow pace of the entire movie is needed to transmit all the passion and drama.

"Belongs in the ""Greats"" list of film-making","One of my favourite films of all time! This is one of those films that changes the way you view movies. The characters are profound, both in youth and in adulthood, and so well developed, the storyline so complex, and yet simple; this is the kind of film you can come back to, time and time again -- and you really will see something different, something new, each time you view it. (The fact that there is more than one version of this incredible film, adds to its complexity. There are different scenes in the short version, that are not in the long version, so it is beneficial to see both.)IMDb lists two running times, but I believe I've seen at least three versions: one a 5 hour version in French in the middle of the night! After viewing the long version, presumably the Director's Cut, I was particularly confused. I re-viewed another version, a shorter one, some time later, and finally understood the ending. While I love Mr. Leone's version (with his work I tend to feel the longer, the better) I found I didn't 'get' the ending until I saw the 'chopped version'. Needless to say, I've seen the movie many times through the 80s and 90s, first in the theatre, thank goodness, and later on television.I don't want to imply that the understanding of this film is a cumbersome task. I cherish films that make me think of them long after the final credits have rolled. The director weaves a tapestry, where we see some of his intentions easily. Others times, we move in closer, or view the piece from a different perspective. His talent allows us to believe we're seeing something 'new'. That's partly because we ourselves change over the years, and see things differently as we grow in our own experiences, but credit is also due the film-maker, who pulls us out of our reality and totally immerses us in his story.I have only to hear the score of this film, and my mind carries me back to New York at the turn of the LAST century ... I see the texture of the bricks, I recall the stunning beauty of both actresses who played the character Deborah Gelly, I see again the cream cake that was even better than the hope of sex, for one of the adolescent boys ... a scene that tells us there is still a child, a hungry child, in this young thug apprenticing to be a man and a gangster.I don't want to imply that it's a difficult movie to understand; just that there are so many levels, so many interpretations, each compelling and intriguing. Most movies of this length would deter many from seeing it, I'm sure. But never once did I feel that this film was 'too long'; I was never even aware of time passing. I would happily sit through four-hour films if they were as well made as Mr. Leone's. (Sadly, there are few of his calibre.)Beyond the script, the directing, the acting, ""ONCE"" is a visually stunning work of art. The music mesmerizes. The colours, textures and light in harmony with the score, are stamped in my memory, as clearly as my own recollections. This is great cinematography! The acting offered some of the best performances of many of the actors' careers. The timing is often impeccable (you'll know what I'm referring to when you view it), and a risk few directors would have dared to take. The writing is nothing less than brilliant, because of course, without a exceptional script, there is no film.Once Upon a Time in America belongs in the 'greats' list of film-making. The most shocking detail, in this film's history, is that it never received the recognition it deserved (in awards), and that it is less known that many inferior films. I feel privileged to have seen it on 'the big screen' a few times, back in the 80s. Some films translate well to DVD, but films of great cinematographic stature are always best appreciated on the silver screen.You can't consider yourself a film-fan, a movie-buff, if you haven't seen this one (or two or three) in each of its versions, several times. I defy you not to love it (them?), too!(Canadian spelling in this review)",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
No version makes this a good movie,"Here's the deal. You have great actors and actresses. They give moving performances with a weak script. Nothing makes up for the messy, unfinished plot line. The producers and director were caught up in the film noir predilection for hiding the ball from the viewer. With a weak story, the idea is to simply ""leave it to the viewer to decide,"" a device that can work very well with a string story but is contrived and bothersome here. Add to the weak story some endlessly annoying direction which has the camera, for example, on the back of a briefcase for forty-five seconds because it seemed so avante grade when, in reality, it is just stupid. The first American release is a disaster because not even the strong acting can make up for that level of incompetence. The European release and the common streaming version are just better enough to allow the great performances to come through. This movie should be watched, appreciated for the great acting (and soundtrack) and appropriately dissed for not tying everything together. Yes, sometimes it's great to leave pieces for the viewer to knit together but not when there is no basis of possibility. I'm not going to the list the impossibilities but start with the fact that DeNiro doesn't even know who this national political figure is, even though he has been in the papers, radio and TV for at least the last five years prior to the denouement.

My favorite film,"Once Upon a Time in America is my favorite film. It plays like a live-action novel, and at 229 minutes, it would probably be faster to read the book (it's loosely based on ""The Hoods"" by Harry Gray).Sergio Leone uses his classic filming style in which broad landscapes and wide angle scenery shots are juxtaposed against close up shots of character's faces. Everything is meticulously edited and every shot has something important to say.The strong point of the film is its meaning, which is generally overlooked by most critics, who are typically more interested in plot. The plot is convoluted and at times uninteresting, but the message that the film sends is far more important. This movie is ultimately about the individual versus the collective. Using the idea of the ""American Dream"" as a catalyst, Leone employs themes of friendship, love, crime, and nostalgia to illustrate why individualism is overrated.Max (James Woods) gradually takes over Noodles' (Robert de Niro) childhood gang. As they grow older, Max acquires more and more of what Noodles once had: his lover, his money, his friends, and, ultimately, his life. Max discovered that he could use his close-knit friends to catapult himself into a better life, while destroying Noodles' life and getting his other friends killed.Leone assumes that the American Dream has to do with our focus on the individual. He shows the flaw in our belief that individual happiness doesn't require collective contentment by showing it in an individual case. What's interesting about this film is that it takes the perspective of the man who lost everything, unlike most American stories, which tend to illustrate a struggle to success. Noodles is left without money and exiled from his home for 35 years. Max climbs to the heights of power, but is left regretful and unhappy.In the final scene, Noodles is seen smoking opium and smiling in a drug-induced haze. Through the complex sequence of flashbacks, it's possible that everything in the movie after a certain point was nothing more than a dream of Noodles'. Leone is suggesting that the American Dream itself is nothing more than a dream.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Leone's gangster masterpiece.,"Director Sergio Leone is best known for his classic spaghetti westerns, but for my money, his final movie, gangster epic Once Upon A Time In America, is his most accomplished work. With a running time of 229 minutes (more if you're watching the Extended Director's Cut), it's longer than either Once Upon A Time in the West or The Good The Bad and The Ugly, and it's pacing is just as measured (some might say 'slow'), but the time passes far less painfully, so engaging are the characters and the drama that unfolds.Spanning decades, the story is truly monumental: it opens in the late 1960s with ageing gangster Noodles (Robert De Niro) returning to the Lower East Side of Manhattan after thirty-five years in hiding, and then proceeds to cut back and forth between the present and the past to show his life as a young boy in an impoverished Jewish ghetto, as a tough gangster during the Prohibition period, and as an old man reacquainting himself with old friends. This skillful technique helps to keep the viewer engrossed long after their bum has gone numb, but fine performances from a stellar cast (which includes James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello, and a young Jennifer Connelly), excellent cinematography, and some brilliantly executed scenes of brutal violence, all accompanied by a wonderfully haunting pan flute score by the brilliant Ennio Morricone, help to ensure that nodding off is unlikely.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

De Niro is good as always, But James Woods is the one that stands out in probably the best performance of his career.  Like most Mafia movies it deals with the American Dream, but while Adding to the American Dream story there is also a theme of loyalty, friendship, and love.  The love story between Noodles and Debroah is probably one of the best love stories ever on film.  The scene where the youngest member of the gang dies and Noodles' retaliation is beautiful.  I have seen alot of Gang/Mafia movies and probably this is my 2nd favorite (Behind the Godfather.)

"A solid gangster flick, but I hated the main character","This is a high-quality gangster flick, with a good story, interesting characters, and an outstanding cast. It was cool to see Jennifer Connelly shine so brightly, even at a young age, and in her first feature film role. The makeup artists were also impressive. In aging De Niro 30 years, they made him look pretty similar to his appearance now, almost 30 years later! The movie was extremely long, but there weren't many boring moments. While I initially thought that more of the film should have been cut, I later learned from its IMDb trivia page that:(1) Leone was contracted to deliver a 2-hours-and-45-minutes-long movie.(2) Upon completion of filming, the movie ran 8-10 hours.(3) Leone and editor Nino Baragli originally cut it down to 6 hours, and planned to release two 3-hour films.(4) The producers forced Leone to cut it down to 3 hours and 49 minutes, leaving 45 minutes that he considered essential on the cutting room floor, including: further explanation of the mob/labor relationship, Noodles (De Niro) meeting Carol (Weld) in 1968, and a good deal of footage featuring Noodles's relationship with Eve (Fluegel).(5) The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival in its original running time of 3 hours and 49 minutes.(6) The Ladd Company heavily edited the American release, against Leone's wishes, down to 2 hours and 24 minutes. This version scrapped the flashback structure Leone used, and instead arranged all the scenes in chronological order. Most of the major cuts were in the childhood scenes, making the 1933 scenes the most prominent part of the movie. The conclusion was also altered.(7) A few days before the film's premier in 1984, Williams found out the 2-hour version would be shown in theaters. He was heard to have said that no one would understand the movie in the shortened version.(8) The 2-hour version flopped in the U.S., and many American critics, who knew of Leone's original cut, attacked the short version viciously; some critics compared shortening the film to shortening Richard Wagner's operas (some of which run over 5 hours), saying that works of art that are meant to be long should be given the respect they deserve. The movie was shut out of the Oscars, with no nominations.(9) When the 3-hour-and-49-minute version was released on video and DVD, the film ultimately found commercial and critical success.(10) According to Woods, a critic dubbed the movie's 2-hour theatrical version the worst of 1984; years later that same critic watched the 3- hour-and-49-minute version and called it the best of the 1980s.Based on the foregoing, I believe the studio should have let Leone put out two 3-hour films, or at least it should have added the additional 45 minutes that Leone wanted (and then split the movie into two). The script contains many complex relationships and sub-plots, which developed over the course of half of a century, naturally begging an unreasonably long run timeeven after 4 hours, some significant relationships, characters, and sub-plots still needed more development. At first, I thought that maybe the answer would have been to eliminate those complexities altogether, instead of partly depicting them, but the widespread disdain of the 2-hour version suggests that the movie is much worse without them. Therefore, I think that the best answer would have been to embrace the complexity and give Leone the time that he needed to best develop this film.I also would have liked to see the film explore more of the differences between Jewish and Italian mobsters. Other than a few camera shots of Jewish food, Yiddish expressions, the Star of David, and Hasidic Jews walking around New York, these characters could have been written as Italian, with no difference.This movie is an 8 in pure quality, and I respect its ""it is what it is"" depiction of its protagonists, but I found De Niro's character so morally despicable that I had some trouble staying engaged. I was also a bit disappointed to learn of several historical inaccuracies in this film, according to its goofs page on IMDb.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

I now throw it out as my favorite film when people ask and the reasons that I love it are perhaps best encapsulated by Leone himself in the biography Something to Do with Death that came out last year:""I make fairy tales for grown-ups. I pay scrupulous attention to detail and making the setting realistic so I can focus on making the story mythic.""In a nutshell, that's all his films, but in particular the one that took fifteen years to get off the ground and ate up three full years of his life. OUATIA is above all else, for film lovers, with its spiderweb plot drifting through the decades and back and its deliberate, dreamy pace. It is also the finest gangster film ever, precisely because it focuses on the lowest rung of criminals and succeeds in never making the gangster life look glamorous. The friendship between Noodles and Max surprises with its refusal to paint one as the ""grounded"" half and the other as the ""loose cannon."" They're both given to violent outbursts and both capable of (increasingly diminishing) moments of tenderness and compassion. This makes Noodles'(DeNiro) betrayal of Max (Woods) all the more haunting, and since Noodles's guilt is what drives the entire film, it's crucial for that to come across.Much has been said about whether the film is a simple story, told out of sequence, a flashback, a flashforward, or an opium dream/ nightmare. I opt for the latter interpretation and without spoiling any of the film's surprises, consider this: Move the last shot of the film to the very beginning and everything else falls into place. The beauty of the closing shot (and it is one of the greatest closing shots in cinema) is the way it reveals nothing and everything.There isn't even time to go into everything else that moves the spirit (Morricone's mythic score, Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography that finds the right tone for each of the three decades portrayed, the art design, particularly in the 1923 sequence with the children). I am not automatically a fan of long films but Leone creates a world that is worth falling into for 227 minutes)A note about the running time: the bio reveals that the film runs 229 minutes outside the US, the extra two minutes being from the rape of Deborah. No longer version exists. Leone had wanted the film to run for 250 to 265 minutes but the footage that exists to make it longer was never dubbed to do so.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Once you heard a certain piece of music you knew what period it was set in and the characters involved.The one week point was the ending.

Best film ever made?i very much think so,"i first saw this film when it was on 1 of the movie channels,showing the first half of the flick on the 1 night,followed by the second period on the next.to that point i'd never seen a DeNiro film and as i had nothing better to do i thought i'd give it a bash.I'm usually 1 to commit myself to a film once i'm comfortably seated and after about 40 minutes i found i was totally drawn in to what i was watching and by the end of the first half had no intention of missing the concluding 2 or so hours the following night.My whole opinion to film has changed since seeing this movie.Once Upon A Time In America has a certain aura about it that no other film has ever had upon me.There was nothing i could fault about it.From the story,to the music,to the exquisite acting this film will go down as the greatest film i've ever seen and nothing else has come close 2 comparison since.Its ranking of 120th in the top 250 list to me is a surprise to say the least.DeNiro and Woods performance as the mysterious Noodles and the fiery Max respectively is second to none.The child actors who play the leading characters in the 1920's also do a superb job.Ennio Morricones haunting score was fabulous and its a crying shame that the soundtrack was never given the real accolades it truly deserved.Once Upon A Time In America is a film that sticks with you long after the end credits come rolling,which very few films manage to achieve.I wasn't too sure the next day whether i'd just seen a masterpiece or whether it was simply a film i wouldn't forget about in a hurry.There are many memorable scenes that truly moved me.Such as the young Patsy eating the cake,Noodles meeting with Max after his 35 year exile and the dramatic scene in the 1920's when the gang lose,as the epitaph puts it 'their youngest and strongest'.OUATIA isn't a film i'd recommend anybody to see.It is portrayed as a gangster film but once viewed it is actually also seen as a story of love,hate and betrayal.You'd need to give the film your full attention as the complex storyline and the constant flashbacks can easily cause confusion.Those who prefer more action packed gangster films would probably lean towards Goodfellas but those who appreciate the lesser known fine films should not live without seeing this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A one watch movie,Can't really say that this movie is bad but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece either. It is worth a watch but you won't go back a second time. All in all I find this director over rated and rather dull for this day and age. In a time gone by these may have been good movies but I think that was due to the lack of actual decent movies made. I'll probably get slated for this but really the Godfather was probably one of the most over rated movies I have ever watched and I'd put this in the same league.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Leone Doing What He Does Best,"Leone helms a virtuous epic film in the crime / drama genre. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, editing, cinematography, score and acting. There are many famous artists involved in this film and they deliver superlative and realistic performances. De Niro and Woods in particular are superb. The plot revolves around a former gangster, Noodles, who returns to New York after disappearing four decades earlier to start a new life and for other reasons. The plot initially hints as to why Noodles left New York, but after his return we learn the entire story as seen through his own flashbacks. We see Noodles and his friends growing up in a Jewish slum in New York's Lower East Side. Noodles, a natural leader, rises to bootlegger and ultimately a Mafia boss. This does not come without violence, betrayal and remorse. The film does a magnificent job examining all of the characters and what makes them tick. The plot is gripping, intense, violent, gritty, bloody, duplicitous and has a cathartic ending. This is a sprawling story and thus turns into a lengthy and entertaining film which Leone is known for to begin with. It is a masterful work of art, memorable, timeless and a classic. This film takes a different path, as far as the storyline, than most traditional gangster films which is refreshing. This viewer has revisited this film many times and in my opinion it is bravura in it's genre and holds it's own with the other celebrated gangster / mob films.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Mob Movie Art Piece,"Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (3 hour and 49 minute version) is a beautifully paced art piece. The film jumps between time periods, masterfully blending three different zeitgeists. The detail placed in this film is brilliant. The story takes its' time to get where it needed to be. While the film is long, it feels as if there's more than one movie within this film. Leone makes the film feel like a trilogy or bilogy of sorts, when he tells different stories from multiple eras. The set/environments of the film are very stylish. The set and environment expand and become more vibrant with the story overtime. Leone successfully transitions us from a period of immigrants in New York in the early 1900s, to the prohibition era, to a more modern period. The film tells a different story of America for a specific group. As these characters grow, so does the country and its' conflict. The characters within this film are very relatable, in the sense that their lives represent our elevation or descent into our later years. Despite their deplorable actions, the characters are all charismatic and engaging. The dialogue between characters is natural. The acting in this film is great. The younger cast and their older counterparts transition these characters in a cohesive manner. It's as if you're actually watching the younger cast grow into their older selves. Robert De Niro and James Woods do a fantastic job in their roles. Their acting is phenomenal. The cinematography is great, with shots that feel as if they were ripped from a Picasso painting or a Michelangelo sculpture. The shots in this film are masterful, with few exceptions. The storytelling keeps you engaged for the most part. The only exception is after the intermission. After the intermission, the film feels a little boring and fruitless at times. It could have been done in a manner of ease, however it feels crammed in with the rest of the film. The film is very long (depending on what version you watch). However, it's a great film. Overall, Once Upon a Time in America is a classic mob movie that encompasses an artistic vision with timeless storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Masterpiece,One of the best movies I've ever watched. Seeing a lot of negative reviews lately - as if people nowdays can't sit trough something longer than 90 minutes.But this movie is masterpiece from legend director Sergio Leone.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best gangster movie ever made,"Godfather is probably more entertaining. However, this movie makes you want to cry and think hard about life.  I have watched this movie about 10 times. Everytime after I watched it, I felt exhausted and extremely sad.  There is just so much stuff in this movie and it's basically impossible for me to compare this movie to any other single movie, maybe a string of Fellini's or Bergman's movies. Remember I am using the word string. A lot of people just do not like this movie. People I think (or used to think) had good taste think the movie is too long, too dry, and basically just a big waste of time. But some people who have seen it agree with my view that it is an enormously rich and rewarding film. The problem is that the film is almost four hours long, and can be somewhat confusing with its layers of flashbacks. However, the full story of the film is a large one, and Leone's style is so operatic at this point that it takes much longer than the plot demands. There are many slow crane shots of various streets in New York's lower east side, and many awkward silences and pauses where nothing is physically happening. The action, however, does not seem slow to me. None of Leone's movies seem slow. Leone keeps everything moving quite nicely, yet he pauses to establish the mood with, for example, a crane shot of the bustling New York street, or a scene where Noodles stirs his coffee for a couple minutes, letting the mood become extremely uncomfortable. None of Sergio Leone's Western characters seem to have much emotion in any of his movies. There is emotion, but it tends to be emotion that is extremely repressed, hidden beneath a calm, tough exterior. This film is different. Noodles (Robert de Niro) does not seem to have any emotions, extremely odd for the protagonist of a movie. When Noodles comes home and visits Fat Moe after 35 years away, his first words after seeing Moe are ""I brought you back the key to your clock"". There is a reason for Noodles loss of affect, as the psychologists call it. His emotion has been buried under the memory of having inadvertently killed his best friends, his soul has clearly died. After meeting Max (James Woods) as a kid, Noodles, Max, Patsy, and Cockeye form a gang. After spending mostof his childhood in jail for avenging the death of a friend, Noodles rejoins Max and the gang,to find Max starting an ambitious climb to the top of the organized crime ladder. Eventually,Max becomes too ambitious, and after prohibition is repealed, seeks to rob the Federal Reserve. To stop him from an obviously suicidal heist, Noodles turns Max in. However,Max and the rest of the gang get into a shoot-out with the police, and Noodles soon hears of the death of Max, Patsy and Cockeye. Noodles can't stop thinking about the call made that killed his best friends, and soon has to flee New York because the crime syndicate he worked for now is trying to kill him. Thirty-five years later, he is still haunted by the memories of his dead friends. He is mysteriously summoned to New York by an unknown person for unknown reasons, and soon discovers a trail of clues that will lead to a great revelation. At the end, there is the final smile by Noodles, doped up on opium, the only time in the movie that he looks completely happy and at peace. Even though this is an earlier Noodles, this is Leone's way of depicting Noodle's return to normality after 35 years of grief. It is the perfect conclusion to this movie. This is a story of a man at war with himself. Noodles is criminal, savage, ruthless, and is sexually animalistic (as demonstrated in the various raping scenes). Yet he is also tender, loving, down-to-earth, and honorable. The center of this conflict is Deborah, who loves Noodles, and tries to turn him away from his criminal side. Deborah is the one pure thing in his life, the one thing that he loves, and when she is about to leave for an acting career, Noodles rapes her. He rapes her because he is mad at her, he is confused, and realizes that this is probably the last time he will ever see her, so he must have sex with now or never. Besides, that is Noodle's instinct, and his sudden moves on Deborah would be quite acceptable with the kind of girl he normally sees. Perhaps he rapes her because he sees in her a purity that he can never have, tries to take it and in the process destroys it. When Noodles' realizes what he has done, he starts on a slow recovery process, gradually becoming less and less criminal, which forces the rift with Max, who is determined to build a huge organized crime empire. When Max and the others are dead, and Noodles flees New York, his bad side has vanished. And when he comes back, he is a changed man. The reason that I feel this is the best gangster movie is because none have the combination of style and substance that this films brings. It's not just about gangsters, its a look inside the soul of Noodles. Robert de Niro gives such a wonderful understated performance that the character of Noodles sticks with you. I can still remember Noodles just by a certain look in de Niro's eyes, a sort of calm depression, a look that has the weariness of the world in it. This is a movie where the mood of repressed sadness will linger long after the film has ended. Very few films are as powerful.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
De Niro and Woods deliver the best performances in a remarkable cast,"Leone's most ambitious epic moves across three separate time periods: the twenties, the thirties and the late sixtiesIt starts in 1933, with the murder of a woman after merciless gangsters have briefly interrogate her (while Noodles hides out in an opium den), then returns to the disastrous night of the bloody betrayal, then jumps to Noodles' return to New York in 1968, then shifts back to the early 1920s to their adolescence This display in a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards is used throughout the film, until the climax where all the dissociated parts of the story fall into place""Once Upon a Time in America"" tells the story of five precocious teenagers born in Brooklyn and the Bronx, Noodles (Robert DeNiro), Max (James Woods), Patsy (James Hayden), Cockeye (William Forsythe), and Dominic (Noah Moazezi), the youngestAs kids in 1921 Prohibition New York, they take only superficial interest in minor street crime, spoiling things or stealing from drunks, until they start running their own racketsNoodles is sexually attracted to Deborah (Jennifer Connelly/Elizabeth McGovern), the mesmerizing ballet dancer, sister of their loyal friend Fat Moe (Larry Rapp), the son of a saloon-keeper But the gang's rivalry with Bugsy (James Russo), another street hoodlum, leads to Dominic being fatally wounded and Noodles going to jail for years for taking a bloody revenge in a blind rageWhen Noodles is released from prison a decade later, Max was there with a car and a hooker Noodles joins his three pals, who have become prosperous by continuing in the crime world including entwining with unions and the strikers, led by their leader Jimmy Conway (Treat Williams).The four best friends accept to assault a jeweler in Detroit, for a major mafioso Frankie Minoldi (Joe Pesci), and his sidekick Joe (Burt Young) And at the end of Prohibition in 1933, the top mob criminals find themselves having gathered $1 millionIn their vacation in Miami, Noodles was highly worried that Max's next plan is a step too dangerous to take and too riskyThe most tragic and moving part of the film is probably the romantic obsessions of Noodles Noodles and Deborah have deep and strong affinity for one another Noodles feels he has the right to Deborah's feelings, but she closed herself to him years ago when he responded Max's call over her own Noodles seem unaware of her decision...

Up there with the best,"Sergio Leone's last film was also his best, with this epic life story of two best friends who work together as gangsters. Whether it is a real life story, or simply Noodles' drug-induced dreams is never resolved, but this and the film's non-chronological order add to its effectiveness. The usual brilliant camera-work of Leone's films, and the wonderful musical score by Ennio Morricone are a wonderful accompaniment to the strong violence and character's emotions. The story takes you through all the emotions, but ultimately leaves you feeling happy that you have viewed such a masterpiece. The acting of not just De Niro and James Woods, but all the characters, young and old, is superb and at no point does the storyline become overlong or boring.

The story is very weak as well, it never goes anywhere, but just fills in the blanks of what was shown to you in the first scenes.

I get that the early 1900s was a different time but some scenes with kids and women were disturbing, particularly the rape scenes. What kind of a driver continues to drive when a woman is obviously getting sexually abused in the backseat? Why did the writers/director choose to do this? And the overall treatment of women were terrible, as they were treated like sex objects and not human beings. This kind of made me wonder how the director himself viewed women??Overall, I do not recommend this movie, I only stuck around to see the ending but I was ready to quit after the glorified rape scene and it made me see Robert De Niro in a different light.I only gave the movie 3 stars because of the 1900s aesthetic.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

This movie is actually in my opinion far superior than any of the Godfather movies, movies that actually were my favorites before I saw this film (and continue to be in some sort). I discovered a new way of creating a movie by a director, that actually was not so much involved in Hollywood style cinema (from what I have read).Once Upon a time in America, its a tale of friendship, love, passion, crime, betrayal and history.

But the fact that this movie has some scenes that are for some people ""ugly"" like the rape scenes, this movie had a lot of bad reviews when it was first displayed.When you see this movie, and finish seeing it you will by a fact consider it too short, knowing it is 3 hours and a half, the time passes really fast, and its because its intrigue, its plot. This is actually a not very typical Hollywood movie, you could feel this is a very sad movie with an ending that won't give you a happy ending (like most of Hollywood films).Sergio Leone was by much the best director of his era, I have seen a lot of Martin Scorsese films relating to crime, but let me say it again: Not even comparable to Leone's work.Just to note, you have to see this movie twice or more to understand it, because of the changes in time, but this makes it more interesting!!10/10 2 thumbs up, 5 starseverything you have give it to this movie!! truly a masterpiece!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is Master Cinema!,"Once Upon a Time in America is a 1984 Italian-American epic crime drama film co-written and directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone and starring Robert De Niroand James Woods. Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it chronicles the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, and the rise of mobsters in American society. It was the final film of Leone's career and the first feature film he had directed in thirteen years.The runtime of the film is 3h 50min and I didn't even go to the toilet all through it. It may be too long for most people but I can tell you that my wifey and me weren't even bored in the slightest. This is Sergio Leone at the height of his game and his direction is masterclass. His sketches of the characters are brief but underscored with verve. Words cannot begin to describe what he has accomplished here. The opening sequences kept me spellbound - a scene of violence, a sickening death, leading to De Niro at an opium den. You know the dragnet is closing in on him, then the fricking ringing phone that never stops ringing. I kept looking for an elusive ringing phone but it never comes. We are treated to images like three dead bodies which makes no sense at all, but dammit I couldn't tear my eyes and ears away, and then we flash forward 35 years and we see the bloody phone. What audacity! What spunk! The opening had me on the palm of its hand. I was minced meat, ready to be pounded, tenderised and moulded to become a viewer Sergio Leone wants. Such opacity in the images but you will instantly know you are in the hands of a master and have complete trust in him. Every scene is handcrafted to perfection with such a high level of meticulosity.Don't get me talking about the ending. This is an ending that is impossible to shut up about. You will want to discuss with someone with at least some measure of acuity WTF was that about. For me there are two ways to look at the ending and what it means for the preceding over 3 hours you have just seen. This is as good as a mindfcuk but with such brilliance.

The characters are introduced very nicely by the director and since the movie is 3.49 hours long the director has ample time to showcase all the details and trust me neither the movie nor the direction or the screenplay will disappoint you.Acting is superb and once again Robert De Niro steals the show in the character of Noodles, he is a talented actor and a seasoned director like Leone has just adored the talent. James Woods has also been quite effective, rest of the cast were equally impressive.Screenplay of the movie is slow but effective and will not loose the grip from the movie, most of the scenes are so beautifully shot that it looks realistic. Climax of the movie is strong. Another strong aspect of the Leone's movie is it's music and the music in this movie is quite amazing.This was the final movie directed by the great Sergio Leone and we can witness the greatness of his work till the last movie he directed.

Leone's Esstential Swan-Song...,"Once Upon a Time in America (1984) Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams, William Forsythe, James Hayden, Danny Aiello, Larry Rapp, Burt Young, Joe Pesci, Scott Tiler, Jennifer Connelly, Rusty Jacobs.Spoilers herein.At the start of the 80's decade, cinema had already gotten a strong start for making great films. Surrounded by tons of mindless and idiotic films from the Comedy and Horror genre that nearly ruined the decade, films like Raging Bull (my favorite of the 1980's), The Empire Strikes Back, Ordinary People and The Elephant Man were some of the best to come out of 1980. Throughout the years, others like Platoon, Rain Man, and Do the Right Thing have been hailed as some of the best of the decade. With one of the best films that has ever been brought to the screen, Once Upon a Time in America, has been constantly ignored and forgotten.Like Midnight Cowboy, The Wild Bunch, and A Clockwork Orange, Once Upon a Time in America is a turning point in its genre. It's the only film that I've seen that captures the atmosphere and tells the story so differently from others. Sergio Leone's final film, Once Upon a Time in America is actually one of the hardest films I've ever critiqued. It is all around astonishing in the sense that the film is extremely well made by Leone, in the longest film of his career.The story begins as a mystery, with several men on the search for Noodles, a Jewish gangster on the run from the men for ratting out his ""friends"". As he escapes the city, we forward to thirty-five years later to him as a senior. There, he comes back to visit a friend and look back on the regrets from his past, from his childhood to him as a younger adult, where he and his best friends rise together in the mob ranks.Leone, a perfectionist, took many years to write the screenplay. He went through script changes and re-writes many times, and never could get it exactly as he wanted it. When he was finally finished, he acted the film out himself. Objectively, Once Upon a Time in America is possibly the greatest gangster film I've ever seen along with The Godfather and Goodfellas. And it is that reason why I give him credit for giving one of the best directions in a film. His techniques obviously inspired Tarantino to go on making Pulp Fiction, and somewhat even for Martin Scorsese with Goodfellas.Leone is probably most famous for making films such as the Dollars trilogy (Fistful of Dollars; For a Few Dollars More; The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and Once Upon a Time in the West. Here, he uses a similar storytelling like ""West"" did, except here it is far more personal into the depths of the characters. The cast is fantastic. De Niro seems rather different in this role, but is still very good. James Woods, Tuesday Weld and Elizabeth McGovern give their best roles to date.A 139-minute version was brought to the United States for a theatrical release, and was found disappointing by many critics and Leone fans in general. This version showed the film in chronological order, with many important (if intense) character pieces cut out. Ennio Morricone's (who also did the score for the Dollars trilogy) musical score is among his greatest. It is performed in haunting and beautiful ways, and it perfectly matches the film.The scenes with De Niro's behavior toward women are the ones that give the film a disturbing feel. The scenes with rape may offend some, but you have to understand why he does it before you can go on with the film. I think he did it because he never grew up learning how to treat a woman with love, and after raping the woman who he did love, he looks at the ground with guilt, and wondering to himself, what had he done wrong? Also, the character development in the film is horribly unappreciated. This is a film I just adored from the very beginning- one to expand my imagination on the characters as I did in Cinema Paradiso and City of God.I won't lie. The content in Once Upon a Time in America is extremely brutal. There are several scenes with shootings, beatings, stabbings- some even involving kids. If you can endure violence and some language- great acting, amazing directing, terrific writing, stunning cinematography, beautiful music. What more could you ask for in a great film? In the end, I would call it the greatest film of the 1980's along with Raging Bull and The Empire Strikes Back. It is an incredible cinematic masterpiece that's greatness within every year that passes. This is Leone's greatest, and sadly last, film. 5 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"OK, but overrated","As a fan of Leone's spaghetti western trilogy and of Robert DeNiro, I was very much looking forward to finally seeing this film. Quite a letdown. Despite good direction and acting, the story absolutely d-r-a-g-s. How anyone can comparethis to the Godfather trilogy is beyond me--that series has movement,development, continuity, and lives up to the emotions its characters express. This film has characters constantly being deeply introspective ... and that's about all it has. There are a few fun to watch moments such as when the boyscatch the crooked cop having sex and shake him down, but they're all too rare. This is a wistful film that might interest those who were there but like home movies, it won't interest anyone else. Two and a half hours of watching DeNiro long for the olden days in discontinuous flashbacks is two hours too much. If you want to see a good DeNiro flick set in NYC, see ""A Bronx Tale"" instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Unlikable Main Character, Boring and Unnecessary Story","This film is not only super long and boring, but on top of that it contains one unrealistically annoying character - the character of Robert DeNiro, who by the way is also the protagonist of Once Upon a Time in America (1984).I don't want to deny Sergio Leone's directing skills, but at least with this project he failed in my opinion. It's not shot very memorable, and the story he set out to screen contains dull epitomes of drama, criminals and characters. There isn't anyone very memorable character, I'd even say most are an unpleasant sight.Kudos to Tuesday Weld and James Woods for the superb and perfect acting they represent, but it's a shame they stand out so much in this film and not so much in others.Final score: 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
My favourite film of all time.....,"Once Upon A Time In America is my favourite film, bar none of all time.. This picture is, in my opinion, Sergio Leone's finest achievement -his masterpiece. The movie can be viewed in several different ways and on quite a few different levels. For what it's worth these are my thoughts: This is the second loose trilogy that Leone made (The first being the Dollars trilogy - A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly)**The second trilogy being Once Upon a Time in The West( The building of the railroad between the East and West coasts of America ) A Fistful of Dynamite or Duck You Sucker or as it was called in France, Once Upon A Time The Revolution ( the Mexican Revolution ) and finally Once Upon A Time In America ( the Prohibition Era of 1920's and 1930's America.) These were in Leone's opinion the 3 most important periods in the history of the U.S. The film starts and ends in 1933 - although goes forward to 1968 and then back to 1923 - then back and forth throughout the story. Time is the most important character as the story unfolds. It is a fairy tale for adults...if you want the film can be viewed an an opium dream in Noodles' (Robert De Niro's) mind. If the film is looked at in this light, the fact that Elizabeth McGovern's character does not seem to age between 1933 and 1968 makes more sense. Another clue to the film's use of dream imagery is that the number 35 appears on the garbage truck at the end of the film (This is the number of years that Noodles was hiding out and spending the intervening years between 1933 and 1968.) Also when Noodles first returns to New York's Lower East Side and meets Fat Moe (Larry Rapp)-he gives him back the key to Moe's clock. This is then used to wind up the clock (and start time moving again so that the rest of the story can be told) In many ways the film is only told from Noodles viewpoint...we only find out that during his 35 years in hiding he was ""..going to bed early.."" Ennio Morricone's music score is haunting - about 2/3 of the music was composed prior to the film being shot - and, as was common on a lot of Leone's film shoots -the score was played while the actors were making the film - in one early 1923 sequence 'Dominic' is heard and seen whistling one of the main themes from the picture (Another use of dream imagery in this film) The use of flashbacks in many of Leone's films is important to the storyline - this film is almost entirely made up of flashbacks and flash forwards. It rewards repeated viewings and never fails to amaze me with its detail and sweep and scope.",,Anonymous,Crime
It's wonderful!,"It's a great mobster movie. It's about the life of this gangster through his childhood and adulthood including him imagining his future through a dream state of inhaling opium. I have a feeling that all the scenes taken place before his opium smoking intro were real and he was hallucinating the scenes when he has grey hair. For one explanation, the phone kept ringing as a sign that something is off. He's slowly heading into the dream world from the opium. The story is told through memory and dreams and how the two begin and end similarly. For every time a scene ends, a similar image begins. It's 3 hours and 49 minutes, but doesn't feel long. I usually find Leone boring because a lot of scenes go on too long where we wait until someone says or does something. Once Upon a Time in America is smoother and better paced and the story pulls you in more.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stunning in Every Way,"Rating  * * * 1/2Sergio Leone made no movies from 1975 until this film came out... and it was his final classic.  Before, he had virtually created the Spaghetti Western-- along with Clint Eastwood and composer Ennio Morricone.  In fact, Leone turned down the chance to direct ""The Godfather"" in order to make this.And he made a true masterpiece.The plot is, as usual for Leone's films, extremely complex.  It starts in 1933, flashes forward to 1968, then back to the earliest days of the 1900s.  It concerns four Jewish friends who are involved in crime even as children.  They stay friends until adulthood, when two of them, Noodles (Robert de Niro) and psychotic Max (James Woods) begin to have differences, though they were the closest as children.It's hard to think of anything wrong with this film.  There is one, however.  It goes on for 227 minutes.  Not that it's ever boring.  It just has too much of a few things.  Example: was all the stuff with prostitutes absolutely necessary?  Still, the fact that you can still respect Noodles after he rapes a woman is one show of Leone's brilliance.Other than too much sex and violence, there really isn't much wrong with this film.  It did certainly deserve its R rating (for more than just those reasons), but it is still a classic.The performances are outstanding.  De Niro and Woods are two of the best film actors alive today.  De Niro matched Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather Part II,"" was incredible in ""The Score,"" and was absolutely hilarious in ""Meet the Parents.""  These are only three of his best.  But Once Upon a Time is America is his best.  Ditto for Woods, who actually saved one of Sylvester Stallone's worst films, ""The Specialist,"" with an incredible performance.  And this here is his best.Some of the scenes are truly touching, others horrifying.  The final half-hour, where an aged Noodles tries to find out who ruined his life thirty-five years earlier.  The final meeting between Noodles and Max is one of the best filmed scenes ever.Still, it would not be a classic without Ennio Morricone's score.  He is probably the best one out there, and this is probably his best.  It is absolutely beautiful and one of the greatest film scores ever.Also helping is the incredible production design.  It really captures the period, nearly as well as the score.This crime drama is stunning in every way.  Every way.How this did not sweep the '84 Oscars is beyond me.This is a true masterpiece, and Leone's last.You have to see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Leone's masterpiece,"Its inconceivable to me, how anyone viewing this great film in its 4 hour version could not be moved, excited & ultimately overwhelmed by it. From the opening with that Goddamn ringing phone, to the last shot of a smiling stoned out DeNiro this film is a true work of art. Complicated & personal, Leone weaves an epic tale about a bunch of Jewish gangster-friends from their criminal childhood on New York's lower eastside in the 1900's to the 1960's. And like many films of the genre,Once Upon touches on the themes of friendship, loyalty & betrayal but does so in what some find an unsettling structure. The film constantly weaves from past to present and back again & I think that this form of filmmaking makes some American moviegoers uneasy. They like their films with beginnings, middles & hopefully happy endings. Now this is a film that is all over the place, with characters that come & go impolitely & age without aging. Leone the artist takes a sacred genre and does marvelous tricks & turns to it. Its also a very violent & sexy film, a little too ""European"" for a mainstream American film, so the film is butched down to a 2 hour version that gets bombed by critics, and hated by audiences who came expecting another Godfather sequel, because hey after all DeNiro is in it. Also in the film is James Woods & the always great Tuesday Weld. The music is by Ennio Morricone & the beautiful cinematography is by Tonino Delli Colli. I'm delighted to see how many positive and interesting comments this film has gotten here, and I too can't wait for it to be on DVD. There is also a longer version than the 4 hour one, in which Louise Flecher has a part, I've seen the stills.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A true epic, magnificent","This is honestly one of the best movies of all time. Although it's quite lengthy, it is continually entertaining, thrilling, and even a little confusing. The scenery of the film is magnificent, as is the way the story is told. Robert DeNiro, as always, is fantastic, but James Woods plays an amazing role that has gained my certain respect. I wished Joe Pesci would have been worked into a bigger role because he is outstanding and hilarious in mob movies, but his minimal screen time and rather insignificant character role can be explained. He would doubtfully fit as any of the main 4, and beyond that are only a couple other key characters and he wouldn't work as any. Overlooking his small role, the overall quality of this film has me thinking it may be second to only GoodFellas in true mob/gangster epics.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""Believe in yesterday""","The old genres of classic Hollywood were bundles of convention and cliché, familiar in their tone and romantic in their recreation of an idea. And while Hollywood itself would change massively in the modern era, those movie stylings lingered on in the memories of those who had grown up with them. Hence it was just as likely to be European filmmakers who were documenting America's history on screen, albeit through the haze of genre-tinted spectacles. Once Upon a Time in America is celebrated Italian director Sergio Leone's tribute, not to prohibition-era America, but to the classic gangster genre which once claimed to portray it.Perhaps the most striking thing about Once Upon a Time in America is its wealth of detail and compelling atmosphere. The production design is really impressive, with sets to feast the eyes on and realistically thronging street scenes. Leone and his art director Carlo Simi have struck a balance between throwing in stuff that makes sense in context and stuff that conjures up a certain feeling in the scene. A good example is when Noodles flees the opium den and makes his way to Moe's, and the streets are strewn with streamers for a forlorn, after-party appearance. Many of the 1922 scenes feature billows of smoke rising up from vents, for that dreamy, wistful look. Sound design plays an important part here, the creaking of a lift creating a tense build-up to a shooting in the way that one of Ennio Morricone's dirges might have done in a Leone Western. Morricone's music is still a key presence of course, tying various thoughts together across the decades, for example the eerie honky-tonk Yiddish theme that plays to introduce Moe's place in the opening scenes and again in the first set of 1968 scenes.The principle cast for this one are chosen from the front ranks of contemporary Hollywood talent. Robert De Niro was by this time the archetypal New York mobster, so clearly the obvious choice, even if he has to swap his trademark Italian American accent for a Bronx one. He is however a little more serene and meditative than his usual exuberant gangster acts, and the quiet dignity with which he portrays the older Noodles is especially good. James Woods provides excellent support. I love his spontaneous anger in kicking Tuesday weld out of the office after a few words from De Niro. Character actors Burt Young and Danny Aiello do the job of making a memorable impact during their brief appearances, Aiello in particular giving us some great comic relief. Tuesday weld is very good too. A handful of the other cast members are guilty of a little overacting, but I'm not in a vindictive enough mood to name names.Once Upon a Time in America may be a far cry from the surreal expanses and moustachioed bandidos of Leone's Westerns, but much of the director's visual style has survived intact. He's still just as in love with the gritty close-up as ever, bringing an unusual prominence to the mole on Robert De Niro's right cheek. For some of the actor's roles this would be covered by the make-up department, or at least the director would favour his left profile. Here however not only is De Niro's juvenile counterpart given a conspicuous mole for consistency, Leone even shows De Niro at three-quarter angles against a dark background, highlighting the mole in outline, for example when he looks at the photo of Deborah at Moe's. It's pertinent, adding an obvious flaw to those otherwise handsome features. And then of course there is Leone's painstaking slowness and protracted non-dialogue scenes, which are what make this the 230-minute behemoth that it is, since there's only really enough script here for a two-hour movie. As usual, Leone makes these unspoken moments a dance of tense mannerisms and darting eyes, which (just about) renders them watchable.But perhaps it is Once Upon a Time in America's gargantuan sprawl that is its undoing. There is nothing wrong per se with a 3hr+ movie, nor is there necessarily a problem with slow, methodical pacing. The trouble is that this picture sacrifices narrative clarity for its stylisation. I don't mean the confusing timeline-hopping; that's nothing that a repeat viewing won't sort out. However there is clearly something missing and in spite of their length some segments of the movie seem horribly truncated. There ought to be at least one more 1922 scene that brings out the comradely warmth between the boys, and between Max and Noodles in particular. It's not enough that we see it – we as an audience have to feel it. Instead we seem to be hurrying from one key incident to another with no time for character development. And in 1933 Max and Noodles seem continually at odds – there is not enough evidence that their friendship is still strong despite their disagreements, and this means the final scenes in 1968 do not have weight they ought to. Some parts of the story seem to trail off into nothing, for example the reappearance of Joe Pesci at the end of the hospital sequence. Instead the screenwriters have focused on working little bits of symbolism into the dialogue and imagery (for example, ""the key to your clock"" and ""I'll do something with your time""), but have not worked nearly as hard on the emotional continuity. As a result Once Upon a Time in America is an interesting and occasionally entertaining collection of references to gangster movie history, but it is a failure as a work of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
You can't blame the cutting anymore...,"Is ""Once Upon a Time in America"" praised because of what it is, or because of who made it? I would argue that it is the latter, as Sergio Leone has been raised to a mythical status due to his unique directing talents and the success of the four western films he directed. Despite what Leone brought to this film (and his signature techniques are all at work here), that alone does not make a great film, and unfortunately ""Once Upon a Time in America"" suffers from several key shortcomings.The main one of these shortcomings is simply the plot, which is too cumbersome, and once put through the wringer of the pacing and time-jumping, simply doesn't hold up as interesting enough to justify the 4 hour runtime of the extended version (the version Leone intended, apparently). By the end of the film I was deflated and bored, and the ending itself did nothing to change that. There was a gem of a good story in here - Leone knew that - but I don't think he succeeded in bringing it out. And many of the scenes seemed to be there only to provide shock value. Leone's earlier work was much ""tighter,"" where every shot seemed to matter.The music and soundtrack are also a bit jarring. I think this was Leone's weak spot through most of his films. His repetition of musical themes in a film worked OK for his westerns, but in this film in particular, it becomes wearisome to hear the same cloying theme for the 50th time over 4 hours. I found myself distracted by the music and wishing it wasn't there behind the dialogue much of the time.So despite some glimmers of brilliance, even the fully restored version of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" rings flat for me. Due to the years of delays in getting this film off the ground, he missed his window and the ""gangster"" genre was already tired when this film came out (and arguably it's even more tired today). And unlike his westerns, which were sort of meta-films as they came after the hay-day of the format. ""Once Upon a Time in America"" just feels like one of the pack.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the Greats,Sergio Leone already had about 5 films before this which were masterpieces and as it was his last film we expect nothing less and that's what we got. Once Upon a Time in America is quite an unusual tale of Gangster's growing up.   It was one of it kind for it's narrative story being chopped up into different parts so we don't really get meaning of the plot till the very end.The story has to be one of the most beautiful stories I have ever heard and a depressing one at that.   It has everything you want in a story as it keeps you guessing and wondering throughout it's nearly 4 hour run but without it being that long it would have never have been that good.   This was different for Sergio Leone as we usually expect to see all his characters living in the west and wearing ponchos but what he brought to the screen in 1984 was probably the greatest gangster film of all time even beating the likes of The Godfather and Scarface.   I once said that Goodfellas was the greatest gangster film ever but that was before I saw Once Upon a Time in America.   Before this was released on DVD did anyone find it hard to find the original copy?  I couldn't find it and it was becoming incurably frustrating as I ran sacked all the Car Boot Sales to try and bag myself a copy and I then come across this man on a market stall and asked if he had a copy and he said he's got one at home and he'll bring it in for me next time he is there.   I agreed to this and asked him what his price was and he said £20 and this is for a VHS which in my opinion a classic or not is daylight robbery so I was back to square one.  The angels were listening though as a couple of weekends later they showed it on BBC 2 and I got to witness one of the greatest films ever made but it just astounds me that this movie was so rare to own after it was released in the mid eighties and even then it was a cut version so I had to rely on the TV to come up trumps with it's full version and lucky for me it did.There are some heartbreaking scenes here especially when Noodles rapesDeborah only because he knows he can't have her any other way but I think it's great how Leone let's us get to know Noodles for him to then turn his back on us and show us his evil side by raping her or attempting to I couldn't really tell if he did or not.   There is no future as far as love goes for Noodles as he doesn't know how to feel it after so much rejection. He is a broken man and is desperate for Deborah to love him but she resists only for him to do that to her.Robert De Niro's performance is one of the best of his career especially when he is an older man because his eyes do all the talking as his age goes and his movements from place to place when reminiscing is just brilliant as the more he moves the more guilt runs through him.   He is a lost soul and doesn't see anyway of putting his past behind and getting one with the future.  His past haunts him and he won't let it rest as he grows more suspicious trying to find out why he was invited back to his hometown after being obsolete for the past 30 years and whilst that is happening he is trying to find out the truth and while this is going on we see how his life has come upon him in flashback.   De Niro is not the only reason we should watch this but James Woods also as he gives the performance of his career as Noodles best friend Max.   Once Upon a Time in America may come across slow in parts and when it's your first time it may not even make any sense to you anyway as it did me.  It took me at least three watches to get what happened and what was De Niro's smile all about but once you have got past all that and have really taken it in you will see that Leone didn't make a great film before he died but he made one of the greatest films ever made.,,Anonymous,Crime
Crime drama at its best.,"I rented this movie back in 1985 and thought it was one of the best crime dramas I had ever seen. The story was great and so was the acting. But what I liked the most was the way it was directed. Long stares, the way scenes jumped from past to present, and the way it all ties together at the end. I like the way that it makes you think about some of the things that happened without just making it obvious. There are some different versions of this film, one which was originally shown to american audiences was a 2 hour mess, a horrible film that made absolutely no sense. Then there is the almost 4 hour movie that Leone originally wanted and is a masterpiece, See this one it is a great film.

A masterpiece,"It's a film that is an epic gangster and friendship story all in one. Sergio interweaves timelines with the finesse of a master and all the acting is superb.The film starts in earnest with the cast as children. The friendship built up at the start makes the developments throughout the film that come all the more heartbreaking. It also shows both a real and gritty side to New York and the adolescents themselves. These are children from effectively the ghetto and it doesn't hold back on showing that.What's also brilliantly done is the rivalry between the two leads Deniro and Woods, but also the great friendship and love each of them has for each other.This film though is also a gangster film and what's so well done here is it shows the whole spectrum of a gangster's life. So you see the consequences of their choices which you rarely see in one film.Then there's the actors themselves. This us one of Deniro's best films as noodles is a very flawed and human character. He is both a monster and relatable in the same breath.James Woods is also exceptional. He is the best friend and protagonist all in the same breath. Theirs very much a sibling vibe to his and Deniro's relationship.Then there's McGovern who is the escape for and potential downfall of Deniro's character all at once.The child versions of all these characters are also brilliant especially the young Jennifer Connelly.The final main character is the music. It sets the scene so well and conveys some of heartbreak and the joy just as well as the actors.Overall the film is epic in every way and deserves any plaudits it gets.

"Strip off the veneer, Tear down the facade...","Injustice. This film deals with it, this film suffered it. Leone and his team never saw a single Oscar for what is, undoubtedly, one of the GREAT movies of film history. Supposedly the reason was that HIS version was far too long, and 'unapetizing' for the American public. Years later, this seems ridiculous. American cinema has topped the record for gore and 'unhealthy' material. And DVD finally gave us O.U.a T. in A. in its glorious entirety. And complexity. Yes, because this script is so perfect, so stimulating and so bewitching, that although I have seen the movie 3 times in the last 30 years, it still surprises me...adds nuances and revelations to it's original story. truly admirable! The facade of good ole, healthy America is severely battered by this story of unhealthy ambition, betrayal, revenge and power. 'Noodles' De Niro (the nick-name of our 'positive' protagonist reminds us that Leone was the king of 'spaghetti' westerns), returns, twice, to the site of past crimes... risking his life and ideals in the process. The savagely bitter finale remind us that he does so, simply because he is 'curious'. Because he NEEDS the truth. And this need, although painful, is necessary. Guilt, it is implied, is a powerful corrosive agent, however icy James Woods' character may be. There is , whatsmore, a sub-text which Sergio Leone works on here, and it is the role of DRUGS in society. In order to bear the injustice and treason, the violence and solitude that life has dealt out, Noodles resorts to Opium, as a source of relief; of contemplation. Could it be that the director is reminding us that Heroin's reign in Italy and in the U.S. during the 70ies and 80ies may closely reflect 'modern' Society's degradation? As always, Leone blends his political criticism of the American way with a strong misogynist vein. His women are few and far between in the westerns, but in the two 'Once upon a time..."" movies they are increasingly present, and increasingly foxy. The are either prostitutes or cock-teasers with a strong masochist element. And it seems he prefers the 'honest whore'. This film could be reviewed by a psychoanalyst, a priest, a gangster or a politician , and all, I'm sure, would offer a different reading, as in Kurosawa's 'Rashomon'. But Leone is NOT a subtle film-maker. And maybe this reputation of his as something of a gangster in the, very selective Italian league of the 60 ies and 70ies, cheated him out of the credit he receives only now. Somewhat like Ken Russell in the British panorama, Leone's stylish but brutal approach to the realities of life, hurt the shyly hypocritical sensitivities of public and censors alike... let alone the distributors' in Hollywood. Technically the movie is breathtaking, especially Pescucci's wardrobe, Rochetti's make-up (the aging jobs are almost all superlative, and fundamental in helping us deal with such a complex game of 'flash-backs'), the Greg Tolland-style photography and shots by Tonino Delli Colli, the sets, editing and...of course, dulcis-in-fundo, Ennio Morricone's timeless score which, once again, is part and parcel of the film, an emotional bomb which Leone knowingly 'drops' in all the right moments. Deborah's theme is crushing. And the brilliant use of music and silence in Noodles' visit to his friend's mausoleum... comic and audacious. So, it's 9 out of 10, given that the perfect film may not exist (Jean Vigo's 'L'Atalante' ?), and the nearest thing to reading a GREAT novel, but with the whole 'caboodle' of the art of our time. Il Grande Cinema.p.s. It is absolutely extraordinary that an Italian,a ROMAN, with a VERY limited grasp of the English language, should endeavour, and pull off, such an ambitious American fresco. His great talent, and that of Mr. Brian Freilino (who helped him coach and survey the realism of nuances in both languages), and of the dialogue writers, greatly surpass the occasional hiccups that we encounter, especially in the childhood scenes. and by the way, ALL praise to the young actors who unjustly precede De Niro and Woods, but only chronologically.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A Beautiful, Expensive and Important Disappointment","Once Upon a Time in America is the perfect example of a Hollywood film that you hate to love. An obedient film lover will make a list of many reasons why this movie is great. Why it should be on your list of movies to watch and why it should be considered an important work of cinema can be debated and defended time and time again. Still, many will agree that the movie falls short in many ways to be considered a classic. Fans and critics will both agree that Once Upon a Time in American will easily confuse its audience without hardly any trouble. A period piece that jumps around from decade to decade will alone make the time-line confusing to any audience. Throw in character motivation and you have a roller coaster of confusion and endless questioning. With a blockbuster cast of some of the most talented names in Hollywood, and a legendary film maker, it's hard to acknowledge that the end result would be anything less that great. With Once Upon a Time in America, it is just that. Many will support the imperfectness that the movie is by showcasing the several different edited versions and why the final version came to being. Then again, whether or not each version tells a different story, the overall structure of the story still remains. No matter if we have 3 hour or 6 hour version, we are still left with empty characters from the very beginning. With all its faults and mystery that both versions have, the plot, the theme and many of its characters have holes. The potential Once Upon a Time in America had with its reach as a cinematic triumph, falls short from anything spectacular. What could have been one of the best 'American' films, falls among the many mobster flicks which does not do this movie justice. Although the cons do outweigh the pros, the movie holds up with many moments of beauty.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Theatrical Version  --  Average!  Director's Version  --  Perfect!,"Once Upon A Time In America is, as Leone hoped it will be, his best movie! It's perfect!Many of you might wonder why this movie wasn't present at the ACADEMY AWARD'S. It's because of the producer's and Warner Bros, who ordered Leone to cut more than one hour of the movie for it's theatrical(original) release. It really ruins the movie. My most honest recommendation is that you see the ''director's version''! That version of the movie is simply magnificent! The director's version is the biggest rival The Godfather has and will ever have! It's simply perfect! True, it is long! But the movie is so good that the time will just fly! Trust me! I've seen it more than ten times and i'm still not bored. It's simply perfect! Not that the theatrical version isn't good, it's just that it's not even as close as good as the director's cut! And literally, not as close as good!!! It takes away the movies structure and leaves a lot of holes in the script! It ruin's it! It's still good, but it's no longer brilliant!I don't think it's necessary to say anything about acting! Just look at the cast!This movie is for everyone out there. This movie is a brutally honest story of a couple of friend's growing up together in a society that gives 'em no other choice but to become gangster's. Also there is a beautifully written love story in the background which comes to most unexpected twist. And i have to mention characterization! It's flawless! Simply perfect! -- Just as the entire movie is in the director's version!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

What a brilliant mess,"I'm not sure what to make of this film. Maybe to properly follow it and get the full grasp, we need the entire ten to tweleve hour version. A movie with mass potential, that became a very unapologeticaly (and unnecessarily) dark and convoluted mess.I read a critic said upon original releasse it was horrible. After the 3h49m version some ten year later, was ""the best of the 80's"".There were three movies that came out in the same weekend in 1989 that were all better than this film. Critics are full of bs.This film was a horrible waste of time that I will never get back. Easily one of DeNiros worst roles. James Woods crushed it but the script and dialogue were a hot mess at best, so you have no real feel for the characters, at all.Incredibly disappointing, don't waste your time. The worst edited film I have ever seen....honestly, just horrible.A very gracious 5/10 would never watch it again!",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Old stories...,"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a crime movie which shows a former gangster who returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan after thirty years. He has to deal with some changes that happened and he missed all of those. We watch also the past of him and how all of these start and of course all of that has to do with the mafia and the gangs of New York.I really liked this movie because of the plot which I found magnificent and the direction of Sergio Leone which was outstanding. About the interpretations I have to say that the interpretation of Robert De Niro who played as David Aaronson (Noodles) was for one more time great, equally good interpretation made by James Woods who played as Maximilian Bercovicz (Max). Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned is the beautiful Elizabeth McGovern's who played as Deborah Gelly. This movie reminded me plenty of movies with the same plot, gangsters, mafia etc but this movie was simply one of the best in this kind.Finally I believe that ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is one of the best movies that a crime movies fan wants to watch. It gives you many emotions and this happens because of the interpretations of the cast but also from the great direction of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of my very favorite movies,"I have a category of movies in my life that I call ""accidental movies"". AM's are flicks that I never really intended to watch, never heard of prior to seeing, etc. OUATIA is such a movie to me. I had never heard of it, was up way too late one night and this showed up on HBO starting at like 2am. I was blessed by the HBO-gods that they were presenting what used to be called ""the long version"" or ""the European version"". Of course, I watched every minute of it. It was fascinating. I couldn't figure out how I had never heard of this movie. So many of my favorite actors in one place! DeNiro... Woods... Pesci... Williams... Because of this movie, I fell in love with Elizabeth McGovern... rediscovered Tuesday Weld, and was introduced to William Forsythe.The movie is a marathon at its full length, but well worth the time invested to watch it. It provides a reasonably faithful historical backdrop to the action of the main group of childhood friends, and sees them through many stages of their lives.Are you familiar with the Bruce Springsteen song ""57 Channels and Nothing On""? Well... the reality of digital cable is that it's 257 channels and STILL nothing on. On those nights, I go back to my old standby, OUATIA. I have now seen this movie at least twenty times. The beauty of an epic is that even at the twentieth viewing, you can find little nuances that you previously missed. I really think of this movie as an old friend that is always there to visit with. I once watched a cable broadcast of the edited version, and even with my knowledge of the movie, found it impossible to follow.If you have never seen this wonderful movie, you owe it to yourself to gather up your best snacks, plant a full cooler next to your best movie chair, send the kids off to their grandparents AND ENJOY!",,Anonymous,Crime
So good and yet so bad,"The 229 minute version of Once Upon a Time in America is too long because there is a repetitiveness in the presentation of the themes. Having said that, it is also true that the attention to detail and the lavish sets make the nearly four our of watching never a chore. Then there is also Robert De Niro who lifts the movie above an ordinary gangster flick. Arguably, one of the best things about the movie is the music, but since God Bless America was used so movingly in the ending of The Deer Hunter (also with De Niro), it was in poor taste to use it as the final song six years later again so stridently. The actors playing the gangsters as boys and those playing the gangsters as adults are all fine. With all that, what a pity that the movie finally fails. It does so in the sense that the ending is a farce, something that sits poorly with an epic movie, and it does so in the sense that it makes the mistake of practicing alchemy, of distilling friendship and love and sensitivity from a group of extraordinary vicious men, murderers whose sense of humor is expressed in swapping babies in a nursery. The viewer is asked to believe that these cockroaches are capable of great sensitivity. Deborah calls one of them a cockroach early on and she should have taken herself more seriously for she could have known she was right. The director wanted it both ways, violence and love undiluted from the same source. Kiss kiss, bang bang: it can be done, but not like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Absolutely Outstanding,"I originally heard of this movie about 2 or 3 years ago and didn't really know much of what it was about or who it starred. However, about 8 months ago I stumbled upon a review of John Ulmer (an IMDb critic I generally agree with and respect) who believed it to be a forgotten gangster flick that was just as good as The Godfather and Goodfellas.After hearing such praise in his review and on IMDb I knew I had to find out more and try to see it when I could. Being a fan of Gangster films, Robert DeNiro and non-linear movies (such as Tarantino films and The Godfather Part II) I knew it must be worth seeing. Having finally got it last Christmas I had high expectations and perhaps that was the reason I was disappointed on my first viewing. I didn't have a problem with the running time. It was that it was that I found it a little too hard to understand and what messages it was trying to convey. Otherwise I thought the film was brilliantly made. However, I thought it would be unfair to judge the film after one viewing. Moreover, it seemed it was a movie that required several viewings to realise its full messages.Today, 5 months on, I gave the film its second chance and was absolutely blown away. Having seen it before, I understood more about the characters and their situations. The film is absolutely outstanding and warrants every minute of it 3 1/2 hour running time. I can understand why so much anger arose from it being butchered into a mess on its release. It is not a quick 90 minute action or comedy flick. Its much deeper than that. I'm of the opinion that its a dream of a man looking back at his past and into the future- looking at his good times, bad times, regrets and what could be coming in his life. I think the deepest message of the film is to choose the life YOU want to lead and live it to the full otherwise you may live in regret. Perhaps I'm wrong but I don't think thats the point. I think Sergio Leone has left the viewer to make up their own minds about it. I have done so. Perhaps I'll find other messages each time I watch it. Thats the sort of masterpiece this film is.On the subject of the film itself it's virtually flawless on every level. However, there's two particular things that stand out for me and I feel should be mentioned slightly above the rest - Ennio Morricone's truly outstanding score and the brilliant production design of an early 1900 New York which, in my opinion, tops that of The Godfather Part II flashbacks. I had never heard of Morricone before I saw this film but his score for it could well be THE greatest I've ever heard. As pointed out on the trivia section of IMDb it was criminally unable to be considered for an Oscar because of another mistake by the distributors. The score beautifully captures the films tone, particularly in the scenes between Noodles and Deborah. He also has several others which also work perfectly throughout the film. As far as the Production Design is concerned New York looks absolutely outstanding in the 1900's scenes and also in the 1930's ones. For the former in particular, every shot (like in Coppola's Godfather Trilogy) is beautifully designed and contains all kinds of early 20th century aspects you can think of such as smoke, horses, shop signs etc. Even in the indoor scenes, all the buildings and designs look very contemporary and every effort has gone into making you feel the film is taking place 70-100 years ago. They succeeded, and I honestly found it impossible to believe this film was shot in 1984.Other aspects of the film are tremendous as well. DeNiro (in what appears a largely forgotten role) and Woods are both outstanding in the leads along with the others such as Tuesday Weld, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Elizabeth Mcgovern and others. However, some of the real scene-stealer's are the child actors featured in the 1900's scenes- my favourite section of the movie. Scott Tiler matches DeNiro as Noodles and a truly beautiful young Jennifer Connelly (who has deservedly gone onto bigger things and is now an Oscar winner) in my opinion upstages Elizabeth Mcgovern. The rest of the child actors all do good jobs as well.Leone's Direction and vision really shine through here with the use of Tonino Delli Colli's photography. It is particularly evident in the 1900's scenes featuring the young Deborah walkthing through crowds.Don't be put off by the 3 1/2 hour running time. This film is one of the few such as The Godfather Trilogy, The Green Mile and Titanic that warrants its running time. Both times I've watched it, it moved very fast and I was never bored. Leone always keeps you interested and I never looked at my watch or felt uncomfortable. In fact I honestly felt as though I'd been watching a 2 hour film instead of nearly 4 hour one when I watched it today.If I had any criticisms they would be of one or two distasteful scenes. I didn't have a huge problem with the disturbing rape scene as i think it was trying to tell you more about Noodles' character. However, I heavily disliked the baby switching scene, finding it incredibly distasteful and unnecessary. I know the characters aren't very likable, but that scene went too far for me.Otherwise, there's nothing else that can be criticised about this masterpiece. It is now one my all-time favourites alongside Seven and The Green Mile, and I believe as John Ulmer rightly said, ""No-one should go a lifetime without seeing this wonderfully moving film"".10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Well made and beautiful score. Not as good as The Godfather 1&2 or Goodfellas.,After so many years of people recommending me to watch this movie I finally decided to watch it. I watched the 3hr 49 min version of this film as this was the only one that was available to me.The first half of this film with Noodles and Max as children was very good and quite enjoyable. My favorite shots were during this section of the film. The second half as adults played by Robert De Niro and James Woods was still good but not quite as enjoyable as the first half. De Niro and Woods were both great in this film.Sergio Leone did a hell of a job creating this film. The cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli and the musical score by Ennio Morricone were fantastic. My favorite shot is the one where the child gang were walking past the street with the bridge in the background. My favorite piece from the soundtrack is Poverty.This film isn't without its problems though as I felt the pacing was a little slow at times as this film is over 3 hours and some plot holes in the story. Like what happened to the police officer who was blackmailed by Noodles and Max?I've seen a lot of people saying this film was better than The Godfather and Goodfellas and I can see why but it's a no from me. By the end of this film I was exhausted. I don't even want to watch the directors cut after finding out it is 4hrs 19 mins. I've seen the LOTR extended editions but they were far more enjoyable than this film and didn't feel like long. This movie could've cut off at least 10 minutes of footage.Overall great movie but too long.9/10 the cinematography and music brought it this high. If those were mediocre this would've been a much lower score.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Leone's latest ambitious project, a masterpiece that will always be remembered. Wonderful and unforgettable score by Morricone.","""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a really rare movie. It was a passion project directed by Sergio Leone and I could see that he put a lot of love into it. It is a different take on the whole mob genre, as it focuses more on the characters' personal lifes, what they feel, their weaknesses and their friendships. There is also a good dose of violence, but it is definitely used as background. In short, do not expect a movie such as ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas"".I have watched the extended director's cut that lasts over four hours, with additional restored scenes, that honestly does not add much to the extended European version. The movie is undoubtedly long, but you need also to understand that it portrays the origin and the evolution of a Jewish criminal gang, since they are teenagers, until basically their latest years, and it does this by really deepening every single aspect, without ever being boring or repetitive. Obviously the film is really slow paced, there are some scenes where the director focuses on a look, or on some details, that are functional to the story. Everything feels just right placed. The narration is non-linear, and we jump constantly between past and present, adding dynamicity to the whole plot.From a technical point of view, the film is perfect. The photography is stunning and there are many iconic shots that inspired countless of other filmmakers, photographers and artists. The Brooklyn Bridge shot is probably the most notorious one. The lighting and the color correction are wonderful. The director managed to give a realistic depiction of the 20s, 30s, and the 60s. Three different eras, with three completely different settings, societies and values. The film portrays these changes really well. With a cast composed by Robert De Niro, James Woods and Tuesday Weld, you cannot really get wrong. Very disappointed by McGovern. She was the only one that I could not really stand. I don't know if she got better over time, but personally I think that here she is awful, as she could not carry any kind of emotion. The score composed by the maestro Ennio Morricone is simply unforgettable and will live forever. It really immersed me in the story and it was always placed in the right moments. Tracks are so diverse, there is one in particular that is heavily inspired by Spaghetti Western, a brave choice that works.This Movie left a legacy that only very few films can claim. I would stay hours to write about the amazing scenery and the well crafted screenplay, but I believe that enough has been said. If you love cinema, or you aspire to work in the film or video industry you must watch this absolute masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
8.4/10 - An Impressivly Smart Film,"This film is almost 4 hours long.I've watched it twice, the same week, in order to keep up with my IMDb top 100 poster rating. Yeah, twice the same week.So, why did I do that, you ask?Well, the first time I've watched it, I thought that the film was pretty good. The score is great, the cinematography felt decent, the story was interesting for me overall. But still, I've felt like I've missed something crucial - the ending didn't make sense at all for me, and the unorthodox structure of the film confused me. So, I've read about the film a little bit, and HELL did I miss something big. So, a rewatch it was, and I'm glad I did it.Once Upon a Time in America follows Noodles, a Jewish mafia man, throughout different eras of his life. I don't wanna spoil anything, but let's say that this film felt to me more like a character study than anything else - much like Citizen Kane - but yet, without giving up on an epic tale, full of motifs, symbolism and foreshadowing in a truly artistic way.So, tbh, I don't have any major problem with this film. The length makes it a tough film to watch without breaks, but on the second watch it went by way faster, really. The pacing is pretty good. Still, this movie may be a little exhausting at times - it truly takes its time to dive into characters, even side characters, in ways that may seem too long for the unpatient viewer. Even so, I wouldn't change it, since I do think that it adds a lot to the story.And about the things I love here - most things, I'd say. The cinematography is awesome, and the way that Leone meticulously built each and every scene is truly impressive. I love the motifs and the symbolism, and I find this film extremely intellegent (though on the surface it may appear as one that glorifies or normalizes abuse, but trust me, it ain't). As said, the score is great, very fitting, and I like how most tunes are built around the same recurring melody. The concept is also quite interesting, both on surface level and on a deep dive. Also, the acting. The acting is so damn good, and I was super impressed with the acting level of the child actors (well, one of them is Jennifer Connelly, so I should've known). Adult Moe and Deborah maybe feel a little rough acting-wise at times, but it has a good explanation imo (if you got the ending you might know what I mean.)To sum it all up - this film is so meticulously made, so smart and epic. It didn't blow my mind in any point while watching, but still, I had a good time and I'm totally impressed with the film. It truly is a work of art, despite its length.

The other issue I had with this one was the flashforwards and flashbacks intertwined with DeNiro's character. At times it was hard initially to recognize which time period the film had shifted into from one scene to the next. This is especially true at the end of the movie when one female character appears to not have aged a day.It's not worth your time to watch the director's cut.

A really gem of a film.,"Once Upon a Time in America was originally released in 1984.It starred Robert Deniro, James Woods, Joe Pesci and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Sergio Leone, the film featured an alumnus of Leone's crew who had worked on all of his films. This included Enno Morricone's musicality as well as Carlo Simi's production design and Tonino Delli Kelli's masterful and creative cinematography. Once Upon a Time in America is a complex tale about New York City Pals who grow into gangsters and live their friendship throughout prohibition. Near the end of prohibition, a bank heist gone wrong becomes the focal point of the story. A subsequent reunion of the surviving friends 30 years later primarily involves Noodles (Deniro) revisiting his past. The movie itself is almost four hours long and its 1.85:1 ratio shows off Leone's unique visual style. For instance, at one point we may see a crane drop down from the top of the frame like some sort of giraffe to catch Noodles entering an old pub or we may watch in awe as the Brooklyn Bridge is reconstructed right before our eyes. These are just two amongst many commodities that really do reinstate this as Leone's pinnacle masterpiece. It would also be his final film. Deniro delivers the goods as usual. His method style of acting that we are so used to seems to be replaced by a more complacent and tranquil demeanor in this film. James Woods's character has a hint of ambiguity; at the end of the film I both admired and hated his character. Joe Pesci has a minimalistic role as a small-time hustler. Another mentionable fact of OUATIA would be the quality child acting portrayed throughout the film. A young Jennifer Connelly nails her role as Noodles lost childhood sweetheart in the early scenes of the picture. Throughout OUATIA we are treated to Morricone's breathtaking compositions. Perhaps it is the orchestrated version of The Beatles' 'Yesterday', or any other of his musical motifs. Not since, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' has Morricone been so luminous. Overall this film is pure cinematic art. From time to time there isn't a word said but the music and pictures on screen carry the story forward. OUATIA was released in three different edited versions - apparently the full version created a quandary for Warner Brother's executives and it was butchered down two hours. This broke Leone's heart and he would never live to see the full version be released many years later on DVD. I would recommend Once Upon a Time in America to anyone who has a deep passion for movies. It contains gratuitous use of much Leoneism and will be talked about for many decades to come. However, it does take an average of two viewings before the plot begins to make complete sense, but when it does prepare to be engulfed in Leone's most enduring creation since the sixties.

a masterpiece of modern cinema and perhaps the most beautiful film ever...,"I first saw this film back in 1985 as an 18 year old and was simply blown away by it despite parts of it leaving me in the dark as to what the hell was going on! Since then i've watched it many times and over those repeated viewings i've come to understand more and more what the film is about and what the characters and story represent. But that is my take on it and as such, one of the beautiful things about this film is that people, i feel, will take what they want from it depending on how much time and attention they want to put into it. In simple terms this is not a film you can watch just the once - if you do you will feel confused and probably let down. Persevere, watch it again though and most likely you will start to ""get it""...Because of this i think OUATIA could truly be a unique cinematic experience, something you really have to delve into and immerse yourself in otherwise you will not come to recognise and spot the nuances or the messages contained within. It's not so much a gangster flick in the obvious sense, more a story told of love lost and lives wasted, friendships forged and ultimately betrayed. Much has already been said about the cinematography, the score, the sets and the acting of which all are truly first class even allowing perhaps for my slight reservations on McGovern. The child actors for me are every bit as good as the seasoned pros and Jennifer Connelly is simply wonderful.The film has flaws absolutely, but what again makes this a unique experience is that those flaws (for me anyway) just add to the mystique of the film rather than take anything away. It's not mean't to be a historically correct story-telling anyway and the reviewer elsewhere who bemoaned the bridge not being the Brooklyn bridge or some such is so missing the point, as do the few who from their words you can tell have just not taken the time to really watch and involve themselves. Maybe some people will just never get it anyway...!To sum up this is a film for those who are prepared to give more of their time, thought and effort to it than just your normal 120 minute Hollywood banality ride demands.

Excellent!,"This movie is such a breath taker! It is not too long! Not if you get into it! If you are bored of the movie then yes, it will seem long.

Mature and reflective film-making,"A human drama masquerading as a gangster story, this, the last and perhaps most epic film of Sergio Leone's career, is a story that takes three and a half hours to play out. During the running time we are subjected to a lengthy, complex, and utterly compelling drama that charts the rise and fall of love, friendship, and betrayal in the life of Noodles, a Jewish gangster as played by Robert De Niro. Only true fans of the cinematic experience need apply, who have the patience to sit through many slow scenes and watch the story play out on its own without any rush or contrivances. Once you realise that every moment that plays out on screen is important in the life of the central protagonist you'll realise what a good film this; there is no excess baggage, no extraneous characters, just realism and heartfelt drama. The whole gangster aspect of the story and the setting is just a backdrop for emotions and relationships to play out. Despite the lack of action (fans of Leone's westerns will find the shoot-outs and fights in short supply here) there are many shocking moments in the movie, many involving sexual violence of one kind or another which is tough to watch but still compelling.It goes without saying that the cast is wonderful, and packed with the usual suspects doing their thing. De Niro excels and has the best old-age makeup I've ever seen, James Woods is on the edge as usual, and Elizabeth McGovern is Deborah, an intense object of desire for De Niro. Did anyone ever think that the reason she hasn't aged at all at the end of the film is because we're seeing reality through De Niro's eyes, and in his eyes she is still as young and beautiful as she ever was? Anyway, plenty of familiar faces pack out the rest of the cast, from Treat Williams, Joe Pesci, and Burt Young to Danny Aiello as the hilarious police chief. William Forsythe, Darlanne Fluegel, the list is endless and also includes Jennifer Connelly in her first acting performance.Leone's cinematography is as great as ever and he has a lot of fun crafting some classic moments. The never-ending ringing telephone is a great element to the story and I never realised I could be captivated by the sight of a man stirring a cup of coffee. But there you go. It wouldn't be half the film it without Ennio Morricone's typically evocative score which in many ways surpasses that of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST with its character themes and solemn, tragic, yet beautiful music. Many elements run throughout the story, many involving the flawed character of De Niro, and without rushing the story gradually evolves in jigsaw-like segments with fall together for the nostalgic conclusion. This is a film that demands close attention throughout to capture all the little nuances and unfolds into a sometimes amazing film as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Painfully Boring Epic Fail,"The ten minutes of a ringing phone at the beginning was probably meant to warn me that if I continued to watch I'd be in for Four hours of this pretentious dreck.

Absolutly Amazing...,"The other review was so off I had to say something. First off this is a gangsta film of epic proportion. It is rich with drama, dialogue and the most beautiful score ever written. Although the length of the film is intimidating I strongly encourage those who enjoyed it to watch it again. There is just so much happening here you wont pick everything up upon the first viewing. The main character Noodles (De Niro) is everything you could want. He is a hero and a dispicable person at times. I use the word hero because of my fascination with the crime genre. You must respect the drive of a man who rises from poverty to success no matter how it's done. Similar to Michael Corleone in the Godfather you cant help but to love the blurred line of Good Guy/Bad Guy in the complex character that is Noodles. You will swear you are in the 1920's or 30's Leone is a genius director and this is not only his finest achievment but one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.

37 years later ...,"37 years ago ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA was released. I have read where there are apparently several different versions, so for clarity I am writing about the 3 hrs 49 m version running on Netflix this month. A CLASSIC film. Yes, the casting was impressive. Yes, funny how Deborah doesn't age. (I think her Cleopatra makeup is supposed to hide it. And I think she wipes off what is her masking of her feelings for Noodles.) The musical score is haunting beautiful. I did watch the film twice in a row. The cinematography was spectacular. Throughout the characters are seen through glass, cut glass, plain glass, mirrors; over & over they have the choice of this door or that, many hidden doors, hidden corridors. Noodles especially has these choices; keep going, go back, disappear? A beautiful example is in the hospital when after voting against Max about an upcoming opportunity, Noodles leaves by one elevator, headed Down. But in the lobby both elevator doors open, Noodles come out one and Max comes out the other. They make up, and leave arm in arm. Simple. They were split, then come back together, their friendship seemingly taking precedence over anything else. Even their initial meeting takes place with a large glass prismed light fixture. Max says help me hold it, and Noodles does.There is so much more to discuss about this marvelous film. If you haven't seen it in awhile, watch it again.Leone was a genius.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

America and the romantic Gangster illustrated to perfection,"Sergio Leone and Marconi have brought us some of the most beautiful scenes of cinematic beauty in their Italian made Western's.  They showed a more real version of the wild west then American directors dared to show.  The West was wild and lawless. We felt that all had no choice but to work outside of law as it did not exist.  America, from the 20s to the 60s and 70s, is a modern world of Democracy and Law.  Those who chose to be gangsters, did so out of their own choice.  Especially the Jewish ones, as they could all have gone to school and become successful in a totally acceptable manner.   This is the main difference between the world of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", and the world of ""Once Upon a Time in America"". Two different worlds and two completely different films.  Both mesmerizing.   We see the world and life of two Jewish Gangsters (Deniro and Woods) being Noodles and Max.  We see them from school children, to old men.  All parts important and shown in various forms of flashbacks.  All the flashbacks edited with music and scenery as to blend together in a dream.  The Actors who play the children, look like child versions of Deniro and woods.  The attention to details is wonderful.   The music is part of the characters and part of their lives.  At one point one of the charactors plays the main movie theme on a wind pipe.  We are watching a poetic fairy tale of gangsters in love.  They are in love with their image, themselves and their friends and sweethearts.  The movie is about temptation.  In one of the childhood scenes, a 12 year old boy is waiting to have a sexual experience with the local girl tramp.  Her price is an ice cream Sunday.  He has to wait until she finishes with someone else.  While he is waiting, the ice cream starts to melt and the camera pans the boys face.  He licks the melted cream and watches it.  After a little while he has forgotten the girl and finishes the ice cream.  He is just a boy after all.  His real temptation the ice cream and the sex just a result of peer pressure.   The scene is without dialogue and is beautiful.This is a Leone film and our hero is still thoughtful and silent.  Here he is played by Deniro and we are in awe as to how a great actor can convey the silent hero with expressions and emotional force.  Deniro is superb.The constant flashbacks in this film should make it hard to follow the story line, but instead sucks us into the characters, their motives and their life.  It sucks us in and we are captivated.  This captivation this interest allows us to follow the story with ease.  This is brilliance of the movie.Leone has made a different film then he has made before and he has kept his style and reinvented the Hollywood version of the Gangster film.  There is no glamour in our thugs.  Even Deniro does not know how to make love to a woman.  After all he was in prison for many years.  He is a thug.   This is not ""The Godfather"".   It is real and stunning.The ending is perfect as it makes you think.   A smile give out the last fact in the story that is missing, but it lets you figure this out for yourself.     Remember the smile.   Remember Deniro in his greatest role. Remember Leone.Great film.  A must see for all who love what is good in the movies.",,Anonymous,Crime

Boardwalk Empire meets Sleepers,"I have mixed feelings about Once Upon a Time in America. I love Sergio Leone's work. The Dollars trilogy is endlessly enjoyable, and Once Upon a Time in the West is one of my favourite movies of all time. So I pressed play believing I was about to see a movie that would wrap itself around my heart, and which I would be thinking about for years to come. I guess I can't say yet if I'll be thinking about it for years to come, but I can say it didn't wrap itself around my heart the way I hoped it would.Leone does not lack for ambition. One area he has not skimped on is the length. At almost four hours, I assumed I would need to break my viewing up, but such was my fascination, I watched it straight through, and felt I would have liked more. (There is apparently a six hour version which I think would be a positive thing. The two hour twenty cut released by the studio in 1984 must have been a butchering indeed.)With such scope for story, I had expected the brassy, bold myth making about the founding of America shown in Once Upon a Time in the West would be replicated here, but transplanted to a toned-down, Godfather-influenced gangster milieu. Detailing the survival of an immigrant community amidst the changing skyline of New York seemed like epic material, but the story is much more interior than that.It may be wrong to judge a film for what it was not rather than what it is, but I was expecting something Leone wasn't interested in giving. This does indeed have the striking visuals I expect from his work. Not just the eye-catching beautiful shots such as the one used for the poster, but recreations of 1920's New York streets, and those near-trademark Leone close-ups of faces. There are sweet, smaller moments too like a character admiring themselves in a mirror, or a girl dancing amidst detritus. Beautiful and evocative.He is helped by a marvellous, and instantly recognisable, score from Ennio Morricone. As the notes swell, and young men skip beneath the shadows of immense structures, it is impossible not to marvel at the combination of sight and sound, and at what Leone has achieved.Yes, Leone plays those big notes beautifully but subtlety, psychological realism, forensic examination are not Leone's register, and the film suffers. The screenplay is working against the visuals all along. That's not entirely surprising as it's credited to 6 writers (including Leone), plus a seventh ""additional dialogue"" credit. That did not bode well.Our point-of-view character is Robert DeNiro as David ""Noodles"" Aronson. The film is mostly structured as a series of extended flashbacks told from the point of view of an older Noodles in 1965, returning to New York, and remembering his life there; the hard scrabble start, the enduring bonds of loyalty between his friends, their rise in the underworld during prohibition, the woman he loved, and his flight from New York.The tone is one of elegy and lament; for lost friends, for a simpler time, for mistakes made and paths not taken, but the film never engages with the adult Noodles as a person. The script does better with the young 1920s Noodles (played by Scott Tiler), who we are able to see as a charismatic leader among his peers. Once Noodles ages, and DeNiro takes over, much of what is happening is driven by others (Mostly James Woods in great form as the unscrupulous Max), while DeNiro is left to look on inscrutably.DeNiro often plays characters who don't give away much but the screenplay almost loses interest in him after 1920 except as a witness to ongoing criminal enterprises.
Even in his personal life, Noodles is stuck in the patterns established early in the movie. His love for Deborah (played by Elizabeth McGovern as an adult, and the radiant Jennifer Connelly as an adolescent) is set in stone. Why he feels anything for her years later, why she should like him at all are never explored. When we meet Noodles, he is already entranced by the princess-like Deborah which we can understand given the glimpse she gives him of something beyond the grime and grind of his life - but she remains a cypher, and his lover for her just an unalterable fact.This brings us to the outrageous sexual politics of the movie. Twice we watch Noodles rape a woman. At least the second time, the film recognises it for the horrific violation it is. The first time, it is suggested the victim was more or less complicit, and encouraged/enjoyed it. Tuesday Weld as Carol is a welcome spark in the film but that scene's ugliness and the use of rape as a plot point is a mis-step the film can't overcome.There are other tonal inconsistencies which hurt the more somber side of things. (A scene where the men whip out their penises to see if Carol can recognise which man raped her toy fondling them particularly stands.) Some of the dialogue is painfully on the nose, and the gangs rise is depicted as ridiculously easy. The four boys come up with ingenious inventions, conveniently come by blackmail material, and can take out any opposition they come across while bullets (mostly) glance off them. All of that contrivance pales compared to some final act plot revelations which stretch credulity way past breaking point. There are holes wide enough to drive several hearses through.These final scenes of a man reckoning with his past are intended to provoke an awestruck recognition of a man realising who he is, but instead produce eye rolls.
I love how this films looks, and its ambition in depicting a slice of New York through the decades but the film only ever skims along the surface of these people's lives, leaving beautiful ripples but a sense we missed the deeper currents beneath.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The 8+ rating threw me off, not worth the time.","Long scenes that don't add to mood, character arc, motif, aesthetic or anything else that I would expect from a film. Mostly reticle acting, some OK. The story itself just seems to me like a bunch of bros dealing with their stupid ideas and regretting some of them, but mostly just acting like total a**holes. The rest of society seems to think that they're cool or something, and they don't seem to have very good reason to even survive in their own world, so they basically drift between intensifying chaos and doing whatever they feel like. I didn't hate the movie, but I did hate wasting more than 3 hours watching such nonsense just to get some obvious metaphors that have been drilled on any other b-movie. Not worth it.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Leone turned down The Godfather to make this. It was the right decision.,"Don't get me wrong, I love The Godfather and all, but the story does not suit Sergio Leone's unique and distinctly European style of direction. Once Upon A Time In America, on the other hand, was a story practically made for the man. Running at over three and a half hours in the most complete cut known to exist today, its pace might be leisurely and its action incidental, but one other thing it has in common with other Leone films is that it is never slow or boring. As a film about gangsters, it is a fine example. As a film about looking back upon the twists and turns life can take, it is a masterpiece. Although there are moments when its sets or props reveal the time the film was shot in, OUATIA is a timeless exploration of how the bonds between boys stretch, alter, and even break as they become men. The tagline (""As boys, they said they would die for each other. As men, they did."") is surprisingly accurate in summarising the film in spite of the fact that it gives very little away. It was Leone's last film, and a more fitting memorial simply does not exist in the medium.Ironically, for a film directed by a man who has yet to be equalled for using the 2.35:1 frame in a dynamic fashion, Once Upon A Time In America is the first film Leone shot in the 1.85:1 ratio. I have to confess the cinematography disappointed me somewhat, with this narrower composition clearly allowing fewer opportunities for creative crowd shots. However, there still are fine examples abound of why a film should never be pared down to fit the box-like television that is now thankfully on its way into the kind of nostalgic past that this film spends a lot of its time depicting. Complementing the visuals is a score by Ennio Morricone that, while recalling shades of C'era Una Volta Il West, also provides a more subtle, emotional undercurrent for the visuals. The strings and choir heard when a rather young Jennifer Connelly is visible remind one of the haunting soloist heard when Jill McBain steps out into the train station being built at the end of the aforementioned C'era Una Volta Il West, only it is just as good and far more restrained.Of course, no film can be what it is without actors, and Once Upon A Time In America has some of the best. The featurette included with the DVD-Video edition features James Woods describing how privileged he feels to have worked with Leone, and his performance in the film indicates he felt that way from the first. De Niro is also impeccable as the adult Noodles, portraying a young man, a middle-aged man, and an elderly man filled with regret using equal levels of skill and artistry. But in a contrast to Leone's other films, the surprise here is in the bit parts, where even the small walk-ons are portrayed with aplomb. Also surprising are the performances of the youngsters who portray our heroes during the earlier stages of the story. The aforementioned Connelly is a delight to watch, but Scott Tiler and Rusty Jacobs excel as youthful versions of De Niro and Woods. Even if you dispute Leone's composition and writing skills, one thing this film erases all doubts about is his ability to choose the right actors for the roles. Or perhaps he just brought out the very best in people.Roger Ebert has said that editing is the soul of the cinema. He also said it was The Brown Bunny's salvation. In the case of Once Upon A Time In America, excessive editing was its damnation. For some reason too illogical to contemplate, the distributors chose to cut OUATIA from its intended length down to a little more than two hours. As Ebert has also mentioned, this decision, as well as that to arrange the scenes in a chronological fashion, made the film seem far longer than the more complete 229-minute cut, and also deprived it of that critical ability to make sense. If you hear someone telling you that this film is lousy or not well-paced, make sure to ask them which version they have seen. Leone has said that he would have liked the film to be anywhere from 250 to 265 minutes. One can only wonder what this other footage would have revealed, but alas, it is in a raw and possibly unusable state. Leone reportedly wished to finish these scenes for a future release, but we all know what happened next, sadly.The use of transitions is also nothing short of brilliant. Early in the film, we hear a telephone ringing quite persistently, and the first twenty or so minutes feel quite disjointed. It is a testament to how well the film comes together that not only do all the pieces fit together like a sports car, the sound of a telephone ringing later in the film feels quite ominous. It is also a testament to the makeup artists' skill that Robert De Niro and James Woods appear at the chronological end of the film looking so old and ragged. About the only slip-up is that several of the main characters change eye-colour when they switch from their adult to child incarnations, and vice versa. For a younger cinemaphile seeing the film for the first time, it can be fun simply to see actors we have been taught to revere in the roles they played before they made portraying mobsters seem routine. After seeing OUATIA, I have developed a whole new appreciation for James Woods as an actor.Out of ten, OUATIA is an unqualfied ten. Were I asked to choose a hundred films to send to an alien planet to demonstrate the creativity of mankind, at least two of them would be Leone's work, and OUATIA is certainly one of them.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Long but not boring.,"Leone's last film is also his longest, at least in its widely accepted 'complete' version, and it represents his most drastic shift in terms of tone, time-period and, in some ways, theme. 'Once Upon A Time In America (1984)' isn't a western, nor even a proto neo-western, and it shares much more in common with 'serious' 70s movies such as 'The Godfather (1972)' than with its own, often partially light-hearted predecessors. Still, that isn't an inherently bad thing. Neither is the picture's length, which is primarily a product of Leone's desire to take his time with each and every shot while also covering around fifty years of the protagonist's life. Though it does feel a bit baggy and, at times, aimless, taking a pair of scissors to it wouldn't solve anything (as evidenced by the reception of the apparently nonsensical two-hour cut originally shown in the US). For a film that's nearly four hours, it remains surprisingly engaging. It isn't energetic, by any means, but it's always interesting and feels like it knows what it's doing. The movie's most entertaining moments actually come from, essentially, an extended flashback (though, its general time-hopping structure doesn't have a definitive jumping-off point). This part depicts its characters as young teenagers, portraying their initial descent into crime as one of circumstance and naïveté. It's an engaging segment that carries with it a sort of coming of age, and it does a lot of the legwork for the rest of the picture. Once the characters become adults, they're a lot more callous and, as a result, a lot less empathetic. We're aligned with the lead as he's reintroduced to his old friends and is inducted into their new line of work, but he soon slips away from us to become a pretty unlikeable guy. I mean, his instantaneous willingness to rape is enough to prevent any real attachment between audience and character. However, he's still an interesting persona and his journey is one worth watching, especially as it moves into his later years. By the time the ending rolls around, you might have become somewhat numb to the storytelling. It's for this reason that the final act doesn't quite work as well as it, by all rights, should. Don't get me wrong, the ending is good and the moments leading up to it are arguably the flick's most intriguing. It's just that much of the movie - in the second act, especially - kind of stays at one level of intensity, which creates a sort of monotone state that can't be broken simply by a slightly more entertaining sequence. This is perhaps the picture's biggest problem; it simply isn't all that gripping. However, it's enjoyable enough for its majority and it deals with some interesting, if underplayed, themes. Plus, Moriccone's melancholy musical score doesn't disappoint. Ultimately, it's perhaps Leone's weakest major effort, but it's still a good film. If you don't mind its length, it's worth watching once. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Laughably self-serious and empty of meaning,"As epic as Sergio Leone's tale of brotherhood and rebellion is, the result of this grandiose and pretentious effort smells rotten - its dirty tricks and machinations always evident - effervescing a stench of perverse human nature. I don't usually fault a film for such a thing. In fact, most of my favorites involve a greying morality and are usually quite ripe with provocative images and action. This film, however, is simultaneously so concerned with documenting evilness and yet is always interested only in perpetuating a style so abrasive that what little narrative significance does exists feels like disingenuous afterthought.The characters are thin and underdeveloped. Robert De Niro plays Noodles (a name that becomes more ridiculous and vaudevillian with each utterance) who is the only character the film even feigns an interest in developing. The opening section (after a brief and brutal prologue that sets the stage for the incomprehensible ugliness that is to follow) show's him later in years, dealing with the moral complexity of his life in a retrospective shroud of thought, which at the same time, anticipates the reimagining of a life better off forgotten. This is the only part that works because the events of the film are presented as subtext and the power of severe sadness in Di Niro's performance is wonderful to behold. As soon as we see the slightest glimpse of what haunts this walking skeleton, all subtlety is evaporated and replaced with Leone's desire to appall.The film leads the viewer back in time to witness the formulation of such a monster. Young Noodles is a savvy and precocious rapscallion whose posse of ""innocent"" looking, little pranksters always follows, like a cartoonish wave of lingering stench. It is impossible to believe, for even one second, that any of these boys could ever become anything other than the butt of a cruel joke told by a world so unforgiving as to force children into a life of petty crime. Of course these boys, played by diminutive actors who bring little craft or nuance to their performances, grow up to be hardened criminals all the same. It is the film's intention to show that even the softest looking fledgelings can be corrupted by the savageness of their external environment. This idea is a good one but is ultimately tarnished by the film's handling of it, to where any prophetic meaning is drained by inauthenticity and derivative parody of other films like The Public Enemy (1931).Baked into this section of the film, are the criminal activities of the gang which are ever increasing in nefariousness, and a largely unnecessary subplot which introduces a plump neighbor girl who's always up for a shag in exchange for various offerings of baked sweets. I get that the young prostitute is used as a totem unifying the boys in their transition into manhood, but too much time is spent on doing little else other than gratuitously victimizing a young girl, whose appetite for sex causes the viewer to lose their appetite for the contents of the film.This young, Madonna character is used in juxtaposition of the pure, angelic force of beauty that is Noodles' love interest. Deborah (played, at first, by a young and stunning Jennifer Connelly and later by a beautiful but wooden Elizabeth McGovern), represents to him an alternative to the nefarious path of crime and hatred he has already descended upon. His love for Deborah is always trumped, however, by his allegiance to his family of young gangsters, and his love for his true equal and partner in crime, Maximillian (played by a typically repulsive and yet somehow banal James Woods).Max constantly distracts Noodles from his heart's truest desire and his imposition between Deborah and our rotten protagonist, creates an undercurrent of homoeroticism that runs throughout the film. This triangular dynamic represents the only interesting facet of this hallow and superficial spectacle, but is constantly undermined by such contrived and mawkish scenes of Noodles pushing away his could-be soul mate for people who he only ever looks upon with conceited superiority. It's utterly ridiculous that he would choose people for whom he has only contempt (other than Max) and for reasons which are never fully developed, over such a loving and loyal symbol of beauty and justness.What's more ridiculous is how many times Deborah comes back to Noodle's, hoping that he will finally shed his rancid, scaly skin, and embrace her whole-heartedly. Her blind denial of Noodles' unalterable character constantly contradicts the fact that she, on more than one occasion, proves that she knows she can never change this man who's inscrutable destiny has long been threaded already. This contradiction leads to the film's most vile and damning sequence.Noodles and Deborah, now fully grown, share a lavish and intimate meal together, adorned in their finest threads and accompanied by a live orchestra. This is all facade and pageantry, for as soon as they sit down and are forced to actually engage with one another, it becomes clear that they don't have any non-combative way of communicating. The possibility that once existed for the two of them to be together is no longer. Noodles, though he dons the attire of a refined sophisticate, is nothing but a thoughtless brute without any semblance of humanity. His lousy and weightless pronouncements of love which fumble out of his mouth in the next scene as the two lay together in faux-splendor, manipulate the viewer and knock them off their guard. This allows the brutal rape that is to follow to assault the viewer with maximum effect.To me, this unforgivable and unflinching sequence of evil incarnate, was merely another of its kind in a string of awfulness assembled by an ineffectual and grossly misguided piece of cinema (it's not even the only depiction of rape-in-real-time that plays). The film then has the audacity to take an intermission, so that that the viewer is forced to contemplate the vile two-and-a-half hours that they have just endured. If they are smart, however, they will use this time to stare blankly at the black screen, for the events that the film wishes for them to ponder back upon, are as blank and thoughtless as such a gesture.Sergio Leone is a true auteur whose fairy tales of moral messiness certainly leave their mark. It is to his credit that he made both a film which I consider to be a top-five all-time achievement in cinema (Once Upon a Time in the West), and this infamous, disgusting piece of garbage that didn't move me at all intellectually or emotionally for nearly four hours, all the while demolishing my surface-level senses with hallow brutality. That is the true fault of such a film; not that it shows such despicable acts of evilness, but that it does so without any tact or desire to use them as a way to say something greater about the human condition.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the greatest stories ever told,"This movie is unbelievable. It's much more interesting and effective than The Godfather. This movie is about the life of one gangster and it's told so perfectly that I feel like I experienced it myself. It's a crime movie but what's different about it is that we get to know everything about main character, like who was his first love, how did he met his friends, what was his first experiences with girls and many other details about his life so it seems like Noodles is a real person which you know all your life. It lasts only 4h but it seems like a life time and not because it's boring but because there is so many twists that it's hard to believe that all this could fit in 4h movie. There is some black humor and violence but that of course is not the most important thing in this film but still makes it even better.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Watch this movie more than once.,"Once Upon A Time is a great epic about the life of a Jewish gangster. It is a story about friendship and betrayal.The first time I watched this movie, I was so confused and frustrated, disturbing opening scenes, complex and detailed plot and a shocking end.For a second view, I got the whole picture, the opening and ending scenes began to make sense, the chronological order of the story was comprehended.I needed a third view to begin feeling the music of this film, and then the magic of ""Once Upon A Time In America"" caught me. I was fascinated by that wonderful soundtrack, the long scenes, regarded by some as boring, became more meaningful now, thanks to a great background music, which set a unique, intense and charged atmosphere, and that's what is so special about this film. It would have never been a masterpiece without Ennio Morricone's work.Once the story is understood, you feel more the intensity of it and some of the scenes become more emotionally involving. You will be attached to the atmosphere of the film to an extent that whenever you decide to watch a scene you'll continue to the end of the movie. I entered a whole new world for a week, the world of the American dream.OUATIA is a great cinematic achievement to be compared along with the great ones, one of the movies that resemble to myths, they grow in debate from generation to another, but the important thing is that you give the movie the time it deserves, because if you're not emotionally involved and focused on it you will be lost, frustrated and you'll probably hate it. But, if you concentrate from the beginning till the end and give the experience the adequate state of mind, you'll be amazed by what you'll get through.10/10.

A fable for adults,"This is an unforgettable roller-coaster ride, a mammoth 217 minutes (UK TV runtime) of love, hate, friendship and memories (Leone's words). And routine bestiality. Leone brought to the American gangster movie all he had given to the American Western movie in the preceding two decades, leaving this stuck out somewhere between The Good Bad And The Ugly and The Godfathers. I've only ever seen the full European cut (still well edited down from Leone's original), I assume the original cut US cut is the one that draws the bad reviews.Disjointed story set in 1968, 1923 and 1933 has handsome chap Noodles played by DeNiro being called back from self-imposed exile to his old stomping ground by someone after decades of hiding, he wants to find out by who and why. Although he turns out to have been a vicious murdering rapist gangster when young we have to root for him as he's really the best of a bad lot. We're treated to lengthy arty flashbacks and many heavy poignant moments, softly tender scenes giving way to scenes of brutal sadism  all in the name of so-called Realism. This, remember, is via persistence of vision viewed on a two-dimensional screen, with a fictional plot contrived to fit logically into a timeslot complemented by a stirring orchestral soundtrack you'd never get in Real Life. Leone himself said he never tried to make realist films, so why pile on the violence and smut? And to crown it all, within is a woman who apparently ""age cannot wither"". Morricone excelled himself with his score for this  like Cinema Paradiso, the film could simply not stand on its own without it, the repetitive and relentlessly moving and melancholic main themes, especially Deborah's Theme can leave you in tears and yet sometimes you don't know why. And they ""forgot"" to enter it into the Oscars nominations  Doh! Also the lush orchestral version of Amapola in the dinner for 2 sequence can give you a lump in your throat, though make the most of it because the dreamlike spell is ruthlessly broken in the back of the car come the dawn. DeNiro was perfect for the role of Noodles, his highly visible semi-intelligent thought processes struggling along but almost creating a few longueurs at times. The climax seemed a bit fast with all that had gone before  you might even call it a rubbish ending (hem)  but it still fitted in well. Even the static 6 minute end credits with Morricone's music is worth watching!A helluva lot happens in these 4 hours, good and bad and happy and sad  overall brooding melancholia spurred by memories of mistakes made. I love it with all its faults, and even though at times it makes me wince it's definitely a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE,"I came across this film last year and I constantly delayed watching it, because I thought I didn't have enough time and patience to watch. Oh, how foolish I was. This is the last film by master Sergio Leone, whose filmmaking knowledge is almost god-like, and what a way to finish one's career. It contains probably the cruelest depiction of mafia I've ever seen and it is as realistic as it should be. One of the themes of this film is friendship and bond that these guys once had. As their bond was broken, nothing remained the same. This is a valuable lesson, indeed. Shame on WB studio which cut this masterpiece and made blurry and tragic version without any flashbacks, which ruined Leone's reputation and career. Again, this film is an absolute pleasure and I can't wait to see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Why I liked this film more than Coppola's ""The Godfather""","Not many realize that Sergio Leone was offered the chance to direct Puzo's ""The Godfather"" but opted to make ""Once upon a time in America."" They say he regretted this decision later in life--but it would be pertinent why someone like Leone would have made such a decision.Any Leone fan would know the importance the director gives to music, structure of the story, the importance of money and how it corrupts many values. All these elements are underlined in this gangster film. In Coppola's work, the story afforded more importance to social details, character details and fabulous camera-work. Both works are monumental--but I preferred Leone's work, truncated to less than 4 hours than his original cut of 6 hours.The music. Leone's favorite Ennio Morricone provided one of the finest film music for this film and he won awards for this film as he had won praise for Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" and a host of other spaghetti westerns by Leone. But the real contributor of music was a Romanian flute player called Georghe Zamfir who plays the brilliant ""Pan's song"" just as Zamfir played the same tune equally effectively in Australian Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" made 9 years before Leone's film. Weir and Leone both know their music and both need to be complimented for picking up this obscure Romanian to enhance their films. Leone's cinema does not limit to brilliance of music--he uses sound to give effects that surpass the camera eye. The ringing telephone--a telephone ring that persists before the number dial moves on the instrument--provided a stamp of Leone that no viewer will easily forget--and no director had accomplished so effectively. Of course, the telephone call was so central to the film's plot. If the telephone was not enough, the sound of the lift moving up (without a passenger) plays another aural reminder of Leone's cleverness behind the camera.The structure. Leone's screenplay of switching from the present to the past and vice versa increases the entertainment value. Coppola's work was linear and less demanding of the viewer. In many ways Leone's work comes very close to the Coppola's third ""Godfather"" film--his least appreciated Godfather film, which mixes pathos, irony and closure to intrigues. Leone's film is many ways quite philosophical as was Coppola's ""Godfather III""--far removed from the brutal and power-hungry Godfathers I and II. Leone was able to add a dash of comedy--scenes with antics of the Artful Dodger in Carol Reed's ""Oliver!"" are copied in the sequences of the early years. Leone's comedy can span from a simple act of hungry boy eating a cream pastry that he had bought to impress his love interest to a young girl taunting her boy lover that ""his mother is calling"" when his male friend whistles. Coppola's cinema rarely dealt with comedy, unless it was a precursor to tragedy. Several sequences where Leone switches time--the eyes of the protagonist changing from the old to the young man, the appearance of the protagonist in the railway station, and the Frisbee hitting the protagonist as he walks the lonely cold street--makes the film more exciting and colorful. The long film is suddenly less boring as it entertains you while unfolding the saga. The switching of the female child with the male, the corruption among the law enforcers, and the obvious dwarfing of the female characters against the male parts for Leone appears more pronounced than in Coppola, because the intent is to underline the weakness of male folly at the height of their power.The film is Leone's essay on American's interest in getting rich and powerful at the cost of simple values of honor and friendship. At the end the director emphasizes the importance of honor and friendship even among gangsters and even women who often ultimately seek the rich guy to live with rather than the true lover.The effect of De Niro's final laugh at the camera can be interpreted in several ways. Who is he laughing at? The camera? The audience? The irony of his life? Is the chase for money worth it? It reminds me of Richard Burton's character, a vicious bank robber in the final shot of the British film ""Villain"" (1971) turns around at the camera and shouts ""Who do you think you are looking at?""Leone could not have made ""Godfather I or II"", but he could have dealt with ""Godfather III"". And Coppola could never have made ""Once upon a time in America"". Leone's decision to change the name of the film from the novel's name ""The Hoods"" gives an indication of where the director is leading the audience.The more you see the film you realize the film is a robust one that will stand the test of time because Leone did not want to merely present an interesting saga on screen but entertain intelligently.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

An epic masterpiece of pure cinematic wizardry!,"Sergio Leone's final master-piece and a swan-song to outdo all swan-songs. Once Upon A Time is a purely magical film, as good as Sergio's other Once Upon A Time film, set in the West. A great debate rages as to which film of Sergio's is his best and that is a question I can't answer having not seen all his pieces. There is no doubt he has done several classic films, with his best Westerns and this gangster epic. What makes Sergio's films so magnificent is their timelessness. Leone's visual eye is astounding and while watching some old films can sometimes feel stale, past it. Leone is a director whose use of the camera was revolutionary, dynamic and iconic. Leone is perhaps one of the most inspirational and mimicked directors ever.This is a movie of pure cinematic beauty. It is wonderfully shot and the lighting is fantastic. The sense of timing Leone's films have is amazing with each scene and captured performance magnificent. America is a marvellous movie to behold and never drags, even at near 4 hours. The narrative is told in a Tarantino-esque (I don't like referencing Quentin and make him sound like the inventor of a non-linear plot but he is the most famous user) with the action switching from the end of the 60's when it is set, right back to the 20's. The story is a recounting of the life story of Noodles, growing up from a young street hood, to a big time gangster to a kind of tragically lonely old man. The film focuses on his development through a 50 year period of his life about his friendships, loves, and guilt and betrayal. Noodles is magnificently portrayed by Robert De Niro in a role that a lot regard as one of his all time greats. Like every other aspect of the film, De Niro was tragically ignored by the Academy that year, and the film didn't receive one nomination. That's Oscar politics for you though, the film flopped and was as such ignored. The film shows the absolute pinnacle of perfection in acting (on several fronts, but particularly De Niro and James Woods), directing, cinematography, writing and perhaps most memorably the career best score of Ennio Morricone, Leone's long time collaborator.So the story is great as are the technical and artistic merits of the film, but what of the supporting cast? Well as I said De Niro is outstanding, with James Wood's coming a very close second. Other noteworthy performances arrive from Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams, Joe Pesci, Burt Young and many more. What works so brilliantly in this piece is the amount of memorable side characters portrayed by ""name"" actors. Brief cameos delivered with memorable class, for example Joe Pesci and Treat Williams who come and go quickly leaving an indelible mark in the film. Special note also goes to the young cast playing the main roles in the early years sections. They are faultless and excellent. Younger actors can often lack polish and maturity in their performances. There aren't a whole load of Dakota Fannings and Haley Joel Osments rolling off a production line. Finding a young actor who can move up from giving an acceptable performance to having the ability to captivate is quite rare, and so for Leone to have found a lot of brilliant young actors who look remarkably like their adult actors playing the older versions of the characters is truly amazing. While most of these young actors didn't go on to bigger and greater fame, one did: Jennifer Connelly. She plays the young Deborah before Elizabeth McGovern (who is the spitting image of the young Connelly). Jennifer Connelly has of course developed into an Oscar winning and excellent actress and in her screen debut here she shows those early signs of excellence at a very youthful 12 yrs of age. Her performance is excellent, and in an integral and key scene that many actors of her age, and indeed older would have buckled under, she is superb. The scene has her giving a recital to the young Noodles (Who is in love with her). The performance is given with such maturity and with such a sense of timing and delivery that it is truly amazing. It was one of the best performances from a young star to ever grace the big screen in my opinion. She was a superb young actress, who developed into a superb actress and her performance here shows genuine talent and of course kudos to Leone for harnessing that ability and extracting it correctly.As I said Morricone's score is marvellous and of the best scores ever. The music of the film has also appeared in the Kill Bill movies as well. Morricone a composer of such a prolific CV manages to deliver a career best score at a stage in his career when he had been around for years. However he found and continues to find, the inspiration not to let his work become stagnant like some composers. Overall this is a film that is regarded as a classic, mentioned in the same breath as the Godfather films and Goodfellas. It is epic, beautiful and in all counts, masterful. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

How can you not give this film top marks,"This is a masterpiece of cinema it has its flaws don't get me wrong don't even go near the much maligned cinema cut ,the 3 hour plus cut is the closes to Sergio's orginal vision.Anybody giving this film under 8 simply doesn't understand cinema and to start attacking the sexual content and violence in this film is just the sad state of affairs with live in today , films are not moral compasses somebody even criticised the fact that it's about Jewish gangsters as laughable just shows you the level of knowledge and brain cell count of some of the people who have marked this film down.

One of the most captivating movies I've ever seen,"I first saw ""Once Upon a Time in America"" quite by accident, twenty years ago. I was visiting the US to attend business meetings. Late one night, after a long, long day, I returned to my hotel room and turned on the TV while I got ready for bed. There was this movie that seemed to have just begun. I sat on the bed for (what I thought would be) a moment to decide whether to keep it on. I started to take off my tie and shoes as I did. . . Nearly three hours later, I realized I had not got beyond that. I had become totally captivated by the violent tale that unfolded on the screen. I've never quite figured out what chord this movie struck within me. Perhaps the terrible waste and regret that arises from the virtually mindless, unbridled pursuit by Noodles and his gang, of their extraordinary appetite for pleasure and wealth? Why I would resonate so strongly with that, I have not tried to fathom.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
More than just a movie,"A gangster-action film with almost mythical greatness; a fable that deals with the question of friendship and betrayal of human integrity. In a broad arc, it encompasses the period of more than 5 decades, associating it again and again with fascinating comments of the current events. Almost four hours of film full of tension in the plot but also tension throug human relationships.
Maybe the greatest movie ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
It is worth the four hours of your lifetime,"I saw this film about five times now. And it is always a great pleasure. I recommend it every time and nearly everywhere, because that movie is outstanding. I know, it is not easy to follow the plot, because there are a lot of timeline´s to come clear with, but it is worth it. I like movies in which there are a lot of ideas (story and screenplay) guiding you to a final climax at the end of it all. In OUATIA you are told the story´s of a bunch of kids, becoming the mob. It is entertaining the whole time (yes, a little bit slow sometimes,okay) and it leads to the point where it´s obvious that all the lives are just wasted. No friendship and no love does exist in the life of these guys. The way that the movie tells you that, makes me love it. Yes, Noodles is only a character, and the character is a killer, smuggler and whatever, but beholding the wasted life of this man really makes sad! The film creates emotions, and that´s what movies and music are made for in my opinion. If you´d ask me - I would watch it!

The absolute worst R-rated movie that I've ever seen.,"I still don't understand many of the high ratings for this movie. It's so unreal.The cast is terrible, and I don't care if De Niro is in it, because in all honesty he does a terrible job, and the character that he's playing is so despicable. It's just not worth wasting almost 4 hours of your life. I've seen it, so that you don't have to.If I could rate it -35/10, I would. That's how awful it really is.

Genius,"This is a movie that I had heard about and was told that it was something special. To be honest I was a little skeptical. I've seen to many Robert De Niro films and can almost predict how hes gonna handle the role after seeing a few minutes of him in character. Im never exactly right but I'm usually pretty close. Ask my stepdad. But he did this in a way that I didn't expect. This performance is Immortal. And I don;t want to ruin it for anyone so I'll say no more on it.Now the film itself is a film that could be great with the worst cast. But because each cast member gives a sublime performance, the film is all the better for it. I was especially impressed with James Hayden who I thought was the best actor during the ruthless scenes but you never thought he was overly ruthless as a character out of those scenes.The film is like a long visual poem. Each segment is beautiful, sometimes haunting and seamless. The lighting captures the emotion perfectly, sometime appearing contradictory to the mood but that bolsters the audience's unease. Overall the camera-work is stunning.Forget every great script you've read or heard in film. This one is terse, occasionally taciturn and highly entertaining. Words cannot describe something full of them.This is a masterpiece. No Godfather comparisons please. Different types of gangster films which are incomparable.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Has its moments, but highly overrated...","Whilst this film does have a fairly interesting story to tell (although not as interesting as Goodfellas) there are far too many things wrong here for the film to be hailed as a masterpiece as some people are doing...First there is the length. At 4 hours long, this takes patience beyond tolerable levels. Whilst films like Dances With Wolves & 2001: A Space Odyssey consistently give the viewer many great things to look at & listen to even when the story isn't moving, this film is far too pedestrian with none of that polish. Obviously the Director has used the run time to fully indulge himself - and some shots do work quite well - but we don't get anything approaching the beautiful docking scene in 2001 to justify the long run time. Obviously the studio tried to hack the film down to 139 minutes (which was even less successful), but a more sequential film would have been shorter - which leads nicely on to...The jumps through time. These didn't add to the experience much for me - and judging by many reviews, just served to confuse a lot of people; just watch Pulp Fiction to see how this should be done. Also this unnecessarily complicated the plot...If even the people giving this film good reviews are saying that it needs to be watched 2 or 3 times to fully understand what is going on, then how can that be a good thing? Films like the Sixth Sense which take on a new light when watched again (after you find out certain key points) are far different from films that you have to watch twice just to understand them. This film could be 2 points higher as a result of better editing & a tighter grip on the story. I for one sometimes get annoyed when I listen to directors saying that they chopped things out for pacing or purely just to reduce the run time - especially in films like Terminator 2 or Leon which are better in their Directors Cut guise. However this film could have benefited from that process.Overall, the acting was good, as was the casting - the younger versions of the main characters even looked similar to their older counterparts. The Direction, Cinematography and Music have their merits (these saved me from rating the film an average 5/10) and there is much to enjoy in spells, but as a whole, I think the film lacks enough visual punch & originality to outdo the Godfather et al. Gangster movie? Yes, but this is no Goodfellas.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome movie!,"Just an all-around fantastic piece of artwork! The acting was superb. The cinematography was outstanding. The direction was unbelievable. The non-linear storyline is second to none. Though on the surface, it appears to be another gangster movie, I see it more as a love story. Leone did a superb job of portraying the relationships of Max and Noodles, and Debra and Noodles. James Woods' performance was stellar, and Robert De Niro as always, is on top of his game. The Godfather is definitely the best of the genre. I would rank Once Upon A Time in America as the best gangster movie of all-time had the supporting cast been more visible. Though the supporting cast performances were right on, having some established Hollywood ""names"" might have helped. The Godfather offered a supporting cast that had more household names that the audience could ""connect"" with. That being said, Once Upon A Time in America is a true classic, in every sense of the word! Great start, great middle, and super ending! Absolutely the shortest 4 hour movie experience that I have ever had!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Masterpiece by one of the GOAT film directors,"Once Upon a Time in America takes time. To view and to understand.
So many are giving low ratings because it is too slow and complicated.

This movie is truly a epic,"i have seen the movie over and over and i have come the following conclusion. This movie was a lock to be a great one. I don't try to analyze every scene, every line spoken, why do that. To me the test of a good movie is are the characters believable? If you can answer yes then you can view the movie with real eyes and not critic eyes. Look at the characters in the movie who gave the movie weight such as Sally the girl whore who grow up to be a woman whore. Fat Moe a slob as a child and a slob as adult, these are real people we see every day and most of us know of these people.

magnifique,"One of the great moving pictures of our time.  Actually, I believe it's too short at 226 minutes.  Six-to-eight hours would have allowed for the necessary character development, and would have elevated the work to a new level.  The director's cut, however, is phenomenal.  Leone's re-creation of 1920s Lower East Side street life is breathtaking; the child actors are captivating (some feel they outshone Woods and DeNiro); the score will haunt you long after the closing credits.  No need to feel angry at Warner Bros. for the marketing disaster that clouded this film's original release (they sliced it to 88 minutes -- Danger, Will Robinson!  steer clear of this version -- secure a copy of the 226-minute director's cut at all costs!) -- we have the director's cut and we are happy. The fact that Once Upon a Time in America did not score big at the box office has no bearing on the quality of what you'll find on the video tapes.  Trust me.",,Anonymous,Crime
Needs editing--sorry fans!,"I am aware that those who rave over Once Upon a Time in America will find my gentle reproach a clear sign of the ignorance of philistines. But let us be perfectly frank: many of the scenes are larded with fat which could easily have been cut, increasing the pace and even leaving space to set up the surprise ending rather than dropping it in like (the filmmaker´s cardinal sin) a deus ex machina.The scenes of the youngsters in New York City evoke immediate memories of The Godfather, part 2, but that comparison did not help but harmed this viewer´s reception of Leone´s alleged chef d´oeuvre, because similar scenes in Coppola´s work are so much better plotted and paced. The true accomplishment of this work is to persuade viewers to sympathize and identify with murderers and rapists--pretty impressive that we find ourselves not hating but liking the main characters at the end. Both Robert DeNiro and James Woods gave excellent performances.I do not have a problem with extra-long films, if there is a reason for their length (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now...). As far as I am concerned, the surest sign that Once Upon a Time in America is not a bona fide masterpiece is that I had to watch it over three nights to get through it.

Not the Godfather,"The first half is very good. The young actors are excellent and the staging is superb. The second half is so so. The shot by De Niro at Marlon Brando is obvious but it doesn't work because the end of the movie is absurd, and also because it is not original like the Godfather. Good acting is not enough. Where the Godfather was epic, this story comes short. There are also some unnecessary vulgar scenes that are there because the movie was shot in the 80s. Again, the Godfather uses vulgarity with less frequency and more art.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Once Upon A Long, Slow, Time in America","I invested nearly four hours into watching this movie, largely based on an IMDb rating of 8.4 and having skimmed user reviews and seeing headlines that used descriptors of ""best ever"", ""epic"", ""masterpiece"", ""wonderful"", ""profound"", ""superb"", and ""beautiful"". Now usually I find that my taste in movies aligns to the IMDb reviews, so away I went. Mistake. After around 2 hours I was still quite invested and enjoying it, but then....not so much....at all. The pace is slow, the musical score by Ennio Morricone is indeed classical but at times seems set a mood that is incongruent with the plot and characters, especially towards the end when Noodles and Deborah are looking at each other over soft romantic music, considering the atrocious way that he assaulted her. So by that point the score was just annoying me.By the end I was wondering what robust conversations must have been had when it was edited multiple times to run between 6 and 2 hours before deciding on just under 4 hours. At least I didn't have to sit through the 6 hour version. I mean if you're studying film and want to write a dissertation on the movie and the acting ability of DeNiro and Woods, there's lots of material there to work with, but if you just want to enjoy the plot and engage with the characters, then not so much.

Complex gangster epic,"A former Prohibition-era Jewish gangster returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan over thirty years later, where he once again must confront the ghosts and regrets of his old life.The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut 4 hours & 11 minutes running time.Once Upon A Time In America is the crowning achievement of director Sergio Leone. It demands total concentration from beginning to end. However,those willing to submit will find it more than worth it.What really makes this film different is it's overwhelming melancholy. Leone's favourite loyalty/betrayal theme is there,but the film is also a study of memory,of a lost soul coming to terms with his past.The acting in this film is an absolute joy to behold. This is one of the best De Niro performances.While an unlikeable character, Noodles is a very interesting study of a broken life. He is matched every step of the way by an exceptional James Woods as Max. Woods has said that this is his favourite performance of his. The younger cast members, including a 12 year-old Jennifer Connelly, are especially effective during the flashback sequences.The combination of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone is epic and the mix of actors are outstanding. Sergio Leone's epic crime drama is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best crime dramas,"This movie is huge. I've seen the massive 229 min cut. And surprisingly it did not feel that boring! The pace was slow but for this story it was absolutely necessary. Otherwise the story wouldn't fell the way it felt. I was tired but also satisfied when this ended.The acting was fitting. The child actors did an amazing job. In some cases I think even better than their adult counterparts.One might get confused at the way this movie is shown. The constant switching between present time and the past might seem weird but its a massive buildup for the last segment. Once a person sees it all, he/she would understand why it was shown that way and would for sure appreciate the making.The long shots and the enthralling musical score that shows and makes sure channels all the emotions into the viewers was expected from Sergio Leone. I always enjoyed his work and this didn't underperformed at all. It's sad that this was his last movie.This was an epic tale and one of the best crime dramas I've seen so far.

Once upon a time there was Sergio Leone,"Sergio Leone's life-long struggle to make the perfect picture would eventually culminate in a crime fairy-tale on Jewish mobsters, aptly titled ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984). And it would hold its ground despite heavy competition of Coppola's well received ""Godfather"" films and the critically acclaimed Scorsese's gangster epics. Made 13 years after his previous picture, Leone's interlude as a producer didn't take away his passion to get the ""America"" project that was in the pipeline finally going. Eventually it bore fruit and would also turn out to be his ultimate one, and maybe his best. In it the former master of spaghetti westerns takes the time to tell a multifaceted story and crams several whole gangster lives into a nearly four hour long epic, still complaining about essential 45 minutes that he was forced to cut. Well, that's Leone for you...At any rate the result is an operatic classic based on the quasi-autobiography of a gangster turned informant, packed with period details of the 1910s, 30s and 60s. It's a nostalgic trip through half a century with time as the key player that washes over the viewer like a mesmerizing, beautiful dream in an opium den, however at the same time feels like a violent nightmare commenting on themes of past vs. present, memory vs. dream, love vs. desire and above all betrayal vs. friendship. Add to the extensive script that was honed for years an array of beautifully photographed scenes, breathtaking Technicolor cinematography and a truly numinous score, and you've got yourself a masterpiece. For it all is married with such a tremendous amount of meticulousness for details that one can't help but get lost in the gangster world of Lower East Side of Manhattan. Aside from Leone's superb visuals, the accompanying music that links times and suggests themes needs special mention as it single-handedly raises the aesthetic level of the whole production by another notch. Created by Ennio Morricone, the famous memories evoking melancholic pan pipes not only fit the film's emotional ride through passing time, but also help to transcend it.The flashback story, with bits and pieces falling into place like in a jigsaw puzzle, is what makes the films so overwhelming, so emotionally intense. This time around a Leone picture however is not so much about landscape and close-ups, but about characters and their environment, the area they live in and their history. De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello let it all come alive. And at the side of the young Jennifer Connelly the 13 year old unknown Scott Schutzman Tiler plays the young version of the protagonist Noodles and nearly steals the older one's thunder, which is no other than De Niro. On the one hand the street urchin's lightheartedness shines in the character's youth while the veteran actor immerses himself so completely in the aging gangster that the weight of his past becomes almost palpable.Sergio Leone not only made Henry Grey - the man on which the story is loosely based - a larger-than-life monument, but also himself as a grand narrator of adult fairy-tales. Actually, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is two movies in one, and the overarching flashback structure makes it an unforgettable experience. All that of course was butchered on US release that sank the picture - even more reason to re-discover it as it was intended to be seen, in all its nostalgic glory.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Fairy Tail,"What makes this movie better then the Godfather films - The storytelling structure of the way the film is put together. The way time and space are overlapped with one another is just sheer brilliance. Kubrick in his film `The Killing' made a great attempt at it and it worked very well in that film but here in `Once Upon a Time in America' one sees and experiences it in it's most pure and perfectly conceived form as of yet ever done in any film that has been made to date. The Director frames his shots most uniquely and everything becomes interesting and important. I have never seen or experienced another film quite like this one. Being almost 4 hours long it seems to pass by like a well paced 90 min feature. That's just how good this movie is. I have seen this film many times on Video, Laser Disc, and now the long awaited DVD release. (More on the DVD in a moment) fantastic character development like the Jennifer Connelly/Elizabeth McGovern girl, the two blend so well that when I first saw the movie I thought it was the same girl, and the mythic way that Elizabeth McGovern moves thru the film, she stays the eternal myth that never ages as all else ages around her, this is conveyed brilliantly in her old age make-up - She still looks like a young girl and yet you can see the age wrinkles, it is simply genius. Then there is the back-story when they are kids, it's a film in it's self and so wonderfully presented. So many other aspects of this film have been talked about by others I will leave that and talk of the DVD release - I couldn't wait until this DVD came out, I rushed to Virgin Records and bought a copy the day it came out, it look beautiful except for the glitches and the fact that disc one ends right in the middle of a scene and does not match the index at all. Well I thought it was just a bad disc so I returned it for another DVD of the film and when I watched that one it was the same, So I'm going to return this on in the morning. Looks like they rushed this one out. Beware. Get the Video (if you can or better yet the Laser Disc)  Major disappointment over this DVD. Someone Goofed on this.

Sergio Leone's finest work is poetic and beautiful,"This film is so poetic and beautiful. I'm a huge fan of Robert De Niro and I love gangster films, but for some reason, don't exactly know why, I've been putting this one off for so long. It's such a massive film but everything is so precisely done that you can't help feel absorbed by it.The story's about two best friends Noodles (Robert De Niro) and Max (James Woods) as they rise to become a group of deadly Jewish gangsters from street thugs in New York City, spanning over 50 years or so. As Noodles returns to the city 35 years later who once had to flee following an incident, is now confronted with the life he left behind. The first thirty-nine minutes of the film has mystery, thriller vibe, I was wondering what was going on. Then it goes to the childhood segment of the film which contains some of the best stuff I've ever seen. The entire film has this nostalgic feel to it, growing up and loss of innocence, reaching a certain point in someone's life where they look back to their past, sometimes with regret.The characters are written in a way that they're all flawed human beings. Some of the stuff these characters do really wouldn't set well with you. I was conflicted time to time, seeing these characters doing all these horrible things. As the film has three timelines and it tells the story in a non-linear way, which actually servers it a lot, it tackles different stages of characters' lives rather smoothly. Everyone in this film gives great performances, Especially Robert De Niro and James Woods. I can't say enough about De Niro's performance. His character doesn't say a lot in this film, I mean there weren't like any screaming your lungs out scenes, but his subtle expression lets you know what's he thinking. Ennio Morricone's score is so perfect that it hits every note. The cinematography is magnificent, some of the shots where they captured the landscapes, the old architectures of New York City, the whole look of the film feels authentic.Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America is undoubtedly one of the finest films ever made and calling it an epic is no exaggeration. If it wasn't terribly butchered at the time of its release I think it would've gotten a lot more recognition, which it clearly deserves. You can tell it was unlike any other project he took on as he spent more than a decade to make this film happen. If you do decide to watch it though, don't even think about watching the other versions, just go with the extended cut. It's 4 hours long, it takes its time to take you in, but it's so masterfully constructed that rarely a scene feels irrelevant and it's totally worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Well Worth The Running Time!,"Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In America is undeniably a masterpiece. A superb film on every level, it feels like the brother of The Godfather Films. While both this film and the Godfather Part II make use of the flashback structure and both feature Robert De Niro, all comparisons end there as this is a vastly different film. Yes they are both gangster films, but this is a different kettle of fish. Whereas the main theme of the Godfather films is that of family, here we deal with the role of friendship in the life of the gangster and how betrayal can lead to bitter recriminations and heartache. However it doesn't just tell the story of gangster betrays friends, oh no, it goes deeper than that. We go into a world where you question the events depicted and the role many characters play. This is a film with no easy answers and with it comes difficult questions. This is essentially the more deeper cousin of The Godfather films. We come to question whether or not the sequences in the 1960's are real. Is it just a dream concocted  by De Niro in the Opium den. It this a possible future, but one that is only possible. What about the brief case. Whereas in Pulp Fiction the case is more of a running joke, here it seems like a plot point that we have missed all of a sudden, while one also has to question why Noodles goes on to rape the woman he supposedly loves in one of the film's most shocking sequences.To be honest I don't think Once Upon A Time In America is as good as The Godfather films, but it is a worthy film to be lined alongside Coppola's legacy. The story by Leone and his direction are first class, De Niro shows us why he is considered by many to be the finest actor working in American cinema today, while James Woods proves that no one can play a psychopath like himself. Then there is Ennio Morricone's music. Sublime and perfect, like The Godfather films, Once Upon a Time In America is complimented with a fine music score that adds gravitas to an already fine film.Every part of this film is superb. The origin of the friendship between Max and Noodles is wonderfully done, the middle time frame sequences were we see the release of Noodles from prison and his reintegration with his friends and how it all leads to the ultimate act of betrayal and the later stages were an older Noodles reflects in the 60's all work well together. This film could have been a long, meandering sprawling bore fest, but instead it is one of the finest films committed to celluloid. However, it is not a film that is easily recommended. Nearly four hours long, very violent, containing a horrifying rape scene and an ending that  only leaves you with more question, I'm not surprised that many have been divided over it, but I love it.

Closer to perfection,"Once Upon a Time in America depicts the lives of Jewish gangsters starting from their childhood.Sergio Leone directed this long masterpiece twenty years ago, in 1984.This was his final direction.As usually, Ennio Morricone made the score for this movie, like he did to numerous Leone movies.The cast is something to remember.There are people like Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern, Burt Young, Danny Aiello, William Forsythe, James Hayden, Estelle Harris of Seinfeld and the young Jennifer Connelly in her movie debut.Those three things combined make this movie a masterpiece; Leone's direction, Morricone's score and the acting work.Some may say this epic is too long for them, I'd say you just have to have patience.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

For the first hour, I have no idea what the movie is talking about. But as the story unfolds, I am more and more attracted to the amazing gangster world. De Niro's acting is wonderful. With so few words, he manages to convey so much. As for the plot, the story is very unique in its design. It doesn't follow the time-line. Rather, it unfolds like memory, with a poetic beautiful touch. Another great aspect about this movie is the wonderful melody, composed by Ennio Morricone. It is indeed an indispensable part of the whole story.For post-95 like myself, Once Upon a Time in America is unlike any movie commonly seen today.

"Amazing mafia movie, about as good as the godfather","I had heard quite a bit about this film before I finally bought the DVD a few weeks ago.I had never seen it play on TV so I picked it up and watched it that very day.I must say, I was blown away.I knew it was going to be good, but the film was excellent.It is definitely in my Top 5 favorite gangster films.It's one of the few films I know which concentrates on Jewish gangsters as opposed to italians.Everything about this movie is great, from the score, to the acting, to the story.It's almost perfect.It's a bit hard to understand at times and you might need multiple viewings to get the complete experience.The film is in non-chronological order and jumps from three different time periods, the 1910's, the 1930's and the 1960's.We see the characters as kids, how they meet and how they start their own criminal activities while worrying about another gangster.They then jump to the 1930's, where they are adult gangsters, robbing banks and dealing in alcohol during prohibition, and finally the 1960's where the leader returns to the old place after 35 years.The cast of the film involves Robert De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, William Forsythe and Jennifer Connelly.The acting is excellent from everybody involved.It's quite bloody and violent for a 1980's film.It's also a good thing the original version has been released here.Apparently, for the U.S theatrical release, the film company cut almost 90min of footage and re-edited the film in chronological order.This caused the film to be a mess, it got horrible reviews from critics and did not make much money at the box office.The original version is widely praised and is an excellent film.If only they had released that version in the first place.The cut version is very rare nowadays.I personally think this is one of the best mafia films of all time and if you are a fan of ""The Godfather"", you will probably love this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not recommend for a long haul flight,"A four hour movie download on the I-pad to while away those hours on a long haul flight seemed to me a good plan at the time. No, far too heavy, far too serious and far too long. I regret not putting aside the time at home to fully appreciate this.It's inevitably compared to Scorsese's absolute masterpiece, THE IRISHMAN and in many ways, including the plot and of course Robert Di Niro, this seems like an early version of it. The style however is completely different, I personally don't think you get to know these people in this film that well whereas in THE IRISHMAN we felt we knew them, we are therefore more shocked when the behave not like we'd expect. That's not to detract in any way from Sergio Leone's magical story telling. He perfectly captures the feel of each era, especially the 20s and 30s a lot better than a lot of gangster films actually made in the actual 20s and 30s did!Another film which this - or specifically the first part of the story showing us how the teenage boys turned into gangsters is quite similar to 1931's THE PUBLIC ENEMY with James Cagney. That owed a lot of its enjoyment to the subversive yet engaging personality of Cagney's Tom Joad. Leone's characters are thoroughly unpleasant like in the 1932 SCARFACE so here, as in Howard Hawks' picture it's the story, the completely believable acting and above all the fantastic atmosphere Leone creates which puts it onto that same exalted podium of those classic 1930s movies.If you're a dyed in the wool 30s gangster film fan and dogmatically refuse to watch any gangster movie made after 1939 ...and justifiably loathe Pachino's SCARFACE with a passion, don't think that this will be like that. This is class! It's not on a par with THE IRISHMAN but if you don't mind the gory violence, you should definitely like this. And conversely, if you like this give THE PUBLIC ENEMY a go - if you're not used to the 1930s acting style it might take a while to acclimatise but it will be worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Last gem from great director,"An epic final work by legendary director Sergio Leone. Originally, the material for the film was between 8 and 10 hours, so he thought of releasing two 3-hour films. When the producers refused, he shortened the film to ""only"" three hours and forty-nine minutes. In America, they were unlucky because a shortened version of two hours came out in cinemas, which, as expected, experienced a fiasco at the box office. I understand that some People film can turn down because of its duration of almost four hours, but the truth is that the film is by no means boring because it covers an action of almost 50 years and we follow three time periods that do not always go linearly. The film asks us to connect some scenes and find meaning. One such huge story about friendship, crime, power, money, human relationships simply requires a longer duration than the average duration of a film otherwise the end product would be an extremely bad copy and would make no sense. The great starring roles of De Niro and James Woods, the brilliant music of Morricone as well as the fact that this is the only film the director has made from 1971 until his death in 1989 make it a true gem of film art. The only grievances of the film, if I splitter, can be found in some scenes that, apparently intentionally as part of the director's vision, last unnecessarily long like a phone ringing twenty-four times, De Niro stirring a cup of coffee just over a minute or watching a boy secretly watching a girl practicing dance. A film that doesn't lose quality even when viewed again.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

I don't mind slow movies but I feel like there were some scenes that could've been shorter without losing any of its impact.

Extraordinary masterpiece,"I often go into the viewing of a long film thinking that my patience may not hold out for long enough to see the creative scope and vision in full, that I might forget how the story began. However, having recently seen two movies of similar length - Das Boot and Seven Samurai - both of which I enjoyed, I was willing to put the effort in to see if this critic's favourite could justify it's seemingly endless supply of accolades. The short answer is, it does.It all starts so inauspiciously. We see Noodles (De Niro at the pinnacle of his abilities) a broken, thoughtful man retreading his steps through the town he grew up in. At this start point we have no frame of reference with which to judge this man, no way of telling what his motivations are. Through longer and longer flashbacks we are able to piece together all the moments that define his life, and through those, get a feel for the man, to follow his triumphs and tribulations.As we do so, everything feels smooth and well considered in all aspects of the picture. The pacing is relaxed but never unnecessarily so, and when it does suddenly jolt and change it still feels right, never forced and contrived. We see the way people change and grow in the same way the city around them does. Simple, honest motivations of childhood wealth are traded for conniving betrayals as Noodles and his mobsters reach adulthood. Through the excellent dialogue and subtle expressions and body language of the actors, we are able to see how Noodles and his friends make difficult, character-defining decisions that are often advantageous but always come at cost. The character development from children to successful adults through to the melancholy situation of later years, complete with the many strings attached, is entirely believable.Leone has created a picture so compelling, so consistent, so beautiful and at times so very ugly, that it becomes it's own world. It mirrors aspects of our own life so perfectly that the three and a half hour length is of no consequence. It simply had to be that long in order for the rich fabric of the story to take hold effectively - so that the events of the first forty five minutes can be returned to with what we have learnt enabling us to make sense of it all.An extraordinary masterpiece through and through, and perhaps the only film I'll ever give top marks to. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Vacuous spaghetti eastern,"This film has its visually beautiful moments, poignant scenes, and revealing dialogue -- very few, scattered one per ten minutes of viewing. It also has mindless gore, unrealistic rape, and laughable motivation -- lots of them. Read another review for details.So, why was this film made rather than a much better one?In ""High Noon,"" the tenuous social institutions can't stand up to a few bad guys; the institutions are weak, though not evil. Ditto for ""Who Shot Liberty Valence."" We resort to individual violence as a last resort against evil.That's not the case here. Institutions are strong, just evil. Cops are on the take, protect scabs, ignore crime, while bosses hire gangsters to machine-gun union organizers, politicians organize business and union fronts for crime. It's everyone for themselves. There is no morality, just the strong and the weak. The time in ""Once Upon a Time in America"" runs from the start of Prohibition to end of the sixties, so this is most of 20th century America, including a period where they had some of the strongest, most responsive institutions in world history.It is not America itself that is of interest here -- 35 years of history are skipped over without a mention and another 12 years get only passing reference. There is a perception of something about America, something about those American westerns and gangster movies of someone's childhood otherwise spent under oppressive European institutions, something freeing about amorality and lack of social control, something justifying disobedience and adolescent rebellion. I am reminded of ""Love Actually"" and the character certain that if he gets to America girls will love his British accent and fall into bed with him. In the film, they do. And in this film, America is supposed to swoon over the Italian schoolboy daydreaming his American Gangster life.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not as great as other Leone movies,"While the 4 hour cut of the movie is nowadays celebrated as one of the greatest movies ever, it falls far short of masterpieces like Godfather, or other Leone's work. Sure, it has some nice childhood growing-of-gangster-age story, has a few memorable scenes, but the whole 60s section of the movie, which might be a pipe dream, is not so great, and the story, however you interpret it, is not as remarkable. It also all but celebrates rapes done by De Niro character (well cast as rapey gangsters fit his overblown persona nicely, and especially delusional self-absolving and lets forget about my misdeeds and stupidity attitude whilst judging others, in a self-righteous, with zero basis in reality, way). The gratuitous rape sequences and plenty of nudity fit somewhat better into Felliniesque European film tradition, Leone is not Fellini and thus the whole narrative seems to glorify mobster immoralities in a way more subtle works, like Godfather, never do. Subversive element is all but lost and all that is left is not so great, but still solid, ponderings of the older Leone. If you expect a masterpiece on par with Godfather or the best of Leone's own work, you might be quite disappointed. If you expect an overlong movie with some amusing growing of age story that celebrates rape and speaks of rationalizations of the corrupt peoples, with great film music and nice shots, it might be quite OK.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Once Upon a Time in America breaks innocence down in a masterful, but uncomfortable way","Once Upon a Time in America is a gangster film set during the prohibition as the main character, Noodles, and his gang of friends run their schemes. It is told predominantly in flashback at various points in Noodles's life; as a kid, as a young man, and as an old man.There's nothing quite like an epic. Every film has its own world that it designs and pulls you into, but in an epic that design is so much more palpable. Once Upon a Time in America helps create this design not only by its on-location sets, but in how the film takes its time to breathe in its scenes. Full minutes of characters not speaking help create a chasm for a viewer's interpretation. The scene Noodles returns to his hometown after thirty years, will remain my favourite. His old friend, Moe, wants to hug him after all this time, and when Moe reaches in, Noodles interrupts that he brought back the key to Moe's clock. It's a great early scene that sets up a lot of the texture of the film, and establishes the questions that the film will slowly reveal.It is, at times, a brutal world that creates an interesting relationship with the audience. Tarantino said of the characters in the film, ""the weight of what they're doing never rests completely in your heart."" To some degree, I agree with that. I think part of the rich texture director Sergio Leone is able to create almost seduces you away from the brutality of what's happening. But I don't think this will be true for all viewers. I think several of the scenes (particularly the rape scenes) will be forever problematic for viewers and pull them out of the experience, if not their ability to create empathy with these characters.The world the film portrays is so foreign. A world where, young women are prostitutes who accept money or pastries. Where children are beaten and shot. The section of the film when Noodles and his friends are young, are perhaps the most empathetic. Once Upon a Time in America's great work is then to take that innocence, and break it down in a masterful, but uncomfortable way.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
An epic that makes you feel like you've lived a life in 4 hours,"I think this movie would break IMDB's top 50 if all the viewers saw the REAL version of this movie - the 224 minute epic that was Sergio Leone's directorial swan song.

Frame by frame scenes, the quality of the film, the music, the acting (brilliant - with my main man Deniro ..aka GOD) and a volatile James Woods makes you feel like you've lived an entire life of someone when you see this movie.  Although The Godfather and the trilogy are my favorite movies of all time - this movie along with the GFather trilogy are perhaps the only ones who make the viewer well and truly feel like they've taken a lifelong journey - literally living a life.

And the ""flash-back/non flash-back"" screenplay is something never seen before, only Leone could have done that.Since then, I have watched this movie something like 30 times, and never get bored of it. I was amazed to learn that in the States, the movie was cut by half 2 hours instead of 4. WHY?Anyway, I hope to be able to see the director's cut soon. I'll leave with a question: Sergio was planning a movie about Stalingrad before his death....would that have been another masterpiece? Too late to know.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A film that shows what film can be,"One of the best movies ever made? Yeah, cliche comment you've heard before. But here Leone operates on every level a movie can, it exemplifies what the medium offers for possibilities. You can read it on many levels; a mythical gangster epic, or an allegory of the rise of American capitalism perhaps. But mostly, it's a truly masterful piece of direction.

Childhood memories and friendships,"The film stirred memories of my childhood as I walked the streets of NY. The friends made in the streets, and the brownstones alleys and roofs. The expressions, the mannerisms, voice inflections are perfect. As you watch it over and over (the 4 hours version) more and more can be appreciated and new things just come clearer. The visions of young love (lust)through the wall cutout. The sadness of watching the young lad waiting for Pegola as he ate the whipped cream cupcake. This movie made me happy, sad, brought the proverbial lump to the throat especially when Bugsy kills the youngest of the gang, while feeling the hatred of Bugsy's payback from the hands of Noodles.

A Criminall Underrated Mobster Masterpiece,"Sergio Leone is best known for his westerns, and with good reason. His 'dollars' trilogy made Clint Eastwood an international celebrity and pointed the way to newer, grittier westerns. And My name is Nobody was both a fitting tribute to and subtle mockery of the genre. But for his final work he moved into another traditional American medium, the gangster film. It was largely overlooked, both because of its original three hour and forty minute runtime, and a pathetic theatrical version that cut it almost in half. This is a real shame, because Once Upon a Time in America is one of the best gangster movies I've seen, almost on par with the Godfather.The film follows Noodles (Robert De Niro) a former Jewish mobster who's returned to New York after thirty-five years on the lam. He's been drawn by a cryptic message suggesting that someone knows who he is, and what he's done. While he seeks answers and catches up with old friends in the present, flashbacks take us back to the twenties, when Noodles, his buddy Max, and a couple of friends not even out of grammar school banded together to make some money, stick it to the man, and earn a name for themselves in the underworld. The flashbacks then proceed to the thirties, as the boys established themselves as some of the bigger movers and shakers in the Lower East Side, even as Max and Noodles drifted apart, leading to the tragedy that would leave one of them dead, and another on the run.Once Upon a Time in America is by turns comic, nostalgic, and poignant. It's about how a bunch of kids with lousy home lives and no real idea what they were doing rose to the top through luck, friendship, and determination. It's about a face of New York that was gone long before this movie was made, for better and for worse. It's about the price of success and how money comes between friends. And it's about guilt and regrets for past misdeeds, and trying to make amends.For someone born and raised in Italy, Leone has done a superb job of recreating prohibition era Manhattan. The hustle and bustle of peddlers' carts and throngs of people, the children scurrying across rooftops and down alleys, and the cops blowing their whistles and waving their batons are all captured so perfectly that it's as if the director were working from his own memories. And even though Noodles and his friends are up to their ears in shady dealings, and even though the streets are dirty and the neighborhood cop in on the take, it somehow seems simpler, almost wholesome as the boys plot, make promises, and chase girls. Part of me wishes I could have been there.But of course there's nothing wholesome about what they're doing, or what it's doing to them. Within a few years these boys have grown up to become hardened killers. There are murders, beatings, two rapes, and a scene where they nearly set a man on fire before finding out that their organization has switched sides and now he's their friend. Plus there's a death so gruesome it can only be hinted at. And most of this is before the betrayals start and everything comes crashing down.In the present, most of the scenes have a melancholy air, as Noodles walks through a changed city, one that has just enough resemblance to the one he knew to bring back painful memories of choices he made, and opportunities he lost. And when the answers to his questions arrive, it only brings more heartache as we discover that the lies and betrayals ran deeper and in more directions than he knew.The script is phenomenal, the production values sterling, and the acting truly exceptional. De Niro does some of the best work of his long career, bringing Noodles to life both as a young, ruthless gangster, and a tired, regretful old man. The make-up artists also deserve great accolades for their abilities to age the main characters more than thirty years. In the later scenes, De Niro looks almost exactly as he does today. And I would be remiss if I didn't praise the work of the child actors, particularly Jennifer Connelly as Deborah, Noodles's childhood sweetheart.Once Upon a Time in America is a film that should be seen by any fan of the genre, or the director. It's grand, complex, and deals with the full range of human desires and emotions. It's a real shame that it isn't more widely known.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A masterpiece!,"One of the greatest films ever made. This film should have swept the Oscars that year, but thanks to the studio, who did a hack job on the film, it was overlooked and many key scenes were cut. Creating an uneven and confusing film that lost much of it's impact and character development. But the DVD is one of the greatest crime saga I have ever seen. The cinematography is excellent and Leone's directing is uncompromising. There is a lot of blood and violence and there are several harsh rape scenes, but the film is a truly beautiful piece of cinema. De Nero is excellent and James Woods also turns in a powerhouse performance. To sit through a film that runs 4 1/2 hours isn't easy, but the time really flew by with this film. The ending was very ambiguous and reflective. A must rent for gangster/De Nero fans. The musical score is perfect too. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Beautiful, exhausting, emotional, existential and frustrating gangster epic","My opinion of this film has changed a lot over the past 25 years. When I first saw it as a teenager, I was interested but confused and bored for most of the running time for being too talky. Later in my snobby cinephile phase of 20's, I found it to be one of the most extraordinary and mystical films I'd seen outside of early Herzog and Vittorio De Sica. The bad ""old age"" makeup always bothered me though and took me right out of the movie. Nowadays I find it a greatly flawed film which aimed too high for what its script ultimately achieved.Almost everything technically comes off amazingly polished considering that this was basically a bigger-budgeted Italian crime movie as they'd gotten so good at during the 1970's. Sergio Leone handles every frame with an OCD level of craftsmanship and the production design and cinematography are as good as you'll ever find. Robert De Niro, James Woods, and many of the supporters bring their A-game. Personally I would have loved to have seen more of Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Treat Williams, Frank Gio, Danny Aiello, Richard Bright, etc. but their roles all come and go extremely quickly and often with no resolution. It's a shame, but this film is not really interested in portraying a conventional kind of narrative. Instead it plays more like a very languid, slow-paced dream for better or worse, including its share of impressive pathos and frustrating red herrings.While portions of the film have a humorous tone such as the baby-swap scam and some of the shenanigans of the flashback child actors, it's overall an extremely sad experience most explicitly conveyed by the graphic rape scene and extremely cynical presentations of relationships and sexuality. The women gravitate toward the men who treat them the worst and lifelong friendships dissolve at the drop of a hat once political expediency demands otherwise. What little violence there is feels extremely gritty and punches hard, but almost all of it comes early in the film and practically nothing of note happens the final half hour.Overall I just feel like too much is missing from this film to be a fulfilling experience and possibly if was all left on the cutting room floor. Who was Frank Gio's character working for? What happened with the union? Why all the emphasis on the main gang being Jewish when it doesn't seem to affect anything later in the film? Why the trash compactor truck? I would recommend this to film buffs as it's much more well-polished than something like GANGS OF NEW YORK. However it's not nearly as exciting or as enlightening of a view of the criminal underworld as any of Scorsese's, Coppola's, or Brian De Palma's forays into similar territory. It avoids a lot of the organized crime movie cliches but to a such point where I wonder if the narrative would have worked even better outside of the genre.As fan of eurocult and B-movies, I have to say it's still a delight catching glimpses of the likes of Salvatore Billa, Bruno Bilotta, Olga Karlotos, Mario Brega, etc. sharing the screen with American crime cinema actors in a major film. A lot of the New York exterior sets found their way into several Italian post apocalyptic films in the early 80's including RUSH, A MAN CALLED RAGE, ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX, and 2019: AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"One of the best and unforgettable films ever , an amazing cinematic feat that takes one of the highest places of cinema , a must watch !","This review is probably redundant given this is an all-time classic . I'm no cinema expert , but do consider cinema created between 1975 - to about the late 90's the gold era of cinema . Once Upon a Time in America is no doubt one of the greatest films of that era .This film has it all . Distorted childhood , crime & violence , love , corruption , friendship , patriarchal America (and world) to borderline and direct abuse of woman abundant at those times , to old romance , and evolving characters which the film accompanies from childhood to old age . The film achieves all that in about 3 hours , a feat hard enough that even TV series's features today with many seasons don't deepen to .The film jumps from the character's life's in the 30's , to the 50's ( just guessing ) and to the 80's with beautiful and unique visual appearance of both place and character , which makes it one of the most authentic feeling films ever . Those times are presented at times in a shocking unapologetic way , which only contributes to the film's realness . Once upon a time shoves the old poverty , crime and those cruel and confused , but still beautiful times in the viewers face in the most direct way . The criminals , the violent ,the rich & corrupt , the rapists , and those caught in between are presented without hesitation and without deviation , in a bustle of a city of colliding interests both cruel , criminal and humane .In contrary , with some characters the film does present a lot of gray lines and margins for the viewer . Can a criminal killing , stealing and raping be somewhat good ? Is his actions more understandable because of the time , place or the people involved ? Once upon a time has the viewer jumping from love , to hate , to pity , to understanding them . By the time the film is finished , you will be pondering for days about the special characters , and your affection & hate and understanding towards them . It says allot about life at that time , maybe you can feel all of those towards the characters ? And maybe after days you have a headache from overthinking about it , and feel little of all of those feelings ? In the end , I think personally I just accepted the story , the characters and the good and bad they went trough as it is , like they were real .To sum it all , the acting by all is epic , all aspects of the film are detailed to an uncompromising level . The characters involved feel real , deep , and the film leaves you with a very high level of perceived acquaintanceship with the time and characters , to an extant you find yourself missing an era , place and people you never knew , lived or experienced .Yes , it's a must watch , no doubt about it .",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tries so hard to be a classic.... and fails miserably,"The story of the movie takes place in three different layers - each being a certain part of the main protagonist's life. First, there is his adolescence, where he slowly turns from rascal to junior gangster. Then there is his adult life in his gang, and finally, his return as old man to his old home city, after 30 years of hiding in excile.The movie begins with a crucial scene: The death of his gang. The rest of the movie tries to tell the story of that event - how it came about, mostly.But all of this does not capture the spirit of the movie: The summary of the story pretends that there is some sort of development, some movement. Yet the movie manages to slowly ooze from set to set, from time layer to time layer, without ever generating excitement, without ever feeling as if the story was progressing. There is painfully little dialogue - and whatever there is is slow. How many times does one character ask a question, only to receive the answer after a long break, during which his opposite pretends to be lost in thought or emotion or just lost? As a consequence, none of the characters seem real. Given the cast and director, it is probably considered a sacrilege to point this out: But whatever they were doing for this movie, they were not in the least succeeding in portraying life, or lifelike performances. Perhaps on some other planet, frozen in liquid nitrogen, there are life forms with reaction times similar to those depicted in the movie - but on earth people tend to talk, and act, and live, a lot quicker. Stealing well over three hours of our lives for this movie is way too much.The only explanation is that this movie tries to be a piece of art - not entertainment. Which would make it a fairly ugly piece of art, showing prostitution, sex, drugs, violence, perverted sex, rape and almost every element that could shock or thrill, but without thrilling. And there are only two scenes in the entire movie that manage to shock. If it is to be seen as art, then perhaps they should have told the story as a long series of still images, as opposed to a movie (i.e. similar to the French ""movie"" that inspired ""Twelve Monkeys""). That way, the entire thing would not have felt so awkward and out of place, and perhaps, it could be more appreciated. Especially the soundtrack, as background to a series of images, would have made this a piece of art. In this movie, it feels oddly dominating - where there is little talk, the music is very noticeable. It is the only character that won't shut up...In the end, the movie tries so hard to be a classic, it feels obvious and annoying. The ending is confusing, and everything between start and end is boring.3/10",,Anonymous,Crime

For me this is hands down THE best film ever made. A masterpiece of cinema.,"The first time I saw this I was about 19 and it was maybe 1987 and my brother had hired it on VHS . I only started watching it at midnight thinking I'd give it a go until I got bored . But 3 and three quarter hours later I went to bed blown away, and in reverence of Sergio Leone. The following day (Sunday) I watched it again. The storytelling in this movie is something else and what tops it off is the absolutely perfect musical score that frames every scene, truly matching the emotions of both the characters, and little old you and me as we watch it! It's magnificent.And yes although it is a little dated in technological nuances and its runtime would be difficult for a modern 19 year old in this super fast paced world, but most of us have happily binged a season occasionally so do yourself a favour and put the afternoon or evening on hold and just get swept away in the lives of Noodles, Max, Patsy, Cockeye, Fat Moe, Deborah and Peggy from childhood through to adults and follow their story. And it is one hell of a story, filmed brilliantly as it switches in time from the present backwards, and forwards again. It can be brutal at times, but also funny and deeply moving as well.Most people I know who have seen this film not only watch it more than once but they all say this masterpiece goes straight into their top 5 movies of all time.And yes, I haven't been living under a rock, and I have seen Godfather I and II, Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction, Scarface, Taxi Driver, The Usual Suspects, Inception amongst other great films, but for me, this tops them all.The only reason I'm now writing a review after all these years is because my 21 year old nephew has just watched it today and he messaged to say how amazing he thought it was, and it is now in his top 10 movies, not bad from a lad born in 1999.

Once Upon a Time in America,"Told by way of a really potent (and well scored by Morricone) retrospective, this sits us down and takes us through a forty year period in the life of the now down-at-heel ""Noodles"" (Robert De Niro) and of the development of the city of New York. The contents of an old briefcase serve as an aide memoire as the retrospective illustrates just how he and three of his childhood friends decided that the gutter was not for them, and that using the ""system"" to get on was the only way. Prohibition, violence, crime, brutality were the currency back then and ""Noodles"" learned not to have scruples about such things. Love, romance feature too - choices, compromises and tragedy all feature as Sergio Leone and De Niro immerses us in the characterful and emotionally charged chronology. The film looks great, the attention to detail is superb, and a really strong supporting cast help offer us s sense that we are actually there for much of the time. Living and breathing the squalor, the danger, the opportunity and perhaps, the inevitability, of the paths these kids took in a the 1930s. It is very long, but that's effective rather than dull. It allows the characters to develop, to breathe and then to disappear - only, perhaps, to reappear in a different guise later on. Ageing is also a factor here too - just as they rose, others rise too with differing standards and ethics - their sense of loyalty and integrity not quite marrying up! No Oscar nominations which is really rather odd - this is easily one of the best, most authentic-looking, depictions of the rise of NYC that cinema has ever delivered. Director's cut on a big screen if you can - it helps focus the attention, shows the cinematography to best effect and helps appreciate just how vast Leone's vision was.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A brilliant film that demands several viewings.,"First of all, avoid the shortened version like the proverbial plague. The only one a serious moviegoer should invest his time watching is the full length film, which clocks in at 227 minutes.Secondly, to attempt to summarize this film would be to do it an injustice. No matter how well intentioned, there is no way a capsule review could begin to properly illustrate how powerful, moving and ultimately surprising this movie really is. Robert de Niro's ""Noodles"" is quietly understated...yet, it is his story that we follow from start to finish. A truly outstanding performance from a master of the genre.James Woods gives his character, Max, his usual intensity. Beyond this, he also fleshes out the individual so we feel we know him at many different levels. Still, the question ""do we REALLY know Max?"" constantly confronts the viewer throughout the film. His quick shifts from shrewd wisdom to angry confrontation rings true. The end result is that the story of these two criminal friends, covering the years from youth to old age, is believable every step of the way.The other cast members are all up to the task. Far too many to name individually, suffice it to say that ""the gang"" and the adversaries are equally outstanding. Director Sergio Leone, who had already created several masterpieces (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly; A Fistful of Dollars; Once Upon a Time in the West) surpasses them all (in my opinion) with this opus.Hint: Approximately the first half hour of the long version (again...do yourself a favor and don't waste your time and money on the short one) makes no apparent sense. Or so it would seem, as we time-hop back and forth from era to era. DO NOT GIVE UP! When Noodles takes a look through a hole in the wall at a dancing girl, you can be assured that the story is finally beginning to coalesce.

"""The pleasure is all mine""","This was originally conceived as a six-hours long movie in two parts, but the producers forced Leone to reduce its length. There are several versions of this film and it is interesting that the same critic who declared two and a half hours long version as the worst film of the year, a few years later declared the version of three hours and forty-nine minutes as the best movie of the '80s. No one saw the original version of six hours, and at nine o'clock last evening I finally sat to watch the directors cut of little over four hours. I finished it at five in the morning. I paused it a few times to let the impressions settle, rewound many scenes several times to make sure that I understood them well, or that I did not miss a single detail, or simply because I wanted to see them again. And when the movie was over, I had that feeling that usually occurs after the last episode of your favorite series that you've been following for years.The film is based on the semi-autobiographical novel ""The Hoods"" by Harry Grey, a former gangster, and it describes the path of a group of Jewish mobsters, since childhood in the streets of New York in the early twenties, through the rise in Prohibition, to the epilogue in the late sixties. The camera and directing are, expectedly, fantastic, and many of the scenes and details in the film are Leone's homage to gangster films from the first half of the twentieth century, but the story itself was nothing special to me. All the time while watching, I thought I'd rate it a seven or eight. But now, when it's over, I miss it. The film has a moderate pace, and the events are carefully weighed that at no time do they look movie-like, so that the story is very realistic and life-like. And the characters ... The characters are so well written and played that they feel real, and you will experience them as people you know and as if you are at every moment with them, somewhere just outside the reach of the camera. This is not surprising when you take into account that almost all the major roles are entrusted to Oscar-winning actors or those who have at least been nominated for this award.Two leading roles are played by Robert De Niro, who has two Oscars behind him, five nominations and over a hundred roles, and James Woods, with two nominations and over one hundred forty roles. There are also Elizabeth McGovern and Tuesday Weld, with one nomination each, Burt Young with one nomination and over one hundred sixty roles, Oscar-winning legend Joe Pesci, a man born to play villain William Forsythe with over one hundred forty roles, Mario Brega who played in all Leone's films, and many other famous faces.Leone's swan song is at the same time the first feature film of Jennifer Connelly, which was a stepping stone for the successful career of this Oscar-winning actress. Apart from acting skill, Jennifer is, especially to the male part of the audience, also known by the sexy body that she does not hesitate to show on the big screen. At the audition for the role of Deborah, Jennifer was less than twelve years old, and when the film was released in theaters she was fourteen. Although the credits state the name of the double who replaces Jennifer in the nude scene, some sources say that the scene was filmed with minor Jennifer, and that the name of the double is a scam to avoid legal consequences. It's a scene where Deborah gets undressed after exercising ballet (the ballet scene is inspired by Edgar Dega's paintings) and in which we see her only from behind, so I can not say anything with certainty, but it didn't seem like a double to me.And of course, we must not forget the greatest surprise this movie brings - the music was done by, you won't believe this, Ennio Morricone.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
10 years of writing compelled in the most beautiful 3h and 47min of all-time world cinematography,"First I'm gonna say that i've seen this movie completely 3 times , at different ages and i gave it different marks every time. By now,i can tell u i've seen plenty of good movies but this one stands ahead of all of them.First time i saw OUTA at 16,i didn't understand much of it and i gave it an 8. at 17 i gave it an 8.50 and now i gave it 10 and made it ""the greatest movie of all time"" on my list. If you ever get this movie make sure u get the Director's Cut and you have a free day cause it's about 4 hours long. You just couldn't ask for more : life,death,childhood years, first date,first kiss,love of your life, friends ,violence, humiliation, betrayal, faking death, scenes that make u cry plus an impeccable directing,close 2 the last detail, a haunting score and an brilliant storyline. If you'd ask me 2 compare it 2 the godfather i wouldn't stay even a second to think. The problem with OUTA is that is not as popular and well-known as TG and it's too long for some persons. If you're looking for a short and ""all-answered questions"" film that's not your type.for the others this would get you amazed,move,leave you stunned. In the final, i would like to say OUTA is an breath-taking masterpiece, a fabulous and haunting tale who will outstand the time.

An outstanding movie!,"A magical jigsaw puzzle that never loses its fascination! The soundtrack fits completely within the narrative and the narrative is musical! This has to be in the top ten movies of all time. As with all great art, the emotions are often simple, crude or even naive - yet that's precisely what makes this a magical movie.

The Last Leone,"Sergio Leone was not only the master of the western, but was also the master of the emotions. And with Once Upon a Time in America, a work he have dedicated the last rest of his life, he want to demostrate that once again, after give us some of the cinema's finest moments in the western genre. Based on a novel by gangster Harry Grey this is truly his real masterpiece, and also his testament, not only for the big cast in it, but for the characters, the music and also the emotions, the locations and the sensations Leone want to give us watching his movie. This movie have every genre in it (comedy, drama, western, noir, gangster, erotism...) and have a wonderful group of actors in it, that were De Niro, Pesci, Woods and Burt Young.This movies at his era was panned by critics, but now is regarded as one of the greatest movie of all the time. Leone gives many unforgettable pictures, but this is the PICTURE. And we're going to remember him because Once Upon a Time there was Leone. And it will always be here, telling new stories and give us emotions more and more and more.It would like to tell about Jennifer Connelly's nude scene, but that's another story...",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
it could have been a contender.,"Although great, ""America"" just doesn't stand up.As a whole, Leone's work ""America"" suffers from one glaring error- poor editing.  [And yes, I saw & own the 3 hr. + version.] There is of course, the notoriously annoying phone scene, where a phantom phone rings, and even when a character picks up a phone, it is not _the_ phone which has now been ringing for the past five minutes and quells the middle scenes which are important to putting together the entire jigsaw of a movie that Leone dumped on us.  There are numerous transgressions committed by Leone that were completely unnecessary.  For example, there is a long shot of Noodles walking across the street.  The movie is so long, that it did not need this added one minute of something that we've already seen and could have easily been accounted for with the addition of a small ellipse- it adds nothing to the movie, and we are forced to endure another minute of Leone's overindulgent splendor.  Part of what makes the film work is the strange, disjointed continuity.  Time shifts from Noodles as a young man to Noodles in his old age with a simple jump cut.  This, although interesting at first, is also rather annoying.The positive sides are numerous: the haunting score by Morricone floats throughout, binding each interwoven sequence together with a sense of tragedy, amidst the beautiful set decoration that in my opinion, is not paralleled amongst similar period pieces.  The shock of young Dominic's cold murder and the retaliation that follows is truly amazing and stands as a testament to the brutality of the times.  The movie wraps around you, especially in the ""friendship"" parts of the movie, with the early children, where you get a real glimpse into the native nature of each character, and the tightening friendships that illuminate the protagonists, especially Noodles and Max.  By the end, this massive epic leaves you with a sense of completion, and a sense of sadness.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A masterpiece...after the opening,"(This is a review of the full 229 minute version) When this film started, I took against it.The opening sequence is among the most brutal I've seen and is also totally confusing. In addition, there is an intensely annoying phone ringing in the background for a long time which made me want to switch off.I'm glad I didn't.I do not know why Leone chose such an off-putting way to begin what may be his magnum opus but it is worth persisting with this film. Much of the worst of it appears at the start.After the opening, the film lurches from an ageing Robert De Niro to events which took place in his life decades earlier. Although non-linear these make sense and are beautifully shot and performed by a cast uniformly excellent.There are many troubling (to me) aspects of this film including sexual scenes involving minors, rape and absolutely savage violence. All of this appears convincing in terms of the narrative and not cheap exploitation. This film is seductive because beautiful romantic scenes are interspersed with shocking acts.The 4 hours of this film passed very quickly, a surprise since as I say, I almost switched off after 10 minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Extraordinary.,"People ask me why I love cinema as much as I do. I usually reel off a list of titles and say ""Just watch this film"". ""Once Upon A Time In America"" is such a film. Sergio Leone was an absolute master of cinema and unfortunately, this turned out to be his swansong. And what a swansong it is. I can never get sick of watching this film. Without a doubt, this would be in my personal top five movies of all time. Luckily in Australia, we never encountered the two hour version. That would have been a fate worse than death. Some films, like ""Gone With The Wind"", use this length merely to show off. Everything in ""Once Upon A Time In America"" counts. Even the slightest line or gesture, like the running discussion between Max and Noodles about swimming. This is a film that lets its characters breathe rather than follow a set pattern. More than once, this film goes totally against what one expects it to do.Personally, I found the whole question of truth of dream that permeates the film, particularly in the 1960's sequences, one of the most compelling aspects of the entire film. I still have'nt decided where I stand as far as the ambiguity the film displays in this respect. The amazing way that aspects of these sequences, such as where Noodles comes face to face with Deborah's son, also named David like Noodles, are plausible, but at the same time exaggerated. For a director to even attempt to combine such conflicting emotions, let alone make it work as well as Leone does without detracting from the story, is truly remarkable. This is a gangster film that goes where few others do. ""Once Upon A Time In America"" is a film that relies on charcter and story, rather than mere visual 'tricks' or shock tactics. However, it can be extremely brutal when necessary. This Gemini-like change in mood can be seen as a mirror image reflection of Max, particularly as the story progresses.I could talk about this film forever. I'll conclude by saying that you can not call yourself an afficionado of cinema unless you've seen ""Once Upon A Time In America"". The words 'modern classic' don't even come close to describing the sheer unforgettable beauty of this tour de force. Cinema is a little bit poorer without the presence of Sergio Leone.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Once Upon A Time In America is a massive film; it is a landmark of its time and a colossal achievement rarely equaled.,"On the cover of the video for Once Upon A Time In America is a sepia-toned picture of a gang of five in trench coats and hats strolling past the Manhattan Bridge. The smallest of the quintet appears to do a dance backwards as if imitating Chaplin. This nostalgic shot eventually leads to one of the most unforgettable sequences ever captured in American film - a stunning mix of strong visuals and powerful music.Sergio Leone, whose film masterpiece remains to be Once Upon A Time In The West (1968), has embarked on perhaps the most ambitious motion picture about organized crime since Francis Ford Coppola's two-part mafia drama The Godfather in the early 70s, putting together an original cut that runs nearly four hours, transporting viewers back to nearly fifty years of American underworld history.Perhaps the most striking aspect of Leone's crime epic (apart from its extraordinary length) is Ennio Morricone's legendary score. Truth be told, it is one of the greatest film scores never to be nominated for an Oscar (due to a late submission caused by a clerical error). The beauty of Morricone's score is largely confined to the first half of the film where it is played more often and has its most resonance because it perfectly evocates the nostalgia of early 20th century America.Once Upon A Time In America stars Robert De Niro (Noodles) and James Woods (Max) in the film's two lead roles, and is accompanied by an extensive cast of young and old including a 12-year-old Jennifer Connelly, Joe Pesci, Tuesday Weld, and Elizabeth McGovern. The acting is consistent throughout; every role is given time to develop. This is especially so for roles which have two different actors playing them in two different timelines. Of course, the best performance comes unsurprisingly from De Niro, whose powerhouse display of male chauvinism and uncompromising personality does no harm in affecting his reputation as one of the world's most proficient actors.The bloody violence is reminiscent of The Godfather but Leone's film is harder to watch because there are two graphic depictions of rape shown. Although Once Upon A Time In America tends to devalue and victimize women by portraying them as objects of sexual and verbal abuse, the film's strength lies in Leone's ability to build a story around core values of friendship, loyalty, and brotherhood amongst men.Once Upon A Time In America does not move in a linear fashion. It is a series of inter-cutting character development flashbacks and flash forwards edited with excellence and assembled with coherence to a main narrative that reveals few things. Its puzzling ending is shrouded with mystery and till today remains the most talked about part of the film. Each character is distinctive and developed with immense depth, yet after four hours, we still know so little about them. Yet it is this enigmatic quality that these characters emanate that makes Leone's film such a satisfying watch.Coppola romanticized organized crime with The Godfather while Martin Scorsese's take with Goodfellas was explosively visceral. Sergio Leone, on the other hand, has opted for nostalgia. Once Upon A Time In America is a massive film; it is a landmark of its time and a colossal achievement rarely equaled. To see this film is ""to be swept away by the assurance and vitality of a great director making his final statement in a medium he adored"" (Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times).

Leone Is Remarkable,"First off let's just say Sergio Leone was a incredible director throughout his long successful directing career he has made many great films such as The good The bad and The ugly and also a fistful of dollars !!! BUT this picture is just flat out Amazing.
The music is spectacular and composed by Leone's life long friend Ennio Morrcione a oscar award winning composer ! And the actors really delivered a breathtaking performance . James woods showed such raw and great talent throughout the film as Max and when you combine a young Robert deniro with a director and acting cast of this type you will be left amazed like I was . I love how Leone took some ideas from all different films and added it to this one which went on to be his last before he passed away . He used flashback scenes to tell a story about a Jewish gang through the probation era and how young poor street thugs became successful Criminals also showed how in that life of crime friends and family mean nothing and being DEAD or being BETRAYED is the only way. I was lil upset on how Lil of a role Joe Pesci played in this film Fresh off a great performance with fellow castmate Robert deniro In RAGING BULL.
I couldn't believe how long the movie was and expected it to be long and boring I WAS sadly mistaking every minute of it is amazing and you really have to pay attention to every single detail or you might miss something . IT was truly amazing story telling this movie has everything from romance to murder it will change you're way on how you look at movies and gangsters it's a great ride from start to finish. The dialogue is very clever the conversations seem very realistic and legit .
They just don't make movies like this anymore
It's a shame it didn't get any oscars or the respect it deserves !! Because the of the 144 min version ! This movie should be seen in one way and one way only the 4 hour LEONE version not the short edited one .
Other than that ENJOY cause you will be watching a top ten movie of all time in my opinion and the best film from the 80's in this genre . If you think I'm crazy just ask Quentin Tarantino",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A tale about America: a model of a corrupt society,"In addition to the comments made on this site about this great film I would like to state something about one aspect of it.Last Friday I watched the movie (the long European version) for the third time in about 10 years and this time I was struck mostly by Leone's very grim vision on American society.Besides the very profound study of all its main characters there is an equally dark insight on society as a whole, and the title being as it is one can only assume that Leone wants to say something about how he sees the United States.This storyline particularly surfaces in the part concerning the union's dispute in which Noodles' gang take side with union leader Jimmy O'Donnell and another gang are employed (the Italian Mob?) by the police and the powers that be. It's not that Noodles and Max are very concerned with the underprivileged workers but simply chose the option that helps improve their own position.After the dispute is settled in their favor the option is given to Noodles and Max to go legal, Noodles doesn't want it: He sees himself as a crook and doesn't like the hypocrisy of the people who have the real power. He doesn't want to be part of that. For Max joining the elite is his true ambition. He knows that Noodles doesn't want to follow him so he uses his maniacal genius to set up up his reincarnation as a 'bona fide' politician. The insane plan of robbing the Federal Bank (which Noodles wants to obstruct to save Max's life) is just a smoke screen.Leone wants to show us that in the higher parts of American society the line between good and bad is very thin, if not nonexistent. There are just people who have power and people who don't but aspire it. How that power is obtained doesn't matter as long as you keep your dirty deeds out of the public eye.Of course it does not only concern America, It can be implied to many, if not most civilizations and nations in history, not least Leone's own country of birth, Italy.But the fact that Max -or Secretary Bailey as he is then known- chooses to dispose of himself by jumping in a huge garbage truck called Mack marked with typically American decorations can only be seen as a symbolic act: Of course this truck is not actually real and neither is the genius cross fade between it's taillights and the incoming headlights of the 30's style convertible filled with partying people, but that's the beauty of film! It can only be regarded as a personal statement by the writers.and director.",,Anonymous,Crime
I didn't like this movie.,"I know a lot of people liked this movie, but I didn't. I fell asleep during watching it on TV. Then I watched it on tape at a friend's house.

History,"Silence. Black backdrop and white letters. A murder. A search. A ringing phone. This is the beginning of one of the best movies ever. What follows is almost four hours of pure Cinema. Sergio Leone's final film is an elegy of gigantic proportions, a tour de force that shows who really are the hands that built America. Spreading from the beginning of the century to the end of the prohibition until the 1960's, this movie raised the foundations for all the stories about friendship and brotherhood, and established a way of making movies that continues to influence countless generations. The editing work is astonishing, the period detail priceless, and Ennio Morricone's score is already considered one of the best scores ever did for a film.

A marathon masterpiece,"Different from the typical Leone-style of western films, this is a novel- esque, visually bold & non-linear narration of the lives of two gang members spanning over decades. The transitions during the time travel are superb and neat. The movie slows down at various intervals just to instill blatant entertainment with intrinsic awe.After redefining the western genre through his earlier flicks, Leone now redefines the gangster-flick genre. And manages so easily to leave you mesmerized. Epic in terms of length and direction. Leone's direction is visionary as always and hypnotic and so is De Niro's acting. Jennifer Connelly looks so beautiful as a 14 year old in her debut movie. James Woods gives a career-defining performance too. Do not dare to ignore the movie only because of the length.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better than The Godfather,"I can't watch the Godfather. It's so boring! Both these films are slow but there is a difference, which I think I've figured out. Once Upon a Time in America is slow because it has an attitude. This attitude needs to play itself out over each scene. Example: Noodles returns to gang headquarters and stirs his coffee for two minutes. The gang know that something has gone wrong between him and Deborah and want him to discuss it. Noodles does not want to discuss it and so stirs his coffee until someone talks about something else. The Godfather is slow because nothing happens. Example: The scenes in the hospital with Michael and Don Vito. Nothing is going on. It's no fun to watch. It's not entertaining. Still, come to think of it, Once Upon a Time in America is not exactly entertaining as such. Those rape scenes are really horrible and I, personally, can't watch them. However, one can appreciate how great a film it is and what an achievement in story-telling. Leone does not attempt to make these men seem sympathetic because they are bad men. And though it seems simplistic to say it; bad men do bad things. What can you do? That is just one facet of the strength of the movie, though. The child actors are a revelation. The kid who plays Dominic is brilliant, why we never saw more of him and less of Macauly Culkin is anybody's guess. The other thing is that they look just like young versions of the older actors. The final word, however, must go to Robert de Niro and James Woods. James Woods has rarely been better. He's come close, no doubt about that but never bettered. De Niro is on excellent form with a marvellously restrained performance. Sometimes you have to have a protagonist who is not an extrovert and this is just that character. Noodles, as portrayed by De Niro, is unhappy with his lot for several reasons and let's people know about subtley. The best Leone film? Difficult to say. They're all great films so this would definitely rank as one of the best and certainly deserves more praise than it gets, even now, in the film world.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Long duration for so relatively few conflicts,"The movie opens very nicely with the ending. It uses the back and forth flow very well. The use is very clear with the make up on Robert DeNiro. The story also flows back and forth in a not too often frequency that it confuses the audience. However, the story presents only a few conflicts in the main time frame of between when Noodles getting out of jail and when the bank job failed. I really like the acting overall which is very good. Robert DeNiro as always played out his character smoothly, expressing his deep suppressed anxiety very well. James Woods gives the movie a character with the contradicting polar of Noodles, expressing out the anger well. We get to see Joe Pesci and even an earlier career job for Jennifer Connelly here which is very nice.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

My first review,"I'd think the best film I've seen, probably is ""Once Upon a Time in America"". The film is based on the novel by Harry Gray ""Once Upon a Time in America"". It was directed by an Italian man called Sergio Leone and stars Robert De Niro. It's based in America. This film about some desperate guys that met in the twenties years. They became kings of underworld, but one of them was a traitor. This film about a friendship, betrayal and love. It lasted about 4 hours. The film is long, but don't slow-movie.

What film are we looking at?,"I suppose this should go to a bulletin board - but given some of the reviews I've seen, I think this needs to be emphasized again.I am not going to rate this film - or even comment on it, directly. Leone's fans will understand as I go on.As we all should know (but it is quite clear from reviews that many do not know) Leone planned a film some 250 minutes long; the original version of this film ran 239 minutes; it was then cut down to about 120 minutes (hey, that's nearly half the movie!) and it was restored - well, unfortunately, that's part of the story.This film appeared on broadcast television twice in - supposedly - two different forms, the 120 minute version and a ""restored"" version, which later showed up on cable TV.Well, I saw them both, and I originally saw the 120 min. theatrical version, and all three versions were the same. The supposed ""restored version"" that got shown the second time on broadcast TV had exactly 45 minutes more - of commercials. (To be fair, I think there was actually 5 minutes more of film.) Does anybody else remember that? shown on two or three nights? Yeah, - more commercials (I believe it was on ABC). Worse yet, the TV version hit the VHS rental stores as the ""restored"" version first - and some rental stores still rent it out as such.The ""original"" American release of this film is wretched. Characters in the 2nd half of the film talk as if they were introduced in the 1st half, only we never saw them. Events are alluded to that never occurred. And the chronologically linear presentations of the sequences actually makes the story difficult to follow since the transitions from scene to scene are abrupt and unprepared for.I don't know when I gave up hoping to find and see the original film. Eventually, I know I'll bump into it. But, until then....My remarks here are for those who think they may have seen a ""restored"" version, but didn't.No, actually, my remarks are for those claiming to have any right to present this movie to the public. The original American release version should be destroyed; the original TV broadcast version should be destroyed; the ""restored"" TV broadcast version should be destroyed; the ""restored' VHS version should be destroyed.Get the director's cut done and - burn all previous versions!",,Anonymous,Crime

A powerhouse of an epic.,"Once Upon a Time in America (the director's cut) is one of the greatest films to ever be created and grace our reality. Sergio Leone, the man behind 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West', gave us 'Once Upon a Time in America', his last feature before he passed away in 1989. He left us a legacy as ambitious as his films, and his movies are his own love-letters to Westerns, crime films and basically life itself (at least this film).A story about Jewish gangsters, Leone's final masterpiece is a harrowing, wide-scoped story that is told from the perspective of David ""Noodles"" Aaronson spanning from the 1920s to 1968. It's an impacting journey and you feel the regret Noodles carries with him from his past: through things that are revealed in HIS present, we learn a little more about his past that we didn't see coming. The film jumps all across different points in time, something cinema can tell so much better than any other medium, when done right like it is here.Even though the film is great, the story behind the making of it was far from outstanding: Warner Brothers made a mandatory cut to the US version of the film (it was cut from nearly 4 hours to 2), and as a result it flopped in America and left Leone 'heart-broken' prompting him to never make another movie for the remainder of his life. Despite this though, the European cut was a great success and critics like Roger Ebert cited that version as the best film of 1984. It was a success in retrospective, but at the time it was a struggle for Leone.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Expanding on the idea of showing the personal side of a gangster ala The Godfather, Once Upon a Time in America tells a story that is completely different and ambitious","I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting.And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds.Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story.And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature.And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An Emotional, Thoughtful Masterpiece!","In my humble opinion, Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America might be one of the greatest gangster films ever made, if not the best one. People unfairly compare this movie to The Godfather, but each film is a masterpiece in its own different way. People even say this movie is one of the best films of all time. I would give credibility to those people because I wholeheartedly agree. This film, Leone's director cut at least, is in my top 100 list. One of the many reasons why this film is amazing is because is a deep, thematic film. Leone created a film about the American Dream. How it will lure you in with its promises and then betray you just as quickly. Sounds familiar, right? The film is also about friendship, loyalty, greed, love, and violence.The situation surrounding the film's release is a sad story. The film is incredibly long at 3 hours and 49 minutes, but Leone made sure each minute mattered in telling his story. It does require patience and focus, but you will be proud of it once the credits roll. The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Festival to rapturous praise. It received a 20-minute standing ovation. The original version had a focused story with flashbacks and flash-forwards. Scenes from the 1920's, 1930's, and 1960's were interwoven with each other, but it all made sense. This is what the critics loved. This is what the European cinemas showed. America betrayed Leone and his vision. Fearing the length and the violence, they edited a good ninety minutes from the film and rearranged the movie to organize it chronologically. Leone's film was butchered. Many critics called the edited version the worst film of 1984 and a travesty. Leone was apparently so heartbroken, he would go on to never make a film again. It's really sad but at least his original version is out here for everyone to see. Do NOT see the edited version. See the one that Leone envisioned us all to see.The film tells the story of Noodles (Robert De Niro). He grew up in a tough Jewish neighborhood in the Lower East Side in the 1920's. His best friend was Max (James Woods). In the early 1930's, Prohibition was in full effect across the United States. Max has some business propositions for Noodles. They involve themselves in violence, greed, lust, and with the local gangsters. Noodles falls in love with Deborah (Elizabeth McGovern; younger Deborah played by Jennifer Connelly). In the 1960's, Noodles arrives as an elderly man figuring out everything that happened and what went wrong during his life in New York City. The movie is really about loyalties being tested and being betrayed by the American Dream.The film delivers a plethora of amazing performances. With this cast, is it hard to deny that statement? Robert De Niro excels in these kinds of films, so it is a given he would be excellent here. I sympathized with his character even if his character made some horrible decisions, including how he treats his women. I also liked his chemistry with James Woods. Woods is not my favorite actor, but he delivers a very moving performance. Elizabeth McGovern is great, and Jennifer Connelly was a real find! Joe Pesci is great in a small supporting role as local gangster Frankie. Everyone is on top of their game with this film.The film is emotional. and it can hit you hard with emotion. You might think that the film's music is a reason why you would feel emotional. With that mindset, I would say you have an excellent taste in music. Ennio Morricone is a film legend who created many memorable film scores, including this one. His theme, ""Deborah's Theme,"" is a tearjerker. It's one of the more beautiful musical pieces you'll hear in any movie. It's a shame he was not nominated for an Oscar due to technicality issues.Sergio Leone is a director who is often underlooked and deemed too artsy. He was the man who brought the likes of Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson to the public eye. He was never really appreciated here in the states even after his Fistful of Dollars trilogy. That, in part, may have been the reason why this film was in the pre-production phase since the 1960's. In the end, Leone finally made this film. A triumphal directorial effort that remains his very best.Once Upon a Time in America is a very unique film that explores the lives of Jewish gangsters from childhood to old age. I also like how there is ambiguity here. Is this movie actually an opium-fueled dream by Noodles? Opium is known to give vivid dreams as one of its potential side effects. Regardless of what you make think, Leone made a movie where scene matters in the grand scope of things. If you are a patient cinephile or moviegoer, the rewards are endless. Be prepared for plenty of violence, nut I really loved this emotional, thoughtful masterpiece.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Master Sergio Leone's Last film and his first in Crime Drama genre and believe it or not it's a Universal Classic.,"Once Upon A Time In America (1984) :
Brief Review -Master Sergio Leone's Last film and his first in Crime Drama genre and believe it or not it's a Universal Classic. Sergio Leone did not make bunch of films in his career, he made just 8 films and 5 out of them are known as Cult Classics. All done with his western flicks and he did the best any human could do on the earth, so he tried his talent one last time in crime genre. And then, a Classic crime drama (arguably the Best Crime Drama) called Once Upon A Time In America was made. This man behind the camera was the best man available at the position till he was standing there (later of course some great director were born) because the sense and cinematic vision he had of filmmaking was beyond other people's imagination. OUATIA is a crime drama about friendship, love, lust, greed, compassion, betrayal, loss, revenge and regret. The film has everything at perfect order if you are the one who accept small contractions in crime genre. I believe, a crime drama never comes with a perfect script, it always fumbles somewhere at least once or twice. So, this film too struggled while setting up couple of things like revenge and woman (i tell you this same 'Woman' factor was the only weak point in Leone's Western Masterpiece OUATIW). Otherwise, the film got nothing wrong rather it had everything much more than expected just because those regular segments were set up by outstanding vision of Master Leone. Robert De Niro was at his best except for one or two scenes and James Woods surpassed all freaking expectations to stand out as the best performer in this big studded cast. Connelly and McGovern both look pretty as Deborah and there wasn't much to do for the Broad's role. Like other crime films this one is vulgur too but fine enough. Overall, a Classic Crime Drama by Sergio Leone which lives upto the mark despite 229 minutes long ride.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Tale In America,"Leone is one of the few 'multilayered' directors who really understand their craft. His films are usually both story driven and character driven. They have a larger than life look but at the same time they're also very subtle. Leone especially succeeds in subtly building tension. His films are also atmospheric creating a distinct feel of mystery, darkness and an impending doom and at the same time he steers clear of melodrama.'Once Upon a Time in America' is also one such film except that this one is more disturbing and emotionally engaging than most of his other works. How a man ends up raping the love of his life, how a friendship that emerged in childhood is permanently destroyed by greed and betrayal, how guilt can eat a person up...all of these themes are explored in an intriguing story.The film is also visually fascinating. The topnotch cinematography by Delli Colli, Morricone's wonderful score and Baragli's solid editing and the work of the lighting team are first rate. The work of the art department is also very precise and detailed as they successfully capture the time and smoothly display the difference between each time period. Lastly, the performances are of top quality. De Niro, Woods, Williams and McGovern are excellent. The child actors deserve special mention and the supporting cast is great too.",,Anonymous,Crime
35 years before The Irishman,"An almost four hours film saga whose action takes place in the world of the American mob and spreads over several decades. Robert De Niro plays the lead role of a gangster whose career is filled with corpses, robberies, collaborations with corrupt police and large unions, and whose love affairs have no chance to end well. The special effects of cinema make De Niro move smoothly from youth to the age of memories and vice versa, in a narrative structure that uses flashbacks copiously. But no, the film we talk about is not 'The Irishman', and the hero of the film does not belong to the Irish mob but rather to the New York Jewish mob during the Prohibition years. The film we talk about is 'Once Upon a Time in America', made 35 years before Scorsese's film, and was the last of seven films directed by Sergio Leone. It's amazing how this Italian director managed to build a remarkable cinematic opera in just seven films. He may also have been the most American of a non-American film directors.Obviously, Sergio Leone had the ambition to match the masters of American film on their territory. After succeeding in the western genre, he tackles the saga of mafia families, modeled on Coppola's 'The Godfather' whose first series came out a decade earlier. Even if it failed to reach the same level, 'Once Upon a Time in America' is an achievement in many ways. The action takes place in Brooklyn, in the shadow of the famous bridge, and is segmented into three moments: the early 1920s when the neighborhood was an area predominantly populated by Jewish immigrants from Europe, 1933 at the end of the prohibition that enriched the gangs of alcohol traffickers, and 1968 when the neighborhood was transformed and the aging mobsters (those who had survived) were either retired from business or had become rich and entered politics. As in 'The Godfather' and 'The Irishman', the heroes never question the legality or morality of their activities. Crime is a family business, and the issues that concern them are related to family loyalties, to the code of honor of the world of crime, to friendship and to love affairs. Of the five friends who started together their careers in crime as teenagers, only Noodles (Robert De Niro) will try in his own way to stick to the end to the friendship pact concluded in his youth. To what extent does this adherence to the mob moral values compensate for a life of crime that destroys almost everyone around him? This is a question whose answer is left to the spectators.The film is excellently written and narrated in non-chronological order, but all episodes are linked and explained in a coherent way. (This is true for the full version, I read that there was a short version for screening in theaters much less clear due to bad editing). From the point of view of details, the best rendered are the periods between the two world wars, and especially the first one taking place in the almost exclusively Jewish neighborhood of the 20s. The music is composed by Ennio Morricone whose collaborations with Sergio Leone left behind some of the best movie music scores ever written. Some of the songs are performed by Gheorghe Zamfir, and even if the pan flute is not a Jewish instrument, they integrate well and contribute to the ethnic color of the film. De Niro's performance is excellent, the makeup helps him move smoothly from the 1930s to 1968, and the comparison with the role in 'The Irishman' where he was rejuvenated with computer graphics effects is very interesting. James Woods is also very good in the role of Max - Noodles' friend, accomplice and rival - and the relationship between the two is the emotional axis of the story. We also see in this film the debut of Jennifer Connelly in the role of teenager Deborah, already radiating the beauty and personality of the actress she will become. Even though Sergio Leone failed to achieve Coppola's cinematic perfection, 'Once Upon a Time in America' is a very good and interesting film, which has survived so far very well the passage of time, and which finds well its place into the category of the great American saga films. Leone would be pleased.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Amapola, Indeed","While I really liked Director Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", I had some trouble trying to like this movie, which I found confusing, uneven, and much too long. This review is of the version that is just under four hours.The subject matter hits very close to home for me, which may be only one of my several problems with the film. In 1910, my Jewish grandparents moved across the Hudson River from the Lower East Side to the Central Ward of Newark, presumably to pursue a better life with more economic opportunity, only to find more of the same poverty but possibly in less chaotic surroundings. In Newark's poorest area, my father was soon born and inevitably grew up with individuals who could have easily appeared as the main characters of this film.In an odd way, the Jewish content of the film often seemed only incidental. To me, the ethnic group could have been Chinese or Polish. It didn't seem to matter at all. Maybe I'm just too touchy about this aspect of the film, but there wasn't one, single element that portrayed Jews, specifically Jewish life in New York, in a positive light. With the possible exception of the poor baby who took the place of Chief Aiello's precious son, I struggled to find one, single character to be sympathetic or likeable at all. While I, myself, have personally faced the increasing, recent wave of anti-Jewish sentiment, especially in large, liberal cities throughout the western world, I couldn't ignore the negative image of Jews that was projected here, even though it often seemed, strangely enough, that the Jewish content was inconsequential. No matter how subtle it may have been, the overall negative vibe depressed me from start to finish. Beyond that, with the exception of a Yiddish phrase interjected into a conversation here and there, none of the characters seemed Jewish at all to me. Was Elizabeth McGovern actually supposed to be Jewish? On the other hand, Tuesday Weld, one of the only bright spots during the entire experience, did project a hint of Jewishness, and she looked beautiful too.Aside from Deborah, the McGovern character, not aging for decades, while the Weld character certainly did, I didn't understand her. As a successful actress, why was she so sad and downbeat all the time, and why didn't she discard all of her personal rubbish in New York and move on with her life when she boarded the train to Hollywood? This was only one of many aspects of the film that confused me.While the original music of Ennio Morricone contributed significantly to ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", I only recognized the repeated, excessively sentimental strains of Lennon-McCarthy's ""Yesterday"" and Lacalle's ""Amapola"". The first song self-consciously suggested the misty-eyed nostalgia of the past, while the subject of the second tune is ""poppy"". Got it, Sergio!Unless my father's Jewish mob in Newark was of a kinder and gentler variety than that which existed across the Hudson in New York, I don't remember his speaking of the violence and brutality that was portrayed here. Who would the victims of such extreme cruelty have been? Anyone he or I once knew? There would have been no reason for him to conceal those details from me, especially at the end of his life. In my view, the film clearly sensationalized the level of viciousness and heartlessness only to appeal to a certain audience and for no other reason.The film ends with a really creepy smile of heroin-induced ecstasy on the central character's, Noodles Aaronson's, face. That is the final, hideous image that haunted me long after the ending. It was the perfect conclusion to a very strange, very long, and often confusing cinematic experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Complex, but not a 'masterpiece'.","I concede that the film is well made and quite intricate in its structure (and that it takes time and patience to attempt to come up with an explanation for the unfathomable gray areas in the screenplay). Leone evidently had an eye for detail, composition, lighting and camera movement. I am sure that no-one will deny that the technical side of the film was handled with care and it does show.The screenplay is a mess. I expect to be lambasted by angry fans that will claim that I am an unimaginative watcher and would like all aspects of plot and character explained to me instead of having to think and immerse myself. Fine. I also know that art defies easy definition, and that all the best art in the world offers itself up to multiple interpretations. Fine. I maintain that Leone is being wilfully obscure in his attempts to cover up the head-scratch-inducing narrative techniques that he conjures up. He does so by claiming an opium/dream logic: some kind of remembrance of childhood and prohibition (an immutable, fixed past) as well as a progressive imagining (regarding the ""future"") on the part of the focaliser Noodles as he lies in the opium den. This may not be the case as he could not possibly know of the exact styles, decor and music of the sixties without having lived through them to some extent. So here we have an organic problem with the screenplay: claims to dream logic to confuse and inspire debate regarding the plot's many unsure points (e.g. was that Max in the dumpster? How Why? What does that wry smile at the end mean? Etc. Was it all a dream of the past and possible future?) counterpoised with the impossibility of this evident in the physical and cultural environment presented to us in the visuals. This, to me, is just vague and sloppy. It is not just a case of great art being unfathomable, it is a case of sloppy art trying to be unfathomable. Take that incessant telephone sound and its related imagery. Did Leone himself know what effect he was trying to achieve when he put it in there? I would say yes in one respect: in order to mystify his audience. I do not think that it stands for much more than that. Perhaps also to establish the confusing and ultimately untenable nature of the film's time structure (he is literally 'calling into the past') and it's relation to Noodle's 'dream' (which the film quite clearly can not be).Also, the film's attitude towards women is just plain nasty, containing two of the screens most unapologetic rape scenes. We could claim that it is merely the nasty attitude of our enigma focaliser Noodles. He most obviously is not a very nice guy when it comes to women and the film does present itself as an exploration of his singular consciousness (if it is a dream). To put it crassly: he is nasty to women so the film has also got to be nasty to women if it claims to be deeply related to his attitudes and point of view. If it is a film of dream and imaginings, then certainly Noodle's dream is mutable (as we know all dreams are) and what he 'does' to the characters played by Tuesday Weld and Elisabeth McGovern is heightened by his desire and imagination. This is the only way in which to explain why Tuesday Weld's character seems to enjoy rape, that it is Noodles imagining her enjoying the rape. This is vague, but it at least validates the epic romanticization that pervades this ugly world (of which rape is only a part) when the main character is an absolute lout: it is him who romanticizes it. This is a sneaky way around a touchy subject. But, as has been established by many, this world may not be a dream- back to that inconsistency in the plot. Is it? Isn't it? If not then there is not much of an excuse for the rape sequences.The dialogue is also slightly off, too often it sounds stiff and mechanical, and it is too self-consciously scripted to sound like naturalistic street parlance. Ennio Morricone's score is alright. It is evocative in places (when he sticks to the minimalist piano melody) and far too saccharine in others (that pan pipe stuff I find grating and kitsch).So to be sure, it is a complex film. It is a rewarding film. It requires more than one watching. It falls far short from a masterpiece, though. Too inconsistent when it should be incisive. It bears the marks of a troubled production and evidence of Leone himself not quite knowing what to do with the beast he had created.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent Gangster Film And An Unforgettable Epic Masterpiece From Sergio Leone.,"Once Upon A Time In America is an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that is filled with excellent direction,great acting and a haunting and beautiful score. It's not only one of my favorite films and one of best Gangster films ever made,but,also one of the greatest films ever made and is another Sergio Leone Masterpiece.Set in Lower Manhattan,New York,Once Upon A Time In America tells the story of the rise and fall of four Jewish Gangsters during the prohibition era and the friendship of gangsters and friends David 'Noodles' Aaronson(Robert De Niro)and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz(James Woods) Over the course of five decades,from the 1910s to the 1960s Noodles and Max experience success,failure,death and betrayal.Once Upon A Time In America was Sergio Leone's final film before his death in 1989 and is a beautiful and haunting Masterpiece of cinema that was butchered by Warner Bros. When Once Upon A Time In America was released at the Cannes film festival the original version was an epic that ran 3 hrs and 49 minutes(229 minutes)and that version was critically acclaimed by critics and received a standing ovation at Cannes. However,when the film was released in America OUTIA was cut down buy Warner Bros to 2 hrs and 19 mintues(139 minutes)and was hated by critics. But thankfully,Leone's four hour version was released years later and seen as a Masterpiece and rightfully so it's just sad Leone didn't live longer to see his amazing film get the respect it deserves. Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films ever made an powerful and unforgettable epic Gangster film that ranks alongside other excellent Gangster films like The Godfather Trilogy,Goodfellas and Casino and other Gangster classics like Scarface and Carlito's Way. OUTIA is an epic in the truest since of the word an epic not only in scope but in length and everything is big and large whether it is the characters or things all around. What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness. Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending.The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well.The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone.The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone.In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worth the investment of time.,"Some reviewers of this movie have complained about its length (almost 4 hours). So? Watch it on two successive nights in two hour installments, and count your self lucky. For years, the sole version of this movie that was available on video was severely cut down, shorter by 90 minutes, and the result was nothing less than butchery. It was like somebody deciding Picasso's Guernica was too huge, so let's take these scissors and make it smaller... Actions taken by the adult characters often made no sense, since those actions were supposed to resonate with actions taken when the characters were young, and those earlier actions were cut out. Spend the time, watch the movie and think about what you are seeing. This is, simply put, one of the five best movies of 1984 and in the long version you get to see it in all of its broad sweeping and elaborate narrative structure and all of its interesting little details. Marvel at the cast of young actors (including a then 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly) who dream of something better than the immigrant ghetto poverty they grew up in, and watch as their dreams and schemes and casual morality sow the seeds of the adults they will become. Live in their America, in the moment and across the decades - an America of limitless opportunity, but also of infinite potential for corruption and exploitation. Success in this America meant always having something on the go and it usually meant trying to keep one step ahead of the cops, whether you were a street punk or a 'legitimate businessman'. Note: other Zippers have made much of DeNiro's gangster's attempted rape of his former childhood friend in the film, but this scene was by no means gratuitous or exploitative. It was, in fact, a demonstration of how far the worlds of the two had grown apart, and this is just one example of how deeply and symbolically EVERYTHING in this movie resonates. A movie this ambitious or good can't ever be 'too long'.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"An epic film consisting of love, greed and betrayal","This is one of those films that is probably hard to sum up in one viewing as there is so much to take in throughout the film. This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film.The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him.The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men.Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life.One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful.Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular.The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Criminal Fairy Tale,"Just from the director, Sergio Leone, I expect it is a great movie. Honestly I don't like western-movie too much, but from ""Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)"", I started to appreciate this kind of epic- genre. And then, I wonder what it's like when Leone directs other genre, such as crime. So I decided to watch this long-running-movie. For the first impression, I really shocked by its duration, 229 minutes, the longest movie I've ever watched. But, sure there are some reasons why he made for more than three hours. Especially, it is a drama-movie, I really understand how the character of each figure must be strong.I can smell the sweat of the hard-work from the opening of the movie. Such a humble opening for this thought-provoking film. My main idea of this movie is it drive the audience from the simplest and youngest crime to the complex act of the prohibition-era-Jewish- gangster. Begin with the funny yet straightforward scene of a kid's gang. Encounter with daily dark-kid-job, yes it's fun for the serious audience. What I see is the humanity of the first half part of the movie. Every character especially outlaws, have a background. Maybe a harsh and tough one, and it's all revealed in this movie. So the entire last part of movie is make sense, very clear.That's what I called the strong characterization, one and half hour for the character building is very meaningful. Again I can feel, how Harry Grey wrote this novel for it. A plain humble novel I think. I haven't read it though, but I just feel it indeed. I also give two thumbs up for the dialog maker. Well-crafted dialog, no narration, just formidable chit chat in every scene. Thanks for those eight writers for this movie. Until the very end, with some twists and spoof, that's all make this movie nothing but superb.For Leone himself, I can conclude that he usually gives the repeated soundtrack as his signature. Yeah, and harmonica again, although not every scene has harmonica player. I am personally not disturbed by its soundtrack. It's a part of developing the atmosphere, the dark- 30's-atmosphere. With all the warm-act, I just can get through the movie without getting bored. In addition, there are so many ""silent- scene"", yes when there is no dialog, just for strengthen the circumstances. That silent scene makes the movie took so long. But, for me, again, it's okay, it's a part of genuine masterpiece.Not like my other reviews, I just write this from the technical aspects. Because I don't really know what the prohibition-era in America. I just know, it must be criticize some parts of broken American in the 1920's-1930's. It's nice though, a cool way to criticize the underworld of the superior nation. This overall technical reviews just to make other movie fans aware, that I highly recommend this movie. A very criminal-fairy-tale with terrific work in all aspects, I really love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Once Upon A Time in your life,"Bravo! Everyone connected with this movie should take a long well-deserved bow. Most excellent entertainment across the board bar none. All my favorite actors are at their peak plus the supporting players came through as well. If that is not enough, treat yourself to one of the best scores you will ever hear too. The music when applied to certain scenes just tugs and pulls on you until you give in and you are glad that you did too. There are different versions out there to experience. I found the blue-ray 251 minute version which Leone had a hand in and it made good sense. I have seen the other versions and I couldn't quite figure out what was going on even after I was captivated. Imagine that if it held you when chopped up it will spellbind you when complete. It does! Let us not forget that the story itself of gangsters, murders, robberies prostitution etc. can never be glorified and encouraged as a way of life in real life. Quite the opposite. It is a life misspent even it is exciting and dangerous to live in a perverted way. It reminds me of The Godfather movie where we fall in love with Don Corleone but lets be clear he was a bad man. What comes through here in this movie is the magic of growing up, having friends, doing things together, first loves and adventures. What hurts is seeing all those things fail or not complete themselves. This movie gives you both and then some. You have to stop and think about what Tuco said in the Good, Bad & Ugly to his brother. In this town, in order to survive, one becomes a priest or a bandit. Same with this movie only minus the priest part. These kids growing up on the streets have nothing worthwhile to look forward to accept trouble that brings excitement or jail. In between they hope for money, food, a better life and that it gets easier not harder. Street life is like that. You get to glimpse very well this no where type of existence courtesy of expert directing here. It would take someone who knew about this type of growing up to present correctly and more importantly with deep feeling and genuineness. This movies delivers that and more. Haunting, reflective, deep, pain, sorrow and mystery rolled up altogether using peoples lives to make the points. That's why the viewer can relate so well. It could have been and in many cases was...your life too. Recommend a meal while watching with a tasty drink and a decent snack. Make sure you have enough for three plus hours. I have seen this at least three times. I am not through either.....",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An honest opinion - Not a bad movie, but seriously flawed","First off, I don't write reviews... Secondly I don't agree in general with 1/10 or 10/10 as either extreme is effectively unattainable in my opinion (what is a ""10/10"" in the 50's if released in 2k is NOT ""10/10"" - to be explained later)...I picked out this movie (extended version)one night from a blockbuster, and seem to have vaguely recalled hearing about it. So I popped it in, started watching it, and was soon thereafter asleep.So the next day I looked up the reviews on here, and to my surprise this thing (that quickly put me to sleep) was on the top 250!!! I was shocked. People were comparing it to The Godfather and Goodfellas... OMG...So I sat down a few nights later and decided to re-visit this thing which I thought could not be anywhere near as good as people were saying... To my surprise, things go a lot better after a while... the story just started off too slow.The story was interesting (once it got going), and ultimately the overall story was good.Some of the cinematography was quite good, some was painfully awful... it was as though there were different people controlling/editing the shots at different times.I don't know what was in the original version and the extended cut, however there was too much sex related scenes for my likings. I think sex has its place in movies, it just that this movie had a little too much (or too long), with some scenes on the boarder of turning into a porno. And when I'm watching a gangster/mafia movie, I don't want it to kick into a little porno action, I want to see the stereotypical gangster related things  drug trafficking, extortion, gambling, murder blah blah blah... not, common baby, lets see if you can tell which one of us mobsters had their way with you a while ago by a careful assessment of our 'weapons' while we look on grinning stupidly. Just didn't seem appropriate.I think the acting was top notch - I can't think of a single actor/actress that did a bad job; the flaws are more in the direction the movie was shot/edited.I think if this movie was released in say 1960, it would have gotten an 8/10 from me... but this was 1984, Nineteen EIGHTY-FOUR... post godfather... I find that movies over time end up raising the bar for other movies, and that sloppy cinematography or acting or direction becomes less tolerated - because movie makers should know by now that everything has to be firing on all cylinders to be a top movie (relatively speaking of course).It should have been better.X",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Once Upon a Time in America (1984) - A Review by Aran Donnelly,"Once Upon a Time in America is easily to me, the third greatest movie of all time, only behind The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II. Everything about it from Sergio Leone, Robert De Niro, James Woods, Ennio Morricone, the story, the characters, the shots/visuals, and the score alone makes me want to become a filmmaker. The Critics Consensus on Rotten Tomatoes says it all about this movie. Most definitely deserves a higher rating than 8.4/10 on IMDb, and 88% on Rotten Tomatoes!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great start, dragged down by misogyny","This epic from Sergio Leone certainly evokes the era of the 1920's and 30's, and I thought it was at its strongest in the scenes from the childhood of the aspiring gang members. With the Manhattan bridge in the background of several iconic moments, they skip along the streets of New York, running their various rackets, endangered by a powerful rival. The scene where ""Noodles"" (Scott Tiler) meets Max (Rusty Jacob) is strong, and the one where a gang member is lost is memorable. As the film spans the decades to the 1960's and is told in an interleaved retrospective, the younger actors are soon replaced by their older counterparts, and I thought the pairings were well chosen.At 229 minutes this is a beast of a film, and unfortunately at about the 120 minute point, it started going downhill. There's a silly scene involving mixing up all the newborn babies at a hospital in order to gain leverage on a cop that should have been excised completely. We're also supposed to believe that this gang acts on behalf of the working people via its involvement with a union leader. Without spoiling it, while I liked how the main characters grew apart because of their differing levels of ambition, I wasn't at all convinced about the double deception that takes place - it just didn't seem likely. Lastly, the final 30 minutes of the film were weak, with two meetings that take place in the 1960's going on too long.On top of that, as many have noted since the film came out 40 years ago, the treatment of women is terrible. The protagonist we're meant to sympathize with throughout the entire film commits a couple of r*pes, the first of which is signaled as ""consensual non-consent,"" the second of which in the back of a car is unequivocally awful. While we see the disdain from the chauffeur afterwards, the fact that the victim (Elizabeth McGovern) later has scenes with De Niro's character which completely ignore this event is repugnant to say the least. Meanwhile, the first victim (Tuesday Weld) goes to work in a brothel and when later confronted by the gang, is made to attempt to identify her rapist by examining their four members, eventually falling in love with one of them (good grief). It's not that the r*pes happen per se, it's how they're treated afterwards that gets me. I'm also not sure why the audience needed to see 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly's backside when the younger version of De Niro's character watches her undress, or why the other childhood friend was written as a wh*re throughout her life. It kind of made me feel like Leone was as stunted relative to women as the characters in this gang, and in any event, left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It's unfortunate, because the film had such promise.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Delightfully Detailed,"Do not bother to watch the shorter version. Cut and mangled for American Theaters by some 90 Minutes, it is still out there and should be avoided. The intended 227 Minute Movie is readily available on Disc and that is the Director's intent. Anything else is blasphemous.That being said, it is the almost Four Hour Film that will have some, less patient, viewers wriggling in their seats and demanding a more friendly version. It is a lengthy, at times lethargic, sprawl that can be an attractive display of Period and Time hopping.This was not a common Film Style at the time, much more so now, and it feels like a Dream sometimes, and there are some Nightmarish Scenes to be sure. With a Movie so long and Artistically involved there is a lot to take in. Most of it is richly rewarding, but it can be overly complex. It is a Film that takes investment and waiting for the payoff may be tiresome, but ultimately satisfying.For those willing to become involved for the long haul it can be a Baroque, Powerful Experience. The haunting Score and the beautiful, soft, hazy visuals combined with some clever Cinema tricks and excruciating sense of detail, to make this a fine Film for those with an eye for demanding and delightful, disturbing and dense, fictionalized and fancied, Gangster Americana.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
LEONE'S UNDERRATED MASTERPIECE IS IMPRESSIVE,"Sergio Leone's sprawling crime epic drama is his final motion picture and his most underrated masterpiece. The film tells the story of five decades in the lives of four Jewish gangsters who are lifelong friends from the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the 1920's that became merciless criminals, but they have a special bond of loyalty to each other. The great Robert De Niro magnificently plays one of them named David 'Noodles' Aaronson, in a marvelously controlled understated turn, he is a small-time hood who is now hiding out in an opium den in a Chinese theater. He is hunted by a couple of murderous thugs sent by the betrayer who was once a beloved childhood friend, who is also responsible for the murders of his other friends. A ringing telephone in the drug den ignites his memory and through a complex series of back and forth flashbacks we go back and relive his life experiences from his adolescents to his adult life in crime and the tragic outcome. Masterful direction by Leone, with marvelous performances by James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams, Danny Aiello, Richard Bright, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Brian Bloom, and young Jennifer Connelly in her motion picture debut. Extraordinary cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli, with an exquisite score by Ennio Morricone The period recreation is absolutely flawless in this engrossing film that is a must-see for any serious movie lover. Highly recommended. Note: Leone originally wanted and envisioned two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes. The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes, and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement. The shortened version was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes that were made. The original ""European cut"" has remained a critical favorite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest gangster films of all time. I own the 4 hour 11 minute director's cut version on blu ray. A truly phenomenal crime epic!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A masterpiece that has everything,"This movie has everything: great score from Ennio Morricone, a superb plot, violence, love, emotion, some funny scenes and most of all great acting from great actors ( James Woods' and Elizabeth McGoverns' best performance). If you want to see this film make sure you give yourself plenty of time and be patient as it does take a while to get started but it is worth it. It could be described as a gangster movie and it is but there is much more to it than that. It skips generations a few times so you need to give it your full attention. You may need to watch it a second time. I have seen it about 15 times and it never loses it,s appeal. Enjoy!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Masterpiece?,"That's the word that keeps popping up in the users' reviews of this film, and not without reason.  I don't know if I'm prepared to draw that judgment myself (I'd really have to see it again), but I'm among those who, at the least, take seriously such claims.  I think there are few films in American cinema history that clearly meet this level of quality: the _Godfather_ saga, _Schindler's List_, _Apocalypse Now_, a great number of Kubrick films, some of Hitchcock's films, some Welles films, David Lean's epics, and maybe some others that don't come to mind right off.  In the ""maybe"" class I'd put this one, perhaps Leone's other epics (though, again, I'd have to see *those* again), _Chinatown_, and perhaps several others.  In any event, the list of such films (masterpiece-level or very near it) is not very long, and this one belongs on it.In the pantheon of great gangster films, this has to be right up near the top, below the _Godfather_ films and above _Goodfellas_ (and _On the Waterfront_, should one so classify it).  In the relatively barren landscape of 1980s American film, this one towers above just about all of them.  It's a truly special film and, aside from its decent placement in the top 250 on this website, has been unjustly neglected/overlooked for the past couple decades, as evidenced by the fact that it's yet to be released on DVD (the arrival of which I'm among those ever-so-patiently awaiting).This one is among the two dozen or so films that I'd rate a 9/10 or higher.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A realistic gangster story of epic proportions- but slow paced and exposition heavy.,"Set during the Prohibition era, Once Upon A Time In America follows the story of David 'Noodles' Aaronson (Robert De Niro) firstly growing up on Lower East Side of Manhatten, committing petty crimes such as minor thefts and robberies to later becoming a prominent mobster in adult life. The film explores themes such as lust, betrayal, greed, love and friendship all while portraying the rise of syndicate gangs and the Mafia in American society. Once Upon A Time In America undoubtedly tells an magnificent and realistic story of epic proportions, but this in a way is the films undoing, at a run time of 229 minutes the film seems to drag on far too long and develops at a slower pace than it needed to. Being Sergio Leone's final film, it originally came under a mixed response with two different versions of the film released in theatres the Original European Version and the American Cut. However, has since gone on to be labelled as one of the greatest gangster films of all time. Despite being a different genre of film from Leone's normal work, many of his signature traits such as long shots, visual expression and the iconic Ennio Morricone Spaghetti western soundtrack are noticeable and definitely positive points for the film. I also found mainly the second act and latter part of the first act to be more faster paced and interesting moments in the film as Noodles transitions from childhood to adult hood. Also the final scenes complete the motion picture brilliantly with a conclusive and pleasing ending. However, going back to my previous point that the film is far longer than it needed to be, this is evident mainly in the films first act with some scenes feeling far too slow and some even slightly irrelevant to the films progressive plot. The film is told through flashbacks from 1968 and starts being told from a in media res prospective, filling us in with important details and exposition as the film progresses, this works well and is mainly the only reason I remained fully focused and engaged. The Film also features a disappointing lack of action for a gangster flick and even at a 229 minutes, an important robbery scene was unfortunately cut out that a lot of the film focused on and seemingly built too, therefore it all seeming a waste. Another point to note is it attempts to hit you hard with emotions at times but these fall flat (with the exception of a few during the first act) because of the characters being violent, dangerous and brutal, meaning we don't connect with them very well on this level. Once Upon A Time In America features a beautiful soundtrack, signature Leone traits and tells an epic story which for the most part is engaging. However it's lack of action and drawn out scenes of exposition and dialogue mean it seems to trudge at a snails pace and doesn't always keep you gripped. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Gresat historical drama,"It's been said that when one watches a ""spaghetti"" western (one of the ""Man with no name"" films with Clint Eastwood) filmmaker Sergio Leone's trademark cinema style and flair for clear storytelling is instantly recognizable. This is no truer than in his most ambitious effort, Once Upon a Time in America, in which his usage of close-ups, concise camera movement, sound transitions and syncs, and the sudden change in some scenes from tenderness to violence. And, he pulls it off without making the viewer feel dis-interested. Of course, it's hard to feel that way when watching the cast he has put together; even the child actors (one of which a young Jennifer Connelly as the young Deborah) are believable. Robert De Niro projects his subtitles like a pro, with his occasional outburst in the right place; James Woods gives one of his first great performances as Max; Elizabeth McGovern is the heart of the film; and Joe Pesci should've had more than just a one scene appearance, thought it's still good.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Should be buried next to Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate in the cemetery of failed epics,"I didn't like this movie.I found it corny and self-indulgent. The characters were uninteresting and one-dimensional. The story didn't grab me -- and did they really need nearly 4 hours to tell it? It was gratuitously sleazy, like a Tinto Brass film. The music was cheesy and unmemorable -- and yet others say that it's one of Morricone's best scores?! Not to mention that the music was mismatched to some scenes.I'll concede that the cinematography did rise to above average from time to time and that the last 10-15 minutes of the movie (starting from the scene with the garbage truck) were outstanding -- atmospheric, surreal, disturbing, bizarre, and beautiful. Too bad the other 3 1/2 hours weren't as good.1 out of 10 stars.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Something to do with greatness,"Sergio Leone was the greatest filmmaker of all time; all his films are masterpieces, they have something to do with greatness and cinematic excellence, the best films ever made. Once Upon A Time In America covers the periods in the 20s and 30s as recalled from 1968. It's a poignant and dense movie in which the motion, the frame and soundtrack simultaneously strike in a beautiful counterpoint. The movie is an example of visual and aural storytelling beyond time and reality – it's an indivisible whole where time is not a linear flow into past, present, and future. Once Upon A Time ""in"" America is not a social historical analysis nor a scientific work, it's a tale, a fairy tale which defies description because it's a dream that Noodle (Robert De Niro) begins in 1938 and doesn't end in 1968. Sergio Leone believed in huge stadium like movie theater where people would come together and watch on a giant screen an epic tale of passion, love, friendship, betrayal, vengeance, faith and perseverance; he believed in four, six hours long films, he believed in the extraordinary visual composition and movements that movies can celebrate, he believed in the powerful vibrancy, depth and richness of wide format films, he understood and empathized the sense of insight that follow a discovery one make for oneself – it was a fulfillment of integrity and lyrical concern over a lifetime. I can't even try to imagine what we all lost with his too-soon passing, what his next film would have been – Leone was planning a Soviet co-production film on the Siege of Leningrad during World War II – an epic larger-than-life film project left uncompleted at the time of his death. His film-making skills were so good that it's quite a physical experience to see his movies... they offer pleasure on a lot of different levels, you don't really know where it comes from but it's a shock of joy and sadness, full of feeling, emotions so essential to our lives.

It takes a long time to tell this story,"Yes, the film is too long. No, the film should not have been cut down and butchered beyond all recognition as was the case with its original American theatrical release. Somewhere in between there must be a happy medium. But given the choice between the two extremes it is certainly much better that we are able to see the film as director Sergio Leone intended for it to be seen. Leone's vision for how the story should unfold is what makes the film unique. At times it can be a frustrating film to watch with its exceptionally deliberate pacing. There are certainly times while watching the film where you wish Leone would pick up the pace and move things along. But upon reflection, after seeing the whole film in its entirety, only then can you really appreciate what Leone has done. It's a terrific story and it's a story which is told in a simply brilliant manner. Yes, the film drags at times. Yes, there certainly could have been some cuts here and there to make the running time more manageable. But in the end there is no denying that the film works. It's by no means perfect. There are notable lulls and lesser moments scattered throughout. But the film as a whole ends up being greater than the sum of its parts. And you really cannot understand that until you settle in for the long journey and watch the whole thing.The film tells the story of a group of five young Jewish gangsters from New York City over a span of five decades or so. As you might imagine these characters lead violent lives and certainly not all of them are destined to survive this decades-long journey. But the way this story is presented we know the ultimate fates of some of these characters very early on in the film. That is because Leone presents his story in a non-linear fashion, cutting back and forth between three distinct eras. It is left to the audience, and one key character, to piece things together and it is really impossible to do so until the story has completely unfolded. Scenes which seem unimportant and superfluous take on an entirely different meaning when you see where the story eventually goes. Robert De Niro plays Noodles (because what's a gangster without a nickname?) and it is Noodles who is at the center of the film, tying the various eras together. A younger actor portrays the character in the film's earliest 1920s era when the gangsters are really just young boys. De Niro takes over the role for the other two eras, during the gangsters' 1930s prime and in 1968 when Noodles is pulled back into a world he thought he had left decades ago. De Niro owns the screen, his performance is perfect as he portrays the young 1930s tough and the older man of 1968 trying to unravel a very complex personal mystery. And De Niro is supported by a large group of excellent actors who bring each of the story's eras to brilliant life. James Woods as Noodles' closest friend in the gang and Elizabeth McGovern as the woman Noodles loves but is probably never destined to have give the two most notable performances aside from De Niro but really the entire cast is spot-on. From the young child actors portraying the gang in its earliest incarnation to Woods and McGovern and many other familiar faces who pop up throughout everyone involved seems to fit their role perfectly. It's a wonderful cast which does a magnificent job bringing a terrific story to life.So yes this is a film with a great story. And yes the cast is terrific. And yes the way Leone frames his story adds a brilliant touch. But there is the still the nagging thought that a little brisker pace would have helped. It's not even that entire scenes had to be cut as you realize in the end that every scene really does have its place. Its that Leone at times seems to linger on scenes where the important information the audience and characters need has already been relayed. And there are scenes where too much time is spent setting up the important event which is about to happen rather than simply getting to that important event. A few minor cuts here and there might well have lessened the frustration one senses as the film hits the occasional lull. It's a film with so many great moments but you wish Leone could have gotten in and out of those great moments a little quicker. But all in all this is a film which is certainly a long journey but definitely a satisfying one.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Uncomfortable but compelling viewing,"Although I have been a huge fan of Sergio Leone's work for sometime, I have only just got around to watching Once Upon a Time in America. Probably largely because I've never been too much of a fan of the gangster genre. I'm so glad I did, as it is another Leone masterpiece.Morricone scores always seem to add so much to a movie, and the same is clearly the case here. The story itself is based in three different times - Noodles as a child, as a young man, and 30 years later. The film plays the flashbacks intermittently, and not in chronological order order - to great effect - with the story gradually making more and more sense as it evolves. It explores the relationship between Noodles and Max, from childhood riffraff to big-time gangsters.At times it is painful to watch - with the rape of Debra being particularly uncomfortable viewing. But the film is very challenging, has a good twist and leaves you with many unanswered questions. A great film for those of us that want more than action action action and explosions.If you have a fair few hours to spend (it is a long movie) I would definitely recommend that you watch this.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A troubling masterpiece,There is much to unsettle the modern viewer here; not least of of the depiction of sexual violence toward the female characters.Elsewhere there is Leone's distracting tendency to make some characters cartoonish; and does the plot even add up?And yet taken as a whole it is quite magnificent.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dull,"This has to be the most boring gangster film I've ever seen.  Basically it's about Robert DeNiro and James Wood's friendship over fifty years or so as they rise and fall in the gang world.  It's interesting to do it about Jewish gangsters, because most films center on Italian gangsters, but their being Jewish didn't seem to make much difference in the film.  DeNiro and Woods were subdued, and I didn't buy for a second that they actually might care about one another.  The female lead and DeNiro had no chemistry.  Leone centered more on cinemetography than story, and the little story there was was painfully streched out to almost three and a half hours.  Speaking of the cinemetography- sure there were some very nice images, but basically they were going for the same look as ""The Godfather"" only maybe with a little more of a golden nostolgia feel for it.  I don't mind slowly paced films, but that deliberate pace must be used to draw the viewer into the film, the pace of ""Once Upon a Time,"" just makes the viewer wish that he had commited suicide instead of having to watch it. I'm not a big gangster film fan, but this one ranks low among gangster films.  It lacks the visual pop of ""Goodfella's,"" the emotional intensity of ""Miller's Crossing,"" the cultural/historic significance of ""Godfather,"" the moralistic elements of ""Angels with Dirty Faces,"" or the acting prowess of ""White Heat.""  And it is certainly a lot more boring than any of the above films listed.",,Anonymous,Crime

Not worth the 4 hours.,The high rating and accolades being thrown around here are so out of touch with reality I cant believe it.  Of the Top 250 I have seen about half the movies and this one was the most overrated (on this website) movie on the list.  How can you take a movie seriously that has Robert Deniro playing a guy named Noodles!  Please.  The plot is thin and boring to say the least. It tries to say alot but fails even though Leone gave himself 4 hours to do it.  The score for this film was horrible.  And James Woods.  What was up with his character going 'crazy'?  Too many holes in this one and unless Leone wanted to go into the soap opera business he shouldnt have bothered with this one.  It wasnt all bad but as a complete work this movie rates below par.  It gets a 4/10 for effort.,4.0,Anonymous,Crime
The perfect masterpiece,"One of the best gangster films ever made period.
From the opening to the final credit it's never dull or boring and it's 4 hours long. I have also never seen a cast of young characters who perfectly fit the older ones as time moves on. It's brutal and some of the violence to woman is very disturbing. It's not a movie u can digest in a single watch it needs to be seen on multiple viewing to understand the sheer epic vision the director had. Plus it's ambiguous was it all a dream? or one man's downfall told in a sweeping score and epic visual style brutally told from a protagonist u love to hate.

Nostalgia and Melancholy.,"This movie is not on par with The Godfather part 1 and 2. Nor is it as good as Goodfellas. I find that Leone's flawed masterpiece is to self indulged with it's epic status to be thought of in the same way as those three movies. Which is not to say it's bad - lets just say it has to settle for 4th place.The story is a sprawling one, not to dissimilar to The Godfather part 2, where we see the account of Noodles, a hood in Prohibition New York. It is relatively simple to follow, the story flicking from child hood gangsters, to the sadness of old age, looking back on being young. Memories come flooding back to the characters, and the effect is astonishing. Leone creates layers slowly as the film goes on to make a deep insight into Noodles life. Much like the slow build up of Once Upon a Time In the West - where we learn why Charles Bronson was brooding for so long - the same effect is done here, but in a more subtle manner.The movie is violent. Not like the Goodfellas violence, or the stylised killing of the Godfather, instead this film seems more immoral and brutal. Children having sex on the rooftops of New York, corrupt cops, rape scenes, shootings (the one through the eye being a good one) - this film really pushes it, but never gets too violent. Just play time for gangster film buffs! Running in at nearly 5 hours long, the film is surprisingly easy to watch - the story just flows by because it's told so well. The story does go off at a tangent sometimes, telling little tales of the kids when they were gangsters - sometimes mere padding for this ""epic"" tale. But damn it, is this the saddest gangster film I've seen! The acting is superb. De Niro is flawless as Noodles - his eyes carry with them the memories of old - it really adds great depth and ambiguity to the film. James Woods is charismatic as Max, being totally believable and at the same time, totally despicable (as a character!). The women are all on great form too, McGovern and Weld giving layered performances. The kids in the movie coped well with the material, but some of the lines they deliver were terrible - but hey, they're just kids, they kid a fantastic job otherwise!This is so much more different than the other gangster films. It is much more of a sad film, concerned with nostalgia and the sadness of remembering times past. The violence is there, but is subdued by the epic story and sadness conveyed. Goodfellas and Godfather still stand supreme, but this movie is really unique.A flawed masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A brilliant and ambitious gangster epic. (WARNING:Plot points revealed!),"In my opinion the third best gangster film (After Godfather and Goodfellas), but still fantastic all the same. It is extremely poetic in its flashbacks, Sergio Leone really captures the atmosphere of New York in the prohibition era. Preformances are all perfect, direction is unbeatable, how this didn't win any oscars or nominations even, is ludicrous, (Although that is the fault of the distributor for releasing a 'butchered' version of the film). Costumes, sets, everything clicks. Ennio Morricone's music is as outstanding as ever. My favourite parts: The first time cut signified by 'Yesterday'. THe second signified by the frisbee, and the egnimatic ending, in the rubbish truck. Its heavy going at 3 hours 40 mins, but its like eating a large meal. Hard but satisfying. One minor flaw: Sergio Leone's treatment of women, especially the charecter of Deborah.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A major disappointment,"Over the years, this film has gained a near-mythological status: how Sergio Leone turned down 'The Godfather' to make this opus, his 16 years trying to get it made, the film's 'butchering' upon its North American release in 1984, Leone's 'broken heart' that led to his death just a few years later, etc. So, after reading a glowing review about a new, uncut version on DVD, I couldn't wait to rent the film.I wish I could say it was a masterpiece. Clunky dialogue, lousy acting, cardboard characters, a pompous, TV mini-series feel to the story, unbelievable situations all conspire to sink this movie under its own weight.One of the problems seems to be that the script was written by Italians and then somehow translated into English by an American writer who must have a tin ear for dialogue. The actors, all of whom have been excellent elsewhere, are left to look foolish uttering the stuff. The only one who barely gets by is De Niro - we realize what a great actor he is since he makes the most what he's given, which ain't much. Poor James Woods, who has appointed himself the chief cheerleader for this film, leaves little scenery unchewed. The rest of the cast go from mediocre to embarrassing - even the lovely and talented Jennifer Connelly, who appears as the love interest as a child, does not escape unscathed.Having said all that, I seem to be in the minority about this film. So go ahead and see it, if you must. Just don't mention it in the same breath as 'The Godfather'.",,Anonymous,Crime
Pros and Con Men,"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a tricky movie to review. The film had various production issues, mainly surrounding the runtime of the movie. The version now released is 3 hours 49 minutes. The theatrical release was cut down to a 2-hour version. Leone's original plan had the footage at 6 hours, planning on it to be 2 movies. It says something about the film, that I would be interested in seeing those alternate versions. But I will try not to speculate about what could have been, but instead focus on what we got here, the 229-minute version. And what we have here... is a mixed bag.Starting with the positives, the music by Ennio Morricone is, shock, really really good. The soundtrack is able to capture a specific melancholy reminiscing feeling that only Morricone and Beatles songs can do.Also, when the movie focuses on the 4 gangsters using their street smarts to outdo the law and rivals it leads to some very creative and clever scenes. The solutions rely less on money and manpower, but more on simple ingenuity.It might be obvious, given the reputation of those involved, but it's worth mentioning. The actors all do a great job. De Niro feels like he was born to play a gangster. James Woods has a lot of emotional explosions that he has to sell, and he delivers on these big reactions.Now it is time for the negative side. I will concede, some of these are personal gripes, but this is my review, so these are my problems. This movie has a lot of scenes that are just hard to watch. The world is unpleasant. And I get it, the director is not glamorizing the gangster life. The feeling of regret permeates the story. That doesn't mean I want to see a sexual assault. I won't go into all the grizzly details; you can check the parental guide if you want to know.About the first 100 minutes focuses on De Niro and the gang as 12 year old kids. This whole section of the movie is dull. And at some points I feel like I should be on some sort of watchlist for looking at this stuff. The section of the movie that's ""GoodFella Babies"" is not what I'm looking for.Likewise, the section of the movie that has old man De Niro, is overly long. Once again, I get why they needed to frame the story in this way. But every time they cut to him reminiscing, any momentum is killed, and it just an old man wandering around.Overall, there is a lot of good parts in the film. You just have to sit through a lot of middling stuff and some filth in order to get to it. Some may disagree, but that's what is great about America, you are free to have your own opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Don't let the title lead you astray, this is no fable-like fairytale; Leone's final film formulating into a mesmeric and thoroughly worthwhile three and a half hour opus.","Once Upon a Time in America begins with some music featuring an artist singing of an America to be proud of; of an America worth dying for and a nation of which is generally somewhat better than just rather decent. The places Sergio Leone's 1984 film, the last before his 1989 death, will go are places not necessarily inclined towards painting images of the place as the song would suggest; his film an other-worldly and quite fantastic hierarchical tale told across numerous decades in the early to mid-twentieth century about kids coming to grow into adults but all the while living a persistent existence as criminals. The film begins at the ground zero stage of the 1920s streets of Brooklyn, New York City, before going on well into the 1960s; a stage by which time friendships have been forged; mistakes have been made and people have come and gone for whatever reasons. By the time it has ended, we are exhausted but in a strictly positive way.Despite being as close to death as he was, we don't necessarily feel Leone lost much of what made him the director he was. When a gangster rummages through an opium den with his cronies looking for somebody specific, he comes face to face with a female patron and her lover; a scene which is allowed to play out in that fashion that sees it oddly disgusting in its overall tone and yet oddly beautiful in its overall craft; that fashion Leone was always able to wedge out of such instances – a wordless exchange purveyed through facial expressions and feeding off of the threat somebody carries via their lowered brows and narrowed eyes. Such an instance is similar to that of how a group of ugly, disfigured bandits waited at a train station nearer the beginning of 1964's A Fistful of Dollars – their toying with the surroundings, systematically seizing and weighing absolutely everything up as what is essentially a hunt for blood takes a brief excursion, feeling prominent.The reasoning for the gangsters doing what they're doing is because of what Robert De Niro's David Aaronson, nicknamed Noodles, got himself involved in at a very early age and kept with him as he grew up. Leone has the sorts of people after Aaronson mercilessly gun down a young blonde and then beat a guy within an inch of his life in hunting their prey, a playful cut to the desired lying face-up in said drug parlour looking severely spaced out and rather vulnerable heightening tension. As it is, Aaronson knows his time has come; the curious notion of having a lead character in a gangster film effectively run from his both troubles and the enemy, when the comparable thing might be for confrontation thus leading to action. Aaronson's exit and re-entry to New York a whole forty years later is carried out in a remarkably played sequence paying sly homage to its own passing of time; specifically, utilising the sole words of ""yesterday"" (temporally) and ""suddenly"" (spacially) so as to establish an awareness of the transition from one era to another.The proceedings begin in earnest in the 1920s with Aaronson still a boy; a boy forming a clan of four with some friends and a boy whose chief items on one's mind lie in that of milling around with these pals, stealing a little something here and there, and the equally young Deborah towards whom he takes a fancy. We feel Aaronson has a genuine fondness for Deborah; the instance in which, through a corrupt cop doing things he ought not, he is permitted sexual relations of some kind however brief and crude, does not deter him from an overall goal of naturally coming to bond with Deborah. It is during these promiscuous times that he comes into contact with that of the slightly elder, but equally street smart urchin, Max Bercovicz; eventually played by James Woods. Bercovicz appears to ride into proceedings, indeed town, with his family on a horse driven cart, as if unreal; as if coming on in from the horizon: this mythical figure surely not even belonging to this realm. Aaronson and Bercovicz's oneupmanship begins mere minutes after they first meet, the targeting of an elderly drunk as a robbery victim seeing Bercovicz effectively come out on top over Aaronson but nicely teeing up what will become a series of fascinating crime infused interplay. The distinct underpinning of homoeroticism in the pair's relationship is fascinating. Overhanging it all are failed relationships with various women and quotations when things get heated, such is the way these two bicker like an old couple, along the lines of: ""Maybe I really should just dump you"" or De Niro's gem ""Wherever you go, I go""; entirely encapsulating the nature of their ties.Without letting up, Leone's exploration of these men whom grow up out of the boys we initially witness is little short of tremendous; a firm eye on the pratfalls of a life of crime. The covering of the advancing through a life of crime by Aaronson and Max et al is as dramatic as it is fraught with a great deal of substance; an occurrence in which the crew execute a diamond robbery and then double-cross the employers seeing said instance unfold within an isolated coastal locale rich in grounded tug boats. The killing of those executed a figurative running aground of those, perhaps literally, previously having had to pull along the likes of Aaronson and co. – now reduced to neatly echoing the presence of a number of small tug boats in the vicinity: rusted, unnecessary and not needed – their time to be discarded has come. Leone crosses from strand to strand; decade from decade with ease, the overhanging mystery of whom it is is involved in Aaronson's calling him back looming over everything in what is a miraculously played, really rather wondrous gangster film that is wholly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
OUATIA: My view of the movie that is considered as Sergio Leone's masterpiece,"Before I saw 'OUATIA' I had read other people's thoughts of it. This was suppose to be Sergio Leone´s masterpiece. I wasn't much impressed when I had seen the first hour or two. I found the second part to be the best one. But I want to see the beginning of it again.This is in many aspects a good and lavished film done with style and full accuracy, but for me it isn't as good as the Western movies by Leone that I have seen - Per un pugno di dollari (1964), Per qualche dollaro in più (1965), Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966), C'era una volta il West (1968), Giù la testa (1971) and Il Mio nome è Nessuno (1973).If you compare ""Once Upon a Time in America"" with Leone´s earlier movies, it misses something important. The charisma, the charm and the warmth of his characters. You never get involved as much in this main characters as you can do with those in his older works. Here you don't care as much about them, because Leone never let you get the chance to come close to them. When it comes to Robert de Niro, I don't care how good actor he is suppose to be. Since his performance in ""Taxi Driver"", you never get the chance to get involved with the characters he plays. At least in the movies I have seen. Classic Leone characters for me will for ever be Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) and John Mallory (James Coburn) in ""Giù la testa"", The Man with no name (Clint Eastwood), Cheyenne (Jason Robards), The Man (Charles Bronson), Frank (Henry Fonda) and Jill (Claudia Cardinale) in ""C'era una volta il west"", Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda) in ""Il Mio nome è Nessuno"" and Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee van Cleef) in ""Per qualche dollaro in più"". But I doubt that either Noodles or Max will join that gang. For me, Leone's main characters is seldom one dimensional or uncomplicated as the case is with this film. The difference is that this characters misses the spirit as other Leone characters use to have.I say it once more: I don't like mobster movies. And somehow the modern mobster-movies seldom gets to be something more than just imitations of ""The Godfather"". And they are often overlong. If you haven't seen any Leone movies but have decide to change that, don't start with this one. And ""OUATIA"" is almost pretentious, almost. There are several connections between this and Leone´s earlier work, so if you are the type who look close, you can see that this is a Leone-film.Rating: 7+ of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A movie that takes it self way to seriously,"A rather long, pretentious and slow movie that lacks the quality it seemingly aims for.It´s starts with a couple of poor boys that lives under working class conditions in the early 1900th century.

The boys have ambitions to become something great etc etc which obviously directs them into the criminal path.The main character is played by De Niro who is in love with a girl from early age. But the girl doesn't want him because of his gangster life and so on and so forth. You follow the boys through their lives without caring. Why should you? In the end they are mostly a-holes all of them and the story never really tries to create sympathy for them. And it never becomes anything interesting of the plot.Even though the movie tries to be a masterpiece with the melodramatic-tragic 50s-ish cinema tone and music - it falls flat before it even makes it to the start up line.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent gangster film from a great film-maker,"Sergio Leone is truly a magnificent director; I hadn't realized the magnitude of his talent and abilities until I saw this great film. The film deals with a group of friends, who meet each other and start a partnership as children. They start out as criminals, and end up as criminals. The story is excellent, and the way it is told is great, and almost unique. The non-linear time-line in the film has been copied since this film was made, by other, mostly lesser talented, film-makers, such as Quentin Tarantino. I liked the way the first 30 minutes moved along, between present and immediate past, and then went all the way back to the very beginning of the story. The plot is excellent. The way it unfolds is truly spectacular, and while some might say that it is cheapened by the fact that we know pretty much how it'll end from the beginning, I really think it added to the greatness of the film and story. The plot also moves along at a great pace, it's never boring, despite the fact that the film is over three hours long, and it's not really an action film. I would say that it has it's share of action and suspense, though. There were sequences that rival action films that are considered as some of the best in newer times. There was at least three sequences were the suspense was nerve-wrecking, and the tension so thick you could cut it with a knife. The special effects were amazingly well-done, much better than most of the same time period. I'd have to say that effects-wise, it's probably the best movie of the 80's. The acting is spectacular. Even the child actors were amazing; it was interesting to see Jennifer Connely, who's since become a star herself, play a role at such a young age, and playing it so well. The performances of the child actors are some of the best that I've ever seen in any movie, children or adults. All of the main characters, as well as most of the supporting characters were well-acted. The characters are well-written, credible, and rarely ever seemed out-of-character. The way gangster methods is portrayed is realistic and authentic, as is some of the plot. I would have to say that this film actually almost rivals The Godfather Part I as the best gangster film ever made. The only thing that bothered me was the plot twist at the end; it really seemed wrong and unlikely to me, as well as my father, who's reading a lot about the mafia. We both agreed that it seemed weird and out of character. That one thing marred the ending for me, and brought this film down from a perfect score. Apart from the ending, the final plot twist, this film is great. I recommend this to fans of Sergio Leone, gangster films, and just great films in general. Fans of any of the actors might also find it interesting. Don't be thrown off by the long runtime; it's worth every minute, up to the end(the last 15 minutes bothered me, but nothing else). 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"THE REAL CINEMA, THE BEST MOVIE EVER (from an objective) POINT OF VIEW, 4 HOURS FELT LIKE 1, THE BEST REWATCH OF ALL MY LIFE:","Before start this review i want to say:
This is my favorite movie since january and for me is the best movie ever, the first time i watched a 4 hours version, for this a remaster 4 hours and 15 minutes version with a 4k quality, it's seem a movie of the 2020s.MY REVIEW:
You have to live, everything it's life.This is the lesson of Sergio Leone in this movie.A few days ago i finished to read my currently favorite book ""Sergio Leone: why life is cinema"" a book about the life of my favorite director (with Trufautt & Chaplin) and about the behind the scenes of all his movies, with interviews curiosity and secrets about his movie who the wife told to the writer of the book, so, you can't find it on internet.The movie how i said a lot of time for me it's the best movie ever made from an objective point with The Kid of Charlie Chaplin.We don't have defects here, i swear, everything it's perfect.If i'm going to do my usually review and voting everything in this all the votes are going to do a 10/10.Everything, from the plot to the small things like the cast popularity.In this we have the greatest scenography of all time, same with the directing, acting and photography.This is a story about life, everything in life.I started a few month ago to write a movie about some kid who's doing the gangster, i have the script and maybe in future i want to do that movie and write to the end ""dedicate to Sergio Leone, the creator of cinema""
With this movie the cinema start to work hard, after that the mainstream era start and currently it's still alive.A movie for the big audience but loved from the critics and the mainstream people.A movie who didn't win an important awards, this was nominated for 5 David Di Donatello and win 0 David, Sergio Leone was betrayed from his country.The movie won only 2 BAFTA, to the best soundtrack, the best of all time and best costumes, fun fact: the Leone daughter work on the movie on assistant costumes and at the end of the filming the actor of young Max fall in love to her.This story it's about the hight and the low moment in our history, it's a story about the youth, about family, love and work.The mafia it's not so important for the story it's almost useless, it's important only for to continue the story.Everyone in this movie (every character) live a point of the life, to the family, to the youth, to the darkness, to the love, to the work.At the end of the movie every character it's chance, like the person in life, they are more bad or not. They are more patient or not, eccetera.There's no useless scenes in this.Someone say ""4 hours for a movie?"" guys, 4 hours for an entire life.And maybe i can understand that person who said that but guys, this 4 hour ares like 1 hour, i'm serious, the pacing in this it's very strange, it's magnificent.The version i seen today it's beautiful, there are other 15 minutes very cool, very, very cool and almost important for the story and i am indignant about the american cinema cut on this movie in 1984, 2 hours of this masterpiece, bah, the original version was like 8 hours.A movie who almost made my cry every single time i'm talking about it only for the fact i don't belive exists a movie like this, it's impossibile.OVERALL: 10/10I already know this.My favorite movie for ever.A masterpiece.Sergio Leone was the best director ever.The best rewatch of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Greatest Gangster Film Of All Time,"Sergio Leone's sprawling hgangster tale is like watching one of those 80's mini series, 60 years of a life told in around 4 hours. The film is well written, acted. It has humour, threat and the drive to make every gangster movie ever made look inferior.The score id phenomenal, you can feel the movements in the film in the music.Every shot is a work of art, from the streets of Brooklym to the Fruit Cellar, James Woods staring out of the window to DeNiro entering the cript.Nothing will ever beat the power of this film, its so sad Leone never eally got to see the impact it had and still has on its audience.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
If limbo was a movie,I honestly don't know what to think about this movie. It's suspenseful and violent and deep yet seems to drag on forever. Maybe this is due to the long run time (230 min) and I understand it's hard to fill that time. But I wasn't bored at any point throughout.The time skips can be jarring and seemed random at first until it finally settled into its rhythm. After that it took off and really surprised me with its themes of aging and betrayal. As Noodles and Max struggle to trust each other after falling out. It also is clear that Leone put a lot of effort into the dialogue. However I do with the music was more prevalent as it would have added so much to some scenes.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is truly the downfall of Sergio Leone. It has bad casting (except for De Niro, of course, the main actors are just not enough interesting to play that kind of characters-James Wood as the lead/villain? ughh!) a pace that feels like a corpse getting carried through a never ending parking, terribly unsignificant plot twists that goes nowhere, and above all, me and my friends had to ENDURE this catastrophe for something like 3 hours or more... and still at the end it felt like we've spent a whole day watching this load of crap.This film a plain incoherent mishmash of a story that goes everwhere and nowhere at the same time.

"Simplicity, Complexity, Suspense","Once Upon a Time in America should be regarded as a prototype for every one of its subsequent films in association to suspense. The entire film adds suspense upon suspense. Its extreme close ups, slow camera movements, and slow acting play vitally to layer onto the already intense suspense. Watching De Niro's minute long reactions and expressions repeatedly may seem like it gets old, but these reactions are telling and pieces of fantastic acting.The film seems simple, but looking back at the film's entire architecture, it's extremely complex and truly remarkable that this film was knitted together so well.

One of the greatest American gangster movies in history,"(Once Upon a Time in America 1994) An Italian-American film, this movie is classified as an epic-criminal-biographical film about the life of David (Nondells). The film takes place in the ghetto in New York City. The film talks about the lives of a group of teenagers in extreme poverty, and their beginnings in the emergence and expansion of the criminal network in New York City.A group story from a popular neighborhood in New York, documenting the relationship between this small group in a popular neighborhood full of crime and all the sterile, retro and old human diseases: racism, greed, chronic poverty, crime, keto (ethnic partisanship, which is located in a specific neighborhood that does not exceed the limits of ""the keto"" ""...). And the rise of the star of that group, its arrival to the summit, and a wonderful narration after the summit, which is the first step of the end steps, a bird did not rise except as it flew and fell.Friendship, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, the disintegration of relationships... Almost all these deadly interactions and passions that lie in the farthest dark corner of the interior of modern man, a human epic as if you were reading the Hand and watching an animated panorama of the Greek heroes, the film is the culmination of tragedy and glorification of heroic tragedies... The end of the heroes was always tragic .. Hercules, Achilles, Paris and many others. A wonderful epic panoramic film by Sergio and the culmination of this great artistic mind and the conclusion of her continuous work for fifty years.Although this movie is very long (3 hours and 47 minutes, DVD or video cassette version), it can be watched and watched every minute of the movie. In fact, the great director Sergio Leon wanted to show this movie in full, with a duration of 269 minutes (four hours and 29 minutes), but the distribution companies refused to show his movie with this length of time, so they showed his movie with a duration of 139 minutes (2 hours and 19 minutes)... This means that the distribution companies destroyed the structure The layout and basics of a movie and this led to Sergio's disappointment because he wanted to show the movie in its entirety in order to prevent the disintegration of the movie's script.This film tells the story of the gang's rise in New York City through three decades (1920s, 1930s, 1960s), using flashback and hyperlink to tell the story, it is rare to combine these two characteristics in one film, as many directors are satisfied with one Of these two characteristics, because one of them is considered dominant in itself for telling the story and directing the entire film.The film focuses deeply on the character of David ""Noodles"" (Robert De Niro), as the film depicts most of his life: his adolescence in the early twenties and his old age in the sixties of the twentieth century, and this is what calls for conclusion from the film's planning, as the planning It was very clear because it was based on recounting periods of the group's teenage life, and taking Noodles (Robert De Niro) as a model for the protagonist trying to struggle to make a living in the ghetto. The film took the character of Noodles as a model to depict his life, his adolescence, adulthood and old age.Movie summary
The film opens in the year 1933. Noodles' friend Eve is murdered by the criminal syndicate. Noodles searches for Eve's killers and finds one of his old friends, Fat Moy, on the verge of death from torture. Artistic flashback to go back and recount the cause and emergence of Noldes and his comrades.In the twenties, Noodles (real name David and nicknamed him Noodles), a completely destitute boy living in the Manhattan ghetto in New York City, looking to get away with his own foolishness and lapses, has a good number of naughty friends: Patrick, Philip and Dominic, they worked for Bugsy for a while and then quit after they met Max Berkowitz. Despite all that, Noodles liked to have independence in his life and some idiosyncrasies, even though he was homeless. He knew that having sex with a prostitute does not mean his independence, so he left the prostitute after he realized. This is evidenced by his flirting with an innocent girl named (Deborah Gilley), peeping at her through a hole in the wall when she was dancing ballet.Bugsy attacked the teenage group and killed Dominic (one of the teenage group members) with gunshots. With Dominic's death, Noodles attacked Bugsy and stabbed him several times with a pocket knife, he couldn't help himself when he was stabbing Bugsy and killed a policeman Noodles is sent to prison, and his owner, Max, stays outside, presiding over the remainder of the teenage group.In the 1930s, ten years later, Noodles (here Robert De Niro as Noodles) is released from prison in 1932, and reunites with his old friends: Max (James Woods), Patsy, Cook-Ey and Fat Moy, where They smuggle alcoholic beverages (in the 1930s, the United States banned the sale of alcoholic beverages). Noodles finally met the girl he loved from his childhood named Deborah, the relationship with her did not last because of his inappropriate behavior when they were in a limousine.There are severe disagreements between Noodles and his friend Max, because Noodles was completely opposed to Max's opinion, who is eager to restore the prestige and position of a gang after he repealed the law that incites the prohibition of alcoholic beverages, and this repeal caused a lot of trouble for the New York gangs. Max suggests that the gang, headed by Noodles, storm the Federal Reserve, Noodles considers this insane... Noodles is convinced by a gang member named Carol and tells him that he will distract the bank guards so that the gang can rob the bank, and indeed the operation succeeds.In the 1960s, specifically in 1968, we find old, helpless noodles, he lost his best friend, his girlfriend Eve was killed... He lost the greatness one dreams about, as a Napoleon who built his glory and greatness in his middle age and lost everything when he became old In old age, it was his end in exile away from his country. We see Noodles in the same case: extreme poverty in adolescence - the greatness of his middle age - loss and almost exile.The film ends in 1933 (a bold move by director Sergio Leone in choosing this ending for the film), Noodles go to a stone block full of people taking opium, the Chinese's favorite drug. The Chinese servant massages him and gives him a pipe, and Noldes takes a poppy and begins to smoke them... Through this scene it is as if the events that happened to him have a bad nightmare or all of that were a great delusion in his life... With all that, Noldes smiles and depicts a smiling face through a transparent cloth and the movie ends.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Once upon a time....in our life....we get to savour something extraordinary.,"This weekend had to be a celebration of #EnnioMorricone's work.
I chose to watch #OnceUponATimeInAmerica. Ennio Morricone perfectly understood what #SergioLeone wanted. For many scenes, there isn't a word said. The music and the images on their own tell a story.
Deborah's theme keeps lingering in the mind long after you've finished watching the movie. As also Cockeye's song with Gheorghe Zamfir's pan flute accompaniment.
The film is magical. But there's a catch - very few people have ever seen it. Even people who think they have seen it, have not. The studio behind the film went beserk when they saw the length and butchered it to a short version which got rejected by the American audiences on its release. The video version, that respects the director's intent, is magical - all 3 hours and 49 minutes of it. (If you're looking for a 90 minutes slam-bang movie, then this will be a disappointment.) One of the best films ever made. Sergio Leone is a director who understands the art of cutting a movie in a manner that keeps you focused till the end.
And terrific performances. But what else can one expect from actors of the calibre of Robert De Niro, Elizabeth McGovern, James Woods, Joe Pesci and the entire ensemble.
Lastly, the script which took 12 years to complete that covers every detail.

An overly long Sergio Leone epic.,"Nobody doubts Sergio Leone's talent as a director. While he's best known for his Spaghetti Westerns, he did make a few films like Once Upon a Time in America (1984). One does wonder if Leone was given free rein with this film, as it was probably an hour longer than it needed to be and included a lot of situations that could have been cut out, or at least trimmed down. If anything, it's clear directors like Quentin Tarantino were influenced by movies like this, considering some of the similarities between it and Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood (2019).I will admit that most of the scenes in this fractured timeline of a story were necessary. Something that was shown early in the film would inevitably come into play near the end. However, I don't think this excuses the numerous (and gratuitous) sex scenes included in this film. With a run time of almost four hours (including an intermission to boot), at what point does the audience understand what's happening while the movie continues beating a dead horse. Granted, when a film like this is basically three separate movies with these characters at three different times in their life, it can mostly justify being this long.While Once Upon a Time in America is a distinct piece of Americana (read: Jewish mobsters in New York), I can't help but recognize its notoriety due to its actors. With big players like Robert DeNiro, James Woods, and Jennifer Connelly involved, it's no wonder why it remains one of Sergio Leone's best films. Of course, I still consider his ""Dollars Trilogy"" to be better, if for no other reason than for the setting and cinematography. However, there were plenty of film techniques (like the numerous crane shots) that make Once Upon a Time in America a master class in how to shoot a film.An overly long Sergio Leone epic, I give Once Upon a Time in America 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The story is all over the place, the direction is utterly confusing, the script is laughable and, despite the great cast, the acting is pathetic at best. I've seen two versions of this film and it gets worse and worse every time. I'm not too sure how director Sergio Leone envisioned this film, but it felt like Leone lost his focus and tried to put two small overblown films into one hugely overblown film. How on earth this film got onto IMDb's top 250 is beyond me. I think Once Upon a Time in America may fall into the category of being ""voted"" a great film based on the names in the cast and production crew.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
The greatest mafia film you're ever likely to see,"Something has led me to believe that Sergio Leone, must be the envy of a lot of gangster film directors for bringing this once in a lifetime mafia classic to the screen, something I would of loved to experience, up there with Scarface. Every scene in this is magical as it is precious, like each fragment of a second or each piece of a finely tuned instrument. The acting is once in a lifetime spectacular, from a wonderfully chosen cast, and it's smaller players (Joe Pesci, James Russo, even Danny Aiello) The story moves back and forth through three generations of a forged friendship between four successful gangsters, plus one, shot way too young, where one of the four gangsters paid for it, while avenging his shot mate, by knifing the enemy (Russo) We move ahead in time where the avenging Noodles (Deniro) gets out and rejoins Max (Woods) and his two other mates, one being the great character actor (William Forsythe) his trademark facial, a lazy eye. The movie starts off in a few violently confronting scenes, the first one, having you hooked from the start, involving one of Deniro's floosies, who's way of death is practically mapped out for her. The next scene has the brother of a girl, Deniro's always had the hots for, being used a punching bag. Violence isn't frequent, only used when necessary, but when it happens, IT HAPPENS. I'm really not gonna tell you much more here. The film is a flawless masterpiece on many levels, photography, music score, remarkable period settings, (the New York bridge for one) etc. About every scene is treasured. I know two people who say this is their favorite movie. It may not be mine, but it's up there. This great treasured jewel of a film, you would never believe was made by the same guy responsible for those spaghetti (Clint) westerns. Leone must be having a great laugh now, for creating something so unique, it will never come this way again, and it happened in the good old year of 1985.

Gunsmoke and mirrors,"To call Sergio Leone's opium-scented labyrinthine gangster epic 'a bit of a downer' would be both an understatement and an injustice to this remarkable, cinematic tone-poem, relating how organised crime played a role in shaping Modern America. It's true, this is a very long, very sad film encompassing child murder, prostitution, graphic rape, terrible betrayal, and the weary recollections of a pathetic, broken old man. It's also unmistakably, tremendously alive, and alert to the possibilities of narrative (non-linear) and form (pure artistry in every frame). Often, it makes The Godfather look like an episode of The Bill. And, at its close, contains a shot at something like redemption.

An unnecessarily padded and ersatz schlep of a film.,"It is high time that American critics and fans alike start to debunk their unquestioned, sloppy veneration of films like Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America'. The checkered history of this opulent film (and the grand, fanciful myth associated with it's production and many versions) belies its mediocrity on a narrative level. The film lurches backward and forward in fits and starts, its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the ersatz decadence of towering sets, the minutia of production detail and the, by 1984, cliche'd but gorgeous cinematographic confection on offer to the audience. The plot's time frame is confusing, gimmicky and laboured, leading some critics to imagine the Noodles figure's opium binging to be the antecedent of some future 'dream reality' as well as the sepia-toned remembrances. This ham handed, overly fan boy-apologetic interpretation glosses over the glaring narrative irregularities on display. Even at this full (?) running time, figures appear and disappear with alarming suddenness: the Deborah character is fleetingly established in child form, a cold and unattainable 'trophy' female, not even hinting at the gravity with which she will re-establish her relationship with a post-prison Noodles, the said re-union henceforth rings completely false. The deadening pace is somewhat to blame, certain sequences drag along stagnantly for far too long, signifying very little, hinting at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obligated to usurp every iota of screen time possible in order to show off his production, fatal for a film that contains figures so sullen and aloof. The trajectory of the figures' lives is presented to us as a microcosm mirroring the historical trajectory of America's teens through prohibition and its spoils, ending with the (arguable) ruin of its moribund central figures (save Deborah- a make up department fumble or intentional one wonders). This notion is commonplace, even banal. The cast of characters as imagined in the one note script (written by seven Italians no less) are flatly and awkwardly played by all but the younger actors, who at least venture a few variant facial expressions. This is understandable given the almost unworkable material. Some critics state that the characters may seem so impenetrably self-absorbed, but actively seek their own goals, assuming the compliance of others (e.g. when Noodles gets out of prison, Max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not this is what he desires and later makes deals assuming Noodles will comply). This explanation of their abrupt, abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily extraneous and merely serves to highlight the complicated ends the films unwavering supporters will go to to defend their positions regarding a film unfortunately short on sense. Although Ennio Morricone's score is much revered, it is undeniably schmaltzy and repetitive, it gushes with an emotional redolence that the scenes themselves, many violent, just do not warrant. At points it is questionable whether or not Morricone was watching the same film I was so incongruous is his work. As a paean to American Filmmaking, it succeeds in terms of mood (helped by a few strokes of masterful editing segueing between time periods) and visuals (not helped by said score) but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Seldomly a film of such beauty...,"I was in my teens,about sixteen or seventeen,when I first saw this film and,incidentally,I was at an age when the twenties imagery fascinated me-well it still does... Highly artistic was the opening scene,when the annoying phone calls are associated with a lavish party scene-a symbol for life's vanity and the revenge of a guilty conscience for all the pleasures(similarly in Shakespearean theater the obsessive repetition of nagging noises is actually stands for the guilt complexes from the past reemerging). It's,like previously other viewers noticed,the story of a few poor immigrant boys trying to conquer the new promised land-even if they end up building an empire of crime(let's face it,they did't have any other chance to evolve from rags to riches considering their social background)they are somewhat American pioneers,these solitary,strong-minded and ambitious heroes who turned the U.S. into what it is today. By the way,American capitalism and political life,even if apparently honest and fair-play are not necessarily based on legal methods... Eventually their twisted friendship will(like in a passionate,irrationally intense love-story)destroy everything it touched-and in between an epic spanning between 1915 and 1968,a visual treat of elegant vintage cars,stylish clothing and sophisticated champagne bottles-all the luxury and fascination of the legendary prohibition age. The scene where Prohibition is ""buried""-somewhat resembling the ""Death of Glitter"" concert from ""Velvet Goldmine"",actually a coffin-shaped chocolate-cake is surrounded by four candles stuck into Cordon Rouge bottles,is one of the most influential in film history,probably known and loved even by the ones who aren't much into this genre,did not watch/enjoy this film. In my opinion this scene is capturing all the beauty and vanity of life,youth,ambition and pleasure-it is almost possible to feel,to sense an utterly voluptuous universe fading away,becoming impossible to hold back... I don't think that the characters were homosexual,in spite of their very strong friendly love,I guess this film is rather a hymn in the honor of a myth as old as mankind:friendship;even admitting that this film involves a certain homo erotic subtext,it is that high-minded, poetic,strictly Platonic homo eroticism to be found in the strong bonds that existed among e.g. ancient warriors wanting to be buried together and have their ashes mixed for eternity-this ritual(though altered) actually happens this way in this film too. I also don,t buy the preconception that Max was a traitor-notice that even his more balanced friends are actually brutes occasionally violently bursting out like wild animals-he's just a better survivor and fighter that the rest.Of course he might be more megalomaniac,self-indulgent and egocentric than the others,but he's acting according to the rules of gangland and of his Jewish background-the Jewish origin of most of the characters partly explain their talent for money-making,their compellingly manipulative personalities,their practical intelligence. While Noodles turns out,in my opinion,as a winner in the end.Even if poor and forgotten,even if he gets high in order to forget life's misery,he seems balanced and appeased in the end.After going trough pretty much of what his century had to offer,after undergoing so many experiences and changes,he takes refuge in a world(even if artificially created by drugs)where,in an almost godlike way,only the beauty,the legendary side of the violent age of gangsters exists.He therefore rescued,almost like Proust,trough the power of memory,his glamorous and adventurous youth from extinction. Another fascinating (among many others) scene is the one when a posh partying crowd is throwing with Cordon Rouge bottles out of an old timer swiftly and almost invisibly driving by-this scene somewhat exhales the ghastly,nostalgic roaring twenties beauty,like in a novel by Fitzgerald or a visually disturbingly compelling&lush period piece by Ken Russel. Irespective of the dark,violent and bleak message of this film,I'll always remember it as one of the most accomplished visual poems dedicated to youth and the unlimited ambitions it is often linked with. Therefore a lush and highly fulfilling treat due to its immense and very credible evocative power,depicting credible and actual scenes without ever being common or boring.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

After a deeper look though, it is evident that these ""unsatisfied customers"" are mostly looking for straight-forward entertainment, fast-paced action and possibly a scripts that does not require any critical thinking ability nor any particular familiarity with poetry. Moviemaking for the past 25 years seems to have focused on offering just that 99% of the time. If we add that the majority of IDMb users commenting on these movie nowadays are predominantly generation Z , then it is clear why so many negative comments. So... if action and fast-paced dialogues is what you are looking for, then do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. You will be bored to death as many have pointed out already. Watch ""Once Upon A Time In America"" ONLY if you enjoy poetic takes on life, the choices we make and the relationships that accompany our paths throughout this worldly adventure. Watch this movie for the incredibly beautiful photography, the outstanding production design, the gigantic work of director Sergio Leone and for the heart-wrenching achingly beautiful music by Maestro Ennio Morricone. Expect a poignant and dramatic movie (like life itself is) and be aware that emotional maturity, some life experiences and possibly some cultural background are needed to really grasp the wide spectrum of emotions and achievements encompassed in this masterpiece. If you don't feel touched by this film at this stage of life, don't worry... you will later on",,Anonymous,Crime
Great stuff,"The third film in Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time trilogy. Once Upon a Time in America is an absolute giant of a film and is also a great film in the gangster genre. It provides an objective viewpoint of the lives of Jewish gangsters during the American Prohibition era. It doesn't romanticise their actions, but rather allows the viewer to make up their own minds. Everything about the film also felt authentic from the dialogue, to the costumes to the props. Every seemed genuine. Although, the three and a half hour run time does make this film a bit of a slow-burner, it also delves very deeply into each character's back story.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/TZT1tM",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sergio Leone's Masterpice,"OK this film was a workout to sit through but boy was it worth it. Sergio Leone's final movie, Once Upon a Time in Amereica, is an epic and arguably his best film. After seeing this, I recognize the great tragedy of the film's editing in its original theatrical run in 1984. Years later we've finally learned what this film is. A dying will of one of the most influential directors of all time.The film is about the lives of four Jewish gangsters as they grew up in Prohibition era and the haunting consequences of one of their decisions. its the story of a lifetime of childhood friends, from boys growing up on the streets in the Jewish district of Manhattan getting involved with the mob, to becoming the biggest bootleggers in New York. This film is just a wonderful trip through. The story line is well planned out and the pacing is done well to where events flow seamlessly throughout those nearly 4 hours. Each frame is painstakingly shot and shows the artesian craft of Leone. Performances of Robert DE Niro, who is good like his usually is, and James Woods, who is especially standout in his role, give human depth to the film that so many other epics/gangster films lack. the film's score adds even more to it with beautiful string melodies to pan flute solos(go figure in a movie like this).Overall if you have the time to devote to watch to this, the do it. This can stand alongside The Godfather or Goodfellas in its genre. This is something to watch it if you can appreciate the art and journey of the story throughout. Sergio Leone's farewell is an amazing film.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The use of sound in this movie is very ingenious,"Sound is the most important element in this film. It not only constructs a complete space-time span of 30 years, but also completes the psychological transition by a series of means, such as the sound painting counterpoint, the sound painting separation and so on. The era symbol of music is extremely accurate, and the soundtrack shows the nostalgic atmosphere of sadness and indulgence.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good but not great,"I wanted to like this movie. I love some of Sergio Leone's other movies and kind of expected to enjoy this, his last movie, at least as much. For some reason I had never seen more than clips of it.  Leone's movies always have great atmosphere and interesting minor characters. It was a treat to see Jennifer Connelly in her 1st role, and of course it had to be her eyes that got her the part, since Leone tells at least part of his stories with the eyes. This brings up the movie's weakness, the story. I didn't think it was a compelling story, not one to spend 3+ hours on. There weren't many tense moments, unsympathetic main characters that all deserved to die if only for not cracking any good jokes or one liners, and there was none of the sweeping scope that you might expect from a Leone movie. The end was a muddy puddle that didn't make a lot of sense. I'm glad I watched this highly regarded movie, but I doubt that I will again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great mob epic and last film from the legendary Sergio Leone,"Sergio Leone's last film Once Upon A Time In America is a very well crafted gangster epic that looks and sounds great with excellent acting and direction. The film is somewhat in the same vein as The Godfather, but with more unexpected twists and turns and of course shot in Sergio Leone's distinct style. The film was supposed to be 6 hours long in Sergio's original cut, over 10 hours of footage was shot, the version that I have viewed clocks in at around 4 hours and is the closest version available to the directors cut. While some of this footage could have made the film more comprehensible, what is left is cohesive and much of what is missing is left to the viewers interpretation. Which is good, I think. Anyway, the film centers around the life of Noodles and his friends and business associates, who were street hoods as youths in NYC's lower east side and later bootlegger gangsters during the prohibition era. The cast is excellent with Robert De Niro, James Woods, William Forsythe and great looks and excellent performances from Tuesday Weld and Elizabeth Mc Govern. Joe Pesci and Burt Young have memorable cameos as well. Another thing that sets this apart from most other films in the genre is that these mobsters are not Italian or Irish, but Jewish. Once Upon A Time In America is a great film and is recommended viewing if you have seen The Godfather films, but are open to something a little more offbeat, but still very much high quality then you should give this film a go.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
a superlong mobcrimedrama,"That goes faster and faster for each time i view it, so it might be some sense in the saying that time flies faster when you become older. its in fact so long and full of hidden loopholes that turns up like a gopher, did i see this last time?-feeling.its almost or close upto the godfather films of content and quality, and i remember when young , we had video egettogethers on saturdays, and i was the only one staring wide eyed at 4 a.m. in the morning the rest of my buddies long gone into neverland.so it made a deep impression to then,and still do today.for the young generations of today i guess they will sense this crimedrama as a new production, because the filmography,the score and the locationgallery are so darn timeless and the acting astonisjing. the only actor i miss in this film is al pacino, the mobster king above all.the grumpy old man has this on his top 20 list, and if you disagree,then do repeat the pain and review the flick another time, its the best of the longest....",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Heading my top ten list of all time great movies!,"Everyone is trying to compare this movie to 'goodfellas' and 'the godfather' because they are all gangster movies.  It seems that people fail to realize that these are vastly different movies.  ""Goodfellas"" excelled at its excellent direction and cinematography; ""godfather"" with its awesome performances and a great script.  However, neither one of these movies offer as much thermatic impact over its audience like ""america"".  I guess lots of movie audience will be scared away from the rich themes of friendship, betrayal, love, regret that are displayed in multilayers in ""america"". The movie forces its audience to immerse deep with its main characters and do some soul searching after reviewing.  I watched the movie about 8-10 times in the last 12 years and simply could not forget noodles and max.Great story, great direction, tremendous acting from De Niro, Woods, to the young actors like Scot Tiler and Rusty Jacobs. The cinematography is wonderful, and art direction/set desing is awesome.  Throw in the best soundtrack of all time and you get a rare masterpiece right here.  This is a movie that I will rank along with 'passions of joan arc', 'bicycle thief', 'decalogue', 'casablanca', 'andrew rublev', 'berlin alexander square', '400 blows', 'tokyo story' and 'seven samurai' as one of the best movies of all time.  And it's certainly my personal all time favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Once Upon a Time in America,"What I liked: This film does away with romanticising the American gangster and instead shows a brutal depiction of men who have no moral compass. They're sexual abusive, murderous and untrustworthy cockroaches to society and this film shows that in full, harrowing detail. The obvious concern before watching this film is the near 4 hour run time but that run time is completely earned and this film doesn't have a dull moment. I was planning on watching it in 2 halves but ended up just knocking it out in one sitting as I was enjoying it that much.It studies many themes, most notably: friendship, betrayal, regret, toxic masculinity/ misogyny, the passage of time and existentialism. All of these are done very effectively.The cinematography is perfect. I love Leone's contrast in use of close ups and extreme long shots. All of the shots in this film are so beautiful, especially the famous one from the cover of Manhattan Bridge. Lastly Ennio Morricone's score is poetic and incredible.What I disliked: Some dodgy child acting.Although I completely understand the treatment of women being realistic to these characters, some of the women act strangely forgiving to these men.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Top Ten Movie Of All time,I think the best part of the movie has to be the writing. The story is just fantastic.  Sergio Leone then put together a masterpiece of film making with all the twist and turns hidden in it.  I instantly recognized it as his work because I have seen so many of his spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood. I was also amazed that it was made in the 80's and I had heard nothing of it until probably 1994.  If they made more movies like this now I would be at the theater more often!!,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fabulous, but...","Like most of you, I too loved this film. (Some of the scenes in New York are among the most beautiful on film and the score is incredible) I do have one minor quibble with the film. The characters in the film never really strike me as being Jewish. If you watch the Godfather, you notice how often Italian is spoke, especially in the flashback in Godfather II. Jews in New York at the time of this film would either speak only Yiddish or, more likely, a mixture of Yiddish and English. There are only a couple of lines in Yiddish in the film and they are simple expressions, not conversation The fact that none of the actors were Jewish would make that difficult I know, but it does take away from the authenticity of the film somewhat. I still love it though.",,Anonymous,Crime
Used to be a street kid,"Watching 3 CD movie feel like watching more than a 500 - page book, your heart will say, ""how long ah"", which has been reluctant to go to touch, ""once upon a time in America"" is such a movie to me, have already heard its name, early listen to how many people told me that this is a great movie, but I heard that to 4 hours to sew on still hasn't happened to see. Finally, spent an afternoon to see this film, at the same time, because of its beautiful music, it can be said that after listening to this film, this year just passed the second year of my life in my heart unexpectedly also surging an old man like the vicissitudes of life.My favorite actor, Robert. DE niro's appearance in the film is one of my favorite parts of the movie. His character's name is really funny, ""Noodles"". Although ""nods"" sounds nice if it is transliterated as ""nuds"", it is still a bit funny to think about the original meaning of ""Noodles"". But the noodle story isn't funny. Like many movies that span a person's life or most of his life, the gangster story is set against a backdrop of juvenile frivolity, middle-aged pride and old age. This is a retrospective movie, the old noodles are touched again and again, so as to recall the past days and the past grievances. Such movies often give people a sense of vicissitudes, especially accompanied by the music of vicissitudes, which makes people easy to lean on the chair and sink into the sofa. What's more, this movie is not like ""cinema paradiso"" like a period of time to recall after leaving a warm tail, but also let me after watching the heart of a ""this is a good movie"" after a burst of melancholy.From the point of view of the story alone, the story of this movie is more conventional but still fascinating. Four hours is not a long time for me, but I am deeply attracted by the fate of noodles and friends. What impresses me most is still the time when noodles and friends were street boys, who were young and frivolous, precocious but somewhat naive, who could set fire to a newsstand without paying protection money, and who, as usual, were fascinated by a girl. There are a lot of deep, evocative details. Article such as face to face can finally get it and kiss an angel Deborah narrative, he chose to follow outside Max's summon, perhaps understandable as a street to stimulate the call of life, in the end, Deborah to noodle shop doors are closed, also seems to be to the door of a door to another life close to him, the noodles has thoroughly took to the streets, onto the gang life. Another child, waiting outside the door with a cake intended to please his ""lover"", first eats some cream, then succumbing to the temptation to eat the whole cake, and then panicking when the ""lover"" shows up. The last good thing he did was to touch the stack of banknotes. After that, the young boy ""slipped"" and the American dream was shattered. Angry noodles revenge ""slip"" of the child, was put in prison, here, the streets of their young time is over, and seems to be from the moment they also doomed life direction, frivolous and beautiful youth time has to go to, then they are grown up, waiting for their is killing, murky adult story.The door that had been closed to him as a teenager was an eternal pain in his heart. His vulnerability was here. He seemed to be the backbone of a domineering gang. So, he had been gentle to Deborah when he was about to leave the girl of his dreams in his youth, he even attacked her in despair, and then fell into empty remorse. At that moment, his American dream seemed to be broken. Max is also a film focusing on shaping figure, he had a deep friendship and noodles, but he has been like his name ""Max"" to maximize their own interests by hook or by crook, he is ambitious, even cheat a friend, his dream seems to be true, but soon disillusioned, even feel alive is a kind of burden, his dream is broken.Although full of scenes in the movie the bloody scene, full of broken dreams again and again, but the final feud mood seems to be breaking, for in the past, they meet, though not a smile, also forget the boon sorrow, and many of these films, in the end, in a pleasant and vicissitudes of life in the music, images of youth again, let a person deeply touched. In the end, everything calmed down except for the laughter of noodles in the opium den.It's a deep film, it's not called once upon a time in gangland or once upon a time in noodles but once upon a time in America, which is really very apposite, it's a gangland story set against an American past, and I don't think it has what many people would call an ""epic effect,"" but there's a lot to be said for the choices of the different people in the film. The music of the film is worth mentioning. The music of different styles under different plots adds a lot of color to the film. After watching the film and listening to the original sound of the film, I think of the door of Deborah's shop again. Which door did you miss?",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
It looks nice,"Once upon a time in America is a very long movie about a set of very unlikable gangsters. It looks very good, it sounds very good and there are some very nice period set pieces.There are also a lot of very nice scenes but a movie is not just a collection of scenes, especially a 4 hours long movie and this is where the movie falls apart.If you are expecting a coherent and nicely executed story then too bad. The story telling is sloppy. Characters enter and exit the story on a whim. Character motivation changes whenever it suits the story if we are even lucky enough to get any. Add to that story elements that are just plain unbelievable or feel out of place and you end up with a strange mish mash of a story.For a four hour movie this is a huge letdown. There are still plenty of things to enjoy and overall the movie was fine but it wasn't good.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A GEM!,"Another GEM by Sergio Leone.
What a fabulous journey back and forth between the very beginning and middle of 20th century United States.
Everything about this movie is perfect:
Story, costumes, setting, script, music, pace, acting, cast, FRIENDSHIP, ambition, and 100% realistic.
It can easily be considered one of the best full-length films of all time.
It wonderfully depicts the American society (particularly amongst the poorer classes) before and after the two world wars and during the infamous prohibition era.
At times, it feels like a strange-but-fascinating kind of modern western picture, especially when the protagonists were in their teen years (or even younger).
It's endearing; it's true to life; it's a GEM!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Glad I gave this another try!!,"Upon first viewing, I could only get through an hour and twenty minutes of it since it was very slow and I didn't care as much about the plot at all, or the kids that were on the streets of New York for the first third of the movie, but that was right before it got really good when I had just turned it off the first time!I watched it again and I was very surprised to have liked it much better as the plot progressed to what I hadn't seen before! James Woods gives a great performance and the unexpected/shocking twist moments of betrayal and murder were very captivating! I liked seeing Joe Pesci and Burt Young in the movie as well, however I felt that their characters were somewhat underutilized. I liked Robert DeNiro in it as well and Sergio Leone's directing skills are nothing to scoff at. Overall, while a bit too long, I am happy I gave it another shot and could appreciate it much more for what it did.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Greatest movie ever made,"Without giving spoilers away. This movie's whole plot is so fitting for this site. Everything is a matter of perspective and point of view.I first saw this movie very young my dad was watching it at 11pm on TV it was edited, he loved it and bought the dvd and eventually I ended up getting the Blu-ray directors cut to see what I was missing. At 4hrs 11mins this is the best movie I've ever seen. I've watched it once a year at least, and everytime the story of loyalty, friendship, love, hate, betrayal, its all here.unfortunately it's underrated badly, due to what I think is modern day lack of concentration. People haven't got the attention span nor the intelligence to sit and concentrate on a 4 hour movie, listening to dialogue. The same people I've seen say this was bad also said Godfather parts 1 and 2 were boring!! This movie needs concentration, so if you are someone who can't let go of their social media for 10 mins like most these days don't bother. If you can then watch it uninterrupted for 4hrs and 11mins I guarantee everytime you watch it, your opinion on the story, the plot, the ending will change each time. As I started with this movie's main point in my eyes is all based on a matter of perspective, in this case the story changes with noodles or max's perspective. As noodles says 'its just the way I see things' I hope more and more people can watch this and enjoy it as much as I do it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Godfather. Definitely my number 1 film and should be anyones top 5",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
