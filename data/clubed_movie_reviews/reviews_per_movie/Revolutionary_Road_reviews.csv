Thought-provoking and sad.,"Having been a 50s housewife with children at home and a husband who wanted to be anywhere but there, this movie was familiar territory. How many of us in those years simply packed our dreams away for the immediate necessity of putting food on the table and paying the mortgage? Di Caprio is outstanding, as is Winslet, she having to deal with an American accent along with the tearing emotions. I didn't see that anyone picked up on the final scene, of Kathy Bates and her husband, but to me that was the whole moral of the story - here is where you will end up if you give in to what you know is not right for you. Overall, though, well done - except women in the 50s did NOT wear hats to work!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The American dream is actually a nightmare.,"A young couple living in 1950's suburbia think they are different from all the other families living the American Dream. Although, they soon find out that not every dream comes true and they fall exactly into the situations they didn't want to be in. Their marriage is falling apart, they have trouble raising their children and they want out of this lifestyle.Sam Mendes is a filmmaker who knows exactly what he wants, which is why he would want to work on this film. Revolutionary Road is probably his least interesting film, story wise. After-all, it's just about two people who try to cope with their lives. There is no motivational plot to it, but the thing about this film is that it doesn't need one. We are getting a glimpse into the lives of two people who had big dreams and realized that they had to sacrifice them in order to live their lives. It's sad, but it also rings true.The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the married couple who constantly fight. Everyone called this film the ""What If Jack and Rose Ended Up Together"" movie. Yet it is so much more than that. They give powerful performances, which unfortunately were overlooked during the Oscar season. Another Titanic star, Kathy Bates, gives her support to the couple as the real estate agent who thinks the world of them. She has a son, who is mentally unstable and asks to bring him over for dinner one night. Michael Shannon plays the son and he steals both scenes he is in. For a guy who is deemed insane, he is the only one who speaks the truth.I watched this flick because so many people told me how depressing it was. While it was depressing I didn't find it to be that bad. The most depressing aspect of the film is how relatable it is to real life. This story happens everywhere and that is the sad part.The cinematography is great, the 1950's feel was spot on and really gave the film more of a cinematic sense of wonder to it. Roger Deakins seems to know exactly what is needed for every film he takes on. The look and feel of the film here is so simple, yet so beautiful at the same time.Finally, I can see why people may not like this film. It's definitely an acquired taste. I was not in love with it by any means and for those involved it's not their best work. Instead it's a film to enjoy once. I wouldn't bother watching it again because the pace is long and I feel that I won't be as engaged a second time.On a final note, why do guys from the 1950's only last about 15 seconds?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truth is usually in singular - Lies always come in plural.,"I saw an advance screening of Revolutionary Road in Beverly Hills, CA this evening (December 14th). A Q&A session followed the screening with Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, Kathryn Hahn, and screenwriter Justin Haythe. Photos from the Q&A are attached to this report.Revolutionary Road is a story that you won't be able to shake easily. The film will stick in your head and leave you to contemplate what has just happened on the screen before you. Richard Yates gives us the story of Frank and April Wheeler, the seemingly perfect suburbia couple. We soon find out their marriage is teetering on the edge of a collapse as they are overwhelmed by the fact that they have each made the wrong choices in their lives.Once again Kate Winselt and Leonardo DiCaprio come together with great chemistry, pulling the best out of each other. This is a heavy film with emotionally complex characters, I'm not sure I could think of any two actors that could pull off the roles of Frank and April Wheeler like Leonardo and Kate did.""Truth is usually in singular - Lies always come in plural."" I'm not sure who said that, but it is a notion that sums up this film.Michael Shannon shinned in his role as the clinically insane son of Kathy Bates character; John Givings. Bates and Shannon both deliver humorous scenes to this heavy storyline, although there are times when you see the sadness and desperation in their characters as well. Michael Shannon's character, John Givings, is the truth in this film. Although clinically insane, he can see through everyone's lies and does the unthinkable; he forces everyone face their own truth.I guarantee you will not be singing ""My Heart Will Go On"" after seeing this film. But you won't be disappointed with this little film gem.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not revolutionary, but very powerful and moving","That 'Revolutionary Road' was directed by Sam Mendes (who directed the brilliant 'American Beauty' nine years earlier) and that it reunited two immensely talented actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet after 1997's 'Titanic' were reasons enough to see it.'Revolutionary Road' may not be ""revolutionary"" and it is not perhaps a film that will be re-watched over and over by me. This said, there is so much to appreciate, there is no denying that it's incredibly well made and superbly acted. And to me and many others (though it is an understandably polarising film, the dark and unpleasant subject matter is not for everybody) it is a powerful and moving film, and one of the most realistic and truthful depictions of a struggling marriage on film.Visually, 'Revolutionary Road' is wonderfully shot, bleak but also sumptuous, while the scenery and 50s production values are evocatively and handsomely rendered. Thomas Newman's music score is hauntingly hypnotic, achingly melancholic and at times ominous.While at times stagy, the dialogue is insightful, making one really think about what it's saying (it has much to say and knows how to say it without preaching) and for many will wrench the gut and induce floods of tears. There is a little levity provided by Kathy Bates, that could have been ill-fitting but is pitched well. The story is deliberate, but the atmosphere is brilliantly evoked and there are many parts that have huge power and are emotionally devastating, especially in the latter parts.Sam Mendes keeps things at an assured pace, keeps the atmosphere alive and doesn't undermine the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet in any way. DiCaprio and Winslet embody their roles, which are intentionally not the most likable, are very complex and very much compellingly real, and their chemistry is both tense and affecting. Winslet has the more complex one of the two and her performance is a heart-wrenching emotional roller-coaster, while DiCaprio gives an explosive turn especially in the fever pitch latter parts.Michael Shannon proves himself to be a scene stealer as the brutally honest crazy nut, and Kathy Bates brings well-timed levity.Overall, a powerful and moving film that is highly appreciated in many ways. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wheeler Family Values,"The Titanic lovers, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, get reunited for Revolutionary Road a tale of sterile life in the suburbs during the Eisenhower years. Not that this is anything new, the subject was done as comedy and as drama in such diverse films way back then as Rally Round The Flag Boys and Strangers When We Meet.It's a nice story, but not one I could terribly worked up about. So Leonardo is working for some firm as a sales rep and it's a job he hates. Good for him, 90% of the American work force are in jobs that are just paychecks to support themselves and their families. Which Leo and Kate increased by two during the course of the film.Seeing themselves in a rut, Kate lets fly the brilliant suggestion that he just quit and move to Paris. Not only that he should just 'find himself' and she'll work and support and raise the kids and him. Leo likes the idea, but then gets cold feet and it goes downhill from there.Leo and Kate are fine, but the film just is not up to the standards set by Titanic. I sure cared a lot more about Jack and Rose than I did about either of the Wheelers. Nevertheless Revolutionary Road which is the name of the street the Wheelers live on in the film, got three Oscar nominations including one for Michael Shannon as the bipolar son of the Wheeler's neighbor Kathy Bates who sold them the house. Nowadays Shannon would be on his meds and leading a more productive life than he is here. Shannon lost for Best Supporting Actor to Heath Ledger for the Dark Knight.Revolutionary Road is entertaining, but hardly groundbreaking.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans,"Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in ""Revolutionary Road,"" a 2008 film directed by Sam Mendes. The film also features Kathy Bates and John Givings.It's 1955. Frank and April Wheeler have been married seven years, live in the Connecticut suburb and have two children. Frank works for a company that his father worked for, and he hates his job. April is a stay-at-home mom who wanted to be an actress.While it might look good on the outside, this isn't the life either one envisioned. But April has an idea. They have enough money saved so that they can move to Paris, a city Frank loves. She can get a job as a secretary, which pays very well over there, and Frank can stay at home and decide what he really wants to do with his life. It sounds possible but maybe not practical, though Frank ultimately agrees to it.Frank can't seem to find the right moment to give his notice; and then April discovers that she is pregnant. What now? There are lots of layers in this emotionally resonant, magnificently acted film. It's very much a story of its time for several reasons. The first is that it's obvious that April suffers from very bad depression. Though post-war psychological problems were recognized, actual depression, especially in a woman, probably wasn't given much attention. It was the returning soldiers who had suffered trauma who had the psychiatric focus. If by some means she had been discovered to have clinical depression, the medicine was horrible.The second thing is that it was 1955. The ideas of picking up and moving to Europe with your family and the woman as breadwinner were outrageous back then. Now, not so much.The third reason is that April at least had an artist's mentality and an artist's way of looking at the world. In this world, we have the practical and the artist, as in the O'Neill play Beyond the Horizon, where one brother is a farmer and the other brother is a poet who dreams of going out to sea. The problem is, there's no way to kill those attributes, and if you try, you won't be happy. April shouldn't have been married, shouldn't have been living in the suburbs, and shouldn't have stayed home.Frank is more practical, though he'd like to be different, would like to do something he loves, if only he knew what that was. April thought he was cosmopolitan, adventurous, and that together, they'd be special. The idea that they're not special is something she can't tolerate.This is such a fascinating movie about life's disappointments, punctuated with some humor by Kathy Bates as Mrs. Givings, a loquacious woman, whose son (Michael Shannon) has been institutionalized. When he meets the Wheelers, he has an uncanny way of speaking exactly the truth no one wants to hear. Shannon does a fantastic job in these disturbing scenes.A shattering movie. I like to be entertained in films. I feel like we all have so much to reality to face, why not be able to turn away from it - but a beautifully realized film like this about dysfunction - somehow, I don't mind.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Frighteningly real,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were the incentive of my going to see this film, and I could not be more convinced of their talent than I am after the two-hour brilliance.This film is reality in its purest, yet magnificently artistic form  the anger that is portrayed repetitively and in various occasions reminded me of the wrath I myself occasionally experience, from the overture of an argument to its climax; the screaming, the furious need to verbally and physically harm, punch, kick, no matter how much affection is felt towards the recipient. Even during the scenes that are meant to be tranquil, there is anxiety and tension hidden in their smiles, a sort of counterfeit politeness that should never be present in a happy relationship.It is all a depiction of two genuine lives that have the potential of existing in complete harmony, yet cannot because of the stereotypical environment and situation they find themselves in. They both crave change, an alteration in their monotonous state of being, but because of the lengthy period of time that they have spent in such a circumstance, their mentality is differently modified. April (Kate Winslet) finds unreserved determination to leave to Paris and although her character seems at times erratic, we gradually come to understand that she is in fact the stronger personality of the two; she truly finds change favorable, whereas Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) seems to find the idea of change more flattering than change itself.Each choice a person makes can change a life, and that life is not always theirs. This film shows us just how wrong something right can be, as well as how right something wrong can be.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Well acted, but hollow and derivative","Sam Mendes's first two films (""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"") are two of the great American movies of the last ten years or so. The films, which examine, with great flair, the hollowness of the American Dream (though the latter has this in the background), have a new companion piece in the form of ""Revolutionary Road"". However, although Mendes is on familiar territory here, he doesn't manage to get anywhere close to the power of those films.The film's story is familiar. 1950s suburban Americana turns into a living hell for a young bohemian couple. In short, it is something like an extended episode of ""Mad Men"". However, the driving idea behind the film is that this couple is trying to escape from their hell, rediscover the romance of their lives and flee to Paris. It is no coincidence then that Mendes has decided to reunite Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since they played the star crossed lovers in Titanic who embodied romance and the American dream.The thing is that the casting is the most interesting thing in the film and that wears off rather quickly. The same old tired clichés are rolled out. The yearning neighbourly lust, the affair with the secretary and so on have all been seen before and nothing new is added. A few years back, Todd Haynes provided a far more effective and interesting piece in the form of ""Far From Heaven"" which examined the great prejudices and falsehoods that the fifties had wrapped up in them.There are plus points. Winslet is fantastic, and should have been nominated for this rather than for ""The Reader"". DiCaprio is not as good as he has been, but Michael Shannon delivers a fantastic turn in the rather stereotypical role of the crazy man who sees past the charade. It is also stylishly shot (yet more excellent work from cameraman Roger Deakins) and looks very good.However, it simply lacks a crucial element. It is very difficult to care for these characters. They always remain distant. Perhaps that is intended, but if so it is an error, because as the story unfurls in a predictable manner it becomes harder and harder to engage with them.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Leo and Kate's world of pure suffering.,"One of the reasons I keep devouring stories in general, and films in particular is that I firmly believe that the authors always have something to say, something worth being heard. A powerful message, if you may, about their view of life. A revelation to present the audience with, so we can leave the room with that ""wow, life is just like that"" feeling.This message may be positive or negative, but it should always be believable within the reality of the film. I confess I rather prefer a positive one. Or, if negative, at least with a tiny bit of hope hidden somewhere, I rather not leave the room feeling miserable. But I understand some audiences may enjoy this and, in any case, it doesn't matter: it's your message, isn't it?According to Justin Haythe (writer) and Sam Mendes (director), life is just too painful to be lived, too full of suffering and sorrow as to find the time to enjoy, create or love. We are hit with a most melodramatic picture of everyday events in a script that fails to create actual conflicts and believable drama. In such a farce, the luxury of the intense performances given by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are outrageously wasted.Fans of the actors will undoubtedly enjoy it, of course, and such an effort certainly deserves recognition. But the story itself contributes nothing, neither to the film history wealth, nor to the poor audience's expectations, that are likely to feel rather down after the show, or even mad at the whole world for no apparent reason, just like the protagonist couple.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

A splendid film because it seems escape out of script. And because it has the potential to be a film about its public. Each of us has dreams and regrets and desire of beginning. Each of us is confronted with decisions, responsabilities, duties. And the answer is not alwazs the best. So, a magnificent film about people, vulnerabilities, crisis and the cold solution.",,Anonymous,Romance
"No wonder no one says ""swell"" anymore!","My grandparents still consider the 1950's to be the golden age of pure, unblemished Americanism. A time when teenagers were respectful, parents were bright, smiling examples of friendly authority, sex was post-marital and marriage was a time of apple pies and cheerful strolls down the charming neighborhood lane. I don't know at the moment if my grandparents have seen Revolutionary Road, but rarely do movies come along when the opinions of our elders would almost surely prove to be enormously valuable and insightful.The movie is based on the novel by Richard Yates, which attacked the very normality and pleasant conformity of the 1950's that forms the basis of so much of the modern nostalgia about it today. There has been a lot of expectation about the movie that would bring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet together again for the first time in more than a decade, but the romance that they share in Revolutionary Road could not possibly be more different from the one they developed on the Titanic.They are Frank and April Wheeler, an outwardly charming husband and wife who live in a beautiful dream house on Revolutionary Road. They radiate an atmosphere of perfection and happiness and are loved by the neighbors. We meet them just after they've made what they promised each other was only a temporary move from Manhattan to the sprawling suburbs. The movie begins with April in an unsuccessful play, and we learn very quickly about their relationship in the car on the way home as Frank thoughtfully assures her that it's okay that she didn't become an actress, it's not her fault that the play was lousy, and then in the fight that ensues, Frank tells her that she acts ""sick"" when she gets mad like this.It seems that the most important thing that Frank and April embody about the traditional 1950s couple was the routine sacrificing of dreams upon the altar of conformity and fulfilling expectations. April dreams of a romantic life in Paris, and Frank has artistic ambitions as well. But he is stuck in a job that he hates despite a good salary, they have two kids already and a third accidentally on the way, and adultery's going on left and right.April suggests that they drop everything and move to Paris where, with money that she could make working combined with whatever they could get for the house, they could live comfortably until he could get on his feet artistically and they could both live the lives they have always dreamed of. They are doing what is expected of them already, but they're both deeply unhappy and they see no improvement ahead.It is one of the movie's more successful tragic moments in the way that everyone Frank and April know react to the news that they are moving. Responses range from friendly disbelief to outward remarks of irresponsibility and suggestions that such a move would be ""irresponsible."" It's hard to watch Frank and April let go of their dreams when it was right in their grasp.It's not unrealistic, ladies and gentlemen. It's uncommon and unexpected, but unrealistic? Irresponsible? I should hope not! It's commonly believed to be irresponsible and unrealistic, but it's not, trust me. I'm doing it myself. I left a job in Los Angeles two years ago that paid well but that I didn't like, and I've been living in China (decidedly less romantic than Paris, I admit) ever since. I now have a job that pays less than I made in LA, but my lifestyle is much more comfortable and I work 10 hours a week, which leaves me time to pursue my artistic endeavors. See how that works?Granted, I don't have any kids, but I also didn't have a house to sell to put together some money to support myself while I found work. ""I just think people are better off doing some kind of work that they actually like,"" Frank complains. I tend to agree.But ultimately life gets in the way, as they say. A gossipy real estate agent, played perfectly by Kathy Bates, makes friends with April and nervously asks if she might bring over her son John, who has been in a mental institution and who she thinks might benefit from meeting a happy couple like April and Frank. April agrees, but when John comes over, it seems that his only mental problem is an inability to adhere to accepted models of conformity, which manifests itself mostly in the form of cutting through other peoples' facades like warm butter and laying bare the sad, bitter reality of their lives. When he does this with April and Frank, the results are not pretty, but they are some of the best movie moments of 2008.Kate and Leo both approach perfection in their performances. Both of them have appeared in other brilliant films in 2008 (Kate in The Reader and Leo in Body of Lies), but in Revolutionary Road their performances reach such a level of pitch and depth that, when combined, they reverberate against each other and turn into something entirely different. If there were an Oscar for the best combination of two performances, there would be no need for any other nominees.Revolutionary Road is not the most uplifting film of the year (although it's also not nearly as depressing as, say, Rachel Getting Married), but it is definitely among the most important. It's not so much that the movie attacks conformity, but that it attacks that little voice inside us that prevents us from doing what we really want in life because it goes against the accepted norm. Watching the movie kind of takes a bite out of you, but it takes a bite of that part of you that gets in the way of your dreams.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A missed opportunity,"In life, we either have the things that we want or the reasons why we do not have them. Based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road tackles the issue of what it would take to go beyond the reasons and create a life of authenticity. The film reunites the popular stars of Titanic, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, as a suburban couple, Frank and April Wheeler, who see themselves as special but whose mediocre lives do not reflect their ideals. Set in suburban Connecticut in the 1950s, the main protagonists mirror the growing intellectual malaise and search for meaning that lay beneath the outward superficiality of the ""affluent society"", an undercurrent that would give birth to the counterculture and the more open social environment of the 1960s.As they move into their new house on Revolutionary Road with their two small children, Michael (Ty Simpkins) and Jennifer (Ryan Simpkins), Frank (DiCaprio) and Alice (Winslet) are determined not to be trapped by their surroundings but their self-deception and inertia ensures that they will get what they resist. They devise schemes to escape that seem plausible on the surface, but fail to confront the fact that they are comfortable in being the people that they used to mock. Ultimately, the gap between their aspirations and their ability to achieve them leads to growing frustration and an inevitable breakdown in their relationship that has sad consequences.The film opens when Frank and Alice spot each other at a party and the closeness of their dancing indicates a strong chemistry between them. Flashing forward seven years, however, the promise of the opening scene has deteriorated to bickering conflict. Alice, who aspires to be an actress, is disappointed with her performance in the local theater and, on the drive home, becomes furious with Frank who berates her acting ability. Frank is now a thirty-year-old salesman for a business machines corporation in Manhattan, the same company his father worked for, and professes to hate his job.Recognizing their untenable situation, Alice proposes that they sell their house and move to Paris where she can work in the NATO secretarial pool and Frank can ""find himself"" and begin to live the life he has dreamed of. Initially reluctant, Frank slowly warms to the idea, seeing it as a way to obtain a release from the suburban mentality personified by Frank's co-workers and neighbors Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) who view their proposed move as radical and silly. When Frank is praised at a job for a report he has written and offered a promotion and higher salary by Bart Pollack (Jay O. Sanders), however, doubts begin to surface about the Paris decision.Soon the couple's arguments take on a more vicious tone, their confidence undermined by visits to their home by their realtor Helen Givings (Kathy Bates), her husband Howard (Richard Easton), and their mentally disturbed son John (Michael Shannon). Free from social restraints, John unleashes a searing indictment of Frank and Alice's values and his verbal thrusts are the film's power point. As a final straw, Alice reveals that she is pregnant and ideas about Paris must be re-evaluated. Fine performances by Winslet and DiCaprio support a solid, workmanlike effort by Mendes, but the film lacks the poetry that would raise it to another level and the dialogue is often self-conscious and overly theatrical. What could have been a work of power and beauty becomes instead a missed opportunity and, in Mendes' hand, Revolutionary Road is a dead end street.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Revolutionary Road"" is an all around beautifully, artistically crafted film with powerhouse performances","A show-stopping Leonardo DiCaprio becomes Frank Wheeler, with remarkable power and an insight we only get from the greatest kind of actors. Allowing the audience to become fully immersed in his psyche, letting us feel everything with him. Living his pain, resentment, and the smörgåsbord of emotions in between. It is a highly accomplished piece of acting from the lead actor that I cannot imagine being ignored come this award season. Frank is a flawed man that many people will be able to see aspects of themselves in. Not being satisfied with marriage, family, work. Feeling we are meant or destined for something greater, yet paradoxically feeling the doubt and insecurity in ourselves to really go after it. He's depressed, has a past he can't seem to let go of, he's arrogant, he's a liar, he's manipulative and in many ways immature. Yet we know him. He's our father growing up, he's a brother, friend or possibly even you. He makes mistakes and is almost embarrassingly human. What I found ultimately tragic about him was not the way in which he lied to others but the way in which he lied to himself. Leo DiCaprio uses his expressive face to brilliant effect as Frank. He was terrific in ""Aviator"" , ""Blood Diamond"", ""This Boy's Life"" and others and has rightfully earned his place as one of the finest actors of his generation. Having said that, this is a whole new layer to DiCaprio that none of us have seen before. He brings a new, mature type of authentic subtlety to his craft. He doesn't resort to any big physical transformation. It's all internal. This is a new height for him, and easily the greatest acting of his career. A performance of great emotional intensity and depth that I can say without hesitation, will be remembered for generations to come.Kate Winslet plays April Wheeler with a sharp fervor. She is angry, depressed and intensely believes she and Frank are destined for something greater than a life of conformity in the burbs. She is a tragic character in that she is basically a closed book, she shuns the love that people try to give her, she is a free spirit and quite the handful. She comes up with an idea to break free of the conformity she shares with her husband in an attempt to revive their marriage and at first it seems to work - the passion for life and each other reignited. But after an unexpected event and other factors, will the dream plan go through?The chemistry between Winslet and DiCaprio in ""Revolutionary Road"" reminded me in many ways of the chemistry between Liz Taylor and Richard Burton in the 1966 film ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"". They create an intensity in their arguments that is electric and palpable. You cannot take your eyes off them, they glue you to the screen and stick it to each other as sharply as the couple from ""Virginia Woolf"" were able to. Frank and April's story is grounded in a greater, more painful reality, however. DiCaprio's raging sobs are chilling.The film is very dark. And the honesty practically guts you in some cases, so I don't think everyone will love it. Watching it was emotionally draining. Sam Mendes certainly did his job well here. It's his greatest film since ""American Beauty"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Certainly Something Missing,","Revolutionary Road is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast.It is certainly a well acted movie,though it is certainly not their finest performances,Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet both shine in the lead roles,and their acting has certainly improved over the eleven year gap of Titanic,both movies contain great chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet,but this time around it felt more real and sincere.I felt like there were certainly several things missing than could have made this movie better,one thing is that it certainly would have benefited with making us feel for these characters more,I found them quite unlikable for the most part,and at times that certainly made it difficult for me to care about the decisions they make or the things that happen to them.I also think it needed more scenes containing intense dialogue between the Wheeler's,these parts were the highlight of the movie as Winslet and DiCaprio both deliver their dialogue beautifully.Its certainly not outstanding and could have benefited more from its two leads,but Revolutionary Road is still a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or romantic film.A seemingly successful couple in 1950s Connecticut struggle to fight off the boredom and resentment their marriage is facing.Best Performance: Kate Winslet",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A dreadful parody of ""Man in the Grey Flannel Suit""","The art of storytelling, whether in a play, a novel or a film is to create characters who become real. And once you identify with the characters, their lives become the vehicle for the tone and message of the work. Without such realism, such verisimilitude, there is nothing but parody, and the manipulation of stock figures.I am a great fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, so I was looking forward to seeing them in a serious exploration of an era that I lived through as a young man. This work was stunningly without substance. Oh there were emotions, but the characters were not believable, and worse there was no attempt to make it so. The clue is the two children, throw away place holders, so they never even became people. Yet children are a part of any family, and we can't know the family without knowing the joys and trials of these most vulnerable members.A good test that I use of the quality of any film is whether there are throwaway characters, or if every person seems to have walked in from their own full life. If they only utter a single line, you can still tell. The mental patient visitor was some kind of a joke I imagine. Not like anyone with schizophrenia that I ever met, and I met a few.And it's not trivial that Frank could never describe exactly what he did for a living. The writers never bothered to create an occupation that would have fit the plot. So he was just a man in a cubicle. A nobody, with no interest in his work, but who was made a key member of a team to develop the most complex product of the era, who had no idea what it did, or how it worked.Some may consider this transcending details to provide a cultural everyman. But everyman is no man at all.This wasn't a dysfunctional marriage, as that implies that there is first a marriage. The film ""The Squid and the Whale"" was about a dysfunctional marriage, where the couple were at each others throats Yet both of them and their children were real unique struggling humans trapped in their history and that of their circle. That was a true work of art, while this was an exercise in a drama class.For those who think this is some accurate depiction of America in the 1950s, believe me it isn't. If you want to see a film about a dysfunctional couple of the era, try ""Come back little Sheba"" or ""Death of a Salesman."" Each of these films created actual characters, and we were drawn into their lives as we learned about the era.This film was about 2008, and how when two super stars are signed for a film deal there is no need to throw away money on writers who flesh out their characters, and provide plausible circumstances of their lives.I just learned that the director of this film was the same man who directed, ""American Beauty,"" one of my all time favorites.Go figure!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A beautiful, well-crafted Masterpiece. One of the best of the decade","Revolutionary Road is not a very joyful film, or is it easy to watch. Instead of being simply entertaining, it achieves what not many films these days do. It wants to be a learning lesson.This film is superbly crafted, in both the writing and the amazing direction by Sam Mendes. After his great film 'American Beauty', he comes back with strong will to do this project. His direction is the best of the year for sure. It feels so professional, so alive. The writing, both of the characters, Frank and April Wheeler, I feel they are so open and 3-dimensional characters, but the screenplay wants to let us inside their lives, and it does so with great passion. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Frank with such intensity, with such force. Dicaprio gives his best performance here without a doubt, since I don't really think he has ever done something like this before. Then there is Kate Winslet. My favorite actress, and certainly one of the most talented out there. Winslet has surprised me before in a lot of movies, but here, she surprises me in a whole other way. Her silent, unlikeable, and sometimes human and cold portrayal of April Wheeler is one of the best performances of the decade. She gives the best female performance of the year, and I truly hope she finally wins the Oscar she deserves.The film itself is so beautiful, so alive, yet at the same time, so dark to what the film is about. The cinematography is amazing, as well as the costumes and the whole set designs. The music, the original score, was so unsettling, perfectly balanced to what each scene brought.Revolutionary Road is not a film for everyone. I can definitely see some critics will hate it, but it should certainly be respected, for its ambition, for the things it accomplishes and every thing it portrays.

Book 10/10 - Film 8/10,"I went to see this at an advanced screener in Leicester Square last night. Kate Winslett chatted about the film on stage afterward. I went as one of those people who'd read the book and consider that source material to be amongst the best literature I'd ever read. I was wondering if and how the film could match up. My prior concerns were about how accurate the film would be. Well, there's nothing to worry about there. Mendes has created a near carbon copy of the book, the locations, characters and scenes are all exactly as I 'saw' them on the page. Nothing (as far as I could tell) is portrayed out of order, no extra characters are introduced, and no primary characters are dropped or altered. The acting is 100% perfect. The mies-en-scene is perfect. Absolutely nothing could or should have been done differently. So why not 10/10? The problem lies in the fact that Yates' novel is a literary one, much of the essence of the experience of the story is realized by Yates with just the right turn of phrase or choice of word. How does a director set about depicting or capturing this visually? I don't think he really can, he needs to use cinematic tricks and devices to inject resonance, the same resonance Yates achieves with that turn of phrase. But in being so (probably rightly) concerned about being true to the source material, the film somehow comes up a little flat as a film going experience, a sort of American Beauty without the crucial stylistic bells and whistles. Kate Winslett said afterward that (interestingly) it was she who had brought the book and the project to her husband, not vice versa and that it took some consideration for Sam Mendes to convince himself that he hadn't already told this story before, and by the final credits, I too was thinking just that, it felt like I'd watched a prequel to American Beauty, but without the pizazz and the rapture and the delight. So, the book, 10/10, the film, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Felt like a well-made episode of Desperate Housewives without the comedy...,"Revolutionary Road, helmed by American Beauty Oscar winning director Sam Mendes, could be the biggest disappointment of 2008.Now, don't get me wrong... the movie was good. It just... fell flat. Though pumped with emotional contact between the characters, it ultimately felt emotionless for me. Beautifully shot by Roger Deakins, though. Another fine cinematographic job from the master of his field.What I wanted to be so much just couldn't be. Of course, Kate Winslet was great in the role, but I don't think this is anywhere near her best work, and it would be a shame to see an Oscar go to this performance when 2008 was such a wonderful year for the leading ladies. A nomination? Well, of course... but the win will not be deserved.Now to DiCaprio. Though I fully acknowledge that the man can act, and in some cases very well, he just seems to me to be processing the same role. He isn't very versatile as an actor at all, and this role just held no challenges for him. Any number of actors could have pulled more from the role. The performance, though shouty, was really two-dimensional for me.And now to the best part of the movie: the supporting actors. Michael Shannon brings his A-game to a very small but pivotal role in the story. He provides the climax so wonderfully, yet had to play off of an obvious screenplay. All that his character did was trumpet the whole message of the movie, and for me, the meaning of any great work is ultimately subversive and not blatant. Obviously the scene was required to provide a goal point, but still... this is the fault of the screenplay, which is very faithful to the book, which is probably where the REAL problem lies. This book was just not a book that adapted well to the screen, I think.Kathy Bates clocks in a lovely little performance as Michael Shannon's mother, wishing to excuse her son's every fanaticism with a mental illness. A shame really, because Jon was such an interesting character, if completely unnecessary.So, like I said, this was a good movie. Just one that was unnecessary to make. A rehashing of a story already told (by the same director), with several well-acted scenes, a wonderful performance throughout from Kate, a sub-par script based on a sub-par book, all shown beautifully by Roger Deakins.A 6 out of 10 (but just barely)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revolutionary Road A Tragic Realistic Love Story,"Revolutionary Road is a tragic realistic love story powered by the believable performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet who reunite 12 years later after starring in 1997's Titanic together. They still have that great chemistry together as before and the story of the movie is not a happy one but its pretty realistic look of a marriage slowly deteriorating. Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet is just as impressive playing his wife April who seem to have to be the perfect family with the house, the kids, and a good paycheck living in a Connecticut suburb in the 1950's. But appearances aren't always what they appear to be in this film directed by Sam Mendes. The man behind films like Road To Perdition, American Beauty, and Jardhead. He's also the husband of Kate Winslet. Mendes does another admirable job of bringing this tragic love story of the Wheelers to the big screen. DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic portraying two people who do love each other but can't seem to make their marriage work. Dicaprio and Winslet disappear into their roles becoming those characters making you care about them and hoping they succeed. They both continue to show their amazing talent in this film. Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as well but her character isn't it that much. She shows up for brief appearances here and there because the main focus is on Leo and Kate. Michael Shannon is the only one to standout in the rest of the supporting cast who do a good in their roles as well. Shannon plays John Givings a troubled man who says whats on his mind without thinking twice about it and is the only one who can see right through the Wheelers. Shannon may not get a lot of screen time but he does a great job in the small role he has in the movie. He's also the son of the character played by Bates. The scenes where DiCaprio and Winslet lash out at each other are done well you can feel the tension between them growing with each passing moment as their arguments escalate. The period setting fits with the tone of the film and everything in it looked realistic giving audiences a look at what things were like back then. There are two sex scenes both involving Winslet so parents should be warned but none of them are too explicit like Monster's Ball, Original Sin, or Little Children to name a few. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in Revolutionary Road. The movie doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending but thats one of things I liked it about because life doesn't always have a happy ending. Overall Revolutionary Road was better than expected it's a tragic love story brought to life because of the exceptional performances from both Dicaprio and Winslet who make the film worth the time to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Everything This Movie Has to Say Has Been Said Before and Said Better,"The subject of suburban misery and malaise, and the myth of the American dream, has been dealt with so frequently in movies, television and literature that you may wonder what more there is to say about the topic. If ""Revolutionary Road"" is any example, the answer is: not much. Indeed, the whole time I was watching this strangely insubstantial film from director Sam Mendes, the only thing I could think of were all the other movies I've seen that have dealt with the same themes and dealt with them better.Frank and April Wheeler are the miserably married couple at the center of this story. Frank, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, goes off to work in a featureless anthill of a company, diddling the occasional office girl on the side. April stays home and frets over the acting career that never materialized for her and rebelling against the stifling sameness of suburbia that she feels she's better than. Most of the film consists of monotonous scenes of these two screaming at each other. I guess it's meant to be a sort of modern-day ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", the story of a married couple who could be helping one another but instead decide to tear each other apart, except that the material isn't nearly as interesting as Edward Albee's play, and neither are the characters.For ""Revolutionary Road"" to work, we have to really understand why April is so unhappy, and that's something the film doesn't tell us. Kate Winselt tries awfully hard, but she can't make much of this rather unlikable character. She didn't have my sympathy because I never understood her problem. I understand suburban unhappiness in general, but I didn't understand it as presented here. DiCaprio has the easier time of it, because Frank it turns out isn't all that unhappy with his life, and pretends to be so largely for April's benefit. The film doesn't establish much about these two before they met or about the early days of their marriage. We're supposed to feel emotions about them in a vacuum without any context. I didn't feel anything.There's not much relief from DiCaprio and Winslet, as one or the other is in virtually every frame of the movie. There are a couple of recognizable actors in supporting roles, namely Kathy Bates as a real estate agent friend and Michael Shannon as her bonkers son. This character is wedged awkwardly into the narrative as the movie's id, shouting out truths everyone else is trying to avoid having to admit, but Shannon's performance is over the top and I didn't know what I was supposed to make of him.With wonderful films like ""Far from Heaven,"" ""The Hours,"" ""All That Heaven Allows"" and ""Little Children"" (which stars Winslet in a stunning turn, no less) and the cable series ""Mad Men"" exploring the same themes as ""Revolutionary Road"" but much more capably, there's really no reason to waste your time or money on this gloomy, depressing movie that has nothing to say. It's not an awful movie, but at the same time it has very little to recommend it.Grade: C",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

But no regret cause I own a DVD of the movie. Initially, I wanted to watch the movie for the Caprio-Winslet pair. Later, as the movie proceeded further, I found myself totally engrossed by the movie. Brilliant convincing performance from both,Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio,actually took away the fact that am not watching anything of drama genre but a reality.It was expected.The background score also perfectly mingled with the flow of the movie. Overall, the movie made me cry. It's a very thought provoking movie and somewhere anyone would connect with himself/herself that sometimes boredom and drudgery of life make one person irrational, he/she wants to break free from the usual cycle. But maximum time it doesn't happen. In a way, it takes a toll not only on body but also mind.

Winslet And Dicaprio Wage War With One Another Every Second of the Way Through,"Without the great presence of Dicaprio and Winslet this film would seriously be at the level of a TV movie. Revolutionary Road is a film that certainly will not cheer you up. It is about a husband and wife who make an attempt at escaping there their ""empty and hopeless"" life. Or at least they create the delusion that they will.In this film Winslet and Dicaprio are at the top of their games. Their feelings toward each other are complex and deranged. Their bitterness towards each other seems to disappear as the movie wears on but it does not. They simply put the bitterness they feel for each other in the back of their mind thinking it will go away and it may have. But when one key event takes place in the movie their bitterness evolves into hatred. Instead of continuing to fight the lie of what people think it means to lead a good life, which is what drew them to each other in the first place, they start to accept that lie causing them to drift apart in so many ways. Dicaprio and Winslet are one of the few that are able to so perfectly illustrate complexities such as this in relationships and marriage. Michael Shannon plays a very interesting role of a man considered crazy yet is the only one who agrees with the ""emptyness and hopelessness"" of their lives. He plays well but I feel as if something is missing from his character.The directing of Sam Mendes is good in that the film brings you back in time. Yet the movie did not rise to what it could have been because of the writing. The film did not open up enough to fully capture the audience. The film stayed one gear and never seemed to switch off it. The couple of Winslet and Dicaprio seemed to be happy at one point but we barely get a glimpse of that. If the movie had started off on that and then switched over to its false hope and then depressing tone it would have greatly succeeded. Instead the movie becomes overly depressing and cynical not living up to its potential.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What is the point of Leonardo di Caprio?,"Sam Mendes 'American Beauty' was in my opinion overpraised: the script, a satire on suburban life, had its share of funny and perceptive moments, but ultimately pulled its punches. The director is back on the same territory with 'Revolutionary Road', only this time, his story is set in the 1950s. The look and feel of that decade is immaculately reconstructed (though were American kitchens really this modern?), but the tale is sadly simpler than his previous film, and amounts to little more than the assertion that suburban life is rubbish, even for the prosperous. There are few unexpected twists to the script, a ponderous and over-present background score, and to make it worse, Leonardo di Caprio plays the male lead. I can understand that when he was younger, women found him cute; but as an adult actor, he never fails to disappoint, decorating every role he with the same self-important whining. To me, he's an unappealing protagonist and fails to command my sympathy. The truth is, not everyone can direct films for a living, and if you can't, a life in the suburbs is probably as good as any. Of course, that's not to say that everyone is happy there; but the darkness in human hearts does not come from real estate and a garden, and I didn't see much insight into the deeper causes here.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Eagerly Awaiting the DVD release (it's THAT good)!!!!,"Just saw this movie. All I can say is: Wow! In this Richard Yates story portrayed through the lens of Mr. Mendes' camera, we enter the relationship of Frank and April Wheeler; a young married couple depicted brilliantly by DiCaprio and Winslet, who seem to be on the verge of marital and emotional collapse as their growing desperation and dissatisfaction with their town and their relationship leads them to think of an escape. There are some compelling, memorable, emotionally gripping scenes between DiCaprio and Winslet, which should interest acting students who wish to know what it means to be ""in the moment"". Additionally, there is the immensely talented Kathy Bates, whose humorous scenes balance out the heavily dramatic ones nicely and which are sure to leave a warm spot on your heart. Also adding humor to the movie is Michael Shannon as Bates' psychologically unstable son, who steals just about every scene he's in. There are moments where the dialogue can seem to feel cliché, but with everything else working so well, those moments can be forgiven. This is a film not to be missed. I've become a greater admirer of DiCaprio's acting ability as a result of this film, Winslet never disappoints, and Mendes adds another superb credit to his resume with this amazing film.

Desultory Look at Eisenhower-Era Marital Discord Showcases Sharp Work from Winslet and Shannon,"It took 47 years to adapt for the screen Richard Yates' celebrated novel of the struggles that a young suburban couple faces living within the constraints of Eisenhower-era conformity. Even now, the resulting 2008 film, as meticulously directed by Sam Mendes, feels so internally driven that the story may be better suited for the stage or even TV. In fact, it often feels a bit like an extended episode of the 1950's-set AMC series, ""Mad Men"", although the arguments between the protagonists bring to mind similarly visceral set pieces from Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Adapted by screenwriter Justin Haythe (""The Clearing""), the plot focuses on Frank and April Wheeler, an attractive couple settled in a Connecticut suburb with two young children and seven years into a dysfunctional marriage. The time is 1955 well before professional counseling and divorce were viable options. The one attribute that the couple shares is the disillusionment each experiences with their daily lives, a far cry from the worldly aspirations they had when they first met at a Manhattan cocktail party.Initially a frustrated actress, April is a creative person who is suffocating from her suburban domestic duties, while Frank is an even more aimless dreamer who hates his sales job at an IBM-like company. The story turns on April's sudden idea to move the family to Paris, where she plans to work as a government agency secretary while Frank figures out what he wants to do. He tentatively agrees, but it is her mounting desperation to hold onto her dream of living a bohemian life abroad that points to their emotional unraveling. Extramarital affairs prove to be the least of their problems, as each becomes entrenched in a deepening inability to empathize with or support the another. Communication between them turns into mutual provocations of emotional abuse. Mendes returns to familiar territory here, as there are vestiges of his debut film, ""American Beauty"", in the often uncomfortable-to-watch marital discord he etches here. However, the tone is even more desultory this time with nary a trace of black humor to provide a counterbalance. All the period touches feel authentic with Roger Deakins' cinematography and Kristi Zea's production design contributing to an evocative feel that doesn't feel overly contrived. Thomas Newman's haunting score is another asset that enhances the dramatic elements.This is the type of movie that provides a showcase for its principal actors. As April, Kate Winslet (Mendes' wife) manages to make a fundamentally selfish character sympathetic by throwing herself fearlessly and honestly into the role. Her former ""Titanic"" co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio has proved to be an arresting actor in ""The Departed"", but his baby face and youthful demeanor really seem at odds with Frank's weakening emotional state and diminishing sense of self-worth. He comes to life during the many confrontation scenes, but he can't match Winslet's affinity with the heavy material. The supporting cast is solid - Kathy Bates (another ""Titanic"" veteran) as unctuous real estate agent Helen Givings, Kathryn Hahn as the Wheelers' chipper neighbor Milly, David Harbour as her deceptively contemplative husband Shep, Zoe Kazan as Frank's gullible secretary, and in just two sharply rendered scenes, Michael Shannon makes Helen's mentally ill son a powerfully uncomfortable harbinger for the tragedy to follow. The 2009 DVD has a standard set of extras - a mostly interesting audio commentary track from Mendes and Haythe, five deleted scenes, and principal cast and crew members contributing to an adequate half-hour making-of featurette, ""Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road"".",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revolutionary Road is a must see movie 🍿!,"I know that 1955 was a desired year to love and live in and this was clearly seen by the way the artist set stage with its cars and artifacts throughout the movie.

This movie at first was skeptical and I was slightly concerned however it became masterpiece within a few minutes. To interact with actual actors is phenomenal.

"Abused, psichologically","An outstanding drama demonstrating an awfully common problem of our society, which often isn't being recognised by the suffering party.
The drama has 3 main characters - April (Kate Winslet) the housewife, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), the main character and will talk about the third one later.If you experience anything what you've seen in the movie, you are psychologically abused and should see someone specialised immediately.
Frank personalises the perfect abusive husband who knows all the trick how he can terrorise April without ever hurting her physically. But she doesn't give up, tries to change their life entirely, Frank gives the hope, agrees with April, but when he has to do action, he finds excuses every time. And again and again so he can let April down.
Well, this is not the first one of its subject. The third main character is John (Michael Shannon), who says out loudly the truth and is intelligent enough to analyse the main characters psychologically - ironically he is considered psychopath for doing it so in this 1950's society.Overall it is a good movie representing important values, but not an easy watch. You might get confused about April's personality and behaviour, which demonstrates how much she suffers due to the abuse she has to take.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The hopeless emptiness,"At one point in this film the key characters, in discussing their own lives, mention the ""hopeless emptiness"" of it all. And thus in one line of dialogue is the entire movie summed up rather neatly. Empty for sure and bordering on hopeless Revolutionary Road is pretty much an all-around failure. It's a movie about an unhappy 1950s suburban couple who feel trapped in their own little world. They're disappointed in their lives and harbor fanciful notions of somehow getting away from it all. They're suburban nobodies who want to be somebodies. If the audience could say anything to this screen couple it would probably be ""get over yourselves"".Revolutionary Road is one of those movies which goes out of its way to thoroughly depress you. That's fine but if it insists on depressing you is it too much to ask that it entertains you somewhere along the way too? No such luck with this movie. Entertainment value is practically nil, nothing interesting ever seems to happen. Frank and April Wheeler are unhappy. They fight, fight some more, make up for a bit, fight some more and bemoan how miserable their lives have turned out to be. This goes on and on for two hours as the audience tries to stifle yawns. Frank and April are terrible bores. Their friends and neighbors are bores. One of their friends has a rather insane son who pops in a couple of times to inject some personality and life into the movie. Michael Shannon plays that part and makes a better impression than any of the big stars do. At least his character does some memorable things. But his scenes are all too fleeting. All too soon we're back to Frank and April throwing fits about the terrible state of their lives. Which rings rather hollow when you consider 99 percent of the world's population would kill to have the ""boring"", ""hopeless"", ""empty"" lives the Wheelers so detest. They have it pretty darned good but they've deluded themselves into thinking they deserve better. They don't. Their lives are just fine. Hopeless? Empty? Really, get over yourselves. Please.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are both fine performers and they make the best they can out of this mess. The performances aren't the problem, the story is. And the characters. Never for a moment do we sympathize with Frank and April and that right there would be enough to doom the movie to failure. Who can identify with these people? Who would want to? DiCaprio and Winslet took on rather thankless roles in portraying this couple. With all the bickering and fighting there is an opportunity for the stars to go somewhat over the top at times and engage in a bit of scenery-chewing. But aside from that you really wouldn't criticize them. The stars don't let down the movie, the movie lets down its stars. There is so little for them to work with. The story is not engaging at all. It's a dull, boring movie in which very little of consequence ever happens. As such maybe it does capture all that emptiness the characters feel in their lives.

It Takes Real Guts to See the Hopelessness,"We all know the pairing of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in Titanic proved to be one of the most beloved romances in all of cinema, but if you are expecting more of the same, I would advise against watching Revolutionary Road. But the reality is, the film is very well made, and very telling of how the suburban 50's life might have been back in the day. But much like some other Oscar bait movies, Revolutionary Road is a film you definitely have to be in the right mood to enjoy, and is likely a film you wont ever want to watch again.The film begins with the two meeting in a clichéd bar setting, but we really didn't even need that. Their relationship and history with each other is easily bought into. The two have simply some of the best chemistry between love interests we have ever had in cinema, whether it be a pleasant scene, or an overly dramatic one. The film does a good job of making you feel for the couple and their struggle to continue their marriage and raise their kids while also going through difficulties with DiCaprio's job. Both characters flaws are represented and in a way that doesn't necessarily make either more likable than the other. I think it's a tribute to both of these brilliant actors that they can make each and every one of the dramatic scenes (there's a ton) feel real and natural. The film flows in a way that you know where the characters are probably heading, you just don't want to believe it just yet.The film centers on Frank's (Dicaprio) inability to want to try something new and his fear of failing. Failure never ruins someone, it's being afraid to fail that leads to their downfall. I thought that was well represented throughout the film. It's worth mentioning Michael Shannon's brief but important role in the film, and the impact that his character has on the rest of the film. To me, he served as the speaker of the audience's thoughts and opinions on these shells of human beings, for the most part. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the film enough to be noticeable, but there is an overwhelming amount of darkness and sadness that is pulled from the film. Like I said, it's a very good film, but it's just extremely difficult to watch.+Both actors chemistry+Beautiful to look at+Look inside the 50's-Sooooo dark and depressing7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sad suburban tale,"The 1950s in America look in retrospect peaceful and prosperous years, despite the Cold War, but many citizens found the security and comfort of suburban living claustrophobic, especially those who had fought in the Second World War and embraced danger. Richard Yates captured these anxieties in his 1961 novel with his ""perfect couple"" Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet). Ironically it is April, once an aspiring actress, who wants a change from bringing up their two lovely children in their leafy suburb in Connecticut even though Frank is bored by his city job in machinery sales. She sells him her idea of working in Paris (""the one place overseas you said you really liked""). But it involves her working at the US embassy as a secretary (at fabulous money) while Frank has a sabbatical, supported by his wife. Frank's mates in the office don't think it's such a great idea and Frank starts to have doubts, as well as an affair with his secretary. Then April becomes pregnant again.Without giving away the story, it can be said that things do not work out for our protagonists. Americans like happy endings but Richard Yates (and Sam Mendes) are not about to give them one. The period is beautifully invoked; I was reminded of Todd Haynes's tribute film ""Far from Heaven"" (2002) which refers to the 1950s melodramas of Douglas Sirk (""All that Heaven Allows""). The minor characters are also a delight, particularly Kathy Bates as the local real estate agent and Michael Shannon as her brain damaged but brutally frank son. But this is nevertheless a sad story. Being a child of those golden years of parents who didn't throw over the traces I don't remember much unhappiness, but I do remember that people who did not fit in rather stood out  respectability had a narrow range.The following two decades saw a revolution in personal relationships and a reassessment of the role of women our society. It's hard to say if Yates and Mendes are blaming society for their character's ills or blaming the characters for passing up the opportunity for more freedom.

Sad & Hopeless Film...Yet Well done & Great Acting,"Winslet & DiCaprio do a fine job expressing the hopeless place that human beings can go when the big Questions of life are not dealt with outside of ones self. And truly, they display this despair, frustration, depression, confusion and hopelessness if any 2 people could in their performances. My husband & I watched this together, having been in unhealthy relationships in our younger lives (now in a wonderful marriage in our late 60's 70's). We both were saddened as we watched the well done development of their characters...the momentary hope...then despair & division. We both looked at each other, knowing that it wasn't so much about traditional marriage in the 50's ""burbs"" being the issue, as it was that they lacked tools in their tool chest. The tragedy was their inability to communicate effectively, love one another in a healthy way, and in our opinion...being happily married so many yrs...to have a spiritual foundation that helps people be close & forgiving. In this respect we felt sad watching because as some have shared-it is a dark & tragic film. Yet, we must say that they did a great job portraying the kind of road couples ""can"" go down in any scenario, not just traditional marriages. The supporting actors as well as the historical settings are very well done. There is a strong political statement in the film that watchers will either agree with or not...& this bugged us both, but - so be it - this is Hollywood. Either way, fine performances.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Performances,"Revolutionary Road (2008)**** (out of 4)A suburban couple (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet) find their lives getting boring and their marriage falling apart so they think a trip to Paris will give their lives a new direction to keep them going. I guess when you break it down this is a film about reaching the American dream of a family, kids and a nice house but then realizing it's not all roses and sunshine. To call this a depressing movie would be an understatement but there's no denying the power in the performances and the strong direction that keeps it going. Some might try to compare this to Mednes' American Beauty but I think the films are pretty different in their approach and what they're trying to say. This movie gives us two characters who quickly fall in love but soon find that love getting caught up in fights over what they plan on doing with the rest of their lives. I think people could look at both of their view points and see something different but at the same time the ending is done so brilliantly well that many people might be coming out of the theater angry, sad or perhaps both. The movie offers up a lot of tough questions about the responsibility of marriage, kids and loyalty but it never gives off any easy answers. Some might want to see Leo and Kate working together again but they might want to reconsider because this certainly isn't Titanic. I've been a major fan of DiCaprio's since I first saw him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and since then he's turned in a very impressive resume for someone his age. He adds another great character and performance to his resume and he remains one of the most interesting actors out there. There are two sequences that I won't ruin for people reading this my DiCaprio made my draw hit the floor. Both come towards the end of the movie when his wife tells him something that comes as a shock. I won't ruin what she says but the look of pain on his face and turning that into anger was something heartbreaking to watch. He adds so much depth to his character that you can't help feel his pain throughout the movie. Winslet does a great job as well and really nails the character, which goes through quite a few changes throughout the movie. There have been numerous performances of a housewife since the start of cinema but I must say the way Winslet plays the character is very memorable. The two working together just hit a homerun because there's not a single second where they don't come off as a real couple. Kathy Bates is in fine form with her supporting role as is David Harbour as a neighbor. Michael Shannon really stands out as Bates' rather strange son who was just released from a mental hospital. It's rather interesting that his character is considered the crazy one yet he makes more sense than any of the normal people. Everything from the cinematography to the set design are top-notch as well and Mendes perfectly holds everything together with his strong direction and key eye for knowing how to bring out the biggest emotions out of a few words. This certainly isn't an easy movie to watch but it does leave you with a lot to wonder about and that's something we need more of in today's cinema.",,Anonymous,Romance
The family on revolutionary road,Sam Mendez is such a great director. He really knows how to make something serious very real for the screen. The soundtrack gave me chills with every scene because it caused mystery among the storyline. Are they gonna be ok? Is something bad going to happen? Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio have wonderfuly chemistry throughout the whole film. They actually seem like a married couple who dont know what to do anymore. Sad movie but a must see,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Complicated and disturbed minds in a perfectly nice world,"One of the most complex dramas one can come across in a very simple plot. Leonardo and Kate nail it with one of the career best performances. Kate portrays a complex and disturbed character and is cold. Leonardo gave his best performance as an absolutely helpless man. His scenes with frustrated Kate and some uninvited guests are absolute gold standard to watch. As an Actor he has a ton of box office successes in his bag. To me, this is his best work despite being a depressing drama. That smile he wears on his face with a million thoughts in his mind shows he's born to act. That haunting piano background score is impeccable. Superb movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: Revolutionary Road,"It's been some twelve years since James Cameron's Titanic sealed Leonardo DiCaprio's heartthrob status, and everyone's been wondering when DiCaprio and his co-star Kate Winslet would once again grace the screen together with that kind of on screen chemistry and magic that made thousands relive that cross-Atlantic adventure tragedy over and over again, effectively retiring James Cameron (until this year of course with his 3D film Avatar) since the film powered past a billion dollars in box office receipts.With tongue in cheek, I thought this Sam Mendes movie offered audiences a peek into how Jack Dawson and Rose's lives would have been, should they live through that night to remember together, and settle down in the USA. The free-spirited Dawson would find his life now quite the bore as compared to his free-wheeling days of a drifter, now rooted to a nine to five job he doesn't believe in, and lives his life like a robot only to pay the bills. As for Rose, she being stuck at home as a housewife also doesn't seem like the life she thought she signed on for, with the realities of matrimony settling in to demolish notions of a once daring romance.Leonardo DiCaprio reunites with Kate Winslet (and Kathy Bates too!) in Revolutionary Road, that on the surface looks at how the familiar has crept into the lives of a married couple, and beneath the veneer and belief of their neighbours, theirs is a union slowly disintegrating, not that they do not try, but probably tried too hard, and where indifference start to rear its ugly head to destroy passion and love. We see how both do things that will ultimately hurt and betray the sliver of trust that's left, and how each manipulates the other in subtle ways in order to get what they think they want.The bulk of the film was centred around their joint decision to uproot their family (and the children whom we rarely see) and move to Paris, so that DiCaprio's Frank would be able to live out his dream, of finding out his true calling. This would mean selling all their assets, crossing the steamship the other way round (which I chuckled at, and wonder if we're really going to see that at all), and having his wife support him (because the Europeans pay secretaries exorbitant salaries) while he mucks around for inspiration to life. This would also mean bidding Sayonara to his dead end job, until Murphy so decides to throw a spanner in the works with Frank gaining much needed recognition.Kate Winslet's April seemed to be the all-sacrificing wife, until her frequent breakdowns seem to cast doubts on her sanity, having to fight like mad with her husband, only to put on a more cordial front every morning at breakfast. One can only guess that she's doing her best to keep things from breaking down, but there's only a limit to how many holes you can plug with your fingers. In fact, the film develops at a pace with which paint dries, and comes alive only when Frank and April trade verbal blows, with hurting insults flying both directions with the threat of physical violence always close by.It's about the hypocrisy that we are aware of, yet choose to play the social charade and getting a kick out of laughing at the fakeness of it all behind closed doors, behind other people's backs. The games we play with the intention to hurt will sometimes backfire on ourselves too, and it's almost always never a good thing to be doing something to hit back at the other person, one whom you know you love. But rectifying it head on also means that it's time to give it up, but preferably done so in a more civil manner compared to dropping the bombshell and hoping for an expected reaction.Perhaps in the madness of it all, it takes an ex-mental patient character John (played by Michael Shannon) to become the voice of reason in an insanely fake world that both Frank and April find themselves in. In being crazy, he's granted the excuse to cut through the nonsense and say things as he sees fit, and has some of the best lines in the movie but also being the most accurate in the reading of the characters' expressions. If you think both Frank and April have words that hurt, pay attention to the wise sayings of John.Based on a novel by Richard Yates, Sam Mandes managed to bring out the best in the chemistry between his two leading stars. Between them, age has not been kind to Winslet, while the additional lines on DiCaprio's face makes him all the more mature, though retaining his baby-faced looks that even made it to the insults their character trades.Just when everything starts to meander around the themes it set out to explore, and treading in dangerous ground in being too convoluted for its own good, the parting shot was quite verbose in summing everything up quite nicely, in that it pays to switch off at times, or most of the times if you will, in order to keep things as status quo without the opportunity of being misread that you're uncooperative, or unwilling to lend a listening ear. Very poignant, and chillingly real.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
powerful,"Not sure most people caught this, but this movie can be summed up by the juxtaposition at the end. There are 4 couples; the main couple, the older couple, the next door neighbor couple, and a young couple. By the end of the movie, you realize the tragedy of the main couple, the false placation of the next door neighbor couple, hints of the start of inevitable marriage-fatigue of the young couple (notice how they are situated on the couch), and you have the old, experienced couple who have learned how to deal with each other. Quite the pessimistic testimony of the institution of marriage, which is what Revolutionary Road is all about.Leonardo DiCaprio shines in this one. His mannerisms and delivery of the dialog was something that could truly be felt. Sam Mendes was on point as the director. There's another scene near the end when you can feel the tension, waiting for something to happen between DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's characters. I won't give it away, but it's subtly wondering when Kate's character will explode. Great job of directing there. Speaking of Kate, she did an incredible job of betraying the frustrated wife trying to hold it all together. And there were other things about this movie; the set, costumes, editing, the feel, everything just worked.I won't say more. It's an older movie, and it's already been discussed enough. But for those film students or movie buffs who enjoy studying how quality cinema (be it acting, writing, editing, or directing) works, Revolutionary Road is a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Uneven performances and dialogue, but solid overall","The story is complex, emotional, multi-layered, and quite smart. Unfortunately it does not always translate in the acting, dialogue, or even the setting of the shot. I like all the actors in this movie, but sometimes Leo and Kate deliver their lines as two actors on the stage in a local production - just not convincing enough. The dialogue sometimes is too predictable, with flatness both in words and delivery. However, neither of these are so often as to ruin the movie. So overall the effect is still impressive. Michael Shannon is the only one deserving real praise - and rightly getting nominated for Oscar. A solid performer, but won't be remembered several years down the road, and is NOT the best of the decade.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Bored Office Worker and the Desperate Housewife...,"If you don't know it from experience, you know from movies that marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be. I used to fill the ranks of optimists who saw it as a whitewater rafting with a few rapids to ride when it's closer to drifting across an ocean of routine, punctuated by loud hurtful arguments and a few tender 'sorry' or 'I love you' to conceal the wounds. Films are never as haunting as when they reflect the turbulence of your own life. And watching Sam Mendes' ""Revolutionary Road"" was like a slap from my mirror.Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are Frank and April Wheeler, young, loving and good-looking. They share everything: car, bed, house, lawns and kids to play in, but in their lucid moments, they realize their solitude. In a spectacularly directed scene, a wave of men with gray flannel suits are literally spreading over New York streets, The Knox building exudes some Billy Wilder's Apartment"" vibes while the crowd shots gives the film a surrealistic touch, channeling the famous Magritte painting with the men with bowler hats. Frank is like a lemming caught in a crowd and about to accomplish his daily suicide over the cliff, he sits down in his cubicle and can only gets his kicks by acting like a 'big shot' in front of an easily impressionable secretary.April can breathe fresh air every day, but with the fathers at work and kids at school, suburbs look like ghost towns, a feeling of total emptiness is inevitable and ends up invading April. Frank is a face in a crowd who doesn't have time, April has time and space but she's tied to Frank. Both are married but terribly alone. Now, loneliness can be a door for as many rooms as opportunities, but in marriage, the door is locked and you're trapped in one room: marital, existential dead-end.April dreamed to be an actress but in the 50's, Hollywood was like TV, many called and few chosen. The film opens with a flop that draw the curtain on her dreams and after many attempts to consulate her, Frank finally lets this out and invites her to abandon this 'theatre' nonsense.The couple buys a nice suburban house in ""Revolutionary Road"", their real estate agent, played by Kathy Bates who, have found the perfect house for the perfect postcard-couple. But we know what that facade of happiness can hide the ugliest realities. Sam Mendes made the great ""American Beauty"", a social commentary about the suburban American life, made of ersatz of contentment and where families could only lead carbon-copy lives dictated by consumerism and pretending to have a 'normal' life because they're too afraid to question the norm. But we're no fools, we see these men and women talking about kids, eating, sleeping or having sex but they're only making an effort to hide their disillusions.In ""Revolutionary Road"", the roles are reversed, it is April, who suggests Frank to abandon everything and go to Paris, she'll find a job in the Embassy and he'll have time to figure out what he wants to do. Frank is tempted to a certain degree: he knows he has no talent, the only certitude is that he hates his job, that meaningless job he can't even explain in proper words, that sucked the life out of his father, making him swear to himself he'd never fall in the same death trap. But as a coach told me once, we're sometimes better than we think at things we hate, and Karma plays quite a trick on him by giving him a raise and a promotion. Frank is like a Lester Burnham in terms of awareness but not in the action and this is where ""Revolutionary Road"" stands out among the other marriage movies, this is one about inaction rather than action.Indeed, it is about a wife who wants to go to Paris without a plan, and a man who can't because he's scared, they know what they hate and they share the same hatred, but there's a crucial difference: April won't go to Paris to be happy, she'll be happy if she goes to Paris, Frank anticipates and thinks the remedy is worse than the disease, he can't see that his wife gave him a tacit ultimatum, she reached the existential dead-end before him. It is very appropriate that the only person in the movie to tell the truth and to make sense is an insane man played by Michael Shannon. He can see the gateway to escape from the inconvenient truth, and sweeps off Frank's justification with a cruel verdict: ""you deserve each other"".They know he's right but can't admit, and that's the terrible truth of marriage: it forces you to keep silent. The ending left me puzzled what's with that old man listening while his wife was babbling, but then I realized it wasn't random; the point was that many marriages looked exactly the same, forcing people to pretend to live happy. In the 50's, the American family model was the norm but looking at the way people smoked and drank and had affairs with their secretaries or neighbors, you realize that not much have changed, today, it's porn and Internet. The cures changed not the symptoms.""Revolutionary Road"" is more relevant than ever, it speaks devastating truths about bored office workers and desperate housewives, and as someone who actually followed his wife to a 'Paris' scenario, let me tell you that it didn't work either, I'm still figuring out what I'm made for and life is still routinely. So I can say that April and Frank were doomed from the start, and the tragedy is that they certainly loved each other.I had just seen ""Romeo and Juliet"" recently (and the remake with Leo) and the more marriage movies I watch, the more I wonder if it the play had such a tragic ending after all.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

unhappily ever after,It's early 60's in the suburbs of New York City. April (Kate Winslet) and Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) are unhappily married with two kids. Her amateur acting career is a flop. He's bored going into NYC for office work and has an afternoon fling with younger worker Maureen Grube (Zoe Kazan) on his 30th birthday. Their neighbor friends Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) are just as unhappy. Their realtor friend Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) has son John (Michael Shannon) who recently got out of psychiatric hospital and April agrees to befriend him. April tells Frank about her wild idea to sell everything and move to Paris. He agrees and grows excited. Then his boss offers him a promotion and April gets pregnant.Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite with her then-husband Sam Mendes as the director. It would be impossible and maybe ill-advised to repeat the characters in Titanic. That's not to say that it's not strange for Jack and Rose to keep yelling at each other. It is beautifully made. It is an unhappy watch done in the most expert way. It is seriously good work but it does make me sad. The other problem is that the kids are almost extras in this film.

No Reason to Exist,"There's a scene in this where the man confesses to an affair and the woman asks why he told. Puzzled, he explains why he had the affair.No, Kate's character asks, why tell me? What did you expect to happen? How did you expect to affect me?By then I was well into wondering why this movie was made. What did they think would happen? What did they expect to change in us?I ask because I use films in building a life, examining a self, exploring a mindworld. But I just could not see how this could be used for any of those purposes.It has one of my most valued performers, Kate. Her strength is in characters whose presentation she can comment on in the performance. Here, she is clearly trying to stretch into playing the precise opposite, a character that has NO external view, in fact no introspection at all. Its an interesting story what an actor believes acting is all about, but not enough to create real value.Unlike ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" this does not reveal a soul. It does not ""study"" a character. Like ""Woolf"" it has actorly pyrotechnics, but without the intended value, its nothing but a circus act, to show that something hard can indeed be done. It is deliberate I think, a film that you cannot find a purpose for about a life that is the same.It is interesting however as another example of husbands directing women they are in love with. Its an interesting kind of lovemaking, with several public and more private channels, some artistic intent subsumed by engagement. Its what I would want. Its what this character lacks.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Romance
Like the Paris scenes,"In this film Winslet and Dicaprio are at the top of their games. Their feelings toward each other are complex and deranged. Their bitterness towards each other seems to disappear as the movie wears on but it does not. They simply put the bitterness they feel for each other in the back of their mind thinking it will go away and it may have. But when one key event takes place in the movie their bitterness evolves into hatred. Instead of continuing to fight the lie of what people think it means to lead a good life, which is what drew them to each other in the first place, they start to accept that lie causing them to drift apart in so many ways. Dicaprio and Winslet are one of the few that are able to so perfectly illustrate complexities such as this in relationships and marriage. Michael Shannon plays a very interesting role of a man considered crazy yet is the only one who agrees with the ""emptyness and hopelessness"" of their lives. He plays well but I feel as if something is missing from his character.The directing of Sam Mendes is good in that the film brings you back in time. Yet the movie did not rise to what it could have been because of the writing. The film did not open up enough to fully capture the audience. The film stayed one gear and never seemed to switch off it. The couple of Winslet and Dicaprio seemed to be happy at one point but we barely get a glimpse of that. If the movie had started off on that and then switched over to its false hope and then depressing tone it would have greatly succeeded.

The Road to Disappointment,"How are you going to keep the viewers down in the theaters now that they've seen Mad Men? With pedigree maybe, but maybe not.Revolutionary Road would have had something new to say two years ago, just before the AMC television series hit the cablewaves. Today, it just feels like we've seen it all before, and much better. Only this time it's said by stars, big stars, three of them reuniting from the one of the biggest movies of all time, throwing their acting around like they're auditioning for Oscar himself. But does that a good film make?The story of the proverbial ""folks who live on the hill"", whose lives turn out to be much darker than any of their friends and neighbors would imagine, offered many opportunities for departure from past films and television shows. But this new Sam Mendes film does not take advantage of those opportunities and plunges instead down a path of self-destructive discontent that's too much of a predictable standard to feel revolutionary at all.To make matters worse, this road is loaded with clichés about suburbia, the emptiness of middle-class existence, and the loss of dreams and individuality, all wrapped in the same smoke-booze-and-infidelity excesses as its more sophisticated television sibling.Leonardo Di Caprio replays the same character we've come accustomed to seeing in his hands, all lava-like intensity and pain behind his child-like face. For my money, he gives an adequate but mostly unmodulated performance that is all tears ready to burst out of his eyes with every marital twist of fate. Weren't those mad men in the 1950's the ultimate experts at keeping it all in? Kate Winslet doesn't fare much better or much worse.

Another Trip on the Titanic!,"I read this novel in college. It was absolutely biting then and I have kept it with me for over 30 years. The movie is so painful to watch. I remember the fifties and their sterility and the roles people were expected to play. A few years had past since the end of the war and people were happy just to be bored. April (Kate Winslet) is ahead of her time. We know this because the talk she talks is stunning to the neighbors. He plans to embrace bohemianism make most around her think she is crazy. DeCaprio tries hard but thinks she is also nuts. There is so much angst in each scene. Some of the people who have found fault with this film are judging these people with criteria based on contemporary life. It was so much duller then and so were the people. They chose to be dull. This sets up a powder keg. The ""Wheelers,"" rolling forward, have the respect and admiration of all those around them. He is handsome; she is stunning. They have two beautiful kids. His job is tiresome, but he apparently makes a little money, enough so he wouldn't have to work for six months if they went to Paris. The best scenes are when the realtor who sold them the house on Revolutionary Road (certainly an ironic title because nothing revolutionary happens) brings her bipolar (perhaps) son to visit. He is the real spokesman for the movie. The crazy guy who really knows what is going on. Anyway, this film cuts to the heart, showing people who have failed to but heads with the realities of their time. The acting is quite good though it is really hard to like either of the characters much. Silence is another main character. It's like a grim reaper when it appears.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good film but one which never quite escapes the confines it puts itself in,"I saw Revolutionary Road this evening and to be honest before sitting down to watch it I was sceptical. Was this to be an American Beauty rip off? A blatant ploy for Oscar glory? In the end my fears were allayed, it's a very good piece. What makes this film are the lead performances, Winslet and Dicaprio are both outstanding. Their characters crack and crumble before your eyes. You believe completely in these wrecks of people, and as their lives go from one turmoil to the next you will them to make the right decisions and feel for them when things go wrong.I felt that the main problem with the film was the plot. I have no quibbles with what does happen in the film it just to me felt that not enough happened in the 2 hour running time, it set its self as a look at a conflict between a married couple and that was its downfall. There is very little else other the arguments of a married couple and in the end that gets a little tiring.I would though say that this film is well worth a watch, the performances are terrific and it is beautifully shot, I just don't think it is the seminal commentary on marriage it sets out to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Never thinking beyond the (white) self,"OK, I agree with most of the glowing comments about performance and filming. However, this is a film that never thinks beyond the most precious needs and desires of the white middle-class (self-fulfillment, anti-consumerism, etc.). The Wheelers are utterly self-absorbed, narcissistic people--whom the film wants us to sympathize with. The film's themes are commonplace: youth's lost dreams, women didn't have it great, conformity is not good, the Fifties were stultifying, consumerism kills the soul, etc. BUT ... this was an extremely exciting decade from another perspective. This decade saw the beginning of the modern Civil Rights Movement! (As I remember, there was not one minority featured in the film, not one.) Very interesting things were happening in the labor unions during this period as well. The Wheelers (and the film itself) really had an alternative to its narrow critique: looking beyond the confines of white suburbia, the woes of mid-level corporate management, and feminist critiques. The film should have included the social and political context of the 1950s--African Americans and the working class fighting for their rights. That would have been a more devastating critique of the Wheeler's life-style, and would have made it a much more powerful movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beating a dead horse,"Revolutionary Road is one of those rare ambitious dramas Hollywood puts out during Oscar season to make it look like they care about people older than a teenager. They don't. If you want to see top drama, you have to go to American television, respected around the world for its excellence. I was recently in Paris to teach the 22 Step Great Screen writing Class, and all the press wanted to talk about - print, radio and television - was the amazing writing on American TV dramas like Mad Men, The Wire, and Lost.Everyone had high hopes for Revolutionary Road, since it's based on a much-loved novel of the 50s by Richard Yates. But that just makes the film all the more depressing. And that's because the writing is shockingly deficient. This film is actually a fascinating case study for screenwriters and directors, especially when you compare it to American Beauty. Both films were directed by Sam Mendes. Both explore the sterility of marriage in the suburbs. But one is a modern classic while the other is a sincere but undeniable failure.What's the difference? The script of course. These two films are yet another proof that the screenwriter, not the director, is the true author of the film. And when a film fails, we have to go to the script to find the causes.Like American Beauty, Revolutionary Road bases its story on as ambitious a theme as a modern-day writer can take on: how do you live a meaningful life in middle-class suburban America? Suburbia promises that we're all the king or queen of own castle. But once you are living comfortably in that castle, are you really free? Is that the true recipe for a good and satisfying life? Revolutionary Road takes on that vast and complex theme full bore, and what power it has comes from a theme that challenges people where they live, and how they live, like no other theme can. It forces the audience to take a lifetime perspective on their own lives, and very few films or TV shows do that.But an ambitious theme is also much harder to pull off. And Revolutionary Road's technique, its artistry, is simply not up to the task. In fact the film is so alienating in its techniques that it loses even those in the audience who really want it to succeed. Plot is virtually non-existent; it hits the same beat in almost every scene (to be fair, some of that blame must go to the novelist). This forces the dialogue to carry the story, something dialogue cannot do.As a result, the dialogue in almost every scene is overtly thematic, on-the-nose and on the same subject: live your passion, escape your dull suburban life. We thought we were special, we want a better future, but we find we're like everyone else.Okay, I get it. Mendes has said, ""It might be more difficult to distance yourself from the opinions of the writer and the filmmaker"" if the film is set in the present, whereas ""you never feel lectured to or instructed when you're watching a period film."" Not so. This shows a glaring lack of understanding of what makes great dramatic writing.With such a lack of technical artistry in the storytelling, the question of course becomes why. As always the reasons become clear when we explore the story's structure, and especially when we apply the seven major structure steps. It turns out that the battle scene - the biggest and final conflict between the hero and the opponent - which usually comes at the climax of the story, comes here at the beginning. In the opening scene the two leads meet in a bar. Each is full of promise. In the third scene, the two characters, now married for many years, have a vicious fight in which they lay out every argument the story will express. In effect, the story is over in the third scene! In a good battle scene at the end of the story, the writer can and should make the competing values of the characters explicit. This is where the theme first pops in the mind of the audience. And it pops with power because until then it has been woven below the surface through the story structure. In the Great Screen writing Class, I talk extensively about how to express a theme powerfully, through a moral argument of action. In other words, by what the characters do in the story. Instead of sending a message, you move and inspire an audience from their core.The seven steps are what make thematic power possible, because they are the way a good story develops organically. When you ignore the natural unfolding of these steps, as for example when you push the battle scene to the front, the thematic elements are flashed in big neon letters. The audience backs off. And the story has nowhere to go. A story is like a shark; it always has to be moving. When it stops, it dies.Another way to see Revolutionary Road's failure is to see it as the drama of inaction. April's solution to her and Frank's suburban paralysis is to say to her husband: maybe you could go to Paris and find yourself. Sounds good, but it doesn't mean anything. I'm not arguing that this attempt to find meaning isn't real. Our lives are full of things we might have done, along with solutions we desperately construct that are as flimsy as tissue paper. But that doesn't make for good drama.Revolutionary Road is a great example in story terms of beating a dead horse. I feel bad for the horse, but I wish I could have stopped watching a long time ago.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
An engaging tale of real lives,"This film is about a middle class couple who lives a seemingly perfect life in an affluent suburb.""Revolutionary Road"" is an amazing film. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio both perform amazingly. The Wheelers live a seemingly perfect life, until they start to realise their life around them is one big lie. Their lives then degenerate into a tale that no one wants to listen to. Such a transition is heart wrenching but strangely captivating.The plot is very engaging and above all, real. What other film contains such a real life dialog about having children or not? Because the plot is so real, one can easily relate to it, making the film ever more engaging. It is ironic that the most real conversation they have is with a supposed lunatic. Maybe we are all living deluded lives, and clarity can only stem from lunacy? It is such a captivating and thought provoking film. Who would have thought the reunion of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio would be so tragic?",,Anonymous,Romance
Best acting couple for years,"During watching this movie I was thinking the performances of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are convincing and extremely good. In my opinion one of the best and most believable couple I've seen for years in cinema. Both knew each other well as if they played a hundred times together. Strange to know that it is only her second movie together. For me the acting is very important in a drama. It was good to see that in the supporting cast Michael Shannon has a remarkable performance as crazy neighbor and the always good Kathy Bates as his mother. Of course all the other actors are also showing solid performances.This Drama from Director Sam Mendes shows the life of a young couple in the 50's of the last century. Sam Mendes directed also the famous ""American Beauty"" and again he let us see what happens behind the doors of the houses of American families. It's a satirical look which includes tragedy and love. Revolutionary Road is not a Comedy in the classical meaning so keep this in mind when you watching it else you could get an unpleasant kick.What was keeping my attention? Firstly as mentioned the acting and then of course the realistic story about a couple in the 1950's. When I first saw Leonardo DiCaprio on screen I was thinking he is dressed in a Frank Sinatra Style. So please also watch at the settings and costumes. All were selected carefully. The cinematography is as usual beautiful in a Sam Mendes Movie.If you like Drama and like to see good performances in a setting of the 1950's this Movie is definitely for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Road to Perdition,"Kate Winslet and Leo reunite after their Titanic ... experience. And while I still have resisted to watch the highest grossing movie ever, I was really anxious to watch this one. A friend of mine had told me, that it was one of the best movies he had watched in 2009. While some movies suffer from high expectations, this one didn't. It's high class drama (if there is such a word/phrase), dark and really ""brutal"" (not in an explicit kind of way).Acting wise, Kate and Leo really give their best, but they have strong supporting cast to play with. There is one in particular, who also plays the part of comic relief. This is not a comedy (far from it), but those rare moments of comic relief are really needed and thrown in, at the right moments. If you thought, American Beauty was dark and twisted ... you ain't seen nothing yet (until you watch Reservation Road that is)!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another fine film from Sam Mendes,"Quite an experience. This wasn't much of a hit in its day and it is quite understandable why. How many couples or families want to watch a film that seriously questions the American Dream and if the husband, the wife, the children, the house, the dog, the lawn, the monotonous 9 to 5 job is the way to live the only life one will ever have? Winslet won an Oscar for The Reader the same year this was released, but this is the film she deserved to win it for. DeCaprio, an actor who has rarely appealed to me gives one of his best performances here. Kathy Bates is fun and ultimately ugly and Michael Shannon is simply superb in his two scenes. This is a disturbing and honestly bleak film that should interest anyone who is into courageous filmmaking. When this was first released I got so tired of hearing people say that they wouldn't watch this for anything because it is not entertainment. This is a film you can learn something from and because of that, it is very entertaining, but if you only want to see happy films, then yeah, this is not for you. The very final scene between Bates and her husband is just about as perfect as it could be and pretty damn funny to boot.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
See it on DVD,"Granted, you should not see this movie if you can't stand a movie that doesn't have explosions or knee-slappers every five minutes.This movie discusses the mediocrity of today's definition of happiness.It successfully portrays the frustration of suburban life Bottom line, it's a touching movie that you should see on a rainy day, or after a breakup, alone. It can have deep meaning and become touching only if you see it at the right time.Although Kate and Leo are great together, this movie is no Titanic. It's slow to take off, it's filled with expletives and lines that sound way too scripted. At the end of the movie, I just sighed and thought, ""well that's just too bad."" I think the director tried too hard to make this movie as it would occur in real life. That's great, but along with the ""reality sucks"" concept of this movie comes the eye-drooping mediocrity of the lives of the two main characters.Kate and Leo do an excellent job of acting, though.

A reluctant Stepford wife,"There is something missing in Sam Mendes' adaptation of the Yates' novel, ""Revolutionary Road."" I fault specifically the screenplay which is heavy on explanatory dialog. The characters are trying to explain to one another what's wrong, while the audience is way ahead. We see the problem, and then a secondary character comes in later and spells it out even more clearly..The over enunciation of every word by both the leads is also peculiar. This sounds like a stage play that the two actors have over-rehearsed. And we're given all the ""high points"" of their arguments with little understanding of why they are drawn to one another or why one or the other just doesn't leave.If we're supposed to condemn the ""system"" that has put them on Revolutionary Road, that has been left out. Their personal problems seem much deeper than whatever rat race a capitalistic society has trapped them in. I felt like any place they were headed, they'd be just as unhappy. Their lack of fulfillment doesn't much matter since we don't see that there's much potential anywhere. Particularly in Mr. DiCaprio's character who is a liar, hates and uses just about everyone around him, and then bullies his wife into being whatever he'd like. It's a particularly unpleasant performance by a usually gifted and affecting actor.Ms. Winslet comes off somewhat more sympathetic, but the constant baiting of her husband in most of the fighting grows tiresome. My favorite moment (and it's a nicely held one by the director) occurs at a roadhouse when Ms. Winslet cuts lose on the dance floor and becomes reckless and seductive. It's a terrific moment for the actress and for the audience.I won't go into the plot since it would spoil what little there is, but the subject matter hinges on a lighting rod in today's political climate, and it's treated without much sensitivity.Even the composer, Thomas Newman, who did so much for Mr. Mendes in ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" (two of my favorite films) seems repetitious and glib. Kathy Bates, however, really perks things up in her scenes showing even playing a one dimensional character can still be both artful and entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The neighborhood of broken dreams,"Sam Mendes was coming off a foray into the war genre with 'Jarhead', when a few years later he turned to romance in an adaptation of Richard Yates' book with 'Revolutionary Road'.
The film reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Wislet from 'Titanic', although this time in a very different love and heartbreak story.
Sam Mendes puts this couple in a distorted or hidden image of the ""American dream."" Through long and expressive shots, while developing a predominant use of white or light tones, build an idealization of life as a couple, but in essence it is a nightmare or a prison in which you can resign yourself to living or seek a more revolutionary road. In the film, these two ways are represented through their protagonists, the husband played by DiCaprio would be the resigned while Wislet's character would seek new options.
It's true that sometimes Mendes gets a little out of hand when it comes to portraying this, but not enough to ruin this heartbreaking portrait of life as a couple in a neighborhood where the neighbors are their own broken dreams.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Well acted and made, but it's really just a turgid melodrama","Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in this film about an unhappily married couple. When they met, they were idealistic youths, but when they arrive in the suburbs, he working in sales and she a housewife, life seems dreary. The film offers no new insights on marriage or life. It is set in the 1950s, so you might think it's like, say, Far from Heaven in that it attempts to exploit the inadequacies of an era so beloved by a certain group of our society. But, no, Revolutionary Road doesn't make much of its '50s setting. I think it wants to be more universally about marriage. It's set in the '50s, I think, so there's a better reason these two people who just plain dislike each other have to stay together. So, taking place in the 1950s actually dates the problems that these couple are having for the most part. The story just doesn't feel relevant to a modern audience. Or me, at least. The film isn't that bad in the end. The acting is quite good, especially from Kate Winslet. Though I am a big fan of Michael Shannon, I found his two scenes in the movie very poorly written, mostly concerning his character, who comes off as a mere plot tool rather than a real person. The film is very gorgeous to look at, thanks to Roger Deakins, and I liked Thomas Newton's score (he provided an even better one for Wall-E earlier in 2008).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Captivating!,"Revisiting titles that I watched back in my adolescence helps me get a better grasp of the full extent to which I have altered and matured in terms of insight and intellect. I found Revolutionary Road quite well-acted by the leads and masterfully directed by Sam Mendes back in 2009, but this time around, as a thirty-year-old woman with adequate experience when it comes to relationships, disillusionment, and identity crisis, I totally got to empathize with each character, their flaws, their shattered dreams, and the overall toll it takes on any individual to be put in such a position. Highly recommended to lovers of realistic cinema!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Watch Fellini Instead,"With a first rate cast, cinematographer, score composer and his own fine direction, Mendes' latest project is tantalizing because it does such a good job rendering the blind intensity that accompanies so many failed couples as they discover and try to grapple with their failure. However, the implicit explanation for the failure of this couple (and the corresponding kind of moral failure portrayed for each of the individual lives in this marriage) has no plausibility, and thus the film's accuracy in portraying the mutual misunderstanding and emotional confusion of Frank and April Wheeler as they face up to the realities of their lives is largely wasted. It is not that one cannot imagine people who, feeling trapped in comfortable but uninteresting lives, get desperate about their situation. While the self-congratulatory ring of artists depicting such bad lives (artists we know wouldn't be caught dead living like thisartists like Terry Zwigoff come to mind) is a bit much, it is the utter implausibility of *these* two people, neither of whom has more than a *vague desire to be special*, getting this histrionically desperate at the prospect of living a life no more special than that of anyone else that ground my suspension of disbelief into dust. April, the most desperate of the two, has made a run at acting early in their marriage and proved no good at it. But she still wants to believe there's something special over the rainbow, and so badly, we are supposed to believe, that she is willing to uproot her own life and those of her entire family to take her husband to Paris, where his own utterly vague, intermittent, and apparently alcohol-related desire to live in a 'way that seems to matter' can be tested at long last. Neither of them can articulate what it is they hope to gain or even *experience* if this longed-for world comes to pass. And in that respect, these are just like the vague dreams of a 12 year old. Whatever else, they are not the natural result of a deadening but comfortable life in late 1950s east coast suburbia for people who have a little more 'lift' in their boots than their fellow man and woman. I have not read the corresponding novel, and hope it doesn't try to make the case for this absurd proposition, but clearly Mendes is prepared not only to believe this kind of nonsense, but to make very expensive art promoting it. It's a nice Oscar vehicle for his wife, and there are some good scenes, particularly those with Kathy Bates and her electro-shocked son (who in this piece plays a cross between soothsayer and Greek chorus). For a far better movie that deals with the same subjects, try Fellini's ""Juliet of the Spirits"". I'm not sure Juliet is real, either, but in that movie you *believe* she is (and care what happens to her).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great performances, Really good movie.","This movie had been on my watchlist for quite a while and I only watched it because it was about to leave Netflix, and I'm sure glad I did.
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet give outstanding performances in this movie about a couple who are not satisfied with their lives, and they take it out on each other. Then, a plan to change their lives dramatically fixes everything- just the promise of a new start in a new place is enough to take them back in time to a period where they truly loved each other. They had all the hope and dreams ahead of them that they could dream of and they were so excited.
I thought the acting was excellent, not only from the two leads, but by Michael Shannon, who was a strange, yet clear-eyed character.
Finally, I'm not a musician at all, but I thought the three-note piano piece that is played many times in the film is outstanding- it can be haunting, exhilarating, and hopeful and, in my opinion, is an understated but crucial part of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perceptive with good insight,"Director Sam Mendes does wonderful work. He takes his time and explores human emotions.

But here, there are some truths that are rarely expressed in movies.Leonardo DiCaprio is very good in this. He is becoming more mature with each new movie.

Introduction to a masterpiece which will question your lifestyle and dreams.,"Can you change your life for love? What's the border between craziness and frustration? Are we really living our lives? This fantastic movie won 20 awards and 73 nominations. It's an incredible story and let's discover why.The movie is set in Connecticut during the mid-1950 and inspired by the book ""Revolutionary Road"" written by Richard Yates. It's a story of love, marriages, families and abortion, ambitions and frustrations, of dreamers and conformists. It's the daily tale of all of us, on the road of our lives. Looking for an often unachievable and unknown happiness. You will ask yourself, what's the purpose of this life? It is just about having a good job, a great house, a wife, children? Or there is something more? Like the love for yourself, for your talents, your passions, your desires and dreams. But to find the right answer requires painful choices to be made, and this where this masterpiece guide us. Frank and April Wheeler are the protagonists and to give them voice and action, we have two of the most talented and incredible actors in Hollywood: Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, directed by Sam Mendes, in one of his most successful films. It's not a movie for everyone. It's very sophisticated, well-crafted, a masterpiece in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revolutionary Road,"Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are a young married couple living with their two kids in Connecticut in the 1950s. Their life is basically fine, but both long for more: he is disillusioned with his steady but boring office job, while she feels suffocated by the quiet life of a housewife. To escape their dull reality, April suggests they move to France and start over there, finally realizing their old, buried dream. Although initially excited about the idea, Frank and April soon have to face many difficulties life throws at them – the move to Europe starts seeming less and less sensible. Is there any way to overcome their desperation?The Wheelers' idea seems laughably idealistic at first, but the feeling of being trapped by the endless responsibilities of respectable life is easy to identify with, and in the end their planned move is not at all difficult to understand. The ironically bright and sunny cinematography and the fact that the story is set in the narrow-minded 1950s add to the mood of deadly pleasantness too. The most telling of the scenes may be the conversation where April explains that she never wanted to get out of her life, but in it.One of the film's main assets is the acting. Especially Kate Winslet performs her part with masterful precision; every small emotion comes to life on her face without ever looking unnatural or exaggerated. DiCaprio does a good job too, but his credibility as a serious adult is sadly diminished by his youthful, boyish looks (perhaps a cliché criticism, but I cannot ignore it). The Wheelers' situation is also reflected to their family friends Shep and Milly who are implied to be going through similar sentiments but with less self-confidence; David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn convey this feel of unspoken envy with ease. Michael Shannon as John Givings, a mentally unstable former mathematician, also deserves a nod for his portrayal of the seemingly aggressive but ultimately bitter and self-pitying speaker of truth; so does his on-screen mother Helen, played by Kathy Bates.Together DiCaprio, Winslet and director Mendes craft a well-made drama that evokes memories from Mendes' first hit American Beauty (1999). Especially the haunting music at the end of Revolutionary Road immediately leads thoughts to Lester Burnham and Co. but the emphases are different in both films. Perhaps the newer film could have used a little more of element of surprise to raise it into the master class, but it is an enjoyable, if forlorn, tale of anxiety at any rate.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Something's missing,"I really admire Winslet and DiCaprio as actors. They're both fabulous in every their role and they had wonderful chemistry in Titanic (which my friend literally forced me to watch:-) They were great then and they are even greater now, but something's missing. I don't know what – storyline is good, Sam Mendes is great director (although I doubt he'll ever make better movie than American beauty), Kate and Leo were spectacular, but... I wasn't fully satisfied with the final result. I don't mind it's slow and I don't think it's boring like most of the people with negative reviews. Let me say that I've watched Taking Chance the same day (and this is the definition of slow paced movie and most people comment that it's boring because nothing happens from the beginning to the end), but this one grabbed my attention and my heart, although I can hardly (if ever) relate to it's subject.

Good (but not original) premise devolves into melodrama,"I was with this one through a good third of the film or so -- maybe even half. I'm a sucker for existential stories -- you know, stories in which one or more characters take a time-out from the sequence of events that inform and rule our daily lives and stop to consider the end game. Mendes was gold with ""American Beauty."" Well, I think he went to the well a few too many times with ""Revolutionary Road."" Yeah, it's another road. ""Road to Perdition"" was a road, too. Having gone down the road to perdition, did I need to take a re-run with another unhappy story in another time and setting? Not sure. Maybe. I appreciate Sam's move to bring it home (or at least a little closer) to something the average suburbanite could relate to. But the themes in Revolutionary Road have already been run through the grinder, and much more eloquently and effectively, by a writer named John Cheever. Sure, he worked in a different medium -- fiction on the page vs. cellulose -- but he got it right on the suburban malaise meter. He could have a crazy man come to an Episcopal church to crucify a rebellious teenager for the sins of the father: namely, conformity to prepackaged standards and adherence to values that seem obviously pointless. But still, when I watched the last half hour of "" . . . Road,"" I just wasn't buying it. The flick asks us to buy into the proposition that everyone deep down knows the sick deal we've all been dealt and everyone is really, really torn up about it but almost everyone represses that understanding or whatever -- and that the unfortunate courageous few, very few, who take a look at the parameters of the human condition head-on are bound either to cower down and put on the plastic mask or are doomed to freak the heck out. Sorry, but that's ridiculous. You can take a trip to your local poor part of town (like where I've lived most of my life) and, if you have a few minutes to chat with the locals and don't get your asterisk kicked in the process, you'll find that our world is full of people who understand that the bill of goods we've been sold from day one is a piece of fecal matter. They don't go around freaking out. Newsflash -- existential despair isn't a novelty. Plenty of us have it. We don't go daydreaming about running off to Paris because of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Road To Destruction,"Sam Mendes who had earlier given us the marvelous 'American Beauty' and the fantastic 'Road To Perdition' is now back with a harsh and disturbing portrayal of the intimate (or lack of it) relationship between a married couple. Though the film is set in the fifties, the dilemmas, moral conflicts, despair, depression and hopelessness holds relevant even for today's world.Given the solid screenplay, Mendes does not waste time to contrast the relationship pre and post marriage. That one scene in the beginning is enough to demonstrate that these two people, who instantly hit it off, had dreams and aspirations. Soon marriage happens, and then children and thus their dreams are pushed further away until it becomes nothing but a distant dream. Frank works a 10hour/day job that he hates and April is the ultimate desperate housewife.Mendes has an eye for visuals and 'Revolutionary Road' is no different. Every frame is stunning to look at. The cinematography and score only enhance the mood of the scenes.Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet reunite after about 11 years, this time with something much more challenging than silly candy-floss romance. One can easily see how both have matured as actors. Although I did find Dicaprio to overact in several scenes and at times he's a little too weepy but his best scenes are with Winslet who delivers a very natural performance by depicting the despair and sadness of the ultimate desperate housewife. The supporting cast is commendable. Michael Shannon steals the show while Kathryn Hahn and Kathy Bates are good.'Revolutionary Road' is quite daring with its stark portrayal of a marriage gone so sour that it has become poisonous. Mendes has been known to deal with risky subject matters and here too he gives it the right treatment. Had the script gone to a lesser director, then the 'Revolutionary Road' could have easily failed.",,Anonymous,Romance

"Trapped in Someone Else's Suburban, Middle-Class American Dream","In the wake of WWII, Frank and April Wheeler (DiCaprio and Winslet) were a young, newly married couple living in New York City. They had freedom, grand dreams, and their entire lives left to fulfill them. Seven or so years and 2 children later, in 1955, they live in a beautiful home in an idyllic suburban Connecticut town. Frank has an unfulfilling office job, and April has given up her dreams of becoming a professional actress. They are struggling, as individuals and a couple. They need to be reinvigorated. April comes up with a plan for them to move to Paris, where they could feel ""alive"" again.This is a fantastic film about the perils of conforming to the suburban, middle-class dream at the expense of following one's actual dreams, particularly in the mid-20th Century when the concepts of suburbia and the middle class were still brand new in American society and when the conformity of the 1950's traps people into doing what is expected of them, even if that means living (and for some characters, justifying) an unfulfilling life that they are programmed to believe is all one could wish for in life. Stagnation leads to suppression of the human spirit, at which point, all bets are off.Other characters struggle with suburban conformity in their own ways. This is a tale about a family having everything that most families dream of, but still being unhappy. There is one thing they are missing- freedom! The freedom to be themselves, to chase their passions and dreams, and to live the life they want instead of the one that American society programs everyone into believing what they should be happy with in life. They have no ""joie de vivre."" Notably, there is not a cloudy day depicted in the film. Every day is sunny and beautiful, and yet the oppression of dark clouds is felt everywhere as the Wheelers' relationship begins to devolve due to the oppression of their ""perfect life"" and suppression of their human spirit and souls, which they both experience but express and suffer through differently and on their own. The people around them find ways to live in denial; the Wheelers aren't capable of doing that.DiCaprio and Winslet are both excellent and have tremendous chemistry, as usual, even when their characters at points do not. They do the heavy lifting here. Sam Mendes does a nice job with the pacing of the film. The cinematography is also very good. David Harbour, Kathryn Hahn, Kathy Bates, and Michael Shannon are excellent in their supporting roles. They flesh out the finer points about suburban conformity in the 1950's. (The film is based on the 1961 novel of Richard Yates, which I haven't read. It would have been very insightful of Yates to pick up on the perils of suburban conformity when it was still in its first decade or so.)This won't be your favorite feel good film, but it is a great film and worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Perfect hopelessness,"Having read and loved the novel, I can honestly say this is one of the best book to screen adaptations I've seen. It's extremely faithful to Richard Yates' 1961 brooding tale but also highly imaginative in its cinematic reconfiguration. In a way, the film had a stronger impact on me than the book. Going through that whole story in two hours is a devastating experience.Everyone who worked on this did such a solid job. The entire cast was magnificent. I won't elaborate on any individual performance, because each actor played it to perfection. Director Sam Mendes finally lives up to the standard he set with his first picture, American BEAUTY. Exploring the dark side of American suburbia definitely works for him. Thomas Newman's score is haunting and, although less complex, reminiscent of American BEAUTY's heavily atmospheric soundtrack.The entire movie is gorgeous to watch. It's full of powerful images that will burn into your memory. I loved the slight surreality to everything. The styles, colors, and strict conformity of 1950s Connecticut has an other-worldly quality. I think it was the right choice to, ever so slightly, heighten and exaggerate the emotions and relations of the characters. It added much needed humor at times and kept things from getting overly raw and dirty. Despite all the stylistic choices, I still felt it was very grounded in reality, and I found it to be almost embarrassingly relatable at times.If anything negative can be said, I could see this getting criticized for being too perfect, too calculated, too Oscar oriented. It may be all those things, but it's also full of life and truth. The novel is a literary classic. The rights for the film were purchased not long after its original publication, but at that time, no one knew how to make it. Everything aligned just right for this movie to happen. I couldn't imagine this film existing any differently. It may take place in a bygone era, but it has everything needed to be a timeless classic, and as long as people keep getting married, it will always be relevant.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Buy the DVD for someone you hate.,"Wow. What a depressing, worthless film. Marc and I went to see this last night - I only hope that he can forgive me for suggesting it. What people say is partly true: Kate Winslet's performance allows her to show her range as the trapped, middle class suburban housewife - she is convincing and at times bold. Michael Shannon is Oscar nominated for his role as a mentally ill neighbour who is the only one willing to speak what everybody else is thinking - his key scene is hilarious and horrific.The cinematography and period detail are beautiful and James Newton's score is affecting - particularly in a scene where Winslet grasps the last moments of light against the back garden tree, while, after their biggest bust up yet, Leo DiCaprio wanders around in the darkness of the house on Revolutionary Road - the house that typified everything 'perfect' about their life.As just about every critic ever has noted, the concept is not original; David Lynch blew it apart in 'Blue Velvet' and 'Twin Peaks' and surely after 3 seasons of Desperate Housewives, it's no longer an alien concept. As Kermode notes Todd Haynes' 'Far From Heaven' takes this initial premise in a far more interesting and brave direction, a beautiful film that I would watch 20 times before I ever set eyes on Revolutionary Road again. Bearing in mind that RR comes from Sam Mendes, who delved with insight and originally into this same white-picket lie with American Beauty ten years ago, it's even more disappointing to watch this film that adds nothing to our understanding.I haven't even got to what's bad about it yet; the sheer hopelessness of the script, the clichéd dialogue, its torturous length, the bizarre sidelining of the kids or the moral corruption unbalanced without any sense of regret, repentance or redemption. Most of all, we both came out of the cinema with the same key observation: none of the characters were likable. Nothing about them was endearing, upright, selfless, loving, hopeful or genuine. Summed up, RR was over 2 hours of hateful, self-deceived people wrapped up in their purposeless, spiralling lives. Maybe that was the point?On a personal note, it confirmed to me that I really do dislike DiCaprio as an actor - only his performance in The Departed approached bearable. The only thing revolutionary about this film is what a tragic waste of time and talent it is, bringing absolutely nothing of worth into the world. I'd rather lose a limb than watch this again. Not only the most bitter, unfathomable film I've seen in the past 12 months but probably ever. Buy the DVD for someone you really hate.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
After the honeymoon . . .,"Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road is a sad portrait of a couple collapsing under the burning question of what they really want from their relationship. I sat cautiously, waiting for his film to take the easy route, to find an easy answer to their problems. This was not to be. This is one of the most honest films I've ever seen about marriage and the emptiness that brings it apart.The story involves Frank and April (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) who meet at a party one night and discuss their future plans. She wants to be an actress and he doesn't have much idea what he wants.They fall for each other and before you know it, they are Mr. and Mrs. Frank Wheeler, making plans for their new baby and buying a house at 115 Revolutionary Road, sold to them by nosy Mrs. Givings (Kathy Bates).This is the 1950s, the age of The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, and Frank enters the workforce at a company that makes computer equipment. He isn't just the man in the gray flannel suit, he is one of many as we see hundreds of gray flannel suits charging through Grand Central Station on their way to work. April, meanwhile settles into the expected role of domesticity, fussing after the kids, making dinner and brooding over her station in life.Frank and Alice are well aware that their destinies have been locked down into lives that are making them both miserable. Frank doesn't want to be a corporate stooge and April doesn't want to be chained to the stove. Neither wants to follow a long trail of misery into middle age so Alice comes up with a strange plan: They will pack up and move to Paris where she will work at the American consulate while he figures out what he wants to do with his life and puts it into motion. Basically, they will be switching roles.Everyone tells the couple that they are daft but no one has the guts to break open the real reality to them. That is, until they meet John (Michael Shannon), Mrs. Givings' grown son who has just been released after spending some time in a mental hospital. The only thing really wrong with John is that he seems to have a knack for telling the unvarnished truth without sugar-coating. He forces April and Frank to take a good hard look at their situation and reconsider this goofy plan.What follows is a case of marital meltdown. It is clear that the couple have been living an unfulfilled life and now that the Honeymoon is over they are desperate to figure out what to do about it. The problem is that real life keeps intruding and it only aids in pulling them further apart.What comes of their marriage I will not say, except that it has the odd pace of real life. There is no phony construction of the plot here, nothing to manipulate or solve their problems easily. Their problems are are born from two separate, stubborn personalities. Their arguments are merciless and emotionally devastating. This is the first paring of DiCaprio and Winslet since Titanic and I am glad they didn't choose safe material. This film almost seems to suggest what would have happened to Jack and Rose once they got to America and started a life together.The movie was directed by Sam Mendes, who is an expert at films about characters who are stuck in a rut. He made Jarhead, about soldiers stuck in the Gulf War with nothing to do. And he made American Beauty which was another that exposes the undercurrents of suburban life. His best arena is focusing on characters desperate to escape their confinement. Revolutionary Road is his best film, a painful portrait of how the dance of dating and courtship can whirl a couple into a delusion that can't survive when real life sends their ideals crashing to the floor.",,Anonymous,Romance

Revolutionary Road Review,"If you took Mendes' ""American Beauty"", then sucked the contemporary setting and satirical bite out of it, you would get this film he made nearly a decade later. That is not to say that he is overly-repetitious or that this is a bad film by any measure. It is a powerful, well-written movie with two Oscar worthy performances by two stars well-known for their romance on the Titanic. Here they play a couple on the opposite side of the love spectrum, two people growing sick of each other and their plain and boring lives. The drama that results is so realistic and so spastic that it will shock you. The only problem with the movie is its lack of timeliness. This movie would have been revolutionary had it been filmed in the sixties or even in the seventies, but with dozens of suburban angst films proceeding it, ""Revolutionary Road"", just like its two main characters is bound to get lost in the shuffle.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Utterly dreadful,"Abotu 20 min. into ""Revolutionary Road,"" my husband said ""all three main characters were in 'Titanic."" I replied, ""I think this movie is sinking faster.""The '50s are certainly a treasure trove of depression, conformity and hidden angst. No surprise there. And depressing subject matter, if handled honestly, can still be cathartic and uplifting even if there's no ""happy ending."" But really...The heavy-handed script is like ""Human Angst For Dummies."" The characters are one-dimensional in their suffering, and the screenwriter has left nothing to the imagination. The script provides no interesting little moments, surprising details, intriguing contradictions or sharply observed behavior. Nothing is implied, nothing simmers beneath the surface.The first argument scene, particularly DeCaprio's performance, is right out of bad community theater. I've seldom seen such embarrassing scenery-chewing in a ""major"" movie. (Kate Winslet manages to escape mostly unscathed, but she seems to be just walking through this one.) And I'm getting REALLY tired of Kathy Bates doing her Kathy Bates Thing.Ugh.The sets, costumes, etc. are all lovely and perfect. But any episode of ""Mad Men"" provides all the same surface polish, plus some some actual delving into the human condition. I turned it off after 20 minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great acting by Winslet and DiCaprio make Revolutionary Road a must watch.,"Sam Mendes has crafted a touching story of a couple with marital issues. Based on a book which is set in the 50s the movie is raw and excels because of some fantastic acting from lead pair Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet. The film is excellently shot with the suburban house behind the white picket fence holding secrets expertly staged- which is no surprise since Mendes also helmed American Beauty some years ago. However, it can be tough for certain audiences to sit through, especially since they will expect the pairing of Di- Caprio and Winslet to sizzle like it did in Titanic. It does, but not in the way you will expect. This is a great profile of a marriage that you should watch.",,Anonymous,Romance
American Beauty: The 1950's Version,"Directed by Sam Mendes and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD would like to be a scathing indictment of 1950s America and suburbia but unfortunately fails to say anything fresh, and its satirical edge is remarkably dull. Still, there were some fine performances and individual moments that stand out, not to mention the excellent filmmaking on display. The story is about the Wheelers, a couple who live in the Revolutionary Hill Estates, a Connecticut suburban community. On the outside their life looks idyllic, but underneath it all there is a deep dissatisfaction and resentment that begins to manifest itself. The banality of suburban life is not a new topic in literature or film, and this film does a good job getting the surface details right in order to make its point rather clear. However, I didn't feel like it did anything I haven't seen before in other films, like THE ICE STORM and Sam Mendes' own ""American Beauty."" In fact, this felt a lot like ""American Beauty,"" with the exception that it was set in the 1950s. Even the score was reminiscent of the one for that previous film. However, that one had a more arty feel that this film didn't have. Still, despite the (ironically) banal subject matter, this film was well put together on every front, both technical and performance-wise. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do a good job playing their roles, although there isn't too much depth to their characters at all. There were a few smaller roles that had familiar faces behind them, but they also felt under-developed. By far the best performance in the entire film was a small role played by Michael Shannon, the temporarily institutionalized son of the couple who sold the house on Revolutionary Road to the Wheelers. His couple of scenes have that acerbic wit and bite to them that I wish had been more prevalent in the overall story, which felt downright sterile at times. From a technical standpoint, the film is flawless and the photography was beautiful, belying the ugliness of the atmosphere projected by its characters. Overall, I didn't hate this film but I didn't think it entirely justified its existence either. It does a good job of portraying suburban malaise, but at the end of it you have to ask ""So what?"" Still it made for a pleasant, if unspectacular, viewing experience and was capped off with the perfect ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Revolutionary Road: It's a one way street,"Stop, before you even attempt to read this review I must warn you. If you are currently engaged, if you are in a happy relationship and especially if your newlyweds, stop reading now. This movie is designed to repel you. This may just be the most depressing movie of 2009. An anti-marriage campaign if I ever saw one. What sets it apart from other movie with the same attitude (The Heart of Me) is that its flawlessly done. Sam Mendes movie looks and sounds gorgeous and not once does it put a foot out of line. What Revolutionary road fails to do however is maker you like it. Its wonderfully made sure, but the subject material is so banal its almost impossible to sit through.With ""American Beauty"", Sam Mendes's previous film, we were given at the very least a glimmer of hope. The theory behind that movie was that even in the last year of your life you can live a lifetime over. Here, none of these characters are given a glimmer of hope; in the end it all feels worthless.It's a movie for a specific audience, an audience I thought I catered to, with this movie however I even had to think twice about staying. It's not that it's a bad movie however, as I said it's wonderfully made. Look as hard as you want your won't find a flaw, its simply a case of the execution overruling the premise, a rare feat but true in this case. Its seems that from the get go this story fails to do justice to the elements Sam Mendes incorporates into it.These elements, done so flawlessly, include two riveting performances from Kate Winslet and Leonard DiCaprio both playing tortured middle class people living in 1950's America. Titanic shipmates Kathy Bates, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet step onboard for director Sam Mendes' tale of suburban malaise in 1950s-era Connecticut. Adapted from the classic 1961 novel by author Richard Yates, Revolutionary Road tells the tale of a young Connecticut couple whose once-idealistic relationship steadily deteriorates into a ceaseless cycle of petty jealousy and bickering as they strive to retain their independence in the conformity-obsessed world of picket fences and perfectly manicured lawns. Ever since they first met, Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) saw themselves as special and different.They strive to form their relationship around higher ideals, though upon moving into their new home on Revolutionary Road, the defiant couple pledges never to be confined by the social conventions of the era. As time passes, however, Frank and April gradually become the very thing that they both feared most -- a typical suburban family complete with abandoned dreams and faded hopes. Frank loses his nerve after taking a comfortable job with a reliable salary, and April morphs into an unsatisfied homemaker desperate for passion and excitement. But April's independent spirit hasn't been suffocated just yet, and when she hatches a plan to head for Paris, her need to escape at all costs stands in direct contrast to Frank's desire to hold on to what they already have.The score is executed with the same pin price precisions of that used in American Beauty, it feels as if somebody has spent a great deal of time on it. As does this film itself, Sam Mendes may have been so busy with the elements of his movie he may not have realised that the premise he was making his movie on felt a little lifeless. For better use of the word, a downer. Revolutionary Road is beautifully made, but it won't make your day.Verdict: A film crafter so beautifully it would be a shame to pass it up now. Sam Mendes directional style shine through the dim premise and while it's unlikely to leave any audience member happy, simply due to its depressing nature, it may just enlighten some. You come out knowing you have seen some great performances, brilliant direction and beautiful cinematography, but it is just not a film you love. For my overall rating I give Revolutionary Road 3/5.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good and teaches us a little something,"I enjoy films that have a hidden lesson. American Beauty had one and so does Sam Mendes' new film Revolutionary Road. This is a very different type of film starring the two main cast members of Titanic. However, this is not a film about Jack and Rose from Titanic and if anything is the complete opposite type of storyline compared to Titanic. The film has a similar type of storyline to American Beauty, only this time it occurs in the 1950s. Based on history classes I have taken in the past, Revolutionary Road's portrayal of life in the 1950s is almost a dead-on match from what I learned. There is the stay at home mother with the working father, where the father is in charge of the household and everyone in it. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Frank Wheeler was interesting and most certainly takes a different approach compared to other films he has done. Kate Winslet's portrayal of April was excellent was definitely worthy of the Golden Globe she received. Michael Shannon's acting was terrific and there is definitely some competition for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. As a male this is not normally the type of movie I would see since I generally watch action films and comedies, however any male can learn a lesson from Revolutionary Road when the film is over. Also if you enjoy films by Sam Mendes you will not be disappointed.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"moving, deeply felt and genuine","Marital conflict is not a fashionable subject for movies nowadays - maybe it's because the old-fashioned subject of marriage is not that fashionable itself - but this story touches in every respect, there are really original ideas about intimacy, about how many things are to be abandoned in the service of a marriage, about whether the abandonment is tragic or not. Frank's rage, frustration and aggressiveness are interestingly countered by April's stillness and coldness, so that every single argue/fight hits the mark, emotionally speaking. Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio are both really outstanding, they deliver confident performances dominating the film and creating at the same time a huge emotional impact (there's everything, impassivity, fear, anger, cries). This flick must intentionally impress the audience, it's certainly a sad story with a sad ending but perfectly written and acted.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The female version of American Beauty,"While watching this film I indeed got the feeling this is the female version of american beauty. Then the credits rolled in & the director is Sam Mendes...so that fell into place. 
From the theme through the cinematography & the script (when we were young we were full of hope...and laughed at everybody that was like we are now) this is a rehash of AB but still the director shines the light at a bit of different angles, showing different variations of the characters emotions. 
Kate Winslet gave a very good performance but in my opinion DiCaprio was terribly miscast. Or terribly directed. His manic-depression kind of role was awkward and over the top. Perhaps we're supposed to relate with April more than Frank but in AB Annette Bening was totally relateable even-tough having a smaller role.
Mendes really knows how to treat this subject and apparently likes it enough to do it over again (this coming from a man who's life is I guess not quite like his main characters...)
Last point I'd like to make is regarding the film name. Like AB it packs a lot of meaning & perhaps some anarchist pointers for the real people out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another fantastic and amazing movie of DiCaprio and Winslet.,"Revolutionary Road, it's an amazing movie, because of some facts: First we need to analyze the title ('Revolutionary Road'), I think there's no doubt that the title is perfect for the movie, because Frank and April's life is like a revolution, the ideas they've got aren't from 1950's people: dreaming about a different life, April wants to work and Frank doesn't, the abortion...things that aren't in line with the time.It's good to show that people had dreams and wanted to get them in these times.So it's positive. Next one of the best things in the movie is the different personalities of the characters, how they try to coexist with each other. Like April and Frank's personalities, they are opposites, this is why their lives end badly (remember April's death) and they cannot be happy (remember the way they treat their children), so they try to live in another reality, in a fictitious reality, which is not the real life, and they try to get their own dreams doing everything they can (like the abortion, to travel to Paris) but they can't, then is just all wrong, then the differences between them and the discussions appear. To combine and focus these types of personalities is a very difficult job, so I want to congratulate Sam Mendes who's an excellent director.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Glass Half Empty,"Unless we are terminally ill, prisoners of war or unemployed in the Third World, we usually have at least two ways to look at our situation in life. The couple in this film, who were apparently created by a book author, not a screenwriter or director, chose the ""glass half empty"" way. 
They had a beautiful home, healthy children, friends, and youth, but they were miserable because they thought life was supposed to be more romantic.
I don't think their dream of that way of life is illegitimate or stupid. There are people who live in bohemian cities, toil in the arts and don't have children, and that may be a satisfying way to go. I believe that these people could have made other choices besides marriage, kids, and suburban life. But that's what they chose.
Having said that we don't see any depiction of activities in the suburbs beyond the basics. Yet suburban people often do volunteer work, have multiple hobbies, go to church, and get into the city for the arts when they can. All of those things alleviate whatever inherent boredom comes with the territory.
All these people do is dwell on their misery. 
These dark commentaries on suburban life often focus on Godless sorts. People who believe that their own daily existence is the center of the universe often get disappointed when they realize that it's not. But they have nothing to fill the void. 
It's true what the other reviewers said that we didn't get much in the way of initial character development, but we did get a few basics and we heard more later. I thought the acting was good, but the scenes with the disturbed son of their realtor were too frequent and too heavy handed. They should have had one good scene of dialogue with him and left it at that. He was excruciating to watch. 
Don't be so sure that the film makers or author are mocking the 50s or suburbia. Through their characters they explain the pointlessness of thinking that some other romantic life is out there. For most of us this is all there is and that's o.k. The 50s or any time are what we make of them. None of the immoral decisions that people make in this film are considered cool. We see the guilt and anguish in those who commit them.
There's actually some great dialog including statements about immaturity, the annoying nature of over-talking and over-analyzing, and the fact that the grass is not always greener somewhere else.

Well performed downer!  Insightful...........?,"This movie has elicited many ""10s"" and lots of ""2s"" from our trusty IMDb readers. That is always interesting to me. A performance is called ""bad community theater"" stuff by one viewer, others hail the movie's performances as ""great"".I'm guessing that the depressing nature of watching a suburban couple bemoan their seemingly OK life, and the internal strife of that conflict, is insightful for most, painful for some and irritating for a few.I generally watch movies to be enlightened, entertained or educated. I'd be hard pressed to say this movie did any of those. But, I was enthralled by the performances, which I considered to be as good as they get. A scene of the corporate ""clones"" departing the 'burbs for their corporate jobs was sensationally filmed, stunning in is scope and set the tone for the ""robotic"" view of suburban life the author/director chose to hang their story on. But this point of view is not enlightening. Kate and Leo, as the struggling suburban couple, argue with the intent to injure, but after reflection, seem to still have the core of affection that originally brought them together. They fight hard, re-group, create a plan to break away and then deteriorate again as the plan slips away.It's not much of a plan. Quit their present life and head to Paris. She'll work, he'll find himself! Other than they are not the ""special"" people Kate envisioned they would be, there isn't much to escape from. Is Leo droning out a living? Sure, who didn't! It was post-war USA. But then he's offered a promotion that seems a bit exciting to him, so maybe things are looking up. Kate can't even verbalize what makes them ""special"" and why they should escape their ""trapped"" life, other than they just should.I felt the movies' ""big cheat"", was the role of Kathy Bates' son. An accomplished mathematician, he is deemed different, institutionalized and apparently brutalized. He has had 64 shock treatments for a condition that doesn't appear to warrant such drastic treatment. But, that's life in the 50's. Offbeat is insane. But, he is presented as the person with the real insight! Is it the author's point that 64 shock treatments help see life more clearly. The character gives us the key insightful line in the movie when he proclaims that many admit to the emptiness of suburban life, but that ""it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" In his only other scene he makes a proclamation to Kate that seals the movie's final fate. Perhaps his unfiltered take on life makes the character viable, but I thought it was too extreme, too convenient. And the use of ex-marital activity by both was intriguing. In both cases it was to feel something, anything!But, I'm babbling. The movie was a well performed downer. We watch a painful slice of life. In fact, if you get the DVD make sure to watch the deleted scenes. The director may have left an Academy Award nomination for DeCaprio on the cutting floor.

How revolutionary can you be?,"I still have the anguish and distress in my stomach. The same I had when the movie was over and the same I had when I went to bed that night.Leonardo Di Caprio still looks like the same kid as in Titanic, always good-looking and elegant, but now making the biggest effort to convince us that he is a great actor. The truth is that he is. There is nothing much to prove...I didn't know much about the movie and never read the book before. My choice was purely based in the quality of the actors and director and maybe a trailer I had seen previously. Fortunately 100 minutes later I was seating with the impression of having seen one of the best movies of the year.A movie that can describe the suffocation of living a life full of conventionalisms and the frustration from dealing with the impossibility of getting rid of them. Any argument from the Wheeler's in the 50's can be the exact same argument from the Johnson's in the 00's in a suburb anywhere. But ""Revolutionary Road"" is not only the typical story of a couple who buys a house, has kids, goes out with the friendly neighbor's and one day starts asking ""what are we doing around here?""...Seems like no one knows the answer except a magnificent character, a neighbor's son who has a psychiatric problem.

Amazing,"Revolutionary Road is the new powerful drama from Sam Mendes. It starts off with April and Frank first meeting, they meet at a party and they start to have a conversation. She wants to be actress, but it turns out that she isn't that great, and Frank finds that out while watching one of her plays. Many years pass and it shows Frank at work, he's not too happy with his job, and apparently he's not too happy with his marriage because he starts to have an affair with one of the girls at his work. But then he goes home to find his wife and kids were throwing him a little 30th birthday party. But Frank and April are both sick of their current life, so after talking with each other they decide they need a new life and plan to move to Paris. Frank then starts to fade away from the idea once he gets offered a better job at his current work place, and then they find out something else that ultimately makes them stay in their current life. April isn't happy with this life though and she really can't stand this life anymore. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Kathy Bates, David Harbour, Kathryn Hahn, and Michael Shannon all star in this incredible drama.The acting from the entire cast is incredible; I don't think there was even one bad acting moment from anyone in the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio shines out of this cast the best by far, I wouldn't be surprised if he wins 'Best Actor' at this year's academy awards, and I'm going to be upset if he doesn't at least get nominated because he definitely deserves it. He really stood out in once scene alone when he's fighting and arguing with Kate Winslet's character. Kate Winslet was also amazing, not quite as amazing as DiCaprio though, I can definitely see her getting nominated for 'Best Actress' though, I'm not sure I see her winning though, I could be surprised though. Kathy Bates was great for the parts she was in, she constantly appears throughout the whole movie, and the scenes she was in were great though. David Harbour was also really good; I really liked his character in this though, just the stuff that happened with his character was great. Kathryn Hahn was good, her character seemed to really freak me out though, just the smile that she had on her face throughout the movie. Michael Shannon was the best out of the cast after DiCaprio and Winslet though, I've seen him in some small roles before but I never really noticed that he had great acting though. I mean his role in this was pretty small too, but the parts he was in were just amazing, I was completely blown away by his acting. His character was supposed to be messed up in the head though, and he did a great job showing it.The story for this was great; it started off a little slow though IMO. Some of this really reminded me of American Beauty, I think if you liked American Beauty you should check this one out, because it wasn't like exactly the same thing or anything, but the concept was sort of like American Beauty. I was glued to the movie right up until the last 25 minutes or so, I mean I think this has one of the best and most emotional scenes that I've ever seen in the movie, and it was towards the end. But I feel after that scene, the ending just gets dry right up until the last 5 minutes or so, and then it really got me interested in it again. I didn't mind that the ending was dry much though, because the rest of the movie before that really made up for the dry ending. The acting sort of stole the show from the story though, but that doesn't mean the story was bad or anything, just that the acting was amazing.Overall I absolutely loved it, I think this is probably tied with The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button as my second favorite movie of the year, but I still have quite a few movies to see from this year first though, so that may be flip flopping around some. Also like Benjamin Button, I think this is probably going to make it somewhere between the 20 and 30 spot in my favorites list. I think in the end I may end up liking this more than Benjamin Button though because I'm pretty sure that this will have a better rewatchabilty standard than Benjamin Button. This has to be like my favorite movie from Sam Mendes, I'd have to re-watch American Beauty and Road To Perdition just make sure though, but I'm still pretty sure. This for me actually lived up to the hype, because I was hyping myself up to watch this a little because I thought the trailer looked amazing and it definitely deserved it. I can also definitely see this snagging 'Best Picture' at the academy awards this year though, but if you're one of the ones lucky enough to have this playing at a theater near you, I suggest you go and see it before it leaves because it's definitely worth the price of an admission price.9.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely a ROMDRAM!  Not what I was expecting though!,"It was very well acted and it certainly pertained to real lifestyles way back in those days, when times were tough, money was minimal, birth control was limited (I know, I'm a child from a parent that grew up with 12 other children-the baby booming era), but yet choices were plentiful. The settings were phenomenal, exactly to that decade. I even remember the plexi-glass partitions that separated each office cubicle. But the great cinematography had all the old cars in the driveways and in drive-bye's as well. The types of suits and clothes they wore and the aprons all reminded me of that era. This movie has all the emotions covered, most of them. It's worth watching! It's a solid 7 Star movie because even though it was not predictable, it was really good.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely dreadful,"I really wanted to like this movie. Felt like a great take on the Broken American Dream. Instead however, I felt like killing myself at the end. Sure these people both felt stuck but seriously... Maybe I am just a stronger person. I have been there and was able to pull myself out of a rut and am better for it. However, these 2... I don't know it just seemed terribly depressing and wrong. There were so many ways they could have fixed their situation. But it is hard to feel sorry for them. They had a wonderful house, wonderful family, and sure they may have been a bit hindered by the children. But my God. I really wish they would have been poor, uneducated, and maybe even some type of refugees. Then I could have perhaps seen a bit of reason to feel sorry. Towards the middle I was hoping they would shoot each other. Terrible movie. I hope the book was better. Don't get me wrong. I don't need the happy ending to a movie. I actually like the spin when there is a bad ending. But in the end it was just a bad movie ending worse.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quick review,"This is a slightly weird movie. It has a feeling of being written and acted for the stage, and Leonardo is very good, as you might expect, but Kate falls down because of her poor American accent. They seem to have pretty good chemistry, and I would rate this much higher if it were not for the accent business. This is where my review ends. I don't have any more to say about it but am apparently required to write at least 10 lines, which is kind of annoying. Not having 10 lines worth of material doesn't necessarily mean your review is not worthwhile. Now I'm going to have to think of all sorts of useless junk to write here, and possibly have my account blocked. But if that's the way the cookie crumbles, so be it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"A riveting story of a suburban couple coping with America's postwar prosperity and the myriad opportunities it presents, amid the evolving roles of men and women. Typically, the duty of the man was to be realistic in getting a good paying job in the city that he didn't particularly like but did for the higher purpose of being a ""good provider,"" while the duty of the woman was to be a good wife and mother, supervising a healthy upbringing for her children, supporting and encouraging her husband, shopping, homemaking, preparing meals and organizing a social life. It's the implicit duty of the mass egalitarian state to provide for the personal happiness of its subjects. The thought of breaking the mold breaks the ""revolutionaries"" here. A riveting story with superb performances by the principals as well as the supporting cast, it's an excellent picture that should be considered along with Rod Serling's masterpiece, ""Patterns.""

"""Mediocre ReUnion For A Dream Pair""","""Revolutionary Road"" is a drama film about a couple whose lives spiral out of control owing to compulsions of life putting restraint on their desires to live a free and uncomplicated life, something not achieved.Cast wise, Excellent. Leo and Kate give their best to their respective roles but at moment, the acting seems a bit stretched and over done. But the core of the movie has to be Kate Winslet, who brings on screen a very mesmerizing performance worthy of awards. Rest chips in well.""Revolutionary Road"" strength lies in its casting. Story wise, nothing much to tell. It weakens itself in the Screenplay, Editing And Direction part. Frankly, the Screenplay could have been better and the Editing with Direction doesn't help raise the movie beyond the level of an Average movie. It's Kate Winslet who elevate the movie, barring the negative aspects.Overall, ""Revolutionary Road"" is a One Time Watch movie. Also, it's difficult to like and dislike the movie simultaneously. But I believe the dream pair of Kate And Leo could have reunited for a better movie than this mediocre piece of work.My Verdict : 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revolutionary Road,"This is a fairly unremarkable family drama that sees ""April"" (Kate Winslet) staying at home with their two children whilst husband ""Frank"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) goes to work in his office each day - and has the occasional fling with his secretary. ""April"" is probably best described as a frustrated actress and her last stage performance went down a bit like a lead balloon which caused the latest in this couple's fiery rows. She decides that they need a profound change, and so suggests that they decamp to Paris. She will get a job and he can spend his time, reading, writing - generally lolling about looking after the kids. They announce this plan to the world, but no sooner than they they do, their lives become even more unsettled and a maelstrom of turmoil, resentment and loathing starts to emerge - one that clearly illustrates that all is not well, psychologically with ""April. The story really only comes alive when Michael Shannon takes centre screen. His performance as the emotionally charged ""John"" delivers well as the man who has an insightful ability to call a spade a spade - regardless of whom he hurts with his typically near the mark observations. It's all a bit long, slow and there's a great deal of dialogue that doesn't seem to advance the story nor the characters especially. Indeed at times this is really just a series of a good looking and stylishly photographed mid-life crises that is set in 1950s America, but could easily be anywhere else. A few familiar faces pepper the undercast, and the intimate scenes with DiCaprio and Winslet are effective at times, but I found this a little too much like a soap for me. Worth a watch - I'm not certain what the revolutionary element was, though.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Most of us live on Revolutionary Road,"I could watch the wonderful Kate Winslett read a cook book aloud and not be bored, but what's the purpose of this film? I would imagine 7 out of 10 Americans live in one way or another on their own version of Revolutionary Road. When there's no particular struggle to obtain food or shelter one is left pondering the meaning of life and why one is so dissatisfied with one's lot. It's the middle class curse.There is nothing special about this film or, I expect, the book on which it is based.

"Dark, depressing and completely unrewarding","If you like to watch mundane, depressing people lament over their lives for two hours, you are in for a real treat. Bringing out morbid and highly unattractive performances from Hollywood actors seems to be Sam Mendes' strength, and in Revolutionary Road he has outdone himself. The characters in American Beauty are all sweet-as-pie, angelic beings of light compared to the protagonists here. There is no payoff  it's just two hours of cringing. Nothing beautiful is expressed, nothing valuable is preached, nothing heartening is communicated. I would sooner watch a 3 year old throw an hour long temper tantrum than sit through this again.",,Anonymous,Romance
Story of a tragic marital discord,"This lesser known 2008 movie starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio was on my watch list for some time. The movie is in direct contrast to the 1997 "" Titanic"" in many ways. Here they play a married couple with two kids whose marriage has gone sour due to their conflicting ambitions and desires. Kate is disappointed that she could not make it as an actress while Leo is not too happy with his sales job. Kate makes an impulsive decision to relocate to Paris and gets Leo to agree but her pregnancy and his promotion become major stumbling blocks in their plans. This also puts their marriage on the rocks as they argue and keep quarreling bitterly. Apparently for them there is no solution in sight.Veteran director Sam Mendes has a simple script on marital discord at hand and he is able to convert it into an immensely watchable emotional story. It helps that he has two seasoned artists playing the main roles. Scenes of their meltdown are well enacted. All three have pooled in their talents to create absorbing cinema. As it happens with such serious plots ,there are a few moments where the narrative drags but the good acting more than makes up for it. It is a worthwhile visit to this emotional story of family discord.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Mixed Bag of Brilliance and Flaws,"25 January 2009. ""Revolutionary Road"" is easily one of the more complex and inconsistently brilliant movies flecked with flaws this year. It is both stunning and irritatingly frustrating in its delivery. From the beginning ""Revolutionary Road"" recklessly and immediately jumps into an overly quick and much too brief a dive into a passionate relationship between Leo DeCarpio and Kate Winslet and then cuts to Kate Winslet's somewhat questionable but deliberate performance on stage as her character's ambition as an actress. Suddenly we are then transported into the future where we see our ""perfect couple"" with the requisite two children who seem to be conveniently missing for most of this movie. There are snatches of what seem to be flashbacks in order to provide some meaningful continuity and emotional connections which may have been better suited to a linear chronological presentation (as the flashbacks seem to disappear a third of the way into the movie). Kathy Bates is wonderful in the first half of this movie with her nuanced performance.The plot, screenplay attempts to be strong and edgy and at times it appears to succeed, yet some of the dialogue, especially the heated arguments between Leo and Kate seem awkward and artificial at times. Nevertheless, the substantive plot points are solid and meaningfully presented as difficult dramatic elements that are successfully performed on screen. Yet for all the dazzle and flash, it is difficult to believe that the values and implicit directorial outcome of this movie might not be stained with a dislocated overlay of contemporary 21st Century morality over the actual 50s mentality and value system.In order to make his big point and climax in the movie somewhat like ""American Beauty"" (1999), ""Revolutionary Road"" has its big scene that is not quite as satisfying because the movie continues on trying to make a statement and tie up some loose connections that even begins to resemble a horror film ending where the whole experience could repeated over again and again. While the basic statement of this movie might be legitimate, it doesn't necessarily seem consistent with the reality of the 50s and the outcome and some of the script appear to be more dramatized and made up and imposed on the societal norms of the 50s.Who is ""crazy"" in this movie is an interesting question. Whether childish, rash notions of finding oneself here or elsewhere is the point and whether one can actually find one's self by relocating somewhere else without first examining one's inner demon's first is questionable. Overall, this movie is powerful, compelling, but appears tainted by some questionable editing decisions (one brief scene where Kate Winslet is looking away from her house instead of at it after a flashback regarding how wonderful the house seemed to reduce the emotional flow of the scene), some questionable dialogue choices and arguments that feel somewhat flat, and the imposition of basic premises regarding the culture of the 50s our assuming we can impose our beliefs of today onto it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Art imitates life...I think I'm gonna be sick...,"The setting indeed takes place in the 50's but this story relates to me in a modern setting.I Agreed, much of this movie is hard to watch, it encompasses the ugly side of human spirit, and emotions that just wrench your heart. I did not realize the Director was Sam Mendes of American Beauty, another timeless classic. His ability to exploit the dark under belly of people is present throughout . At the time of viewing I kept asking myself why is this feel so emotionally charged in a sadistic way?. (It was clearer in hindsight.) The story commanded your attention. I could not look away. I was obligated and compelled to watch the story unfold. The movie is superbly presented,and the acting is top-notched. The feelings of love and hate and disgust I had for Kate and Leo. I don't think this was their best work but they make a fabulous duo,I never felt this movie was trying to hard to be real. This movie reminds me of a past relationship I had. A very real fiasco with two children ,mental illness, abuse, sad times, happy times vs bad times, and the bad times mainly won. The movie is so dark and emotion so raw and in your face. My stomach turns just watching this film. During the film I felt I was stuck back in this painful relationship. I was a bit relieved when the movie finally ended and I could walk away. This movie left me emotionally spent. The supporting cast are the diamonds in the rough,especially Michael Shannon ,who in my opinion stole the show.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An emotional drama of life, love, showing the ups and downs of marriage proving it's a roller coaster ride.","""Revolutionary Road"" an emotional drama and true it's not everyone's cup of tea still the film is well done and enough of an emotional drama to make it a watch for most especially married couples. Based and adapted from Richard Yates's novel director Sam Mendes takes a haunting and close look at marriage in 1950's Connecticut living the American dream in the suburbs. Meet April and Frank Wheeler(and again the chemistry between Winslet and Dicaprio is top notch maybe better than ""Titantic""). And they are the perfect young couple already with two young children. Both have unlimited promise April is an aspiring stage actress and Frank works a good job as a sales rep in the city. Both want big dreams to happen as they plan this after they move into their house on ""Revolutionary Road"". Yet as is so common with many couples they find the struggles of trust and most of all they feel trapped in a world of coded convention. Then it's the lying and the lack of faith and the behind the back cheating that surely enough leads to explosive problems for the Wheelers.Yet April(in one of Kate's strongest performances)wants to start over again by leaving Connecticut for the confines of exotic Paris, France. As expected Frank's heart isn't in it and this leads to extremes especially for April as she will push herself over the edge. Overall I found this nothing great yet, it's worth a watch for the performance of Winslet especially who's very strong and a must see for Kate and Leo fans. Still most couples and especially married ones can relate well to this film as it's proves and shows married life is never easy especially when each see different paths it proves that marriage is clearly a roller coaster ride and no bed of roses.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Trouble in Paradise. American Beauty:1953,"I am m not sure if I want to recommend Revolutionary Road even though, it is a very well-made picture directed by the creator of American Beauty and shot by Roger Deakins. The film reminds American Beauty with almost identical shots, POVs, even with the way the music creates tension, and most of all with the similarities in the subject matter. You can view the film as Sam Mendes's return to explore the territory and to perform dissection of the phenomena called American Suburbia once again and to prove that there never was peace and idyll in the quiet suburban paradise, nor in the end of the 90s, neither in the beginning of the 50s, during the age of hopes and innocence. Or, maybe, we should not try to look too closely, and the movie is not about the epoch, but one unhappy family of a man whose job is uninspiring (but pays the bills) and a frustrated, disappointed, unstable woman.Acting is superb and confirms that DiCaprio and Winslet are among the best if not the best actors of their generation. But with all said, Revolutionary Road - one of the most difficult to watch films I've seen in a long time. The story of a young family from American suburbia who had lived their American dream but at some instant became exhausted with the monotony of their exemplary life, made me annoyed and even angry with them. What is wrong with those people, what makes them so unbearably unhappy, and why should I suffer for two hours, listening to hysterical cries and observing a storm in a glass of water? Why do they hate their lives so much? Am I to believe that never was a story of more woe than of the husband who has to go to work to support his family while his wife stays home taking care of their nice house and the children? She is restless, she feels trapped, she wants to change their lives, to make a clean cut, to go and start all over in Paris. Well, I have a surprise for her: change of venue would not make anyone happy if they can't find readiness to be happy inside themselves. If they can't be grateful for what they already achieved and what they are blessed with - strength, youth, energy, two nice and healthy children.It does not mean that I deny films about unhappy families, not at all. Mendes' debut, American Beauty - one of my favorite films from the 90s. Perhaps, because it perfectly mixed tragic and humorous, drama and dark comedy. Or, perhaps, because in American Beauty, we had a chance to get acquainted with several characters, not with one but two unhappy families, to know and to understand them. Revolutionary Road - is the film about April and Frank and it concentrates on them only. This is the strength of the film as well as its weakness. Winslet and DiCaprio inhabited their characters, two little-interesting, selfish, ordinary people and played them so well that observing them for two hours has turned into difficult task. Their misery which they brought upon themselves is suffocating. Not just for them but for the viewers, also.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Much too dull, and much too drawn out","I saw the trailer for ""Revolutionary Road"" while at the cinema for a different film, and I must stress that, the trailer alone had me blown away -- the potential of the story, the cast, even the beautiful Nina Simone piece in the background. Unfortunately the film did not live up to that beautifully crafted trailer but instead left me disappointed and empty.Let me say, though, that the cast was so remarkable, and of course Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio have an excellent and believable chemistry. Winslet delivers a wonderful performance, as did DiCaprio, although I must admit her performance overshadowed his by a long shot. Although I felt that DiCaprio was superb in his more intense scenes, other times when he was just playing a ""normal guy"" he was rather dull and almost corny. I felt that he didn't know how to act like a ""guy from the 50s"", and was left torn between two directions.Secondly, I felt that the film was much too drawn out, and often during scenes it felt repetitious. There was nothing new or interesting between long periods of time, in terms of -- well -- everything. The dialog was the same, the character's reactions to each other were the same, even the settings and scenery never changed. When there's nothing interesting, I don't understand how as the audience we should be -- well -- interested.I give this film a 5/10 for a great cast and fine acting. But otherwise, I did not enjoy it. Although there was substance, it just wasn't enough. It was much too dull, and much too drawn out.",,Anonymous,Romance
Redefining Marriage,"The very first thought come to my mind after watching this film is, if that was what marriage all about, I'd rather choose to stay alone quietly.

With the consciousness of getting far away from the initial goal of life, they feel desperate and decide to leave, start over at where their dreams begin. However, it was once again being proved, reality comes bigger than everything.

When roses dry,"How do you dissect a seemingly perfect relationship? How thin is the line between love and hate? Danny DeVito attempted an answer to these questions in ""The War of the Roses"". So did Roman Polanski in the controversial ""Bitter Moon"". Director Sam Mendes not only answers these questions but goes on to prove that every relationship feeds expectations, but the real question is how much are you willing to compromise to keep those ever so minute cracks from growing on that all too perfect wedding portrait.Hypothetically speaking, what if a couple of young lovers where to survive a massive ship wreck over the icy Atlantic, get married, and settle down in middle class suburbia. What would their marriage seem like somewhere around the dreaded seven year itch? With absolutely no reference to the ""Titanic"", Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are cast together again, this time as Frank and April Wheeler, a perfect couple in the eyes of friends and neighbors. Frank is an average nine to fiver at a city office and April is a homemaker aspiring to be an actress. While the possibility of living the American dream seem far out of reach, the Wheeler's plan on moving to Paris for what would hopefully be a much better life. April would find a good job to support the family while Frank would reflect on his true calling. Though a simple plan, negative vibes soon start to tear the very fabric of their relationship. Some of these include disapproving and jealous neighbors, severely bruised egos and even the slight case of infidelity. To make matters worse, April conceives for the third time, throwing the metaphorical spanner into the works, turning what was once love and adoration into utter loathing.DiCaprio and Winslet does it again. A power house performance by the two leads would be an understatement, given this film was nominated for three Oscars amongst other nominations and awards. Add to that an ensemble lineup of supporting roles from Kathryn Hahn, David Harbour, Michael Shannon and even Kathy Bates (also starred in the Titanic). Film noir fans will welcome this remarkable movie from Sam Mendes, especially after his dark tale of a dysfunctional family in ""American Beauty"".Couples watching this movie will find it hard to take sides.

It is dangerous to fantasize and attach so much to something ( in this case an expectation for happiness) and obsess that it must happen no matter what. Life never goes as we plan. We should be aware of it. We should accept it. This is what I think this movie tries to show us and teach us.

Sam Mendes does a fantastic job of directing and the film is beautifully shot with amazing lighting in many of the scenes. In fact it's the setting itself that gives the intensity to much of the film with the house and Frank's job been oppressive to the point where the viewer is desperate for them both to escape. DiCaprio and Winslet are sublime and their chemistry sizzles on screen. The supporting cast are fabulous with Michael Shannon stealing his scenes as the son of Mrs Givings. All through this film you feel the quiet desperation of a couple who love and loathe each other at the same time and who don't know how to resolve either one of those things.

Sam Mendes manages to deliver another film that manages to be reflective and a portrait of an era with an important social criticism,"Based on the novel by Richard Yates published in 1961. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty (1999), Road To Perdition (2002), Jarhead (2005)) tells the story of the couple Frank and April and like them, unhappily married, came to extremes to try recmeçar his life in another place, away from everything. Mendes is responsible for bringing back one of the most famous couples in film history in Titanic (1997), who until recently was responsible for the highest grossing of all time.50 years. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) are a happy couple. He is an insurance salesman dissatisfied with their jobs, although reasonable salary allows him to sustain a comfortable life for his wife April (Winslet) and her two children. She is a frustrated actress who failed career and became a stay-at-home. They always felt special and ready to lead a life following ideals. When moving to a house on Revolutionary Road, a suburb of New York, they are proud to declare independence from the suburban inertia that surrounded them. There are a couple of neighbors, work colleagues Frank in an office in New York, and the realtor Helen Givings (Kathy Bates), who sold them the house and visit often alongside her husband (Richard Easton) and son John (Michael Shannon), a former mathematician who suffered at the hands of mental treatments of the time. But soon they realize that they are becoming precisely what would not be. Frank is in the trivial and is afraid of everything, while April is an unhappy housewife. Determined to change the situation, proposes that April start all over again, leaving aside the comfort of home and starting today in Paris. Only, to execute this plan, they arrive at their extremes. Although beautiful landscapes, there is a huge void that makes the couple want to swap one doldrums for a life more exciting with adventure, and this would be achieved, according to them, going to Paris where she worked as a secretary in a government agency and he could study and work on something that was pleasing. This courageous decision provokes envy and admiration around the circle of friends of the couple, and the reality soon brings them back to life.Who is in charge of the screenplay adaptation is Justin Haythe (The Clearing (2004)) that tells the story in the first half of a non-linear, with the main characters and supporting cast that will be part of the events. Haythe creates a script able to study in depth the problems for which a couple of middle clase passes when the fire of passion ends and the routine will gradually dominating the couple without notice. The theme has always existed and will continue to exist. In the film, a typical American family is portrayed. The art direction of Terri Carriker-Thayer, John Kasarda and Nicholas Lundy builds the appropriate setting with typical large houses, with their green lawns, the lack of fences between neighboring houses, the classic swing on the tree, so common among this class U. S.. They perform a great job in recreating period both in outdoor environments, especially as inside houses and facades. All vehicles, house styles, which combined with the costumes Albert Wolsky, let's all very believable.The script, if one hand knows discussing the hypocrisy of society in the 50s for the ""American Way of Life"", fails to successfully give dynamism to the events. Is sure to show the doldrums of married life, you need a camera without movement on unimportant tasks, but the movie ends up not progressing their events. Not much really important or causing any reviravlta happens all the time. The pace of the film is very still all the time, and the plot is predictable. The script manages to shock in certain situations, especially at its end, but the slowness of the story itself ends up not working so well in film and in the book which was adapted. Another factor that could be exploited better the lives of the couple before the wedding. Would be even sharper and shocking the drastic change that routine has brought to their lives by killing their wills over the years.Sam Mendes shows masterfully life dull, routine and without emotion experienced by the couple. To do so, he uses long shots, slow, no background music in the house. Another scene that shows well the life you are leading is punctual, showing Frank going to work. He descends from the train in the middle of hundreds of other workers like him. They are all dressed the same, giving the distinct impression that the people who watch Frank is equal to the other. And there is nothing more frustrating for someone who thinks especially find it's just another in the crowd and nothing special.The interpretation of the protagonists is essential for us to believe in the drama of the couple. DiCaprio and Winslet managed to put out during the film the image of Jack and Rose from Titanic, and showed that since then evolved in other activities, especially the heartthrob. Long ago, DiCaprio proves to be a great actor and delivers a powerful performance in the construction of this man unhappy in his marriage and his job, and ends up having to give in to society's rules. He is more mature and secure as ever. Already Kate Winslet is not far behind. April has to live with the fact of being a failed actress, to lead a depressing life. She hates your marriage, your family and your neighbors. And think of that leak site could represent the change needed for the couple reunited happiness. Another adjuvant that has highlighted is the Oscar-nominated for his performance in this work, Michael Shannon, who gives life to John Givings, who suffered with the treatments he underwent. John has the character's function criticize dilemmas by Frank and April so acidic and direct. He is the one who encourages the couple to pursue his dream. Unfortunately, the character ends up appearing bit during the movie and his lines often seem forced. The interaction of John, his mother and his father with the couple seems purposely placed the script so there is such criticism by John.Already a photograph of nine-time Oscar nominee Roger Deakins, explores very beautiful locations in all planes, and knows compose screen with the appropriate colors. Are used more neutral colors, like red and nothing flashy. These colors do not show let life pass the unhappy marriage of the couple in a good part of the projection. Only at the beginning, when they are still at the beginning of the relationship, some more cheerful colors can be noticed. Add to the reconstruction of perfect season, the soundtrack once again impeccable Thomas Newman, who had previously collaborated with Sam Mendes in American Beauty (1999), Road To Perdition (2002) and Jarhead (2005), in addition to composing track of how many successful The Green Mile1999) and Finding Nemo (2003). Newman uses periods of silence, the noise amplification and a strong track at key moments throughout the film.Sam Mendes manages to deliver another film that manages to be reflective and a portrait of an era. With good script and technically perfect, Mendes gives a lesson in directing actors. The sensitivity in the conduct of the dramas of the couple who will increasingly funneling is noticeable in the first few scenes.

Boring & Pointless!,"I haven't read the book but I'm assuming that the book is way better than the movie for it to be made into one. A lot of times novels fail to make a good movie and this one is one of them.Maybe if the movie were a true story, I would have appreciated it and felt the message it's trying to convey but this movie is just unrealistic and pointless. It's sad that DiCaprio and Winslet accepted a script like that.Moreover, the movie is slow and gets you bored. The whole time I kept convincing myself that it will lead to a really good part which will make the story useful and interesting in the end.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Five-star review,"Having read about the plot, I really didn't want to watch Sam Mendes' ""Revolutionary Road."" But I figured that in light of an article I'm writing, I should see it because both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are lauded for their performances. It was just that the concept -- two people stuck in the American suburbs in the 1950s and hating their lives and taking it out on each other -- struck me as possibly the most boring thing in the world.I was wrong. *Watching a movie* about two people stuck in the American suburbs in the 1950s and hating their lives and taking it out on each other is the most boring thing in the world.I feel fortunate that I was watching it at home and could multitask on other things while it was playing. Otherwise it would have been two precious hours of my life completely wasted. As it was, I got to brush my dogs, trim their nails, vacuum my living room, and write letters to four friends.I give these activities five stars, the movie none.",,Anonymous,Romance

Intense psychological drama,"This movie is incredible. It is much a cross between Labute's ""In the Company of Men"" and Mamet's ""Oleana"". If you are a fan of either of these movies you will likely love this movie. However, if, like most others, you haven't seen either of them then ask yourself if your idea of a good time is watching two intelligent people in a state of existential dread over the meaninglessness and routine nature of life rip either other apart verbally in the fashion of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe"". If not, avoid this film.Like DiCaprio's early work with DeNiro in ""This Boy's Life"" this film is all about an intellectuals struggle to find his voice to carve out a life, to follow his dreams, or to give up and accept the forces that, Mendes' so vividly relates, tend to move us to obscurity and mediocrity. Namely waking up to a life in a job you hate, with 2.3 kids and living in suburbia filled with routine drudgery and your typical 50's June Cleaver types as neighbors. It is depressing. It is painful to watch. Yet it says so much about the daily grind that so many of us go through. We run the rat race, move up the ladder... but for what?? To one day find out that all our childhood dreams are only that... dreams that have faded away with the new day.Without giving away details about this movie, let me just say it is like a couple on the brink of divorce going to see a world renown therapist. Once in the office, the man relates an intricate story to the therapist detailing all his wife's failings. The therapist nods and agrees and the man feels validated. Then the wife takes the floor detailing all the ways her husband has let her down. Again the therapist nods and agrees with all her points. At this the man jumps in and says... ""You said I was right... Now you are saying my wife is right. We can't both be right."" Again the therapist nods and agrees.Similarly, this movie is all about the delicate nature of truth. Some of us devote our live's to it. Other's dummy ourselves down in order to live in peace with those close to us. We tell little white lies to protect those we love... but lies build and soon we are lying to ourselves and have lost our moral compass. Some of us are so devoted to our version of the truth that we seem crazy and are committed to a mental hospital... but truly there is a thin line between genius and insanity and this movie all takes place along that line.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
revolutionary road is a street,"I like dramas. Good dramas make me smile because obviously they're so fascinating to see. But this one here, I don't know. It didn't achieve its purpose. It was like a tragedy. The more to the ending, the more story got depressing. But when I shun that, the movie itself was built really well. Storytelling was quite good one. This picture takes place in 50's, so the art-direction for the movie is very auspicious. There have been done some remarkable job.Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors. Leo and Kate Winslet haven't been in a same movie since Titanic back in 97'. Their reunion for this frustrating movie is the best outcome from it. They both give good performances, but as you could guess, there's no great destiny here for them too. Some couples just look good, but it doesn't mean they last forever.Leo and Kate live in a nice white house which is located in Revolutionary Road. At first, I thought the title means the 'road' a young couple are going through, but I was way wrong. It's actually just a street name. But revolutionary for sure.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Brilliant Cast, Brilliant Film","There is a sort of hyper-reality to this film; Edward Hopper comes to mind as if the characters are stranded in a desert of their own making. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio give perfect performances as a once happy couple, and how life carries on and on and that nothing will ever ' happen ' to them again. Winslet comes up with the frantic idea that they must give up their lives in America and the ironically named ' Revolutionary Road ' that they live in to go and live in Paris. They have two children which are barely seen and a kind of horrific reality sets in when she becomes pregnant. No spoilers but the trap of so-called real life closes in and we the viewers get a glimpse of marital hell that I have rarely seen on screen before. Based on a great novel by Richard Yates it is a film that has to be seen, and I just wonder why I missed it in 2008, but am grateful to have caught up with it. Kathy Bates is also in the film and she kind of closes it with a terrible silence that is almost as terrible as the dropping of an atonic bomb. My one criticism is about the two sex scenes which lacked passion or authenticity. Against the hyper-realism of the rest of the film they were too brief ( a matter of seconds ? ) and dull. Sadly many directors are happy with emotional violence between couples, but almost totally fail with the life giving pleasure of sexuality.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely Not One To Be Missed,"Directed by Sam Mendes, this piece of great cinematography does not disappoint. Kate Winslet and Leanardo Di Caprio were yet again reunited on-screen to give another great performance (as expected). The duo delivered in this emotional and deep drama about life, family, happiness, dreams, hardships and most of all sacrificing for what is important. The film just goes to show what the realities of life are; that life can look and seem perfect until you look within yourselves and unless you're happy with who and where you are, nothing is perfect. The music, the script and the acting go so well hand-in-hand to create an accurate representation of that era. A great watch; definitely not one to be over-looked!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revolutionary Road was a revolution of emotion,"Revolutionary Road really touched me. I thought that the struggles and emotions were very real. Though this movie contained two amazing actors, the acting was just not believable for me. They were going through very difficult, heart wrenching times and I just did not care. The acting wasn't believable. I felt like they were trying too hard and maybe just couldn't connect to the emotion. Dicaprio and Winslet are two of my favorite actors but in Revolutionary Road, it just seemed like they were memorizing a script.I was kind of lost with the flash backs and flash forwards. I couldn't tell when they were flashing back because the actors always appear to be the same age. It was too subtle.The plot was very powerful. It was sad, sweet, and kind of inspiring. It rang true to the struggles two people can face together. I feel this film would have been more enjoyable if the actors connected with the plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

How honest can this movie be when the children are mere props?,"Hey, Hollywood, here's a question: If life is dull in the suburbs, as movies seem to contend, why doesn't it occur to filmmakers that movies set in the suburbs will be dull, too? Because they are. Revolutionary Road is yet another mildly decadent, inert melodrama exploring what writers seem to regard as soul-dead all-white suburbia (American Beauty, The Ice Storm, Little Children, Pleasantville, etc.).But dullness isn't this flick's only, or primary, problem. Dishonesty is. In fact, it's hard to say what the most dishonest part is. It might be plot devices like the two Wheeler offspring, who are treated as nothing more than props, yet we're supposed to believe that the third child will matter? Or the other plot device, the mentally ill mathematician, who seems to exist purely to say inflammatory things (he gets to, he's crazy) that let director Sam Mendes give Winslet and DiCaprio chances for histrionics.But I think the most dishonest thing is Winslet's character, April. A moody hypocrite with bleach-blonde hair and coal-black eyebrows, she baits her husband into drastically changing their lives by following an absurd pipe dream (she doesn't even research these ""secretarial jobs in Paris"" that she talks about), saying that moving to Europe is for his sake when obviously it's just as much, if not more, for her own.Clearly, we're supposed to have sympathy for April. That's what's dishonest, because nothing about her actions merits sympathy. Both April and Frank are unhappy in the 'burbs (what movie protagonist isn't?), but when Frank chooses to stay and face their responsibilities-- as well as tacitly admit that they aren't artists or writers or actors who have a Bohemian future in Paris-- April becomes a shrew. Along the way, she also contemplates a self-administered abortion (never mind the risks, or Frank's opinion, he's only her husband and the father). April is as selfish, callow and emotionally constipated as it is possible to be. For instance, whenever Frank wants to talk about little matters, like, oh, say, the fact their dinner party just broke up into a near fist-fight, or that she's taken to sleeping on the couch(!!), she retorts, ""Why do you want to discuss EVERYTHING all the time?"" Coward that she is, she wants to run away from her problems, to Paris; short of that, she walks away from her husband when he wants to work things out. I'm all in favor of walking away-- but from this movie, not from life's problems.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Complex and rewarding,"The theme of the authentic life was intellectually popular it the Fifties. Existentialism made it a movement: Sartre and De Beauvoir explored it: in her case more successfully, as she is a better writer.This film depends on the leads and DiCaprio has this in the bag: his performance is just ideal, a mix of hope and rage, He looks and sounds the part. Winslett is fine as April but her character is very complex and almost too ambiguous to really understand. She speaks in a strange and restrained manner which withholds her from the action. That is not to say it is wrong, but rather it is unusual in movie terms.In fact Winslett's April Wheeler is the crux of the story. It's hard to know whether their marriage is bad anyway, or if moving to Paris will solve anything. April Wheeler has creative instincts as shown early on by acting in a play, which are frustrated. Husband Frank Wheeler is like thousands of people who say they have a novel inside them but in fact they concede their vague and possibly vain ambitions by increments as they manage day to day life.It is a shame that this story ends badly as if they, and no one, can ever win the battle to escape the 'burbs, the job, the predictable and inauthentic business life.The device in this story of having a 'crazy person' tell the truth serves a plot purpose but is not very stylish in 1961, when the book was published.. Shakespeare used it, in having the fool tell kings about reality.Deakins's photography and Mendes's guidance are superb, the tone is right, as are the production qualities too. This film will provoke thoughts for a long time after.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful story telling of a failing marriage,"Superb performance by the leads draw the viewers into a not-so-unfamiliar suburban family drama. What makes the film so appealing is that it speaks directly to so many married couples. If we don't see resemblances of our lives in the film, we would see it in our friends' and relatives'.Through all the fights and drama, we alternatively sympathize with the husband and the wife. The great cast of neighbors enliven the story. The film leads the viewers on an emotional ride as April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) hit a rough patch, reconcile, then descend into further chaos. We are inclined to ""take side"" in the couple conflict, but as the story unfolds, who is responsible for the crumbling relationship and who is the strong one becomes less clear cut.The film beautifully explores the emotion and characters of a loving couple in crisis when both realized that they had fallen into domesticity and might be missing out on life (or maybe not). It leaves us pondering about the choices we've made and the life we've resigned to.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Captivating but not compelling,"'Revolutionary Road' is director Sam Mendes's second attempt (after 'American Beauty') at relating the insipid side and/or rotten underbelly of the ""idyllic"" American suburban middle-class life. It's livelier and more captivating, with characters that resemble real humans rather than cardboard cutouts, but it still misses the mark. I've not read the original novel and cannot comment on how well Justin Haythe's screenplay adapts the source material. Taken on its own terms, however, is not clear on what the film 'Revolutionary Road' wants to say: on what story it wants to tell or what moral it wants to relate.The problem is that the story doesn't establish a clear conflict to animate the narrative. Are April and Frank struggling against each other, against themselves or against the onerous demands of their perfect middle-American community? A case could be made for all three. I personally was left with the feeling that we had two ordinary folks trying to punch above their weight and prove that they were ""better"" than their folksier neighbors and making enemies unnecessarily.The problem is that the film lacks any subtext - either verbal or visual - to give clues as to the resolution of the conflict. The viewer can take away whatever point of view he wants about suburban life, about the bourgeois bohemian quest for ""something special,"" about Frank and April as people or even about the morality (or wisdom) of abortion. The ambiguity on both the literal and the metaphorical level feels like a cop-out, and we're left feeling as though we've swallowed a concoction that is rather less than the sum of its parts.The film manages to keep our attention thanks to decent cinematography - albeit one which does not exploit its 1950s period setting in a very imaginative way - and its two well-proven leads. Despite its thin plot, the script does at least attempt to paint two round if static characters, and the undeniable chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio is not wasted on blubbery utterances of each other respective flat love interest's first name. It's a tantilizing but ultimately unsatisfying piece of candy. Worth seeing if you like the lead stars; otherwise, steer clear.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The depression hit them hard especially when their plan to France has cancelled due to April's third pregnancy. She wanted to get abortion, but Frank got mad.

What a couple...,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch a couple in the mid-1950s trying to surpass their personal problems and at the same raising their children. It is obvious that the couple has a lot of problems since they aren't happy with each other and seems that everything is lost. After they realize that, the woman suggest to move to Paris for a brand new start.I liked this movie because it has an interesting plot and some very good interpretations made by its cast. I also liked the way that some problems of the couple were presented and how they tried to solve them. The direction which was made by Sam Mendes it was exceptional with many great scenes that made you feel that you were part of this movie and a friend of that couple, something that I found very important. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to mention Kate Winslet's who played as April Wheeler and she was simply outstanding. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Leonardo DiCaprio's who played as Frank Wheeler and Kathryn Hahn's who played as Milly Campbell.Finally, I have to say that ""Revolutionary Road"" is a nice movie with an interesting plot and some great interpretations.

What makes this film so fantastic is the details and the acting, which I have never seen so sincere in my life. Mendes must be given huge credit for letting the development of the characters happen in a continuous way, so that you never lose faith in your characters. His many descriptions of norms of society and the ways of implementing them in the movie are amazing as well. Truly one of the best directed films I've seen.

A woman's childish unrealistic demands are a road to hell in 50's era setting.,"This drama focuses primarily on Frank and Amy Wheeler, a married couple with two children that reach a crossroads when Amy completely loses her skull on an idea about moving to Paris, France as both the ultimate life achievement to match their goals and also the most pressing and important issue in front of them as a couple. Frank is going to Paris or else this insane woman is going to make his life a living hell. Poor Frank gets dragged down by his woefully insane and melodramatic wife's unfulfilled need for .. ? What we never really know, but Amy wants it, and it's in Paris, damnit. She has no money to take the family there, no ability to work there to finance the idea, but somehow it's FRANK's fault they are not in Paris yet. This woman just gets battier and battier as the movie goes on, which is an interesting juxtaposition against the good old 50's style of conformity. If you like watching Leonardo Di Caprio argue heatedly with his utterly insane yet well spoken wife, there's a lot of scenes of that here. A lot.Overall the characters are pretty well developed and the movie is shot well with some nice old cars, etc.. It didn't seem like they really knew how to end the movie properly; overall it was a well acted flick. The most interesting character is a fellow on leave from an insane asylum who talks with the couple.. he's essentially the voice in this Woman's head and an interesting character foil for her madness.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Empty and  Hollow,"Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio): ""You are an empty, empty, hollow shell of a woman. I mean, what the hell are you doing in my house if you hate me so much? Why the hell are you married to me? What the hell are you doing carrying my child? I mean, why didn't you just get rid of it when you had the chance? Because listen to me, listen to me, I got news for you - I wish to God that you had!""Nothing ""revolutionary"" about Revolutionary Road, a period piece about a '50's couple in decline after moving to the burbs. I can confirm the creatively deadening effect of moving from city to country, even at a time when the American Dream included lawns, garages, flower beds, and conventional neighbors. Director Sam Mendes gets it mostly right.Leo DiCaprio's Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet's April Wheeler dream the dream and act on it in 1955, he with a business sales job and she staying home with the two kids. Her epiphany that they should move to Paris eventually persuades him they are living a ""hopeless"" and ""empty"" suburban idyll. All this is the usual slam of the vapid 50's, yet Mendes brings his especially trenchant appreciation of America to the screen as he did in American Beauty, only here it is more realistic and less romantic.Mendes had the memorable red roses image in American beauty; he does it again with shots of Frank in his fedora going to work with all the other drones in fedoras. Mendes is helped by fine performances from his leads, whose universe has expanded considerably since they were on the deck of the Titanic.Most of all is the poignancy of today's mortgage crisis, in which the seeds are sown through the discontent of a couple considering themselves not unlike the others but falling into the wishes that lead to frustration and loss. Such is the stuff of an unhappy movie about a happier time that I remember but young artists could never know.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Interesting movie, Better performances","I thought this was going to be a more entertaining movie, but what make it worths to watch it are the performances of DiCaprio, Winslet and Shannon.I can't understand how Brad Pitt was nominated for the Oscar and not DiCaprio when he has a much better performance. The better moments of the movie are the conversations and discussions between the 2 leadings, the scenes where Shannon appears are very good too, the supporting characters are entertaining. I think the weak point of the movie is its length (119 minutes), I think 105 minutes would have been better because some moments the film is a little slow and boring.Frank and April are a young married couple who are tired of their boring life, that's why they decide to go to Paris and live there, but when Frank gets a better job and salary offer at his work, he will have doubts of leaving, that's when really serious problems begin in this couple's relationship .....This movie is recommended specially for adult people who like dramas.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sailing Down to Revolutionary Road,"Sam Mendes make an adaptation on Richard Yates novel into a movie, and pairs the couple who melted the hearts of millions with the 1997 blockbuster, Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet had a reunion in Revolutionary Road, which finally, Jack and Rose has become husband and wife, under the name of Frank and April Wheeler.Set in the suburban of Connecticut during the 1950's, Revolutionary Road is an exploration on a couple seeking a better life, which is to fulfill their dreams by migrating to Paris. One can easily compared Revolutionary Road with Mendes first big screen work, American Beauty (1999.) Frank and April settles in Connecticut, with a big house, 2 lovely kids, a job that has no problem putting bread on the table. However, Frank do not like his job, while April is drowning herself in sadness when she is unsuccessful in becoming an actress. Things take a drastic change when both decided to migrate to Paris, with 2 issues hindering their plans: Frank getting a promotion and April getting pregnant. What falls ahead of them are countless challenges on their relationship of an unhappy matrimony.One will never be disappointed with any movies from Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, since both has never delivered disappointing performances. With their outstanding performance in Titanic, Revolutionary Road will never disappoint anyone who is expecting more from the couple.Sam Mendes discussed the issue of an American dream turned sour in American Beauty, where he introduces a failed husband seeking a breakthrough for himself, a wife who wants to break free from a loveless marriage, a daughter with growing up issues, infidelity, erotic dreams and drugs. Things take a turn in Revolutionary Road, where similar issues were discussed.Together with the scores composed by Thomas Newman, one could see the shadow of American Beauty in Revolutionary Road. The husband having a quarrel on the dinner table, the wife who wants to fulfill her dreams at the expense of her husband to a neighbor who is a former mental hospital patient, we could easily see the linkage between American Beauty and Revoultionary Road.While American Beauty begins with an brief introduction of The Burnham's family and their neighborhood, Revolutionary Road begins with how Frank and April knowing each other in a party. The next scene begins with Frank and April, now a married couple, facing the problems they had in their marriage. Mendes is taking a twist in terms of presentation for both movies discussing similar issues.Just like the environment in Revolutionary Road, it was peaceful and calm, where one would slow down their paces and enjoying what is around them. Mendes handles the nature of the story and present it in a way where one will not feel much harsh elements in Revolutionary Road, compared to the straight-to-your-face reality featured in American Beauty. This can be told by the unexpected ending for the movie.Sailing down to Revolutionary Road is not as disastrous compared to taking the maiden voyage in Titanic. While one will wrench in Titanic, they will appreciate the beauty of Revolutionary Road, which will not be easily forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Making what seems to be an easy decision to live the life of a suburban family isn't always so easy. Society seems to idealize family life to the point of ad of naseum. Some people are just more bohemian and flighty by nature. When these people try to mold themselves into what they think society wants them to be - it can result in disaster for all involved.

Trailer Held More Potential Than Final Product,"Perhaps it was just me overlooking how trailers tend to inflate a movie to something bigger than what it really is, but I really did have hope for this movie. It seemed epic and heart-wrenching, like a classic that could make you cry every single time you watched it. Sadly, however, it did not impart an impact remotely as strong as I expected. Don't get me wrong, it had its high points. The storyline is sound. The acting, the emotion, absolutely riveting. My dissatisfaction only spawned from how short it seemed after it ended. Something was not right. I was so captivated with the trailer, it might as well have been a short film itself. But the movie...the transition, the build-up of conflict...it could have been better. The ending would have been the fantastic cherry on top, would have absolutely torn me apart had I just fallen a little deeper in love, become a little more entangled with the characters and their plight.

Stupid Movie From Start to Finish,"Wow! this movie has got to be the biggest stinker of 2008. My idea of entertainment is not to watch to totally manipulated characters go from alpha to omega in what they want out of life. People don't just work for years to achieve the American dream only to throw it away suddenly on some sill whim. The characters don't seem real to life, rather they exist to give expression to the author's point of view which is pretty stupid as far as I am concerned. If the writer(s) wanted to examine suburban living and come down on it as empty and shallow, they did a pretty crummy job. Two hours of fighting and screaming hardly made me think achieving the American dream is not worth it. Rather it bored me silly and I couldn't wait for the credits to start rolling.

Frank has no idea what he has done to cause April to stop caring for him, after all, he really loves her, does his job as the supporting husband, and even tries his best to understand her. Yet, despite all he does for her, she is still unphased, and could care less about him. For Frank, April's resentment towards him is unbearable, because he does not know what he did wrong. Frank even blames himself for April's absurd behavior, but it is really April's self-loathing that is ruining their lives. The end pretty much sums it up for Men who want to stay in a relationship.

A film about depression,"7.9 stars.If you whittle this film down to the bone you end up seeing it for the one thing it represents: depression. This is all about several people (not just the leads) who understand mental illness in all of it's undignified nakedness.Dicaprio's character represents all those with aspirations, a wannabe who says all the right things, but doesn't ever follow through with any of his dreams. He is your average person who does not truly desire to be or to have anything more than comfort and a few perks on the side. He will not put forth the effort needed to accomplish greatness. He might also be considered a mild depressive. He is the person who squanders the potential he is given to settle for mediocrity.Winslet's character is much more intense and passionate. She has been tricked by this otherwise charismatic lover of the world (Dicaprio's character) only to realize after it's too late, that it's not what she envisioned. Now she is stuck in a dreary life of endless misery and boredom. She should be satisfied, content, even happy about her good fortune, but instead she has to convince herself over and over to fake being happy in order to survive. It's the only mechanism she has left to save her soul.The other characters are riddled with mental health issues, Shannon's character being an obvious bipolar, probable borderline schizophrenic. He represents the person who fully understands exactly what Winslet and Dicaprio's characters are suffering with, because he has a more advanced level of that ""disease"". He represents the person who has no alternatives, he cannot manage his problems, he can only face them and accept the inevitable.This film is a metaphor. The writer utilized an American family in the era of when America was truly at its peak of greatness and the status quo. The family represents a person who is given the opportunity to thrive as long as they exist in a vacuum where equality and opportunity exist (even though it wasn't really fully realized yet).This film has multiple layers, I can't begin to explore them all. There is a lot of depth and you have to put on your thinking cap to fully appreciate it. If you don't like the story, it might be due to misunderstanding the theme. In my opinion, the theme is simply to give us a taste of what it's like to experience a life of privilege, but not take advantage of the opportunities it affords.I can see how those involved with the making of this film somehow get it. They fathom the crises displayed. They get the intensity of emotions that people with these diseases feel. For that reason alone 'Revolutionary Road' is brilliant. Adding to my praises for it, the music also reflects the theme precisely and evokes an emotional response. I give it a high rating solely for the genius and talent and nothing else, because it's not very stimulating or entertaining for me, it's simply a very intelligent and insightful presentation.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Turning points come from outside,"I am 61 years old. I watched this movie with empathy reminding my 30s. Both husband and wife have strong upward desire but not contented. The husband seems he does not like his boss and his daily job. Thus they make their own big turning point, which is to sell everything and move to Paris, where the wife will work with high wage and the husband will seek something truly deserves to do. What a bold idea. However, while they are preparing for it, unexpected turning points come from outside. The husband's case is that his job is recognized and he is offered a new position with very good salary. For men, recognition and promotion are so attractive that all of dissatisfactions so far can be forgotten. I will not disclose what turning point comes to the wife to avoid spoiler. Anyhow, this is the story of a couple who lives on the road of symbolic name 'Revolutionary Road' and tries to make a revolutionary change in life, but faces unexpected turning points. I recall my wife and I had similar events in our 30's too. That is why I wrote I watched the movie with empathy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Powerfully and compellingly depressing film about the emptiness of Suburbia...,"Sam Mendes, in an effective follow-up of sorts to American BEAUTY (I say follow-up because both films touch on the same subject matter), has created a film that is amazingly realistic and compelling, and examines life in Suburbia to the extent that most directors are afraid to go.The acting by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is astounding and is reason enough to watch the film. It amazes me how neither of these performances was nominated for Lead Acting Oscars. DiCaprio portrays Frank Wheeler in a powerful yet laid-back manner, while Winslet as April Wheeler is simply stunning. By themselves, they are fantastic, but together they forge a combative and forceful on-screen relationship that is in no way comparable to the overly romantic one seen in 1997's TITANIC. The excellent acting is not only confined within the lead roles, as Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon do more than adequate jobs in their supporting roles. The latter was actually nominated for Best Supporting Actor.Not much has been said by critics in terms of story/character development, but in my opinion, this is one of the most engrossing films I have seen for the Awards season. Likewise, not enough has been said about the score, which is effectively low-key with a hint of deep-set and ominous gloom; perfect for setting the overall mood of the film as it creates an uneasy atmosphere. The cinematography, camera-work, set design, and costume design were all remarkable, and the viewer would have felt engrossed in the 1960s atmosphere presented.Overall, a truly captivating Motion Picture; one that should not be missed. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 166. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Powerful and meaningful,"""Revolutionary Road"" (2008) earns its 7/10 rating by delivering a raw and unflinching portrayal of a disintegrating marriage, brought to life brilliantly by the talents of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. Their performances are a tour de force, capturing the complexities and frustrations of their characters. The film's strength lies in its unrelenting exploration of the American Dream gone sour, and the haunting feeling that life has not lived up to its promises. The suburban setting and period-accurate cinematography create an atmosphere that feels both nostalgic and suffocating. The weakness, however, might be its unrelenting bleakness, which can make it emotionally exhausting. The score complements the film's somber tone effectively. ""Revolutionary Road"" is a poignant and harrowing examination of the human condition, making it a must-watch for those who appreciate intense character dramas.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bitter-sweet suburbia,"Of course the last time Leo and Kate made a film together, they played youthful star- crossed lovers in a doomed relationship. Here, they are older and altogether disenchanted, although again the outcome is doomed. The former of course was ""Titanic"", for me an overblown, badly-written melodrama but here we have a warts and all examination of a stale marriage set in mid-50's ""I like Ike"" suburban USA, based on a modern literary classic. The special effects are certainly better in the film about the ship but I know which I prefer.The film is an up close study of a marriage going wrong. On the face of it this youngish couple should be happy, like their neighbours seem to be. They have a nice house, he has a steady job, they have two kids and are considered the perfect couple. But like the song says, in every dream home a heartache and so it proves.After dissecting the modern American marriage to a degree in ""American Beauty'"", Sam Jaafe (Winslet's husband at the time) gets the scalpel out again for this movie set some 50 years before. Some aspects however, whilst I appreciate they are in the original novel, don't work for me, in particular the introduction of the recently institutionalised son of an older neighbourly couple, who is there to point out the flaws in the Wheeler marriage which we presumably somehow mssed in the preceding hour. Add to that he uses some downright abhorrent phrases that only repel rather than enlighten with his parents saying nary a word against him.I also feel De Caprio is miscast here. He looks too baby-faced for the part of the treacherous husband but Winslet does well as the frustrated wife who can only find release from her straitjacket with the most extreme of solutions.Nevertheless the film has a gathering power as it builds up to its desperate climax and makes for strong, sobering viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Middle-class, suburban America seen as a creative and emotional dead-end...","Playing a business equipment salesman in the 1950s--a husband and father of two whose life has become a depressing rut--Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't quite have the chops here to portray angst successfully. The 30-year-old blues appear to have arrived too early for the actor (even Richard Burton had to wait a while before the marital blahs wore well on him). DiCaprio works commendably hard under Sam Mendes' direction, furrowing his brow and keeping his voice in a lower register, but he still looks like a kid in his suits and hats. Kate Winslet (reunited with DiCaprio after their successful pairing in 1997's ""Titanic"") plays his housewife-spouse, and looks terrific in her '50s wardrobe even if her character is almost impossible to reach (she's either too stony or too talkative). This prestigious-looking adaptation of Richard Yates' novel is rather like a Douglas Sirk melodrama with the central issue missing. It is purposefully glossy and plush, yet the argumentative digs and disappointments which crop up between this immature-acting couple are supposed to be far more edgy and provocative than those found in Sirk's potboilers. One might be forgiven for wondering what the hell is eating away at these two; opening with a fight scene in front of their car at night, I felt DiCaprio's Frank and Winslet's April were eons away from George and Martha of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Winslet simply cannot eke out a tangible character within this sterile format (one wants to like her April solely because Winslet looks so beautiful, but April has far less dimensions than most heroines). The husband's job, the couple's plans for the future, the neighbor next-door who harbors a secret crush on the unhappy Mrs., all contribute to making this portrait an interesting journey--but is it a worthwhile, moving experience? I don't believe so, not with these leads and not with Justin Haythe's callow screenplay. ""Revolutionary Road"" (terrible title!) promises to be a heady exercise; it has the impeccable production and slick sweep of a good commercial movie for grown-ups, but Mendes instead offers us selfish adult children and endless bickering. Give me Sirk any day. Three Oscar nominations: for Michael Shannon as Best Supporting Actor, Albert Wolsky for his costume design (deservedly so) and for art direction. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Disturbingly immersive tale of the last rites of a subarban marriage,"You got to hand it to the two leads of this film. They may be better known for the love story Titantic, but this is a counter-history version, like as if what would have happened if they had survived the wreck but their relationship went sour.Firstly, there is little to fault in this film. The acting is superb, and Kate Winslet is for me one of the finest actresses anywhere. There is little to fault her with this performance, I think it's even better than when she won the Oscar for The Reader (another dark film I very much enjoyed). Leo DiCaprio is also sublime here, and the pair on-screen are at the top of their game.What we have is a couple who on paper are living an idyllic life. Based in the 1950's, the picture perfect couple live in a white picket fence dreamy suburban area whilst the husband works in a steady job where he is going places, and the kids are fine etc. Yet underneath it all the couple are deeply unsatisfied. The name of the film is really an ironic statement (joke?), and is the name of the road they live on.A far-fetched & extravagant proposal by the wife to her husband to dump their current set-up for a fantasy life in Paris sets up the destructive trail as the couple's relationship disintegrates. Neither side is perfect or wholesome, and it's uncomfortable but disturbingly immersive watch to see how things pan out.It's quite a cynical outlook on the reality of middle America, but the same story can be played out almost anywhere.You have to hand it to the director who has taken the whole ""American Beauty"" idea (again) and transposed it all with another tale that peaks between the curtains of surburbia. The direction is great, the settings are all perfectly captured and the actors all fit the bill.The only issue is the discomforting nature of it, which explains for its lack of success at the box office. It does drag at times, but it's not an action film. There is little if any humour and that makes it often even more difficult to get through. It's worth the effort though to give it the time it deserves.It's a good stage play on screen, and from early on you know it will all end in some tragic way. What way? Well, I'd recommend that you watch it. Not one to watch on Valentine's Day with a partner but one to watch out for nevertheless.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Convincing. A very nice work From Sam Mendes,"Revolutionary Road a movie about A young couple living in a Connecticut suburb during the mid-1950s struggle to come to terms with their personal problems while trying to raise their two children.

The story is interesting, the plot is very well developed, it is very good set on the 50's era. It has a slow paced rhythm, you have to focus and have patience or you'll get bored. The cast is very good. In the leading roles we have Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Frank and April Wheeler respectively, both deliver very good performances specially Winslet, DiCaprio was a little overacted for my taste.

"intense, raw, painful and brutally honest","Frank: I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities! April: It takes backbone to lead the life you want!Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) works for the first time with his wife Kate Winslet in Revolutionary Road, a heavy drama based on Richard Yates' novel. It also reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Winslet since 1997's Titanic.Frank (DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) seem to live the perfect life with their two kids in a Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. Frank has a job he doesn't like but is good at, while April put her acting dreams on hold to become a full-time housewife. But they feel trapped and unhappy and feel like there is a better life than what they have. Then April hatches the perfect plan: the Wheelers will start over in Paris, the only place she remembers her husband saying was worth returning to, where people felt most alive. No job awaits Frank there, in fact, he has no idea what he will do, but he will finally have the time to find out. April volunteers to support the family by applying for a good-paying secretarial job. They announce their plan to the world, but when they begin execution, complications ensue, values are tested, and the couple discovers so much more about each other that will forever change their future.Revolutionary Road is intense, raw, painful and brutally honest. It has been called a humorless American Beauty, but it's so much more. It may be set in the '50s, but its message continues to speak to anyone in a relationship today. Technically, while the performances were terrific, it sometimes felt like the characters were mouthpieces on a tableau, as if in a play. But that itch aside, Revolutionary Road resonated with me, being in a relationship and having had the same thoughts as the characters. When April says, ""I saw a whole other future. I can't stop seeing it,"" you feel her desire and grief. You will also feel Frank's helplessness even in his volatile explosions. Even in their many conversations and yelling sprees, one might think that at least the couple communicates and are honest with each other. But in the end, there is a scene that at first confused me, but later on I realized its importance: how a couple lasts by showing how the other copes.

A Raw and Heartbreaking Tale of Dreams and Despair,"Revolutionary Road is a devastatingly honest exploration of a crumbling marriage and the crushing weight of unfulfilled dreams. Directed by Sam Mendes, this film paints a stark portrait of suburban discontent in the 1950s, making it hauntingly relatable even today.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet reunite to deliver powerhouse performances, reigniting their incredible chemistry from Titanic. Winslet is magnetic as April Wheeler, a woman desperate to break free from societal constraints, while DiCaprio brings depth and vulnerability to Frank Wheeler, a man torn between conformity and his own aspirations. Together, they create a palpable tension that drives the emotional core of the story.The screenplay, adapted from Richard Yates' novel, is sharp and unrelenting, capturing the complexities of love, ambition, and frustration. The arguments between Frank and April feel raw and authentic, making their struggle both painful and compelling to watch.The cinematography and production design perfectly evoke the era, with Mendes using the picturesque suburban setting as a stark contrast to the characters' inner turmoil. Thomas Newman's score further amplifies the film's melancholic atmosphere.A poignant and beautifully crafted drama, Revolutionary Road is a must-watch for its stellar performances and unflinching portrayal of the fragility of human dreams.

Seven Pounds attempted to bring us to tears with multiple manipulative tricks, but Revolutionary Road actually does it with a simple story, well acted, about a troubled marriage. The theme is the paths we take, why we choose them, and the chances we are given, whether we recognize them or not. This is a pure emotional roller coaster ride, as classic as A Streetcar Named Desire or Goodbye Columbus. Too bad it's not released yet, because DiCaprio certainly would be among Sean Penn and Frank Langella in the running for Best Actor Oscar, and Winslet would have taken Best Actress.

A Second Exceptional Family Drama from Mendes,"Sam Mendes should be pre-emptively awarded a Best Director nomination in any year he releases a film. Through four movies, he's the only director working today who has yet to make a movie that's less than a minor classic, though his dark sensibility admittedly makes his films difficult to watch repeatedly.In Revolutionary Road, Di Caprio and Winslet give believable, fully human performances in the challenging roles of Frank and April Wheeler, a young couple struggling with their own lack of belief in the life they've chosen. The film shows beautifully, and often painfully, how every moment in life offers a crucial choice, and how the results of these choices can surprise and even devastate. The most impressive thing about RR is the weight and consequence imbued in the life of an ""average, suburban American family"" - the same weight each of us feels in our own lives. Di Caprio and Winslet deserve at least as much credit as Mendes for this, and all three are worthy of Oscar nominations.From an artistic perspective, I would rank this as Mendes' ""worst"" movie, but the faults in the editing and script are so minor that were this any other director, they might not even be noticeable. All told, Revolutionary Road is a unique addition to the oeuvre of a young and already canonical director.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It takes real guts to see the hopelessness  Revolutionary Road,"Here it is, the start of suburban sprawl. So many people will look at it as successthe ability to survive and raise a family away from crime, in a neighborhood that thrives on wholesome love and friendship. But as anyone can tell you today, most of that is a complete façade, a mask hiding the troubles and anger and regret that everyone feelsthat need for more, and a way out of the rut of living without living. What Revolutionary Road does is peel back that layer where it concerns the Wheelers, a young couple that is looked up to by everyone in their social circle. Loving, two children, a supporting husband, and a beautiful wifethey're the idyllic white picket fence dream. Except for the inner struggles both Frank and April fight each day, looking at their present and only seeing a future full of mediocrity and safety; the excitement of young love full of hope, where the sky was the limit, all but gone. Once that first child is born, you need to begin living for someone else, putting yourself in the backseat. Sometimes that life just isn't for all of us.The novel for which this film is adapted from is also the material loosely utilized for the television show ""Mad Men"". While these two entities differ greatly, the underlying structural problems about marriage and the meaning of success couldn't be more similar. Sure Jon Hamm's Don Draper is a confident man that buried his past to become the man he thought he wanted to be and Leonardo DiCaprio is a beaten man stuck in a job he hates in order to be the husband he thinks he needs to be, but the end resultbreaking from their vows to add a little excitement and memory of life when all they had to worry about was themselvesis a mirror image of the other. Tightly wound and stressful to no end, Frank and April Wheeler are at a very dangerous crossroads. Finally getting on the other's nerves, beginning to think that maybe their marriage was rushed into after a chance encounter at a party, the relationship has escalated to shouting matches that attempt to get the other to snap first. It is only the hastily hatched plan of moving to Paris, starting anew with that fervor they both fell in love with from the other the first time, that gets them back on track with a glimmer of hope for the future.Business is booming, the computer generation is burgeoning, and money has become the driving force for life. With advertising and sales entrenching themselves into daily routine, people are finding themselves brainwashed to the idea that a perfect home life means having the big house, nice car, multiple children, and dinner on the table each night. If that dream means working a job you don't respect or pretending your life locked inside your house raising the kids who forced you to move to the suburbs in the first place, well, you make do. As my favorite character, and probably the most important voice in the entire film, says, ""most people know the emptiness, it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" Michael Shannon's John Givings, a friend's son, recently admitted to an insane asylum, hits the nail on the head. Most couples going through the motions know the void they are filling with material goods and lies to themselves and each other, but very few understand the fact that once you find yourself in that world, it becomes a descent into quicksand, almost impossible to find that joy you once saw in front of you so long ago.This man's insanity also plays a huge role in the film due to the fact that, in my opinion, he is the sanest character here. He understands what it means to be free from the constraints of society, but for some reason humanity got lost on its journey, eventually deeming freedom to be an unattainable dream. To live without inhibitions is insanity while slaving away every last fiber of your being becomes the sane thing to do. This fact is shown completely naked through the eyes of DiCaprio's Frank and Kate Winslet's powerful turn as April. By discovering how much what she does hurts her, how much what her contemporaries say she should be doing destroys her will to go on, she slowly finds herself spiraling into depression, becoming vacant and hysterical. The final act, John Givings' last visit to the Wheeler house until the next morning's surreally off-kilter mood and action, is absolutely devastating to experience. You can't help but see yourself in their shoes, watching as the weight of conformity finally becomes too much to prop above the necessity to fly.And Sam Mendes really gets every bit right, even those heavily debated subjects some people might not want to face. At first, I began to think how much could have been improved if say Todd Field directed this story, but after further thought realized it wouldn't have been as effective. While it doesn't contain the amount of humor the audience I saw it with thought, there are a lot of laughs included, both adding to the awkwardness of some situations and deflecting from the sheer dramatic gravitas portrayed at many moments. I especially loved the moments where Mendes slowed the camera down, just a bit, and superimposed a beautiful orchestral score above while muting the sounds of the actions on screen. Utilized when April and Shep dance at a bar and later during Frank's heart-wrenching experience of being completely helpless, this effect is successful and never heavy-handed. Sometimes it takes tragedy to wake yourself from the nightmare of solitude that you thought was a dream of happiness, and Revolutionary Road puts that revelation in your face, hopefully to watch now so as not to allow it to occur to yourself in real life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow...that's all I can say,"Fantastic Picture! Several times throughout it I just could not believe the performances from Kate and Leo. Do not look at this movie merely as negative and depressing. To dismiss it as such would be to oversimplify to the Nth degree. What it is a brilliant work of art sculpted to perfection by everyone involved and I can not wait to watch it again. The raw emotions displayed in this movie just grip you from start to finish and you are engulfed by these people and their lives. When I heard about another pairing of Winslet and DiCaprio, I was wary to say the least. While I am a fan of both actors, I had grown up with the I Love Leo generation and did not think I could see past Titanic. Some might say that this is just Jack and Rose further down the line, but I respectfully disagree. You can tell that both of them have come so far in their careers and though I felt a little funny watching them together again, it quickly faded (even though Kathy Bates was in it too which I thought was funny). Please watch this movie with an open mind and heart and you will not be disappointed!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
great performance for both Kate and Leonardo,"Im getting used to see great performances from these actors, they really fit well on screen. It's a great movie about 2 guys trying to get their marriage to work along with their dreams, a young couple who have kids and decides to move to Paris, to complete their dream. It's a simple story about something we all might experience one day. Frank is working hard to support the family, along with their 2 kids. April becomes insecure when Frank doesn't wanna go to Paris anymore, because she got pregnant, and he's the only one who wants to keep the baby.I was really impressed of Leo's performance, he should really get the Oscar for this one, and Kate as well. Good luck guys!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pointless Road,"I just finished watching Revolutionary Road, actually I watch it twice. The story is set in US suburbia, in the post WW2. It enfolds a married couple, the Wheelers, who are in discomfort with their ordinary lives and they decide to do something different. Their plan is to move to Paris and start a new and different life. Winslet plays a 1950s housewife with unaccomplished dreams. She encourages he husband Frank (DiCaprio) to quit his job and sell their home so they can go on this trip. But Frank is more assertive to others opinion, outside their marriage, than of his own wife. For a moment we see them doing well until Frank is offered a better position on his work place and decides to cancel their plans.I understand the premise of the story and Winslet character's desperation to get out of her, so called boring life. What I didn't get was her true motivations. I have never read the book and perhaps I never will, but the movie doesn't really develop why she is so into going to France and leaving everything behind. It's obvious, they are not happy and it's clear from the beginning of the movie where their arguments and fighting become cliché throughout the entire movie. The plot is focused on their depressive state, instead of showing how they got to be so unhappy. Perhaps you might have read this already in other reviews, but my other complains is the lack of character development. Character development is practically inexistent; it leaves you with a lot of whys. The main characters become unlikable and predictable, the only character that I found interesting was John Givings played by Michael Shannon. But other than that, I found the acting was just average, and it wasn't the best work of DiCaprio and Winslet. Story wise there is no concrete plot and in my opinion, it's not strong enough for the viewer to support the main character motive. Anyway, be your own judge, but be warned, this movie is depressing from start to finish.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good Adaptation of Richard Yates's Classic Novel,"When watching the trailers for this movie, I wondered why anyone would want to subject themselves to two hours of Leo & Kate yelling at each other. It seemed like the ultimate downer of a film, an uninterrupted stretch of ""The Bickersons"" on the silver screen. Why would an acclaimed Film Director like Sam Mendes and Hollywood luminaries Kate Winslett & Leonardo DiCaprio get behind this project?""Revolutionary Road"" by Richard Yates is one of the great American novels of the 20th century. Published in 1961, it was hailed critically but it didn't do well commercially. It was a bit too grim in its outlook for the time. This is the first time it's been adapted to film. While the movie is faithful to the book, the novel is much more than just another story of suburban malaise. The movie doesn't go beneath the surface of the characters as the novel does. From watching the movie, we really don't know much about Frank & April Wheeler, other than that they are unhappy with their lives. The book goes into much greater depth. This is the film's major flaw. Like ""The Great Gatsby"", to which it's often compared, the plot and its characters are secondary to the lyricism of the prose. It's very hard to capture this type of literary masterpiece to the big screen. Case in point: Coppola's ""The Great Gatsby"" was a critical failure, despite a massive film budget, big name movie star talent, not to mention Coppola himself directing.That being said, I thought DiCaprio was great as Frank Wheeler. He really nailed the role perfectly. While Kate good as April, she tended to overact a bit too much. I thought her crying scene toward the dramatic ending was a bit artificial (after she made breakfast for Frank and he left for work) and could have been more genuine. I'm not sure why Mendes didn't do a re-take. It must be tough directing your wife (Mendes is married to Winslett).All in all, an excellent movie and by all means go see it. My advice would also be to read the book before seeing it. That's not to say one needs to read the book to appreciate the film, but it does help gain a better understanding of the characters and the story.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Wheelers aren't so special,"Greetings again from the darkness. Evidently I am one of the few who didn't like the movie, and just to be clear, that doesn't bother me one iota. This is a depressing, non-message movie stuck in an unrealistic setting with characters who we don't care the least bit about. The fact that the American Beauty and Road to Perdition director assembled such a strong cast doesn't override the fact that it is just not a good film.Basically we get a chance meeting at a party between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Love at first sight seems to happen because he is a longshoreman and she is an actress-wannabe who has never been anywhere or done anything. When she says he is the most interesting man she has ever met, we can only assume that he must also be the first. Besides that ... what does he see in her?Flashforward a few years to a miserable life in early 60's suburbia and a couple of kids and we are then subjected to 90 minutes of screaming and bickering and crying and depression and anger. You know there is an entire segment of the law (and a Tammy Wynette song) just for these situations ... it is called D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Just do it folks. The whole thing is just ridiculous. And where are the KIDS?? They are only in a couple of scenes. Not sure how that happens. I know my kids were around the house most of their childhood.The most interesting character in the movie is the white-jacket worthy son of Kathy Bates played by Michael Shannon (the mysterious marine seen in World Trade Center). His twisted and vile psychoanalysis of Leo and Kate is spot on, though ridiculous in itself.Director Sam Mendes (Kate's real life husband) is blessed to have Winslet and DiCaprio cast or this film would die a quick death at the box office and most assuredly would not end up on any best of lists for this year. Based on Richard Yates' novel, the only explanation I have for the terrific reviews is that they are a product of the reputation of the novel and the high profile parties involved, and not for the finished project of this film. For a significantly better film with similar material, see Todd Haynes' ""Far From Heaven"".",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Family Film of 2008!!!,"wow, this movie was great!!! this movie about a young, idealistic couple living in a 50s suburban community is sure to grab hold of you! Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing (as always) playing the husband, Frank Wheeler, a man who is disgruntled with his job, but trudges on to provide for his family. sure, he's not perfect and makes mistakes along the way, but who doesn't? i truly felt for this guy as he reaches out to connect with his wife at their hardest moments.And Kate Winslet, oh, Kate Winslet. she radiates in this movie as April Wheeler, the young wife who wants her husband to be happy while coping with her own personal issues. like her husband, she is also not perfect, but they enjoy great chemistry together on the screen! her dialog delivery is perfect, and it is hard to tear your eyes from hers, as a thousand different emotions fly through them at any given time.Michael Shannon is also worthy of noting, playing John, a poor, disturbed man who visits the Wheelers with his realtor mother (played wonderfully by Kathy Bates), as he copes with his mental breakdown that has landed him in an asylum. his scenes are at once amusing and heartbreaking.alright, to be serious now. Sam Mendes has yet to make a bad movie, and this one is no exception. dark? yes. depressing? yes. Revolutionary Road is paved with harsh truths and difficult moments, but it is a beautiful film. Thomas Newman's score may be the best of the year, and Kate Winslet delivers what may be the best female performance of the year. go see it with an open mind, and let it haunt you afterwards.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revolutionary Road: Movie review,"''Revolutionary Road'' is a drama with some elements of romance. This movie is directed by Sam Mendes in 2008. Justin Haythe worked on the script. Later in 2012, ""Skyfall"" was also directed by Sam Mendes. A novel, on which ''Revolutionary Road'' is based upon, was written by Richard Yates in 1961. The movie features a star-studded cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Michael Shannon.''Revolutionary Road'' takes place in 1948. Frank falls in love with April, who wants to be an actress. Some time later, they understand that they have their ordinary lives. The couple tries to change this situation and move to Paris when they realize that it won't be so easy.This is a hugely emotional movie. It creates a strong atmosphere and pays attention to detail. The actors' performances are splendid and convincing. Kate Winslet achieved four Awards.Written by Anastasiia Shystovska",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Acting Masterpiece,"I have waited for weeks for this film to open in Hollywood, here in Los Angeles, and finally today I saw the film. Dicaprio and Winslet take REVOLUTIONARY ROAD and from the first scenes I think I am back with WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? with Martha and George bickering and arguing with biting dialog. Then REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, because of its time frame, reminds me of the fabulous MADMEN, with that intensity and drama of its leading characters, until I look into the eyes of April, Winslet, and realize that REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is a story and journey of two characters with their own enemies to face. Every frame of the film and the scenes between Kate and Leo remind me of what that it must have been like in the 1950's, attempting to live that perfect American life, but in the end, you realize that the ""Donna Reed perfect wife and mother"" American character, is a falsehood, and that April is only hoping to find something better. The supporting cast of Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour is superb with characters that only add to the history which is building between the Wheelers.Sam Mendes does give us hints of American BEAUTY, but in REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, he directs a story of brilliant drama and intensity. With the final scene, you can understand how April must have felt in a suburban world of perfection, and lies.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What happens to a dream deferred?,"'Revolutionary Road' digs and picks at a truth so awful and ugly that hiding it or pretending as though it doesn't exist is no longer an option. It is a festering sore below the surface. Ready to explode.A 1950s Americana suburbia. Quaint little houses. Charming people. Green lawns filled with young rambunctious children. It is the image of desire, of success. But what goes on within those walls when the doors are closed to curious neighbors? What happens when the charming life you lead is anything but? A lie. A carefully constructed, well-manicured lie.Sam Mendes leads the star-studded adaptation of Richard Yates' novel. It is an explosive observation of suburban life gone astray. Frank and April Wheeler find themselves playing the part. Doing what society tells them is the proper thing to do. Get married. Settle down. Have children. It is the life neither of them wanted. They abuse each other emotionally. Rip each other apart. Tear each other down. Because there is no one else to run to. No way out. No more fake it till you make it. 'Revolutionary Road' is a tragedy. A full-blown suburban tragedy.The reunion of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet find the two under very different circumstances than 'Titanic'. These are two extraordinary performances from two of today's greatest screen talents. They hold no punches in this haunting tale, exploding with powerful emotions that help make 'Revolutionary Road' one of the most explosively entertaining pictures of the year. These are two individuals stuck with each other. Desperately looking for a way out. Putting on a show even to each other, pretending and promising that everything can be okay. And Winslet, who has been criminally passed up for an Oscar five times now, gives this performance everything she can. It is an absolutely devastating but profound role.Sam Mendes is no stranger to suburban turmoil. He directed 'American Beauty' with a fierce satirical eye. This time around, there's a much more suffocating sense of dread. It's a brooding atmosphere that intoxicates the senses, and 'Revolutionary Road' has a lot to say about this so-called American dream. Michael Shannon finds himself in the role of a mentally disturbed man, the son of the Wheeler's realtor. He makes keen observations about the world around him, and while his condition render his words as insanity, there is an undeniable truth to them. All the lies, all the emptiness. 'Revolutionary Road' is a downer, but difficult to argue against.Hot to the touch, 'Revolutionary Road' stirs the pot and turns traditional expectations on its side. It's a disturbing tale of isolation and hopelessness. Mendes begs the question, at what cost? At what cost are we willing to put on this charade? To pretend to be something we aren't? It's one of this year's very best pictures, something that will leave a heavy shroud over you that's shockingly difficult to shake off.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hollywood did its usual twist on what was a good novel,"The novel that this was based on was meant to be a learning lesson. It was intended to show how shallow and unfulfilled lives are when self is all we care about. Instead Hollywood did what Hollywood does best, attempted to make heroes out of selfish arrogant characters who care only for themselves. This movie was just plain awful. The only attracting feature this movie has is an on screen reunion of Kate & Leonardo. Which in could have been a good thing, but given the nature of this film they should have left off saying goodbye while floating on a door in the icy ocean after the Titanic sunk. Michael Shannon is a good actor who needs to find himself some good roles to really put his name on screen.

Mendes mending more marriage hearts but with a slick revolutionary style!,"Director Sam Mendes' suburbia melancholy tic is still ticking with his latest subversive (synonym of revolutionary) film ""Revolutionary Road"". The film is not really a revolutionist one as it is a sinister one; sinister in the sense of marriage peccadillo. Mendes brings us the usual no-no's of marriage that have been mores in the matrimony world in the last few decades: adultery, deceit, lies, dissatisfaction, and escapism. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star as Frank & April Wheeler, a young married couple with two kids living in a Connecticut suburb in the mid 1950's. Frank Wheeler unenthusiastically just goes with the motion in his mundane office job living paycheck by paycheck. April Wheeler is a stay-at-home mom and part-time amateur actress who longs for more than the life she is living. Therefore, a Wheeler Revolution must occur! So they decide to move to Paris. They inform their archetypal suburban married neighbors (and best friends) Shep and Milly Campbell of their Tour de France plans; The Campbells think it is all talk soup, even with their stunned expressions. That scene is probably the elite one the film. The Wheeler's revolutionary Paris road plans come to a dead end when Frank gets an unexpected promotion and the zenith of the Wheeler Marriage Civil War begins. ""Revolutionary Road"" should not be part of an itinerary for a Marriage Retreat because most of the film shows the Wheelers emotionally bickering about various contrived sentiments and psychological conflicts. DiCaprio and Winslet's titanic performances are Oscar worthy; but Winslet wins out between the two. Nevertheless, my favorite performance of the film was Michael Shannon's scene-stealing work as John Gibins, the mentally troubled son of the Wheeler's real estate confidante Helen Gibins. Shannon portrays John Gibins as a real straight shooter who fires emotional verbal blows to the Wheelers which get them off track in saving their marriage. I hope the Academy does shadow my Shannon sentiment by giving him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Kathy Bates is ""gibin"" us some more fine acting in the twilight of her career with her solid work as Helen Gibins. Justin Haythe's screenplay based on Richard Yates ""Revolutionary Road"" novel gives the best-seller literary work a respectful proper credence. You gotta have Haythe in your promising screenwriter list. Roger Deakins' astounding cinematography should garner him yet another Oscar nomination; copy that Roger. But let's divert back to Sam the Man! Mendes, Mr. Kate Winslet himself, admirably continues to direct stories on marriage tribulations that cause eventual destruction on many psychological effects on a couple and those close around. He did it proficiently with ""American Beauty"" and does an encore with it in ""Revolutionary Road""; even though I thought Beauty was superior to Road. When you first cinematically drive through ""Revolutionary Road"" it seems like just a mediocre movie ride; but before you could say ""mental revolution"" it does linger in your mind for a few days and that is a prominent sign of a powerful film. Follow your movie G.P.S. and take a ride through ""Revolutionary Road"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thoroughly Unpleasant From Start To Finish,"As I suspect many people were, I was drawn to this movie primarily out of curiosity, wanting to see the ""great reunion"" - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet reunited 11 years after their blockbuster starring turns in ""Titanic"" - with Kathy Bates thrown into the mix as well. There's no doubt that DiCaprio and Winslet have some powerful scenes together, but this movie is about as far removed from ""Titanic"" as any movie could possibly be. In this movie set in the 50's, they play the Wheelers - Frank and April - a young couple trying to make their way in the world, dissatisfied with life, with marriage, with each other and with pretty much everything else. They hatch a scheme for Frank to quit a job he hates to allow the family to move to Paris to let him ""discover"" himself while she supports them. Things seem to improve for a while, but the plan falls apart, and eventually so does everything else in their lives. The Wheelers are not a pleasant couple to watch or listen to, and, by the end of the movie, pretty much everybody else is sending the message ""I don't want to talk about the Wheelers any more."" They do have those handful of powerful, raw with (negative) emotion scenes, but in the absence of that anger (which sometimes seemed to border on hatred) Frank and April are actually pretty dry together, which might make a valid point about the state of their marriage, but which isn't very interesting to watch. In the end, I just found them to be unpleasant characters in an unpleasant movie. This certainly isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oscar worthy performances,"Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank wheeler and Kate Winslet as April Wheeler, are very convincing as a happily married but extremely bored husband and wife. Their boredom with mundane activities of married life and ""emptiness"" of daily life is well understood by John Givings (played by Michael Shannon). Michael Shannon did an extremely good job as a certified lunatic with a PhD in mathematic who is recently discharged from psychiatry unit. The interaction among three main characters in the movie is based on the concept of a thin line between sanity and insanity. Kate Winslet is extremely talented and lovable ( Titanic, Little children, even not so popular Holiday and this year Reader).

To top that there's some pretty average performances by all. Leo's done just all right but you expect more from him. And you never feel or care much for Kate in the film. Perhaps because there's not much character development, there's a try but not good enough. Needed more.

Intense yet subtle suburban drama with amazing acting,"Revolutionary Road is an oddly appropriate and ironic title since it involves 2 smart unconventional young American people in the fifties who want to make their own personal ""revolution"" by changing their life. They never felt as if they fit in and it's also why they were partly attracted to each other in the first place. This films marks also the reunion between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, their first since Titanic. Those two turned out to be a few of the greatest actors of their generation and not only are they fully in control of their amazing acting gifts, their chemistry is undeniable. The rest of the cast is completed by fine actors especially the disturbed former engineer. I compare to Titanic but it's more intimate than epic, more suburban drama than romance although there's a fair bit of it that encounters the pitfalls of convention, hypocrisy and fear of change. Revolutionary Road is much closer in spirit to American Beauty by the same director.It's based on an 1961 novel but I found that most of the issues explored are still valid today. Perhaps not how Kate Winslet's character would act in the second half (although it's understandable for the period) but more how certain values and peer pressure can create obstacles preventing us from reaching true happiness and how people react to it. Actually, beyond the couple's conflict, it's the clash of different values that was fascinating to me. It's very dramatic in parts but also subtle emotionally and psychologically. None of the characters are outright bad, they're just human and flawed. I was engrossed by the story and the characters. If there's a slight weakness, it would be that not enough time was spent on showing exactly how the 2 main characters thought differently than the rest of society. I also see how some viewers might be bored by the limited scope and ticked at some of the personal actions taken. One of my joys was to guess what would happen next at certain pivotal events and trying to guess what was taking place inside the character's heads. The dialogues were great, sounded right and were delivered perfectly. The production design was top-notch and nothing seemed out of place or anachronistic although I'm not a specialist of that era. I think Revolutionary Road was indeed one of the best dramas of 2008 and it deserved all the accolades it got.Rating: 8.5 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gripping drama of dysfunctional family life.,"Revolutionary Road, is a drama centered around the lives of a young suburban couple, in the 1950s. Frank Wheeler and his wife April, have been living out the American dream, as proscribed by 1950s social expectations. Frank has a decent job as an executive, which has allowed him to comfortably support his wife and two children.There's trouble in paradise though, when April urges Frank to quit his job, which he hates, and move the family to Paris. Once in Paris, April wants to work at a high-paying administrative job, for the Parisian government. She is willing to support the family herself, while Frank takes time off to 'find himself'.Skeptical at first, Frank warms-up to April's plan. But after being offered a lucrative promotion at his company, Frank becomes conflicted about moving away to Paris. Meanwhile, April admits to Frank that she no longer loves him. All emotional hell breaks loose in their marriage, as Frank confesses to having a fling with his secretary. And April then has a brief tryst with her neighbor's spouse, in their car one evening.Things are further complicated in Frank and April's relationship, when April becomes unexpectedly pregnant with their third child. Feeling stifled and trapped as Frank's wife, April doesn't want the baby. And she's willing to take desperate measures, to end her pregnancy. As their marriage completely unravels, Frank and April come to realize the terrible compromises that they've both made, in order to conform to the absurd expectations of American life in the 1950s.Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are both well-matched as the stars of this movie. Leo radiates a compelling charisma, as Frank Wheeler. Leo makes the viewer believe that Frank Wheeler should be destined for better things, than his mundane work-a-day life. Kate Winslet as April Wheeler, does manage to outdo Leo's performance. Kate emotes with a skilled precision, giving enough of herself in each scene to be believable, without going overboard.The supporting cast of this film, turns-in decent performances. Especially Kathy Bates as the Wheeler's simpering neighbor, Helen Givings. And Michael Shannon gives a standout performance, as Helen's son John, who endured brutal, and unnecessary psychiatric 'treatments'.Revolutionary Road gives viewers a glimpse into the ridiculous, oppressive existence of '50s suburbanites, and the gruesome effects that it had on their lives.

"Not as powerful as the book, but definitely worth seeing.","I read the novel by Richard Yates a little while ago, and I must say, Sam Mendes & Co., did an excellent job at paying an enormous tribute to this American masterpiece.I think Mr. Yates would've been very proud, even if much of the emotional wallop written so profoundly in the book, wasn't completely translated onto film. The novel left me gutted, raw, totally blown away by its shocking intensity and excruciating truths. I felt almost the same way after watching this incredible film, however, the experience wasn't nearly as visceral for me. But then, books have a way of gripping our senses much more palpably than cinema at times.This film was superbly acted. I cannot overstate this enough. However, the pace of the film left me feeling like I was reading ""cliff notes"" of the novel. Like we were given only a skeleton of Yates' fleshy, meaty, gut-wrenching tale of 1950's suburbia.Kate and Leo are very much at the top of their game here. The fact that neither one of them got an Oscar nom for their respective roles in this heartrending film leaves me profoundly perplexed. They both acted their butts off! I am pleased that Michael Shannon got a nom for his amazing contribution, but the sheer audacious exclusion of a Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress nomination leaves me fuming. The Academy needs to seriously (and quickly) buy a vowel.The novel stands the test of time. It is remarkable. A literary masterpiece in every single way. It's amazing how Mr. Yates' words continue to reverberate after all this time, and I'm certain he would have been very, very pleased with the powerful resonance of this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
masterful adaptation,"Kate Winslet again proves she can play suburban American housewives. LITTLE CHILDREN would have been enough, but granted, she reaches impressive heights as an intelligent but emotionally insecure young woman with bohemian tendencies who sees herself trapped in a stifling suburbia in this exploration of the dark side of the American dream. Almost as effective is Leonardo DiCaprio as her similarly dissatisfied office worker husband. Supporting player Michael Shannon is electrifying as John Givings, an eerily perceptive mental patient who upsets their fragile sense of equilibrium at a tense point in the drama. Kathy Bates plays Shannon's mother, a real estate agent/neighbor but seems to be retreading the character she played in ABOUT SCHMIDT several years back: friendly, loquacious, somewhat overbearing and very strange.As he did in the highly overrated American BEAUTY and the flawed but under-appreciated ROAD TO PERDITION, British director Sam Mendes handles American material with style and steadiness. He has a well thought out sense of shot composition; the climactic scene (the details of which I will not divulge) with Winslet standing in front of her picture window is a case in point. Justin Haythe's screenplay persuasively retains the essence of the Richard Yates novel about people who don't know who they are, hook up in what they think or hope is true love and come to hate each other. The actors tear into their roles vigorously. There are many powerful moments and very few dull ones. Winslet and DeCaprio give it all they've got.Among the layers excised from the novel is the emotional suffering of the Winslet-DiCaprio couple's children. In olden days most movies conveniently sent the children off to play, off to bed, off with a nanny after giving us an idyllic glimpse of them in order to establish the parenthood of the central adult dramatic personae. Few films ever convincingly integrated the messy realities of raising real children into their plots or dramatic situations. The same thing happens here. Just one nugget from the novel illustrating the harm done to the children would have strengthened the overall presentation.By and large, however, this is a masterful adaptation.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revolutionary Road,"This film will resonate on many different levels with everyone who sees it. And I hope those who see it, who maybe loathe their husbands , like Kate Winslett's character does, have the courage and strength to run away as fast as they can. Do not settle for 2 or 3 martinis every night, or a trip to the jewelry store for another piece of bling, or a trip to a psychiatrist for happy pills, or empty meaningless affairs. Hit the road and run run run far far away.The scene that is in all the trailers for the film showing April (Kate Winslett) taking out the trash reminded me of a story a friend of mine told me. I once asked this friend why she left her marriage.She said, ""one morning I woke up and took the trash can out to the street. I looked down the street at all the other trash cans and homes with well-manicured lawns and realized at that moment this was not the life I wanted."" She left her husband and their mid-western life behind and moved to Laguna Beach, California. She never looked back.Anyway, this movie had many Madame Bovary moments for me. The only difference is that April really loved Frank (Leonardo Di Caprio) in the beginning. Another difference would be Emma Bovary's desire for a show house and show things to prove her worth in society. April does not seem to care about material things or the status quo, in fact she rebels against it.Kathy Bates plays the real estate agent who sells the lovely home on Revolutionary Road to April and Frank. Her crazy son, with a PhD in mathematics, is the wisest man in the film. He sees right through the frustration in April's life.Sam Mendes directs this film. He also directed American Beauty. An excellent choice since both show nightmare suburban lives. Different decades, but nightmares all the same.Adapted for the screen by Justin Haythe from the book by Richard Yates. Kate Winslett and Leonardo Di Caprio give award winning performances. Kathy Bates is great as the real estate agent. Her crazy son John (Michael Shannon) is only on the screen for a short time,, but an award winning appearance in my humble opinion. This is the first time Kate Winslett has worked with her husband, Sam Mendes.On a personal note, I came very close to a life like April's while I was living in New Zealand. My ex-fiancé is a wealthy real estate developer who owns half of downtown Wellington. I am so glad I had the strength to board that plane that flew me far far away and on to new beginnings.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Utter, utter, utter tosh.  And pretentious with it.","Really bad film. The only good things about it were the costumes and set - everything else was false, false, false. Couldn't have cared less about all of the characters because Sam Mendes couldn't be bothered to explain them to us or develop them in any way. Couldn't take them seriously as a couple because they were so mismatched - Leo DiCaprio will always be a pudgy teenager to me, so couldn't take him seriously as an early middle-life crisis type. Kate Winslett? Well normally she at least looks good, but she was haggard in this. Just what was all the hype about? I really think that Golden Globes must be ten a penny if she actually won one for this. No wonder she was speechless - she probably couldn't believe that this performance had won it for her. Will be very careful in future about any more Sam Mendes films I see.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Formulas for Happiness and why they Crumble,"A half a century ago migration from the noisy high-powered success of the city to the serenity of the suburbs found the path of REVOLUTIONARY ROAD a common one. Richard Yates' novel about the fragility of married commitment in 1955 has been very successfully transformed to the screen by writer Justin Haythe, director Sam Mendes and a perfect cast of actors. All of the soured expectations of that period gel in this superb film - a movie that is difficult to watch at times, mostly because it rings so very true.Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) Wheeler move to Connecticut from New York when the addition of children to their lives of thwarted expectations alter their once dreamy plans for their future. Once in the 'just perfect' little suburb and living in a just perfect little house sold to them by real estate agent Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) - who has a grown son John (Michael Shannon) who is in a mental institution and has undergone multiple shock therapy treatments that allow him to see things as they are no matter how cruel or rude his views - Frank settles for life in the Knox Business Machines Company, reluctantly following in the footsteps of his father while April attempts to rationalize her dreams of being an actress by appearing in an unimpressive amateur theatrical group. From the opening frames of this claustrophobically suffocating new life the once happy couple shows signs of deterioration of a marriage. The manner in which they couple attempt to dramatically change their boring life is destroyed by the realities of their situation: another pregnancy plays a significant role in the downward spiral of Frank and April's future and we as viewers are forced to watch the castle crumble.Winslet and DiCaprio are excellent in the lead roles, offering the type of sensitive acting skills that pull the audience into the film. The supporting roles by Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, David Harbour, Richard Easton and Kathryn Hahn are cameos worthy of praise. Every aspect of the film recreates the 1955 era and in some ways that 'distance' makes observing the film emotionally more tolerable. This is a sad story that has no redeeming end. Well worth the attention it has received. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Powerful stuff.,"All right, let's get it out of the way. I counted about four Titanic references. How many did you count? The casting of Bates, Winslet, and DiCaprio, the steamer trip to France, making love in the vintage car, and the close-up of Leo's hands while drawing a diagram in front of Kate at the breakfast table. Despite the fine quality of this film, I could not help but notice these things, and I'm sure most other people will, too.Revolutionary Road is another attempt by director Sam Mendes to show a darker side of the typical suburban American marriage. Though this film won't quite garner the awards that American Beauty did, it is still a film of that same quality. The film deals with a young suburban couple during the 1950s who are coming to a crossroads in their lives. Frank works in the city doing an office job that is meaningless to him. While he's away each day, his wife April tends the house. It is a nice house for a young couple. They have two children who are often off screen and are treated more or less like additional furnishings of the home. Any depth of relationship between the Wheelers and their children is not explored in any way. Early in the film we see April participate in a community playhouse type of production that is universally panned by all that see it. This scene is there to show us how her dreams of becoming an actress are forgotten very early in her adulthood. One day April suggests to Frank that the two of them give up their stale suburban existence and move to Paris. She can do secretarial work while he figures out what he really wants to do with his life. Pretty much everyone they know pans the idea, thinking it foolish. But Frank and April at this point think the joke's on all of them. They are really serious about this Paris thing, and everyone who doubts their dream is simply lame and emotionally dead. Just before the move, two big developments send reality crashing down on Frank and April. Frank is offered a considerable promotion from work, and April learns she is pregnant. From here on, the whole facade of their marriage and even reality itself comes crashing down on them. One argument after another tears the two farther and farther apart. Until finally, tragedy strikes.The film kind of took me by surprise. I, as a proud life-long bachelor expected to relish in their emotional pain an arguments. But as the film went on, and things got more bleak I found myself really feeling bad and caring for these two. I WANTED them to find an understanding and be happy. But once everything was out on the table, the two had clearly burned any bridges they could have used to come together once more. Kate is wonderful as always, and this was Leo's best work since that big film that made them famous. And Oscar nomination not withstanding, I felt the mentally challenged character was a little bit contrived. Sure, he's good in the role, but I just didn't buy the role itself. That it took a crazy man to be honest with the Wheelers... I just didn't buy that they'd even let him in their front door. Even as a favor to the real estate lady. There are affairs to be had by both Frank and April, but they are not the cause of strife. Just symptoms. I'm sure most couples of today would divorce for even 10% of the problems between these two people. Maybe their biggest mistake was ever thinking they were special in the first place. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Leo and Kate!,"this movie is so far the best I've seen in recent years. leo dicaprio left me dumbfounded with his performance.

""youre so stupid april, why did you do that huh? why?""what i like about this is the feeling of being transported back to the American suburban in the 50's and left the theater feeling light and nostalgic at the same time... you get a piece of what life was like back then.watching this film crushed my heart but i will definitely watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An absolute masterpiece.,"Sam Mendes' masterpiece Revolutionary Road doesn't take any time to introduce us to it's characters or show us how they met and fell in love. From the very first scene, we know who Frank and April Wheeler are and why they are so tragically unhappy. The Wheelers thought that they were special, somehow superior to the drones of classic suburban America that they began living among. Perhaps it was the realization that they were living such a dull, unimpressive life that made them feel superior, but in the opening stages of the film they slowly realize that they have stopped being outsiders and instead have become just another uninteresting couple in this uninteresting world. To open themselves back up to life and that superiority, April creates a dream fantasy to move to Paris and they both buy into it for as long as they can.This dream of Paris, however, is just a band-aid for a wound that won't stop bleeding. For a little while they live on a high, basking in the glow that this fantasy has brought them. But soon they realize that they can never escape this disaster of an existence that they accidentally slipped into too long ago for them to even remember what made them so interesting in the first place. Their despondency with life quickly turns into aggressive hatred towards each other as they fall further and further apart in a series of brutal arguments that only get worse and worse. The tragedy of this film, and these characters, is that in the end they don't hate each other. Frank and April Wheeler love each other deeply, but that love is so strong that the only way to distract themselves from a life they never dreamed of living is to turn such a strong emotion into unimaginable hatred towards each other. They are in love and want to be happy together, but everything in their lives succeeds in driving them further and further apart into an ending that shook me to the core.Of course, when it comes down to it, this tragic tale of suburban misery is an actor's showcase. And boy, what a showcase it is. I've seen a few people express hate for the film and it's performances because they feel that it was all too melodramatic and scenery chewing. But I personally think that's the genius behind these performances. Not because the actors are melodramatic, but because the characters themselves make their own arguments melodramatic and explosive just so that they can feel something. These people are craving for something that they can never have, a kind of life you would see in the movies. And if they can't have a happy life where they travel around Paris having fun, they can at least feel alive in the most tragic way possible by taking out their aggression on each other at every turn. All of the shouting and flailing of the arms, I think that was all in the realism of the characters and their need to shout louder and be more theatric than the other person. They used this explosiveness to establish dominance in the argument and relationship and in that respect, the performances were flawless.Leonardo DiCaprio has really impressed me a few times this decade, but his performance in this picture makes his past work look like child's play. Hell, he makes the rest of the actors in this piece seem like amateurs. He steals every second of this film with an explosive, emotionally powerful performance that served to devastate, terrify and move me all at the same time. A brutal portrayal of an ultimately sympathetic and tragic character and without a doubt one of the best performances of the year. Even though DiCaprio completely steals the film, that's not to say that the rest of the performances are anything but sensational. Kate Winslet is the perfect match for his talent in the arguments of these characters and each of them provide their own level of internal fear and external explosiveness. Michael Shannon has been an actor who I've admired quite a bit over the past few years, stealing scenes in all of his films while he went unnoticed and underrated by the world at large. Needless to say, when I found out that he had a performance with Oscar buzz in a prestige picture like this (a performance that would eventually earn him an actual Oscar nomination), my expectations were pretty high off the bat. He took those expectations, ran with them, and then shattered anything I could have expected from him. His performance is absolutely frightening and I couldn't be more pleased that his talent is getting recognized all over the place, especially by the Academy themselves. His explosive argument with DiCaprio's character unsettled me in a way that few films ever have, and that was based entirely on the flawless performances from the two actors.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Yawn...,"Great acting, boring movie. This story is familiar to a lot of people cause it's about a couple and the things couples deal with. It's not really that interesting, especially 2 hours of it. The pace of this movie is so slow, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. These types of movies are overrated because of the big names in them, and if two no names gave the same performances, I doubt so many people would love it so much. Lots of people will say how great it was, but only because they wouldn't dare to say that Leo was in a bad movie. Obviously mostly everyone here would disagree with me, cause you apparently love movies where nothing happens. Revolutionary road is more like the highways in Saskatchewan, not a whole lot to see, and it's pretty straight forward.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
It makes me love and hate so much at the same time,"This is what I felt when I completely watched this movie. I hate the characters in this movie, because it's so real and remind me the same things that I and my partner did in the past, just like Frank and April did. You will feel embarrass because we thought we could make revolutionary road in our relationship but we can't, just like in this movie. It's like a ceremony of tragedy in our life, so empty, painful, and regretful.The movie is especially for the people who have already made a long relationship with someone who they loved. The movie teaches us about how weak and vulnerable the relation is and you still cannot solve it until something bad happen and you just cry. I was definitely angry after I watched this movie.On the other hand, we should give a deep appreciation to this movie. The characters are so real, like we watch our long relationship, so boring, full of angry and misery. This movie uses straight dialog and I salute the mimic of the actors and actress.

Dialogue based drama,"Revolutionary Roads is one of those movies whose charm lies in the acting of the actors and the couple of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have done this task well.As the director of the film, Scorsese has done everything that was needed, from creating suspenseful situations to including his words in the heart of the story.Leo's acting is great, but Kate is better and stronger than him.If you want to watch almost two hours of acting class, it is better to play this movie.Although the film is almost single location and limited, it is full of suspense and fear.

Powerhouse performances of Winslet and DiCaprio carry this painfully beautiful film to new level.,"Walking into the theater to see ""Revolutionary Road"" with some friends of mine, I expected nothing more but a remarkable performance by long lost co-stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. I was given much, much more than I paid for. Although the film adaptation doesn't hold a candle to Yates' actually story telling, Winslet's and DiCaprio's exceptional portrayal of Frank and April Wheeler really take you straight to 115 Revolutionary Road and give you a front row seat to possibly one of the greatest screen performances of 2009""Revolutionary Road"" is that kind of movie that not only teaches us a truth we don't want to believe but shoves it in your face all at the same time. It's very unfortunate that the film couldn't live up to the novel it was based on, but it came very, very close. The script, flawed as it is does give its main characters a certain life to them that draws its audience in, but soon once an audience member accepts the invitation they don't want to stay because of what they see; the truth. Despite the very familiar premise of the story, ""Revolutionary Road"" does what most martial dramas aren't anymore; they make the audience leave the theater with a lesson learned. Mendes makes you really question the assumed sophisticated living of fifties suburban life.Simply put, DiCaprio and Winslet carried this movie all on their own. This being the first movie they've worked on together since ""Titanic"", I came with high hopes but also some doubts. I felt that their performance in this movie wouldn't even come close to falcon punch of a performance in Titanic. I have no hesitation to say that their work in this film surpassed their performance in Titanic in all aspects. The chemistry they established in Titanic really was shown in this film. Even as their characters hated each other, you felt the heat of passion that radiated from their scene work. Also, I tip my hat to the surprising performance of Michael Shannon portraying the clinically disturbed ""John Givings"". He really did justice to the part he was given; I was utterly convinced by his performance. I think it's safe to say that the cast of this movie is what brought to the level it's on.This is not a film for the whole family, but this a film that should be seen nonetheless. Don't go to this movie with fascination of a story in mind, come for a soon-to-be classic performance of two incredible artists.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mainstream cinema with a touch of existential agony,"It makes me sad when a movie had the potential to be outstanding but only turns out OK. I was looking forward to this movie because I loved the novel. It had everything: a good story (the most important element), a good director, talented actors. Yet still the result didn't reach the books complexity, intensity and subtlety.Why is that? I think it's not enough just to take the written dialogs and put them 1:1 into the movie. The written material should have been better elaborated to visualize the depth of the agony. Too many times words were chosen instead of other visual means - or just silence. Sometimes less is more. If you compare it to The Hours (the middle story with Julianne Moore) you see how the characters are better expressed in a shorter time frame and in a more subtle way.I liked more the first part of the movie that nicely built up the tension and set the stage. The second part, the final exchange of blows reminded me more of a boxing match (with words and punches) than of a subtle existential denouement.The actors  were good, but not great. I liked Di Caprio's performance almost more than Winslet's, but neither of them could truly reveal the deepest secrets and fears of of Frank and April Wheeler. Sadly the result was too superficial, too conventional in its dramatic outline without any risk taken- almost too flawless.It should be seen as an elegant and fairly successful piece of mainstream cinema whose main credit is to to give viewers something to think about and as an impulse for the brilliant novel to be read again.Not bad but not strong enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Terrible,"This movie is terrible. It tries to make grand statements about the hopelessness of cookie- cutter suburbia and attempts to provide insightful character studies, but it fails miserably on both counts. The dialogue is particularly bad; as brilliant as Kate and Leo can be, they sound like cut-rate community theatre actors. The flashbacks and flashforwards are poorly handled and not only add nothing to the story but also detract from it. The pacing is way off, the score is a nuisance, and the subplot (such as it is) of the secretarial other woman almost seems poorly edited, as if the initial scenes were forgotten until the creators needed another bump in an overly flat narrative road. The only meritorious part of this movie is the character of John, the institutionalized neighbor son. His role is creepy and thankfully less monotone than the rest, but even this is not nearly reason enough to put up with the remaining mediocrity. Don't forfeit two hours of your life for this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

I couldn't believe how I got sucked in to the acting of this movie. I almost felt as if I was their and I was fighting for them (and with them). All actors did a phenomenal job and I would recommend that if you want to spend your money at the movie theater, which for how much it costs is such a risk of disappointment these days, this is the movie that you must go see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
DiCaprio and Winslet at the top of their careers makes for a standout film,"It's amazing to see where Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have gone since ""Titanic"" and it should only be fitting that they reunite in a film the demonstrates the full extent of their talents. The wide range of emotion, the external and internal struggles--without them, this film would certainly flop into obscurity, even in the hands of the talented Sam Mendes (""American Beauty""). ""Revolutionary Road"" as a script doesn't carry enough strength. It's dialog-heavy and even melodramatic at times, even if much of that dialog is responsible for adding most of the film's depth. But DiCaprio and Winslet are so commanding and convincing that you're taken by their story and Mendes brings the best out of both of them.The timeless duo play Frank and April Wheeler, two suburbanites in the 1950s who have bought into the American ideals of the era despite their every inclination not to. Frank works a job he can't stand, April wishes she could be an actress. The film is the typical suburban conundrum: a contemporary-minded couple desire to grab life by the horns in a time where responsibility, family, practicality and self-sacrifice are the highest of values. Frank and April each wrestle with this in their own ways and it results in a lot of highs and lows for their relationship in the film.Winslet is amazing as usual. Her inner-monologue is about the strongest of any actress in Hollywood. How she can communicate personal conflict and emotion to the audience with her expressions is astounding and in a film where she plays a woman who feels one way but is pressured to behave another, she really gets to shine. She is beautiful, enticing and tragic at different points and then all at once.DiCaprio achieves the same effect in his own unique way. He's always been able to portray a roller coaster of emotion and playing a man who is sensitive, a bit neurotic, but also quick to defend his manhood, he has to convincingly change his emotion. He succeeds and he has to, because Frank does this a lot. His most striking strength in this film is the sensitive side in the calms after he fights with April. It's chilling how real it feels from him.But as talented as these actors are, the parts are highly demanding. They fight, a lot, and about the same stuff, over and over again. Toward the end, their fights elicit laughter from the audience because of how over-the-top the two are forced to react to each other's piercing insults as they fly off the handle. The film needed more external stimulus of conflict, not conflict stimulated mostly by characters' thoughts. There's only so many beautiful angles and close-ups of faces that Mendes can do with a camera to maintain interest. Perhaps the point is that the Wheeler's drive themselves insane due to the nothingness that surrounds them, but films need more than that to engage us sometimes. They rarely interact with their children in the film, which would seem imperative to understanding part of their sacrifice, for example, and it would give them so much more to actually do.The film is quite tragic, but certainly relatable. Whether its fighting with a spouse or the feeling that you're going to let life slip away because you've chosen a certain lifestyle. There's plenty of time during the film for reflection as you evaluate the arguments and decisions and decide for yourself whether they are settling or need some change.One standout character is a man recently let of of a mental institution that the Wheelers meet as a favor to a their realtor (Kathy Bates). It's the realtor's adult son, played by Michael Shannon, who provides the film's irony--he sees the Wheelers twice, affirming their choice to make a change at first and exposing their flaws the second, digging at the contradictory roots of the film's two-faced subject matter. Shannon steals his scenes with both self-deprecating humor and by delivering his poignant lines with great strength. Why is he noteworthy in a cast with such incredible talent? Because his scenes are so refreshing in a film that is so densely wrapped up in conversation with itself, that relies on riding the coat tails of the intense emotion depicted by its characters. ""Revolutionary Road"" is nothing short of thought-provoking, it just needs to more energy and a grander purpose and that's something two of today's best actors can't entirely remedy though boy do they come close.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An emotional and dramatic insight into the 'American dream',"When I read the book last summer, I was mesmerized by Richard Yate's unsentimental, realistic portrayal of suburban life in the 1950s. He presented a young couple whose dreams of happiness and excitement are grounded by reality and responsibility. What is so unique about this story is the fact that the feelings that the couple (Frank and April Wheeler) experience could apply to anyone, no matter where or when you live. Unlike many stories set during this time period, Revolutionary Road is still relevant today.All this is perfectly captured in Sam Mendes' startling adaptation. Like in American Beauty, he does a magnificent job of bringing out the emotions of the characters and conveying the hopelessness of their situation. The characters are all flawed in various ways, but Mendes effectively turns these flawed people into three-dimensional, realistic humans that we ultimately come to care about - at least that's how I felt. We can identify with their hopes, fears and desires and we understand what feelings motivate them to take make sometimes drastic, even immature, choices. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the two leading characters, seem to effortlessly take on the mannerisms and personalities of their respective roles. Before the first ten minutes are over, we completely forget about their idealized romance in Titanic and they BECOME Frank and April Wheeler, a tragic couple torn apart by their clashing hopes and dreams and their inability to fully understand each other the way they had when they were younger and full of life and optimism. Both of them bring just the right intensity and emotion to their scenes, and we forgive them for their mistakes and flaws because they are quite simply human. Although the entire supporting cast is good, the main standout is Michael Shannon as John Givings, the son of a 'friend' of the Wheelers who is currently residing in a mental institute. He brings the perfect blend of brashness, confidence and magnetism to his character and it's satisfying to see that his work is being recognized. He manages to convince us, simultaneously, that he is as insane as they say yet, perhaps, that he is saner than any of the other characters. Providing the heavily dramatic and uber-serious movie with an occasional comedic moment, Shannon proves here that he has the acting chops to match the daunting, impressive presences and talents of DiCaprio and Winslet.In addition to a top-notch cast, Revolutionary Road boasts a subtly beautiful score, dazzling cinematography and fine costumes that truly represent, not only the time period, but the entire tone and message of the movie. Also, while making a few detours, the script stays faithful to the novel it is based on and does an excellent job of translating the book's feel, even though much of the emotion and drama in the novel comes more from the narration, what the characters are NOT saying, as opposed to the dialogue itself.All in all, while it might not be for those seeking an uplifting escape from reality, Revolutionary Road is a poignant, deeply thought-provoking look at life in the suburbs, a failing relationship and the complex labyrinth of the human mind.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's ironic how the two get together in this film to tear that image apart and portrait the reality about our every day commons lives, marriage and the conventionalities we evolve around. The problem with these couples is buying the marriage-deal with a mindset of both not having lived their lives fully just yet. The moral is educating young people to stop idealizing relationships and encourage them to develop restrain instead of getting entangled in situations where they must catch up with too many things all at once (their personal ambitions, their jobs, their kids, their marriage, their inner frictions ...).

A Road Ending In The Crash of The American Dream,If there is one thing that Sam Mendes seems to put across in his movies is that the American Suburbs are the last place you want to be. In American Beauty he introduced us to cast of characters who were anything but upfront about themselves and their inner desires. In Revolutionary Road it's a no holds barred grudge match with Sam Mendes in one corner and the image of 1950's American lifestyle.From the absolute beginning the movie doesn't wait to dive into the issues of marriage and discontent. The movie doesn't build like American Beauty but hovers around in the same tense area throughout the film. These people are unhappy and no one is sugar coating it.I would have given the film ten stars but it felt a bit manipulative at times. Constantly we are given images of misery and elusion to deep depression being experienced by the neighbors. Also the dismal existence of the 9-5 commuters and company men lined up in their dreary cubicles. We also get a glimpse into the mind of the non-conformist 50's mental patient. A tool used to show how in that period in American History people were conformed or suffer dire consequences. The dialogue is poetic but a bit too introspective for a young couple who are non-English majors. At times it feels like a propaganda film against the suburbs that Sam Mendes seems to have a distaste for. In the film there is no middle ground. It becomes either salvation or imprisonment forever in the torture which is the middle class existence.Sam is a master of his craft and this film shouldn't be looked over. Although by the end of the film you feel the director has struck a heavy tone; You rise or fall and hope to god that you don't fall.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Challenging film,"I've always thought that Leonardo DiCaprio was a very underrated actor, although Titanic probably puts a lot of people of the scent of his acting skills, it is quite anomaly in his acting career, most of which is exceptional. For example, before Titanic he had a very interesting role in 'What's eating Gilbert Grape', in which I didn't even recognise him and only realised it was him when I saw the credits, he was that believable. I think in his case he is in some people's eyes restrained by his youthful physicality but nevertheless, does possess range, charisma and authenticity in abundance.I thought this film was astonishing - very difficult to watch at times, as the arguments were so real, ferocious and sprawling. But I found it was in that starkness and reality that the compassion of the film came through, as it was so unblinking in confronting such difficult and ego-ridden issues. The characters were so believably self-contradictory, and confused, it was just like real life! I think this film might come across as a bit of a drag if you expect to be entertained rather than very hardly prodded. This is the type of movie that does invade your head space, but without providing any simplistic morality or easy answers. The plot is inconclusive and leaves a lot of unresolved tension, and it's definitely a film that asks more questions than it answers. For that reason I really liked it, but I can understand that others who see life as considerably less fraught with tension might wonder - what's all this fuss about?!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An awful couple shout at each other over and over again,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. None of the characters are likable. A boring man and a horrible woman don't achieve their pipe dreams, so they have loads of blazing rows. This unlikeable couple shout at each other at the top of their voices over and over and over again.There was so much hype and praise heaped on this film and The Reader in 2008 - yet both films are dreadful.

Thought provoking film with brilliant performances all around,"Sam Mendes' 'Revolutionary Road' is a film that certainly will not cheer you up. It is a haunting, thought provoking film that proves getting married and having kids isn't for everyone. Beautifully written with extremely well-sketched characters. A pretty cynical take on marriages and relationships actually but that's what made the drama so compelling. Brilliant performances all around. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio come together with great chemistry, pulling the best out of each other. Michael Shannon, Kathy Bates, David Harbour, and Kathryn Hahn are also turn in wonderful performances with Shannon steals the scenes every time he appears.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing!,"""I'll never let go jack, Ill Never Let Go"". Those were the last words that Kate Winslet said to Leonardo Di'Caprio just over 10 years ago in the film we all know as Titanic. A film which would be known to almost every human on earth. 10 years later the first words that would rekindle the on screen duo would be ""So what do you do?"" ""Im Studying to be an actress"" would be the reply.Here is my REVOLUTIONARY ROAD review.First off, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is not a movie for everyone. The movie is extremely slow and all it does is focus around a married couple living in a suburban community in the 1950's. The movie is directed by Sam Mendes who also directed the Oscar Nominated film American Beauty. My first complaint being that i felt this movie was just a little to much like American Beauty only set in a different time period, but i loved that movie so this was just as good to me. I just wish Sam Mendes could come out of the box a little bit and try something a little broader.Frank and April Wheeler are both around 30 with two kids who think that they can escape the traps of existence they have chosen. The movie begins with them meeting at a party and then goes straight to the marriage Frank works at a job he hates but continues there because the money is decent. April is an ""actress"" who believes she is destined for better things. One day April comes up with the idea just to drop everything, move to Paris and live the rest of their lives their. She can work as a Government secretary and Frank can ""find himself"". April later finds out she is 10 weeks pregnant. Could this stop them from going to Paris? Will they ultimately just be stuck on REVOLUTIONARY ROAD for the rest of their lives while Frank works at his crap poor job? What keeps them together? Is It Love or something else? The story of the characters was absolutely amazing. Some scenes I could not turn away from. I just sat there an gazed in trance at what was going on. The last 30 minutes of the movie really stand out. It was the last 30 minutes that I could not stop thinking about for a day. And the last scene in the movie. It has the Givings (neighbors) talking about Revolutionary Road and the new family that lives on the road. It is a scene that ends the movie perfectly, because it shows what could have been had things gone another way. I can not reveal what i mean by this exactly to those who have not seen the movie. But for those who have, they will know what i am talking about. It basically shows how the wheelers would have been had things gone a different way.The viewer should know in the first 15 minutes if it is going to be a movie that they should walk out of or stay and see what it has to offer.The movie is called Revolutionary Road because that is the road that they live on. My thoughts to the reason given for the title is because the movie is not just about Frank and April but about their neighbors and friends. The movie is Extremely realistic to most romances. Being married is not all about the high life. People cheat on each other. People like to try to act like the perfect family around others and then go home and be the exact opposite. That is life. This is what makes the movie brilliant. After viewing the movie i honestly did not know how i felt about it I knew the performances were amazing. All of them I would say Leo delivers the performance of his lifetime, and so does Kate. I really hope that it finally knocks her the Oscar she deserves.To be honest though, to me the most noted performance of the whole movie is actually by Michael Shannon. Michael having done most villainous roles or quick cameos really puts it all into his character. Michael plays John Givings who is a mathematician and has been hospitalized for insanity due to his genius thoughts and the fact that he says what everyone else wants to. It is his character to me that really opens up the movie and at times will make you laugh and get away from the dark moments surrounding the character. This goes back to the part where I talked about the title coming from the characters. John is the son of a couple that lives on Revolutionary Road and they try to act like they are perfect. They go over Frank and Aprils quite often and never mention their son until he gets out where they must confess that he is not right in the head and then actually have them meet with Frank and April. Later John has a scene with at the dinner table that i think should be remembered for a long time.The movie is very dark. The moments are dark. It goes deep into relationships and it goes deep into suburban life. This may be why it reminds me so much of American Beauty. The movie was so deep that as said before i did not know how i felt about the movie. I literally was thinking about the events and actions in the movie for the whole next day. I rate this as one of the best movies of 2008. It was so deep and dark.I give this movie a 9 out of 10. But like i said it is not for everyone. Only for those who are really into the development of characters or deep stories. I guess if you like American Beauty then there is a 80% chance you will like this as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This Road is Hard to Walk Through,(a short review) Leo and Kate are incredible and deserve a much needed Oscar nomination. For Winslet the win seems inevitable. Michael Shannon's brief screen time is enough to leave him embodied and printed into your soul. Kathy Bates is heartbreaking in a role she could have easily walked through but makes it nearly authentic.Director Mendes creates stunning moments that literally strike fear into the heart of the viewer. Deakins great cinematography is always crisp. Editing keeps a stunning pace. Thomas Newman's score is to die for.The second best film of the year! ****/****,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An incredibly HEAVY & ACCURATE portrayal of the greatest obstacle in life,"I guess Sam Mendes is a pretty dependable director. This is a near perfect movie.One of the heavy, sad themes of the movie is ""letting go of your inner child"". There are people that are fortunate enough to be put in positions that allow them to keep this part of themselves alive for their entire lives, but the truth is that isn't usually the case.The movie is a tale of 2 wonderful, creative, intelligent people basically being torn to pieces by everything that forms our world. In the end, I feel that behind it all, if Kate and Leo's characters were allowed to do exactly what they wanted to with their lives, they would have stayed in love and in a healthy relationship until death. Unfortunately, life does not always allow people to do whatever they've always dreamed of doing. That rarely seems to be the case, sadly enough.So here, you are presented with the demise of their love story. Yes, it is as depressing as you would assume it is and as depressing as people tell you it is.This movie sums up the biggest obstacle in life.What is ultimately the most dependable source of happiness in life? LOVE. What is the number one obstacle that gets in the way of making LOVE last? LIFE ITSELF. Everything else...It's a heavy movie and it certainly isn't going to make you feel great, but HELLO, this is a realistic portrayal of just what is going on every day. This is a struggle that ANYONE with a heart and a brain has to deal with, and therefore it is a universally powerful film.Of course there couldn't be much better candidates to star than Leo and Kate, they both made it beyond believable. Viewers complain that they couldn't get into the movie because they didn't like the characters - I think they need to realize that even the best people can go into psychotic, helpless, horrible phases once life has them by the balls.I also loved ""the lunatic"" who wasn't a lunatic at all just simply a man who had the world figured out a little too intensely and could see right through it, therefore had lost his desire to be a part of the system. Unfortunately there are people like all over the world. It's unfortunate that sometimes the most intelligent ones are the ones who lose the desire to maintain a ""stable life"". In the 50's I don't think this was as common as it seems to be now, so I guess they put him in a loony bin for his views... I got along with him great though!!!Sam Mendes knew exactly what he was doing. That's all I have to say.Blaaaaaa this movie just tackled so many of the most powerful and engaging things in life that I cannot stress how good it was. I could go on and on but I'm going to stop myself right here. I want to see it again, right now. God dammit.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Grand Crap,"This film was terrible....i could'nt believe how badly constructed it was. the 'most ' unforgivable fault was to cast Leonardo di Caprio for his role. He was soooo unconvincing in depicting his character.the relationship between Blanchet en Leonardo looked like that of a schoolteacher (Blachet) putting in on with her favorite student somewhat later in the movie it looked like Mother/son.....di Caprio was totally miscast-ed. then the story...unbelievable weak in execution....I mean fi. here is an urban family with two daughters which are hardly ever to be seen..... the couple's verbal, loud fights are never interrupted by crying children who wanted to know what's going on... the Drama...it was not Drama enough and the director never convinces in telling us the 'tragedy'.... the clue was meager and predictable..... a film which will be forgotten quickly.... the hardest to swallow part: a mediocre role by a wrongly casted Di Caprio.(like boy scout captain?)who should only play roles fitting his age or search a better make-up artist.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living,"If you are interested in entertainment then get an ""Iron Man"" or something like this – and this is not to be taken as a reproach, sometime we need just mindlessly relax. However if you would like to entertain meaning of your own life and re-examine its fundamental principles then this film is for you. Yes, this is Oskar-price material, in all respects, and I did enjoy it very much and not likely to forget any time soon. This is not mindless and manipulative, self-serving sludge, but something you can take home with you, keep and use it to improve your own life.The ""Revolutionary Road"" is not necessarily a street name; rather it is an attitude toward life. And so what if Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) are both seem to be an ""ordinary people""? They loved the house on ""Revolutionary Road"" - understand this as a symbol of self-creation. When we are young we are all 'potentiality', we are a blank slate to be filled with anything. Soon we settle and stop dreaming, stop examining our lives – this is like death. After a while, Frank's and April's lives became rather mundane, not 'revolutionary'. This became the physical death of April and the emotional death of Frank. Although Frank physically survives and now dedicated his life to his children, his responsibility to himself, as individual, is unfulfilled and there is no future for him as a person.The only authentic person in this story is Bill (Michael Shannon), who's happened to be psychotic and who undergone 27 shock therapy treatments, correction that society administer to make one socially acceptable; after all we can not just allow anyone forget their responsibility, don't we? He comes to the ""Revolutionary Road"" and feels at the right place, until Frank and April veer off this road. He's like their self-consciousness, unwavering and brutally honest; self-consciousness they would violently banish (Frank almost hits him and April is also angry at him). The fact that he is psychotic is another confirmation of his symbolism as anti-social construct of human psyche.The film does not answer any specific question, it only raise and examine issues from several perspectives. It strongly asserts that we must treat our lives very seriously, not just live them. It is not that we need to give up everything and move to Paris, no! Paris is not a place, it is a state of being where you still have dreams of self fulfillment and constantly reexamining your life seeking meaning of your existence. When other people allude to Frank and April that, literally taken, moving to Paris, is ill conceived, they are neither wrong nor shortsighted. Literally moving to Paris will not solve any problem; moving to 'Paris' must be done psychologically, as an act of self-reevaluation. And it is not a matter of responsibilities toward people you love, its most of all responsibility toward yourself, to know that you are not settled (i.e. dead) but actively seeking meaning of your existence, that you are 'full of life and blood' as Frank said – for if you stop this process you are also not very good for the people you love.Another interesting feature of the film is that it considers both freedom and constraint as dialectic opposites. Some people operate well and are very creative and fulfilled while constrained by a situation. You can always strive to be the best you can at you job, or be a good mother or father. Social constraints are not necessarily evil. For instance, look at the constraint of a religion – it is dogmatic but within these hard set canonical boundaries there is a great opportunity to improvise and achieve great results. On the other hand, some people can not deal with any constraint. Such people either create their own rules or are perpetually miserable while forced to live by rules of others. The former are the stuff from which great people are made of, the latter are eternally miserable.These are different facets of the human condition which is an essence of our nature. This film quietly and seriously deals with these important issues. It is a worthy addition to our path toward better self-knowledge.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Emotionally stimulating performances by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet make this a rewarding domestic drama,"Revolutionary Road is an emotionally blistering drama that tackles on mature subjects such as infidelity, abortion, and the struggle of following life-long dreams. It is honest, it is poignant, and it offers somewhat uncomfortable message about the difficulties of marriage when desires are not reached. Director Sam Mendes is the leader of bringing about this potent domestic drama and reuniting 'Titanic' stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet as lovers. The romance between the two stars however, is slightly different story here. While the blockbuster film showcases the blossoming romance between Dicaprio and Winslet, this film goes the opposite route, and does so by tackling the sad, but significant issues that can leave marriage, or perhaps a whole family clinging on the edge of divorcement. With an intelligent direction by Mendes and profound performances by the two leads, this movie makes for a solid work of art. Set in the 1950s, the film revolves around Frank (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) and April Wheeler (played by Kate Winslet), a Connecticut couple who's marriage is in turmoil and are struggling to deal with personal issues. April is struggling as a theater actress and is stuck as housewife, and Frank is working a white- collar job that he desperately can't stand and is having an affair with his co-worker. When they make plans to move to Paris where both can fulfill their life-long dreams, they see what they believe to be the light at the end of the tunnel for their marriage. But can they overcome their personal obstacles including April's unexpected pregnancy to succeed their goals?This film does not aim to tug at your heart springs, but it does offer a heart-wrenching truth about the fragility of the family when a couple's marriage reaches a dark period, especially when considering how high America's divorce rate has skyrocket in the past six decades. The story explores the dynamics of our lead couple as they struggle to come to terms with the obstacles bar from achieving their desires. One of the major aspects the story tackles is the idea of feeling trapped in a world where life is barred with seemingly endless limitations. The problem between the Wheelers is not each other, but their struggle to find a satisfying life in the suburbs. When they make a plan to move the family to Paris, that is when they become touched with hope for their domestic dilemma. But as the story advances, it becomes more and more evident that achieving you dreams is not always as easy as it seems. This accounts to some emotionally jarring revelations. Although the film occasionally slips into the pitfalls of utter melodrama, it is brutally honest is portraying the atmosphere of a broken family. And the helping hands behind the emotional resonance is Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet who both showcase true grit and powerful sentimentality in their roles, not perhaps not on the line with the chemistry they showcased when they were lovers on a sinking ship. The lead couple is greatly supported by Kathy Bates who makes for a tremendous role as their mutual friend who provides comfort in the dark days of their marriage.Revolutionary Road is a powerful domestic drama sparkling with riveting performances and an solid direction by Sam Mendes who embraces the material with strong intellect. This is certainly not a happy ride nor does it opens doors to much humor beyond the arresting melodrama, but that is a rewarding piece of work.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It will leave you Speechless,"Director Sam Mendes best known for his work behind the camera in American Beauty (2000) delivers a powerful and poignant film. The story revolves around a young married couple Frank and April Wheeler played to perfection by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet (she won the Oscar) who are desperately trying to break the conformity of 1950's living. Technically this film is astounding the shots are done beautifully the lighting creates all of the right moods and the score is just haunting. Also the emotion of the script is felt by the way that Leo and Kate play off of each other, I think that Leo has been coming into his own over the past few years with films like Blood Diamond and The Departed but for me this was definitely the best performance of his career. Kate did an outstanding job and like I stated before won the Oscar for last year, anyway see this film you might not enjoy it but you will definitely remember the journey down Revolutionary Road.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The ""american nightmare"" : REVOLUTIONARY ROAD","A dream interrupted abruptly before dawn. Hopes that the long-awaited break in the daily conventionality of a 'life miserable, sleepy, unsatisfied. Ten years on from 'American Beauty', Sam Mendes has again a picture of family and its subsequent disintegration filtered through an apparent normality of the facade, which actually hides concerns and falsehood. Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler are a couple middle-class New York in the Fifties, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an employee, April (Kate Winslet) an aspiring actress. The couple lives with two sons in a comfortable residential dwellings. Their frustrations are as crazy splintered and in fact, at the earliest sequences are seeing anything but edifying skirmishes that follow one another seamlessly. From the novel by Richard Yates 'Revolutionary Road' is an intimate and thorough investigation of the couple's relationship, set in a context, the fifties, so conformist as to be cloying and fake and plastic. Anxieties and fears of a young couple are well masked by a layer of total hypocrisy. The individual aspirations are unattainable goals victims of unavoidable constraints: one can not be what you are. We are allowed to dream, but as long as you keep our feet on the ground. Because in fact this is the crux of the film, where there is division between good and evil, victim and executioner, the only 'guilt' which is attributed to Frank and April is only that he believed it possible to materialize their dreams. For a moment. Endless moment. The American dream does not exist because it never existed, is simply unattainable utopia. Circumvent stereotypes, Sam Mendes enters with skill in the folds of American society, showing a disarming realism and 'objectivity disconcerting: the filmmaker happens to be English, but America knows more of an American himself. And among wild trails, pettiness irrelevant (he who betrays an 'insipid secretary, she is totally indifferent to the news because now no love for him) nothing is what it seems, where even sex is an outlet, a foothold to cling with the aim only to externalize their inner frustrations and drive: eloquent in this case the scene of intercourse in the car. A world where a boy with mental problems (the good Michael Shannon, Oscar nominated) and even the most lucid of all, the only voice out from the pack, but note the fact, fits with sincerity perspective through this sentence: ""It takes the liver to see the void, but It takes a lot more to see that there is hope."" 'Revolutionary Road' is a film slow and introspective, the time taken, in which everything is determined with extreme precision, photography and soundtrack to contribute effectively to the performance of individual sequences, especially the last, shocking and inevitable, in which the emotional tension explodes in a paroxysm becoming almost unbearable. Leonardo DiCaprio is very good, but Kate Winslet is amazing: so real, tangible. Gives the best interpretation of his career identifying himself with monstrous emotion: his every subtle gesture is thus a demonstration of impressive physicality. Commendable. A vision in the original language in this case and for a film focused primarily on the dialogues is almost necessary. 'Revolutionary Road' is a film disillusioned, gloomy, dreary, weary because so truthful and current, the Fifties serve as a perfect disguise of contemporaneity. You can live without dreaming, resigned to a life of mediocrity common and routine, if you do not need to change the city is still dead inside, do not need to have children and raised over then condemned to unhappiness. We Open the eyes then, a new day is looming. And the harsh realities of life to annihilate us.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sitting through torture would be less depressing than this film,"So you think life's tough? Well, you ain't seen nothing yet! If you really want to suffer, try living in 1950's suburban hell. In that period, women's freedom and choice of career was virtually non-existent, and whoever tried to shake this equation, often found themselves on the wrong side of society's ability to tolerant social turbulence.In American Beauty director Sam Mendes's adaptation of the bestseller Revolutionary Road, Frank and April Wheeler (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet together on screen for the first time since Titanic!), a young, suburban couple going through the motions of life. April, who doesn't want to play the role of the lonely housewife, makes life miserable for husband Frank, who can't seem to make her happy. When April comes up with a daring idea to relocate to Paris, France, the consequences of the decision manage to make the couple's life even glummer.Personally speaking, I found Revolutionary Road to be a depressing experience, lacking the optimism or cynicism director Sam Mendes demonstrated in films like American Beauty or Jarhead. Instead, everything that happened to the characters of the film was so tragic and sad, that I was counting the minutes for the thing to be over. The acting was good, but nothing we haven't seen before in the department of suburban melodramas - even those starring the same actors (Winslet was much better in Little Children, which was more or less similar to RR, except that it took place in modern day and was much more tongue-in-cheek fun). DiCaprio was OK, but good thing he earned his Oscar recognition for bigger, better roles like The Aviator and Blood Diamond and not this train-wreck of a film.Now, I don't know about you guys, but these sort of blunt, straight-out realistic dramas don't help me feel better about myself or get a better perspective of life (like I believe most films should do). Instead, this film just left me shattered, annoyed and disturbed - and truly unsatisfied.I gave it 5 point out of 10 (and only because of the decent acting).",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Revolutionary Road"" Dreamworks Pictures","""Revolutionary road"" teaches us that life is not always what is seems. The title of the movie is a contradiction. It means 2 different things. A lot of time in life, things do mean 2 different things at the same time. A lot of the time, things in life are not ""this way"" or ""that way"", instead they can be a combination of both sides. Thats what I think this movie is about.In the movie the two lead characters came to a cross roads and needed to make a decision. Once the decision was made, things seemed to happen to them - in a very unexpected way. In a way both of the characters changed. Or did they take on each others' reciprocated personalities - like a chameleon - like a reflection in the mirror?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The dark side of suburbia,"For a British director Sam Mendes seems to have a great understanding of American culture and he has a great interest in the darker side of American culture. Mendes reunions Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio for this dark, gritty piece of Americana set story.Winslet and DiCaprio play April and Frank Wheeler, a unhappy married couple that live in 1950s East Coast America in the suburbs. April was a failed actress and a housewife whilst Frank is an unhappy salesman for the same company his father work at. Outwardly people thing they are the perfect couple with a nice family; but no one knows what happens behind closed doors. Desperate for a chance April suggest to Frank moving to Paris so he can find himself and be happy in the city of live. April has plans on how the move would work and the two make serious preparations to move the family abroad. But event conspirer against April's plans and whilst the married couple have a brief period of happiness their relationship becomes very strained.Revolutionary Road is an actor's film: it is filled with excellent performances with DiCaprio and Winslet at their best. They are believable as the couple of the piece and this is such a realistic scenario about how a relationship going wrong. The supporting performances were excellent, with people believing the illusion of the Wheelers and the other character seeming to have a need for it. This is most evident with the female characters Helen (Kathy Bates) and Milly (Kathryn Hahn).Mendes handles the material, trying to balance out both April and Frank's good and bad part and they both change amongst themselves as the protagonist and the antagonist. He gets the best out the actors and his skill behind the camera adds to the power, like when April has to make a phone call and the camera moves away and April gives the audience a voice-over. Mendes could have easily have shot the film in a dark hand-held style which is popular at the moment. Yet Mendes kept he kept the film well lit and its offers a great juxtaposition of the nice setting of suburbia and the darkness of the relationship. There are excellent themes in the film, there is the idea of broken and unfulfilled dreams, an important aspect in some of American literature like Of Mice and Men. There is the obvious film of a relationship going wrong, with the people starting a family and creating a home just because it's the normal thing, not because it's the best thing to do. As well the film looks at the idea of illusion that people will put up to protect themselves and other people believing it. Revolutionary Road was very much like American Beauty, looking at the dark underbelly of American suburbia, but this time, set in the 50s.Whilst the film is very strong for the most part, they could have shown a little more about how the relationship broke down in the first place and the children did not play a big a role as they should have.Revolutionary Road is a melodrama: but it's an very good melodrama and sometimes that is what the audience needs.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not revolutionary but interesting adult drama,"I'm a fan of Sam Mendes' direction and his style in clear in this movie, which is one of the film's strong point. There are other strengths: the acting is good by just about everyone involved but especially Kate Winslet (who does a much better American accent than the usual grating attempt); the topic is interesting (marriage problems); and the treatment is mature. And there are some genuinely deep moments in the movie that any married couple will relate to. Mendes does suburban angst better than anyone in cinema but his theatrical roots show at times with the staged scenes and clunky dialogue.DiCaprio just can't carry off heavy roles - he looks like a wee boy in a grown-up's suit. The film is based on a Sixties' book and inherits some of the sexism from that era (but not intentionally or ironically). And, at the end of it, it doesn't say a great deal... except that marriage is not the idealised perfection that romantic novels lead you to believe.But for the acting, interesting topic, cinematography, music and atmosphere, it's well worth catching and markedly better than most movies. Watching this movie is time and money well spent.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The American Dream,"I usually do not post in forums, comments, etc... but I felt like I needed to after I saw this influential film and the type of feedback it was receiving. The feeling this movie gave me is something I have never felt in my life. Sam Mendes does a wonderful job directing while both he and Justin Haythe adapt this Richard Yates novel into a screenplay... however, the biggest element that shined in this film was the superb acting.I don't consider myself a movie guru, but I do know a lot about the general aspects that build a powerful film. Revolutionary Road was a complete outlier, as it struck chords I didn't even know I was aware of. I have been married for almost 3 years... I love sociology and I have written papers on American Institutionalism... which this move depicts very well in the 1950s. It was a time of change, a time of conformity, and time of confusion for Americans....The two main characters in this movie - April (Kate Winslet) and Frank Wheeler (Leo Dicaprio) had a connection that only deep lovers may understand... I know many argue otherwise... but seriously... if both you and your spouse lift yourselves above the 'Marriage' institutionalism ideal... you will begin to realize, that we are both just two humans questioning a sociological constructed ideal called 'Marriage'. The way Mendes depicted this movie was flawless... there were moments I felt completely disconnected with reality and had almost a sense of eeriness watching the couple interact during their ongoing conflict in the film.The movie probably won't appeal to the masses... but if you are aware of socially constructed ideals and institutionalism, you will find this film hard to forget. I think both actors did a wonderful job... I have never seen such emotional and flawless acting. Leo definitely got snubbed for the Oscars... I never really watch the Oscars, but the fact that he didn't' even get nominated has sincerely frustrated me.Watch this film. Truly a quality piece that will show you an ongoing battle within every marriage... it is just a matter of how tolerant and willing you are to play 'the game'. I admire the couple for their willingness to be free-spirited and aware of their predicament. Marriage is socially constructed... it is NOT natural... despite the advantages, it just isn't. It is a form of social control delivered by a higher agenda that we may never come to realize.We still fall victim to love though, and this movie depicts the struggle and realization of this institutionalized cage of marriage and individualism.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why Did They Bother,"This film depressed and bored the pants off me, the only thing remotely interesting or entertaining was Kate Winslet's curious American accent.With a prosaic storyline and stilted dialogue I was left wondering how on earth anyone could ever think this film was ever worth making, then I realised - DiCaprio & Winslet reunited; a marketing department's dream.I predict this film will do exceptionally well..... at the Razzies.Anyway, I made a note of the Director's name - Sam Mendes - won't be going to any more of his dross again!P.S.

Revolutionary Road...   You say you want a revolution?,"Revolutionary Road: 9 out of 10: The strangest complaint about this movie is that it is painful to watch and too realistic. For example one critic exclaims “It's unbecoming -- and it should be worked out in private, not in a movie theater."" another claims.“This is a movie about two people in pain; the last thing they need is for Mendes to turn his cool camera on them."" This is a serious depiction the disintegration of a marriage. Why should we be expecting musical numbers? Are we so used to “everything will work out” American movies with big name stars that we now demand successful conclusions? If you have, you ever sat through a Holocaust film or a movie involving a dog named Yeller you know the eternal truth .This is not going to end well. Kate Winslet gives an outstanding performance; this should surprise no one. (The fact she actually keeps her top on, for once, may raise a few eyebrows however among a disappointed throng.) Leonardo DiCaprio’s performance is her equal in every way; and there is no denying in those 15 odd years after Titanic that these two stars have even more chemistry than before. The rest of the cast is also beyond top notch with Kathy Bates as a venomous realtor, a particular stand out. Sam Mendes’ direction also shines. He keeps the camera pointed at both the actors and seemingly their characters souls. In addition nobody uses focus and character placement better than Mendes. Each frame seems its own work of art The plot is simple. Winslet and DiCapiro are married with two kids. He works in a dead end job in Manhattan, while she takes care of the kids and lives in quiet desperation in suburbia. If there is a problem with the set-up, it is that women in the audience may be noticeably envious of Winslet’s lifestyle while the men may hanker for a do nothing, three martinis, fling with the secretary, job. Life in the fifties, at least for the white, upper middle class, does not seem very bad on the surface. That said the yearning and the subsequent disastrous consequences seem all too true. Winslet and DiCapiro fight like real couples do. Starting small and quickly hitting at each other’s hot buttons. Winslet has the emotion heft in the arguments, and comes across as the stronger person; wounded by life. DiCapiro, ironically, only has the fact he is right to keep him afloat. (Moving to Paris would solve nothing, he is as trapped as she is, and neither of them is special.) I do have a couple of nitpicks with Revolutionary Road. The conveniently disappearing children are a problem. Director Mendes trots them out for a few scenes in the middle of the film but honestly, they are never underfoot, and as real children is when marriages disintegrate. In addition, that fact that Winslet’s Stepford wife routine does not raise DiCaprio’s eyebrows towards the end of the film raised my eyebrows. He seemed a little more clued enduring the proceeding to let that pass by unnoticed. I did recognize the arguments that couples have, as well as the quandary of following your dreams rather than being happy with whom you are. (Following your bliss can lead to much misery in real life; both for yourself and those that love you.) Then again, we have only one life, so how should we spend it. I do not see this argument between flights of fantasy and a practical life being solved anytime soon. However, as short as our time on Earth is, I cannot help but recommend spending two hours of it in the company of Winslet and DiCapiro. Revolutionary Road is simply one of the best films of 2008.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A visually stunning, expertly acted, good-looking and well-made drama","If one thing can be said about Mendes, it's that his career has been very eclectic: although all three of his previous movies have depicted distinctly American themes, each was in an entirely different genre and setting. With Revolutionary Road, Mendes comes full circle with his first film, American Beauty, and explores similar themes but with far more subtlety. It is this subtlety that I felt was eventually the film's biggest flaw, but we'll get to that later. Let's start with what was good, in the film, and that gives us a lot of ground to cover. As with his previous films, the production value is truly second to none. With the costume and set design, Mendes has managed to flawlessly capture Eisenhower-era American suburbia of the 1950's down to every little detail of the period. And second-time-collaborator Roger Deakins provides a startling, subtle-but-beautiful visual look for the film, perfectly capturing both the period and the contrast between its diffused, sunlit posterior to the stormy, tremulous interior of the lives of the protagonists.The story itself is simple but allows for the profound, in-depth exploration of themes. While Mendes' previous films have appeared broad, well-known ensemble casts, with this film he goes a little subtler, and aside from his two main players the cast are mostly unknowns. That said, he was blessed with his two leads, who are two of the best actors working today and also two of my favourites: Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who worked together for the first time over 10 years ago on Titanic, have proved that they have grown up significantly since the cruise liner disaster movie. Their performances are simply riveting, and they truly bring the fairly simple story of the film to life. While DiCaprio, an actor who has really been rising recently in terms of the quality of his projects and the range of his acting, delivers a striking, dramatic, visceral performance; and yet, distinction can be made that, in my opinion, Winslet out-acts DiCaprio: I haven't read the original novel but from the movie I got the impression that it was more about her than about him. So with Winslet taking center stage, she really delivers on a tremendous level. She nails everything from body language to subtle character quirks to the large, bombastic, dramatic fight scenes, and delivers a performance so poignant and resonant that one can't help but admire her. The thing with Winslet is that she does this with pretty much every role, which is why she is such a good actress in my opinion.So what's the movie really about? Well, I saw it as an examination, a breakdown of the American Dream. The classic meaning of that term is divided into three major categories: liberty, prosperity and the pursuit of happiness. The film seems to shoot this very mythological idea of the American Dream down, and depicts a situation in which one category comes in stead of the other: in order to be free, we must release ourselves from the obligations of financial success. In order to be rich and prosperous, we must give up our freedoms and liberties in life. And happiness? I felt that the film dealt most with happiness, as both freedom and prosperity seem to contain a little bit each of that third category, but in both cases true, complete happiness seems to be a compromise in both cases. What is the meaning of happiness? Shouldn't two beautiful children, a large, cozy home and financial security also ensure happiness? Or must me always seek more from life? Both characters in the film are adulterous, but they also both find out that infidelity is not an effective escape from their unhappiness. One gets the impression, that even if the characters would end up moving to Paris, they would be unhappy there as well, and what fuels their temporary happiness seems to be the fantasy of getting away, and not the actual act.With Revolutionary Road, his fourth film, Sam Mendes has crafted yet another visually stunning, expertly acted, good-looking and well-made drama; the performances by DiCaprio and Winslet are simply phenomenal, and while the plot seems simple, it contains complex characters and explores deep, rich themes. Here within lies Revolutionary Road's biggest flaw: Mendes has explored these themes of the meaning of the American Dream before, in his debut film and the utter masterpiece American Beauty, and I felt that the former film explored these themes and delivered that message far more effectively than this latest one. Where Revolutionary Road was restrained and subtle, American Beauty went all-out and held nothing back. And it is this very repetition that restricted this film to being good but not the masterpiece I was hoping it to be.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence,"In the cinema certain historical periods seem to become associated with a particular set of ideas. Thus a 1960s setting is often used (as in the recent ""Doubt"") as shorthand for ""clash between traditional conservative values and progressive modern ones"". The 1950s, by contrast, are often seen (as in ""Far from Heaven"") as a period of stifling social conformity when conservative values went unchallenged by progressive ones, particularly in proverbially conformist suburbia.""Revolutionary Road"" set in a Connecticut suburb in 1955, is not a remake with a period setting of ""American Beauty"", Sam Mendes' earlier film about suburban life. That film is, among other things, a satirical black comedy, combining satire with a character study of the leading characters and a philosophical exploration of the meaning of happiness. It contains surreal or supernatural elements, being, for example, narrated by the ghost of a dead man. ""Revolutionary Road"", by contrast, is more realistic and tells the story of the tragic disintegration of a failing marriage, treating its characters as rounded individuals rather than simply as objects of satire.The two films, however, do have something in common. Like Lester Burnham in ""American Beauty"", Frank Wheeler seems, superficially, to be living the American dream as a fully paid-up member of the middle class. He has a career in marketing, a charming house, an attractive wife and two young children. Beneath this façade, however, Frank and his wife April are deeply unhappy. April is dissatisfied with her life as a housewife, and Frank dislikes his job.Two things happen on Frank's thirtieth birthday. He begins an affair with a secretary from his office, less through sexual desire (she is less attractive than April) than through boredom. When he arrives home, however, April makes a surprising proposal, namely that they move to Paris, with April working as a secretary to support the family so that Frank can discover what he truly wants to do in life. After initial reluctance, Frank is won round to this idea, but then two further events cause him to have second thoughts. Frank's talents are noticed by a senior executive in his firm, who offers him a promotion to a better-paid position. April becomes pregnant with their third child, and Frank informs her that in the circumstances it will be better of the family remain in America.Lester is in many ways a flawed individual, but I suspect that most viewers of ""American Beauty"" will sympathise with him rather than with his cold, snobbish and neurotic wife Carolyn. With ""Revolutionary Road"" I suspect that their sympathies will be more evenly divided. Mendes avoids the standard clichés of portraying April as a free spirit and her husband as a complacent bourgeois conformist, or of arguing that the only life worth living is the bohemian one. Frank is dissatisfied with life not because the suburbs are intrinsically dull or because he is temperamentally unsuited to life as a businessman but because his talents are not recognised at work. When he receives his sudden promotion, he realises that he is doing a worthwhile job which will enable him not only to support his family but also make a wider contribution to society. His main fault is that he has failed to realise just how unhappy his wife has become.April is not a bad person, and has genuine causes of unhappiness, rooted in the social codes of the period which frowned upon married women, especially married women with children, from working outside the home. Nevertheless, she is portrayed as having faults of her own, rooted in intellectual snobbery and what might be called the ""grass is always greener"" mentality. She believes that she and Frank are unique and special, too good for the life of the suburbs. She sees the proposed move to Paris as the solution to all the family's problems without considering whether this is what Frank really wants. After this move falls through she too has an affair, with their neighbour Shep Campbell, even though he is precisely the sort of suburbanite she normally despises; his main attraction for April is that he is not Frank.The film reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since ""Titanic"". Although I never really liked DiCaprio in his heart-throb phase in the nineties, ""Revolutionary Road"" confirms the message of ""Catch Me if You Can"" and ""The Aviator"", that he has matured into a fine actor. As for Winslet, her husband clearly knows how to get the best out of her; she really deserved the Oscar for this film, not for her technically proficient but soulless performance in the very overrated ""The Reader"". Frank and April are, despite their faults, both such vibrant, likable people that we find ourselves desperately wishing in our hearts that a happy ending will be possible for them, even though we know in our heads that the differences in their personalities make that unlikely.The title is deliberately ironic; ""Revolutionary Road"" is the name of the street where Frank and April live, but there is little revolutionary about their lifestyle or that of their neighbours. Nevertheless, the film is not really a satire on suburban life; Mendes was no doubt aware that when the cinema indulges itself in anti-suburban satire the result can look uncomfortably like snobbish humour at the expense of those little people unfortunate enough not to have the telephone number salaries enjoyed by Hollywood moguls and stars. It should rather be seen as a moving human drama. DiCaprio himself said of it that ""There's rarely a movie nowadays about people and their normal struggles to find happiness in their life"". He is, of course, right about the rarity of such movies, and good ones on this theme are still rarer, but 2008 produced at least two excellent examples, ""Revolutionary Road"" and Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"". A pity that Mendes and Eastwood did not receive more recognition from the Academy. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
HK Neo Reviews: Revolutionary Road,"Tagline: A bravo effort that keep us dreamingReview by Neo: It's been too long since the pairing of one of cinema's most successful pairing ever in the film, Titanic. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have aged considerably since their last outing, but there are no doubts that both have learned and matured in their respective craft of acting. Not to mention, watching the two acts together, seems more like seeing a family in the neighbourhood arguing against each other, than actual acting. It is this dramatic pairing that made the film works and combining this with Academy Award winning director of American Beauty (Sam Mendes), and the illuminating script based on a book by Richard Yates which all contributed to the success of this film. True, that despite Winslet being the younger of the two, looks much older than the baby faced DiCaprio, but both puts in an incredible display of domestic, yet flawed characters, who are struggling to find their inner soul and ultimately their purpose of life. Living in the conservative age of 1950s, in an era of McCarthy's witch hunts and an age where people seems to live within the boundaries of their comfort zone, Revolutionary Road, portrays difficult and relevant yet ageless ideas through the eyes of two characters, Frank and April Wheeler.What made this movie so relevant, despite the fact that it is concerned with the conservatism of the 1950s, is that history repeats itself, whether you like it or not. Not unlike myself, sitting in an office, working on things that I do not have a fascination in, is hardly inspiring or noteworthy. It is true though that in today's society, people need money to survive and out of the millions of people, not everyone can earn a living and do what they like and enjoy. Living a dream is possible, but it isn't easy. That's not to say that working in things you do not enjoy doing is easy, as it is not, but as the saying rings so true – to pursue a dream is difficult, but letting go is harder. Revolutionary Road works because, it relates to reality, it questions the status quo, it defies the convention and empathises on just how difficult it is just to live and survive.In what I would say as a more Oscar worthy performance than her display in The Reader; Kate Winslet steals the show in an illuminating display of a conflicted character that is torn between her role as a traditional mother and her lifelong dream of something better, something more interesting and something closer to her dream. Winslet is a dreamer, who longs to be romantic, but when her relationship with Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) becomes more and more distant, there is a certain uncertainty and sadness within her eyes that made her character different and ultimately allows the audience to take her side, even if she alludes to the stage of cheating. There is no doubt that Winslet and DiCaprio both hits off each other in an impeccable manner and their timing, chemistry, eyes, contact are just seamlessly natural to endure.Likewise, DiCaprio does not put a foot wrong and it's been a while where it is so difficult to find any fault in one's acting. Not unlike Winslet, Leo is a tormented soul, but rather than like Winslet, he is more willing to except his surrounding and the responsibility of taking care of his family as the head of household. Leo has come a long way since Titanic and there is no question that he has gone one better in each film and every year thereafter. He was catchy and standout in Catch Me If You Can, defiance in Aviator, conflicted and smart in The Departed, it is pretty certain by now, that DiCaprio will be able to play any role thrown or given to him. He is the kind of actor that creates a sense where he is impossible to dislike, and certainly in the scene where he explodes at his wife at home. The scene in the forest could easily have been hampered by overacting if played by a lesser light. This is a competent display of acting and I am somewhat disappointed that DiCaprio is not recognised with a nomination for this fine display.Although it is not always true, but director Sam Mendes manages to counteract the ideal of an American Dream. It is rather ironic that we have to work hard in our lives, most likely in jobs that you would never have dream of becoming in order to reaps the rewards in the future of going on a holiday, relaxing on the horizon, showering yourselves with gifts or wants. At the same time, Mendes is a realist or perhaps writer Richard Yates is, as after all, we all need to eat, survive, before we can truly enjoy ourselves.All in all, the Revolutionary Road is not a movie that will leave you satisfied and content about the where we are in our lives, but rather allow the audience to dream a little, live a little and feel a little. Life isn't all about work and therefore it is important for everyone to be able to find a balance, between the need to survive and also the wants that provides us with hope, an aim and perhaps a purpose to live on. Before we all become, corporate robots, working mechanically on a routine task on a day to day basis, take a moment to remember what you used to dream about, what you used to want and at its very core, what do you want in your life. Personally, I know what I want, and despite being struck at this corporate desk in breezy afternoon, I haven't stopped dreaming and nor should you either  (Neo 2009)I rate it 8.5/10www.thehkneo.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A great insight on the ""emptiness"" deep down","A great performance by both Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio! Their chemistry is far more visible in this movie rather than in ""Titanic"". They have both grown into complete actors and with this movie they have proved that they can mirror a wide range of emotions convincingly and also that they can lure the audience into entering a (non)fictional world without taking notice of anything else.The movie portrays the story of two human beings in an American 1950's suburb that hold a battle against each other and against themselves. The battle is held for the freedom of the soul; it is a rebellion against mediocrity and the greatest tragedy people face everyday. It is a movie that raises many questions regarding Life and what people do with it.I believe that a movie like this can't do anything else, but leave a bitter taste in one's mouth because it depicts exactly what we don't want to face. A mere handful of people do indeed take advantage of this frail gift we possess - Life, but most allow it to pass by them much like strangers in the street. Most might dislike this movie especially because it tells this bitter truth that we don't want to acknowledge.Watch the movie!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revolutionary Road hardly revelatory,"The drive from the train station is not that far. Once you get past the first stretch, home to local folk like plumbers, seamstresses and the like, you turn on to a quaint, quiet road. The house that will hopefully soon be the home to you and your children, present and future, sits atop its tiny slope, understated but proud. As you drive past the other homes, you see the people that inhabit them. The children run under sprinklers; the parents sit on their porches and enjoy their afternoon cocktails. They all look so happy, so home. This is what you need. This is what will make you happy too. This is Revolutionary Road. Only, it isn't really that. What it is really, is Sam Mendes' REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, and just like the pretty picture it paints, it isn't as revelatory as it inherently suggests nor does it bring the happiness you thought it might.Mendes has been down this particular road before. In the Oscar winning, American BEAUTY, Mendes explored the trappings of suburban life. It was hardly revelatory when he did it then but screenwriter, Alan Ball's unique take on the subject made it feel fresh and relevant. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is based on Richard Yates' 1961 novel of the same name. It tells the story of Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet), the lovely, new couple who have bought the aforementioned house at the end of Revolutionary Road and who bring with them the promise of youth and vitality. You see, the Wheeler's are special. Everyone has always said as much. Then they moved to Revolutionary Road. They made their house into a home and filled that home with two wonderful children. It was at this point that they realized that they may not truly be as special as everyone has always said, that perhaps they are not destined for anything greater than what they already have.Leo and Kate are perfectly cast as the Wheeler's. More than ten years after TITANIC, the pair are together again and now everyone gets to see exactly what might have happened if the couple had survived the boat going down. (I trust I gave nothing away there.) And while there is nothing romantic about their reunion, they are REVOTIONARY ROAD's one true revelation. Winslet is remarkable. She is subtly but always at odds with herself inside. She wants to love her life, her husband, and on some level, she does. But she is also yearning and desperate to feel alive. DiCaprio is a bit shaky but while April's hand is less than reassuring, Winslet's hand lifts him and elevates his performance to nearly the same level as hers. To watch the two of them go back and forth between being hopeful for their futures and dismally resigned to a lifetime of unhappiness is a ride well worth taking and one that will certainly leave you dizzy by the time it comes to its harrowing close.The problem with REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is that Mendes seems more concerned in presenting the Wheeler's as a symbol for the greater point instead of allowing them to just be the relatable characters that they are. Frank and April are special. When we begin to buy into the idea that we are just like everyone else is when we become just like everyone else. When a film tries to make a point instead of just allowing the point to make itself is when a film takes on an importance it did not earn to start. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD could have been beautiful if it wasn't trying so hard to be the biggest house on the block.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Totally enthralling and painfully realistic drama,"This drama is so well made and both Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet are so exceptionally good in their dramatic interpretation that I often forgot I was watching a movie. Leonardo di Caprio really excels and you cannot avoid empathizing with his character.The director of American beauty does another brilliant job at depicting the frustration of leading an ordinary existence and the devastating consequences that a desperate need to find a way out might lead to. This time though with an emphasis on drama and tragedy; there is no comic relief here to help you hide from the pain. Revolutionary road is a movie that explores the inner struggle of trying to reconcile the dream of doing something extraordinary with our lives with the perspective of inevitably conforming to what everyone else does. In the second part of the story all the way to the ending an ominous thriller-type atmosphere bleeds into the drama and by then you are totally enveloped in the character's lives, anxiously waiting to find out how they will end up.This part might contain spoilers:After the inebriation of finding each other, getting married and having children, husband and wife find themselves becoming the ordinary people they had promised themselves never to become. Leonardo di Caprio's character is an intelligent and imaginative man who has a job he hates and Kate Winslet's character is an actress turned housewife, suffocating at the idea that their dreams may have been lost forever in their middle class existence. In an attempt to escape the hopeless emptiness they feel closing in on them, she suggests a drastic change. They decide to throw caution to the wind and take off to start a new life in Paris, where people ""really live"". Their plan injects new energy into their relationship and into their dreams but the euphoria is short-lived, as life takes a series of twists that will change their future for ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revolutionary Road,"Revolutionary Road was a great film in many aspects. First the powerful acting delivered by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet. Second the dialogue was absolute genius.

It baffles me that this movie didn't get more nominations and Leo and Kate needed nominations for this movie, but this isn't the first time I've seen Leo get shafted by the Oscars. The story of two people only in love with the idea of each other, getting married having children and trying to do the right thing with everything that's wrong finally clashes and is told so brilliantly and believably in this movie.

He works not because he loves doing it but to support his family. The couple looked perfect for the outside world .

In fact Michael Shannon the crazy guy slams on Frank's face when he heard of change of plans.Campbell couple thought it was a crazy idea but then they were even scared to accept the fact themselves.The movie title is also very intriguing with a flavor of sarcasm.

My rating: 9,"Always, when I see Leonardo DiCaprio showing in a movie I am not really enthusiastic but many of the movies with him are very good. As this one is.It is about this how harder is for the trivial world to become different. And is it possible for the different world to become trivial? Isn't it every well-known path a revolutionary road? I hope that I will not insult someone with this - the spirit of Europe loves expressionists and expressionism, while on the opposite pole there is spirituality which finds life there cheap figuratively and literally. From the one side you can hear laughter and from the other sad crying which is capable of being happy because of the unhappiness of the others. But which one where is it? This movie shows the moment of exhausting of a relationship and the different points of view capable of supporting it. To believe on someone else's promise or to believe on your own? And if to be grown up means to give yourself up... I will not make conclusions instead of you. And about this to be wondering to keep your unborn child or not, or for the abortion in general, about this I will never change my opinion.The moments in the wood were showing the unmistakable calculations of the elementary mathematics of truth. In its hard for reading signs, the under-questionable or without-questionable everyday life stays behind. To stay in the moment of falling in love - to state your love again and again. And to lose everything. This is the sad aftermath.Incredible soundtrack. Film that assure you that you are alive and you can feel things.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Familiar Territory, Much Over-praised","""Revolutionary Road"" is a not-very-good recapitulation of a certain mind-set about the 1950's previously explored by ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,"" ""Organization Man"" and ""Little Boxes Made of Ticky- Tacky."" Sam Mendes has been down this road before (American Beauty) and done it better.In my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio is already past his prime as a high voltage star, and, although she was praised for her role in this movie, Kate Winslet is no longer an appropriate co-star for DiCaprio. She's a far better actor and their scenes together give off the dampest of sparks.It's the premise of this movie that fails to convince me. Despite the critics, most adults in the 1950's were seeking high paying jobs (which did not bore them to death) and most couples wanted a home in the suburbs to raise their kids. True, the system was hardest on the wives. Many of them were college educated and struggled with the wifely routine that society imposed on them. The Feminist movement had not yet caught fire. When I was a young adult in the 1950's, college educated women stayed home to raise the kids but they also found an outlet in community affairs and other worthwhile activities. Most of the women I knew returned successfully to the work force when the kids were old enough.It's not clear whether Winslet's character has been to college -- only that she has ambitions, first, to be an actress and, second, to quit the Connecticut suburbs for Paris. DiCaprio's ""organization man"" is also drawn to the Paris idea but two developments interfere. First, the wife becomes pregnant with their third child, and second, the husband is offered a substantial promotion.The rest of the story is melodramatic and will not be summarized here. Kate Winslet has proved her mettle as an actor, and she does the best she can with a weak role. DiCaprio also does the best he can (which is not very much) with his role. And Mendes should have stood in bed. I awarded this a 4 only because of Winslet. She IS an amazing actress. Frankly, the worst thing about Revolutionary Road is that it was completely boring.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Dark and unsettling but fascinating,"This takes place in the mid-1950s in Connecticut. There's a young couple named Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet). They have a big beautiful house in the suburbs and two kids...but they're miserable. Frank hates his job and April's dreams of becoming an actress are shattered. Things slowly get darker and more serious and leads to a disturbing ending.This is NOT a feel-good film. It's dark and unpleasant but it is an incredible look at the dark side of the picture perfect American suburb of the 1950s. The cars, clothes, furnishings and music are right on target. The acting by the leads is incredible. DiCaprio explodes in his role. He's miserable and slowly gets angrier. He's downright terrifying! Winslet had the much more difficult role of his wife but she's brilliant. You see her crumbling inside and trying to hold herself together. Just incredible. Everybody is good but a little extra credit goes to Michael Shannon playing the dangerously crazy John. There is some humor though. I got a big kick out of one woman who smokes constantly in the movie even when she's pregnant!There are a few missteps. This does have its slow parts and the kids the couple have seem to disappear completely for long periods of time.

Depressing....yet Strangely Captivating,"This movie is a downer, no doubt about it. However...I remained glued to the screen, from beginning to end. The movie sucks you in. I think it's the ""realism"" aspect.You feel like you're a fly on the wall, peeking into these people's lives back in the 1950's...a time when being married and living in suburbia was the epitome of the American dream (or so I've been told). What more could you want? Evidently, the answer to that question is: Plenty. Especially if you are April Wheeler, portrayed by Kate Winslet in this movie.April is married to Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio)...a charming smooth talker who has one of those mysterious jobs in an office where no one is quite sure what he does. He claims to hate the job, yet we see him laughing with buddies and making the best of things. Meanwhile, April, a ""failed actress,"" is stuck at home with two children...feeling miserable and sorry for herself all the time. She wants...MORE. She wants to feel that their life is ""special.""Well, the story chugs on...April is depressed...Frank is kind of just getting by...the couple has plenty of tiffs and disagreements and just don't seem to be connecting any more. Until April comes up with this ""FANTASTIC"" idea, which is that the family will run off to Paris to live! In April's mind, for some strange reason, Paris is the ultimate solution to boredom. And when will they go? In September.Suddenly, with this plan in mind, April is happy...for a while. But then...life gets in the way, possibly spoiling her great ""Paris Plan."" Now she is miserable, once again. (So many ups and downs in this movie...mostly ""downs,"" though). There are other things going on...cheating for one...and an interesting character in the form of Kathy Bates' son, who is a bit insane.But mostly, this is a movie about the fantasy of living ""happily ever after"" disintegrating into the drudgery of reality. The characters seem real...the emotions, as well. Granted, this movie would not be for everyone, but I found it very interesting. Not uplifting, mind you...but interesting. Messy relationships always are. The acting, I feel, is excellent. Do I recommend this movie? Absolutely. If you are into ""messy relationship"" plots and realistic characters. It packs a punch.I'm not a fan of April's character, by the way. I think she was her own worst enemy in this. Happiness is a state of mind...not a country.

What Life Would You Like to Choose?!,"Great thought-provoking and sad film from Sam Mendes.

It's just... empty, it leaves me absolutely nothing at all to ponder with, a totally opposite reaction from Mendes' previous work, all which contain 10 times the charm, beauty, humor, and depth of this film.

"The Real ""Leave it to Beaver""","As human beings, we crave stability. The thought of sameness and certainty brings us a certain degree of comfort. But being comfortable and ordinary means sacrificing our chance to be truly extraordinary. To what degree do we give up our dreams for a sense of comfort and normalcy? Is an ordinary life worth giving up the chance to be someone special?Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) are a happily married couple. Frank is a dreamer, and wants to go back to Paris because people are ""alive"" there, but after April became pregnant, they moved to the suburbs to live a normal life. But April is not happy as an ordinary housewife, and Frank is just as miserable having ended up in a job that he swore to avoid. So they decide to move to Paris so that they can live the life that they were ""meant"" to. But are they willing to take that chance?In 1997, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet created one of the greatest screen romances of our time in ""Titanic."" Eleven years later, the real life best friends have returned on screen together in an entirely different kind of film. It is a credit to their skill and versatility that Frank and April Wheeler are NOTHING like Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt-Bukater. DiCaprio and Winslet are wonderful in their roles. Both are trapped in a situation that they hate, but can't escape.The other actors vary, however. Kathy Bates is miscast as Helen Givings, the only person who really seems to have fully bought into this sitcom-ish life. Bates is a good actress, but she's not right for the part. A cynic might say that this was to draw on the popularity of the ""Titanic"" connection, but I doubt it. ""Revolutionary Road"" will not appeal to that crowd, and the two leads are a strong enough appeal anyway (but with Hollywood, you never know...). Michael Shannon is excellent as John, Helen's son who was in the mental hospital for his opinion that this life that everyone seems to be living is a delusion. Shannon has made a career of off-the-wall performances, but this is one of his best. Unfortunately, the character sometimes comes off as a writer's construct than a real individual, and Shannon is unable to solve this problem. Of special note is David Harbour, who plays the Wheelers' next door neighbor and friend, Shep. It's a passionate and heartfelt performance, and it should grant Harbour some notice.Sam Mendes already peered behind the white picket fence in ""American Beauty,"" which I have not seen. But there has been no greater criticism of the delusion portrayed by the classic 1950's sitcoms like ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best"" than ""Revolutionary Road."" But the true strength of the film is that it applies to every era of American life; our dreams our precious, and we cannot reach them without taking a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Objects in mirror are sadder than they appear,"Richard Yates' seminal novel Revolutionary Road, published in 1961 has become one of the quintessential books to understand the post-WWII America with all of its virtues (the promise of a better life, the notion of happiness being attainable by achieving economic abundance, the society and communities as emotional anchors), but also its flaws (the shallowness of a society more concerned about economical success, the fear to see beyond and look for a change, the lack of ambitions and dreams or how they get lost in the way in order to seek comfort.Frank and April Wheeler have a life other people would die for: a beautiful house in the suburbs, two charming children and they're beloved by their neighbors. Together, they're gonna make a plan to escape from this suffocating and lifeless environment. This is how April finds the perfect solution: they'll sell the house and then move to Paris, where they can find their real purpose in life. Things, however, won't be so easy, as Frank starts to have second thoughts about this idea after he gets promoted at his job, and April is not willing to give up her dream, for it represents her salvation from misery.Director Sam Mendes assumes the challenge to bring Yates' provocative prose to the big screen with a very faithful adaptation (penned by Justin Haythe), that remarkably recalls that feeling of ""Hopeless Emptiness"" described by Yates, which ends up devouring silently not only Frank and April's mettlesome minds, but also the ones from the people around them (even if they're not fully aware of it).Thus Mendes develops a subtle, but emotionally powerful work, backed up by admirable production values, such as Roger Deakins' enticing cinematography, Thomas Newman's delicate music and Kristi Zea's eye-catching production design, that perfectly captures the 50's atmosphere without making it obvious nor redundant.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet find not only an excuse for a long-awaited reunion, but also a perfect vehicle to deliver vividly affecting performances as Frank and April Wheeler. Leaving behind the ghosts of Jack and Rose, they succeed by embodying the souls of two lost people trying to find out who they really are and how they drag each other into a spiral of regrets and frustration.Along with them, there's a superb supporting casting, featuring Kathy Bates as Helen Givings, the real-state agent enthralled by the Wheelers' ""immaculate life"" and Michael Shannon (in an Oscar-nominated performance) as John (Helen's son), and emotionally disturbed man, who ironically is the only one able to see Frank and April's distress and will become the voice of truth when everything falls apart for them.Just like Mendes' Oscar-winning debut American Beauty, this movie is a harsh and effective dissection of life in American suburbia, which by the way hasn't changed that much in over half a century.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two Hours I'll Never Get Back,"I was very excited to see this film for months. It didn't play by my area, which was a bit upsetting. Luckily, I received it through Netflix the day after it came out on DVD. Now, I regret adding it to my list.I'm going to start of by saying that DiCaprio and Winslet are terrific actors with a lot of potential and talent. Unfortunately, they didn't show this with this film. Every or most scenes they had together were nothing but screaming matches that made me cringe. The most upsetting part was that neither character had no character development. None whatsoever. Winslet as a housewife...boring. DiCaprio as a man who provides for his family with a job he loathes...boring. The screenplay could have easily made these typical cookie cutter roles into something new and refreshing. But they didn't.Adding Kathy Bates to the film didn't do much either (and I think she's a great actress too). Was she there to turn the viewers' attention away from the main characters? If so, it was pointless as her being there. Michael Shannon plays one of the most boring and typical insane character I have ever seen. Yet another pointless character to distract the viewers. But somehow, he got an Oscar nomination for it (which should have went to Ralph Fiennes in ""The Duchess"", IMO).I gave this film 2 stars instead of one because I think Sam Mendes did a good job with directing.

Beyond Titanic: DiCaprio and Winslet's Stellar Reunion in Revolutionary Road,"Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes, is a powerful film that reunites the iconic Titanic duo, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. As a huge fan of both actors, I was thrilled to see them together again, tackling the complex themes of disillusionment and yearning for personal fulfillment that lie at the heart of this 1950s suburban drama.The story follows Frank and April Wheeler, who appear to have it all but are secretly struggling with the suffocating reality of their mundane lives. As a fan, I was blown away by the depth and intensity of DiCaprio and Winslet's performances. They have matured since their Titanic days, and their on-screen chemistry has only become more captivating.Leonardo DiCaprio, as Frank Wheeler, delivers a raw and vulnerable portrayal of a man torn between ambition and mediocrity. His ability to convey deep frustration and longing is truly remarkable, making it impossible not to empathize with his character.Kate Winslet, playing April Wheeler, is equally mesmerizing. She brings a fierce determination and emotional complexity to her role, as she struggles against the constraints placed upon her by societal expectations. Her performance left me in awe of her incredible talent.Sam Mendes' direction and Roger Deakins' cinematography create a visually stunning backdrop for this emotional rollercoaster. The film beautifully captures the essence of the 1950s, highlighting the contrast between the idyllic facade of suburban life and the harsh reality of its characters' inner turmoil.As a fan, I wholeheartedly recommend Revolutionary Road to anyone who loves DiCaprio and Winslet or appreciates films that delve deep into the human condition. This movie is a testament to the extraordinary talents of its lead actors, and their unforgettable reunion will surely leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An eye-opening road,"Let me start by complimenting Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on their brilliant performance in this movie. In my opinion, Leonardo deserves a commanding nomination for some awards too following his role in this film. They made their roles come alive which made their stories very believable. Michael Shannon who played John Givings in the movie did a good job too.This movie shows a couple (the Wheelers) that decides to do something which most of us know is an option we commonly ignore at the back of our mind. They opt to escape from the constant predicament of what everyday life has to offer- the jobs, the people we associate with, the house, the surroundings. So, almost all of us can easily relate to this story as having thought about how constant life can get at one point or another.The movie shows us how Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) deals with the ups-and-downs of what life throws at them. All these prove to challenge their relationship even more so. This is what ultimate reality is where love is being tested whether it could stand the test of time.I rated this movie a 9.0 for the brilliant acting by the two main characters and also for the true significance of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Honey, I'm home!","It opens at a party, where the two main characters meet each other. Then it flash forwards to a play, where Winslets character just performed an awful acting performance, and the two main characters lash out on the side of the road on the way home. Then the title rolls. And after a while, you think that there isn't a better scene than that. But soon it happens. The movie is about a plan to put a marriage back together, but after an unplanned pregnancy, a few affairs, an new high paying job for the husband. And then comes the scene, after a long roller coaster ride of drama and high hopes, where a man who is virtually mentally ill exposes the perfect couple as seen in public for what they truly are. DiCaprio can't handle it, yells at him for feeling insecure for being exposed. The man tells Winslets character he feels bad for her but at the same time, thinks she is awful as well, for putting up with everything and how she let her become a ruined human. He leaves, saying he feels sorry for himself, but says that there is one person in the room he wouldn't want to be: the unborn child. After he leaves, the eruption starts, and the fight escalates into the woods. It's the perfectly acted scene of this half of the decade so far. And what happens after is just unbearably unbelievable and at the same time, irritably true to life. Revolutionary Road will not necessarily corrupt or destroy your view on the perfect 50's life, but instead it will make you realize what a lie that lifestyle is, and help you realize why we are here now. Winslet and DiCaprio are not only at the top of their game, but at the top of the entire game (that's every actor in the world, thank you). They stick with you and eat you alive.

Revolutionary Road,"Winslet and DiCaprio are a couple in a difficult marriage and decide to start again by moving to Paris - but complications follow.Excellent performances from the 2 leads, which sheds light on the differing emotional approaches of men and women to a crumbling marriage. Winslet seems more assured in her role whilst DiCaprio strays into melodrama occasionally, but this is a minor quibble.Good support from Bates, the local friend who can't cope with such emotion, Shannon as her disturbed son who tells it as it is and Harbour, who adores Winslet from afar.This is a very hard watch, made up in the main by long and highly dramatic and caustic arguments between the leads and you therefore need to be in a particular mood to truly 'enjoy' this.

Winslet & DiCaprio,"Sam Mendes' latest offering is, at long last, an adaptation of Richard Yates' book of the same name. I've heard a lot about his book (haven't read it) and would have thought that it merited a scramble for the production rights. Having seen the movie, I can't wait to read it. At a time when there seems to be a paucity for good scripts in Hollywood, a film about personal struggles and showcasing the monotony of daily life is a rarity. This has to be right up there with the best of the films on the 'American Dream', shown in its stagnation nevertheless. Reading up on the praise showered by contemporaries and critics alike on Yates' book, the magnitude of the task dawned upon me and anyone will acknowledge that it takes a team like this to do justice to the source material. It does, with some members of the cast walking away with the laurels, none more so than Kate Winslet.To say that she stands at the apex of her profession, unchallenged, would not be stating too much. Her April Wheeler is passionate, constantly challenging the fabric of stillness that overhangs the setting and the one person in the film who harbors the founding thought of the United States – hope. Watching her during the silent moments of the film is an exercise in getting floored repeatedly. In an inspired piece of casting, Leonardo DiCaprio plays April's man Frank. Representative of men from a time when everybody craved a security blanket, here is an actor at the top of his craft and still getting better.This film also completes a circle of sorts for the two. In the interim between Titanic (1997) and Revolutionary Road (2008), their careers have been fulfilling for the actors and fans alike. Together here, they make for immensely compelling viewing.Michael Shannon as John Givings is the surprise package of the film and I couldn't help thinking of 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest', another quintessentially American film. In the sense that, if he's crazy, it's only because they say so. Also, it probably takes an out-of-the-box thinker to comprehend April and Frank's plans. Another performance worth treasuring for it doesn't get much of screen time.Mendes brings his gift for ushering a sense of balance to proceedings and making it look natural. This may not turn out to be as memorable for him as American Beauty but the movie is all the better for it. Thomas Newman's score, the costumes by Albert Wolsky and the art direction by Debra Schutt and Kristi Zea add considerably to the film.This one kept me awake for a while after the credits had rolled. This particular representation of the American Dream may not be relevant any more but the themes of conformity, loneliness and frustration hold true.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Toto, we're not on the Titanic anymore","In Titanic, Kate and Leo were the achingly romantic, star-crossed lovers who would meet again in eternity. In Revolutionary Road they show us what might have happened if the couple survived.It's late 1950s American suburbia and he's settled into a similar deadening job in sales, at the same company, as his father and she's an unhappy, stifled housewife who once dreamed of being an actress. Along the way, both have meaningless affairs to relieve their boredom. Attempting to save their marriage, she devices a desperate plan to escape their narrow, regimented 50s existence -- they'll sell everything, take their life savings and move the family (they have two kids) to Paris, where he can take time off to ""find himself"" while she works as a secretary at NATO or UNESCO to support them.This dream is shattered by her unplanned pregnancy (termination is not an option for him) and his recent promotion at work. What happens then is the unraveling of a marriage and a life.This is not a movie for faint of heart. It's long, very slow-paced (a BBC production) and there's no light at the end of the tunnel for this pair. This is a far different couple from the lovers in Titanic. And, thank God for that because in this film both actors get the chance to demonstrate the true range of their talents, as well as again, the powerful chemistry they have together on screen.There are uniformly fine performances by the supporting cast, with Michael Shannon the standout (and Oscar nominee) as the emotionally disturbed son of friends, whose insanity grants him the freedom to be the sole voice of truth in this repressed suburban hell.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awful movie about awful people,"I was disgusted by what I was watching in this hollow movie about self-absorbed people, one of which can't take the responsibility of the decisions they have made. I'm so sick of movies catering to irresponsible lifestyles. If you can't handle children then don't have unprotected sex ESPECIALLY when you are as old as the characters are in this movie. I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters nor was what little love they have for each other even believable. Titanic was a better movie than this and that's not saying much.Leo's character is the typical selfish prick businessman who cheats on his wife with an office girl. Kate's character is self absorbed and unwilling to take responsibility for their decisions. Either Kate's acting was bad or the character is such a piece of crap that I couldn't for one second believe that she wanted to go to France so that her husband could find out what he wants to do.******* SPOILER (to some extent) *******The choice Kate's character made in the end was the most selfish decision anyone could make in that situation.

An achingly beautiful drama of the highest class,"It's been over an hour since I finished watching 'Revolutionary Road' as I begin writing this review. Such is the effect of this film that I can't really stop thinking about it. I am not sure how to describe this one for I feel I will not be able to do justice with it. So I would just say a couple of things.
First, it is by far among THE BEST drama movies ever made. Almost all the performances flabbergasting but Katherine Winslet's stands out. She has carried the whole weight of the film on her shoulders and never fails to impress us in any scene she is a part of. The altercations between her and Leonardo are captivating and give us the essences of the life of an ambitious couple and the thick and thin they have to go through. 
Second is the screenplay and dialogues which are simply superb. You will not want to miss even a single scene. I watched a couple of scenes twice or thrice also.

A strong marriage tragedy with some minor flaws,"This is the first review I write here - that doesn't have to mean it's going to be a bad one. The thing I'll try here is to show what I would've done differently if I had been the director. Intrigued - then read on! The strong things: the camera department has made a good show - along with some OK music it makes the film very moody overall. That's one good thing. Then, the performances are mostly quite strong - but there are a few exceptions, I will cover later. The dialogues are mostly believable and the script holds enough changes to keep us intrigued.Here is what I would have made differently: 1) I would have changed some actors. The girl Frank has an affair with, is simply much less attractive than his beautiful wife, for most men, so that is not believable at all. She wasn't such a special character, too.2) Another acting thing: the woman of the other marriage coupled played beyond bad. So: either changing the actress or trying one's best to get a passable performance.3) I would have changed one line: that ""Leo"" didn't know ""Kate"" wasn't in Paris. When you are married, you should know about such a thing, so that is NOT realistic.4) There was a scene where the charismatic ""crazy"" man was completely blurred despite talking. Could have been a tried way to do sth. original, but what is original isn't necessarily good. That's the only weak thing about the cinematography, though.5) Some non-linear time changes, e. g. going back, or foreshadowing would have made the film even more interesting. I probably would have changed the script here a bit, but it is okay how it is.6) In my mind there is another thing I don't remember. If I saw it a second time, there would maybe be more thing I notice that would be better off changed. Oh, maybe that there weren't enough close ups in such an intense, ""closed"" kind of drama, but it was another thing I tried to remember.Overall, a fine film with some flaws that aren't quite tragic enough to leave me feel the film I just saw was mediocre. It HAS the typical Mendes-feel, although he hasn't quite made a lot films yet. Looking forward to seeing more, though.This is an 8.4 for me, so not nine, but really a bit better than the average eight. Can I recommend this movie? Yes, a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful, Sad, Realistic","First off, let me start by saying, the acting and overall performances given by both DiCaprio and Winslet are undoubtedly phenomenal, as to be expected with such veterans as themselves. However the plot and dialogue itself deserve a standing ovation. The story is about Frank and April Wheeler, a suburban couple with two kids who live the stereotypical suburban family life. However neither Frank or April are content with the lives they lead, and they both know this, and it shows displayed through a very toxic relationship shared between the two. Although one day, April goes to Frank chanting of the impossible... LIVING THE LIFE THEY WANT TO, discarding the norms society has set in place for them.

Awful all the more than Kate and Leo don't make a second Atlantic cruise (web),"Well, after a half hour, i was wondering what this movie was about: babbles, nothing happens. So if the goal was to depict a boring couple life, at least, it's accurate. I was just about to stop it as Kate has a terrific moment: it was about being free, doing what we would have decided and not lose our life in a dull monotony. It strikes me as reaching 40, I feel exactly the same than this Leo at 30: Funnily, we live in different country, fifty years apart and nothing has changed: taking train to job, surfing into a wave of grey suits clones, tied to a desk... So i was really excited to see this family come to Paris and i was already happy to see Kate and Leo embark on a Cunard ship this time and maybe it will the same deep emotions as ""Hideous Kinky"" ! But my joy was short-lived: they never make the trip! They are stuck in their suburb, babbling, ... I can't say more because if i haven't stop it, i just keep forwarding to the end!

A movie that touches the soul,"I recently watched the movie The Revolutionary Road, a drama about an unhappy married couple living in the 50s. Sam Mendes paints a picture of American suburbia, reminiscent of a world well into the industrial revolution when people felt the benefits of a booming economy. Indeed in the 1950s the American economy was the strongest in the world. Keeping up with the Jones' was a part of life, as was hypocrisy, intolerance and the dried-up imagination which often went hand in hand with the consumerist, work-driven lifestyle, where the women were pushed aside to make way for the bread-winning man. The latter theme is excellently portrayed in scenes such as the rush hour at the train station where men bustle through as if taking over the city, and at Frank's office which is completely male dominated apart from a handful of female secretaries. The reaction of their conventional friends when April (Kate Winslet) and her husband Frank (Leonardo Di Caprio) announce that Kate will be supporting the family in Paris speaks volumes of the place of women at the time. The dried-up imagination is lucid when the friend exclaims ""what for?"" when told they will be emigrating to Paris.I love a film that does not need only words to convey its message, and this movie is one of them. April's strained body language when her dreams of moving to Paris are shattered, the shots of the lifeless empty rooms with dull furniture and the brown and gray suits of Frank and his wearisome colleagues depict a pervasive ""hopeless emptiness"". The whole scenario spells insipid, and when Kate and Frank excitedly discuss the possibility of leaving this depressing existence behind for a new and interesting life in exotic Paris, we as viewers are intrigued. We want them to pack up and go and we look down on the conventional couple that will be left behind to rot in their unsavory, bigoted existence. Ironically it is the mentally unstable John Givings who seems to see through everyone's facade, and pushes them all to face their truth. ""Hopeless emptiness. Now you've said it. Plenty of people are onto the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" Despite the dramatic turns in the plot, it is the simple images like this that stick – Frank dressed in his suit standing next to his car and waving to his wife perhaps thinking that if he acts like everything is alright and normal, it will be. There is a clash between the adventurous and bohemian and the practical and rational approach to life, whereby you do as is expected of you, and life is defined by your success and place in society. It is a movie that hits home because of what it encourages us to ask ourselves, a rhetorical and age-old question that influences the course of all our lives and is easily a fodder for debate: what is our meaning in life?The title is an irony that you may find follows you throughout the film. 'Revolutionary' conjures images of the young and fitful - restless souls that seek to change the world. Yet Kate's dreams are stifled by the 'oh come on, stop it' attitude and her tragic end dashes our own hopes for their new found purpose in life. Most of us will be left disappointed after already having decided that Anne's words and a prevalent message of the movie meshes with our own belief: ""It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shattered dreams of all the Ordinary lives,"Well, just shot of giving 10/10 for lots of reason because I strongly believe that nothing is perfect and giving 10/10 mean that its perfect, like they way Frank and April Wheeler think about their lives in suburb Connecticut. This novel is about the lives which was true in 1950's and its true in every era, its timeless. The dreams of ordinary middle class suburban peoples, their lives around their houses and dreams. But the same people wanted to achieved those dreams and try to fulfill those promises but in the end, they forced by every possible circumstances to live the lives they hate about. They have to work to the place they hate about it, but they just cant control those things. AS THE LIFE IS A DIAMOND, AND ALL THEY HAVE TO LICK THAT DIAMOND EVERYDAY AND LIVE. Some people cope better by lying to themselves and some people couldn't cope in best possible way and like their dreams their lives will shattered in thousands pieces of glass. Frank cope and understands the practicality of his life and his family life, he worked hard at every opportunity and already compromised to the life, to the future he has to end up with, but his wife tried another way out, the whole new future and wanted to give a try, a try too hard and when she sees no hope of that future and that dream she took extreme step. As far as movie is concern Sam took the book and made the movie as close as possible, he literally took back to 1950's. Acting wise, well, I was hoping a brilliant performance by Kate by all means and of course she performed brilliantly, but the one actor who did more than his fare share of role, it was Leonardo, he just blow me away with his acting.

Perfectly directed and acted...,"With Revolutionary Road, the excellent Sam Mendes delivers his most powerful and gripping movie since his debut, American Beauty. Coincidentally or not, both of these dramas hit similar themes and their protagonists also share a lot in common.Suburban couples whom, on the surface, are seemingly perfect but in in reality are growing apart, trying to define or redefine their existence, having doubts about their lifestyles? This summary can be applied to both films and yet, it would be a terribly inaccurate injustice to say this film is ""just like American Beauty"".The story is definitely its own, so are the characters. Mendes' direction also really sticks to the movie rather than being formulaic. He is better than ever, ever image, every moment, every emotion perfectly captured. DiCaprio and Winslet? They nail their parts as a couple, the Wheelers. It's just perfect, nuanced, authentic.With all these people on top of their game and an interesting premise, Revolutionary Road could have easily been a 9, perhaps even a 10. Alas, the screenplay has significant flaws. For one, a few lines are weak. Nothing major but still. More importantly, there seems to be something missing. The whole pointlessness of their existence not made so clear, for instance. And then, there's the Wheelers' children.Yes, our suburb couple has children but where are they, exactly? Not really in this movie, unfortunately. I realize that with a director like Mendes, few things were probably left to chance and this was probably a deliberate, conscious decision. Perhaps as early as the screenplay, or maybe in the editing room? Whatever the case maybe, it's a weak point and prevents the movie from having the punch to become a TRUE, long-lasting American classic. I'm talking top 100 movie of all times. Had this movie been extended by 15 minutes or so (which would be entirely reasonable given it's actual running time) I think much could have been explained and the final third of the movie, as well as its resolution, would have had even more impact.We're still left with powerful characters and another movie that is fodder for us viewers, about the apparent inescapable cogs of the wheel of our lives.Do we really need to live in such standard ways? And more importantly, if we do, is it instantly wrong? As usual for Mendes, he explores those black and white questions and shows you the wide palette of gray between these two extremes.Kudos to Mendes, our two leads, as well as the supporting cast and Mendes technical team. The weakness of this movie is Justin Haythe, whose sole other screen writing credit is the laughably bad ""The Clearing"". There just aren't that many Alan Ball around to write perfect stories.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Real and beautiful,"This movie is a must see for anyone who ever had ambition to do something with their life, but got stuck with a job they didn't like, didn't have enough money to realize their dreams or who got bogged down by societal norms on what responsible adults should do once you settle down and have kids. If that's something you can relate to, this movie is for you.It is a beautiful depiction of human expectations, ambition, compromise, identity and disappointment. I bet everyone at some point has felt as lost as Frank about what their purpose in life is or as disillusioned as April about the meaninglessness of a nice house and shiny furniture. This is all of that, and it will hit you in the stomach.Leo and Kate put out some really good performances, and even though at times April might seem a bit loopy or Frank comes off as a bit of a jerk, it is all very believable and the audience still empathize with both characters. That's great writing, when you can see the choices a characters makes and disagree with them, yet understand fully how they ended up at that bottomless pit.This is not a movie for the ones who prefer light entertainment, romance that conquers all or who are uncomfortable with the darker aspects of human behavior and psychology.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Disconcertingly mirrors its subject matter - attempts to be different, but ends up disappointingly the same","Familiarity need not always be a bad thing. The concept of film genres would be essentially void without a cultural recognition of visual and narrative patterns trends establishing a sect of films. Moreover, many cinematic works incorporate the notion of cultural baggage, using familiarity with previously established conventions to add emphasis to or to subvert contemporary efforts. However, the notion of baggage can also work towards an opposite effect, making narrative material which may have once appeared fresh come across as repetitive and unoriginal, devaluing an otherwise quality film. This proves to be exactly the case with Sam Mendes' adaptation of Richard Yates' novel Revolutionary Road. Attacking the film's formidable quality would be senseless, yet the consistent sense of unoriginality ensures the film never quite attains its desired effect, despite it being a stunningly powerful attempt.Yet perhaps this concern with familiarity should hardly come as a surprise, as the concept had encircled Revolutionary Road right from the casting of its two leads. Despite the promised subversion of the timeless love story offered in Titanic, the film's marketing and hype banked very much on the reuniting of co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and the hope that the chemistry and spark between them would go on as much as their hearts once did, leading to a potential case of cultural expectations overshadowing the effort in question. The same goes for American Beauty director Mendes once again digging up a dark undercurrent to supposedly sublime suburban life. Such a combination of factors makes the fact that Revolutionary Road is such an excellent film in itself feel almost like a shallow construction of a success, as the film appeared so tailor made to be nothing less that its own quality appears to paradoxically seem unsatisfactory.Nevertheless, the familiarity of the film extends beyond its cast and crew, as the subject matter derived from Yates' novel manages to do what it does exceedingly well while somehow managing to find nothing new to offer that countless other depictions of 1950s married life had not already unearthed. This adherence to convention becomes difficult to navigate - on one hand, Mendes might be seen as making a critical comment on the desired homogeneity of the time through ironically making use of 1950s stereotypes and familiar narrative arcs. Yet at the same time, the film exudes a continual sense of award baiting self- importance, an implied attempt to elevate it to the level of 'high drama', from the neatly pristine period exteriors and pastel coloured costumes to Thomas Newman's wistful, tinkling piano score which appears to be directly plundered from his previous work with Mendes on American Beauty. The continual sense of the 'serious, important film' Revolutionary Road seemingly set out to be, in turn makes it feel less serious and important.However, such a wave of criticisms need not overshadow what is fundamentally still an incredibly powerful, moving and classy piece of work. Mendes' directorial capabilities have lost none of their stunning emotional clout, and he demonstrates a disconcerting skill to casually manipulate audience emotions. Whether provoking cries of frustration towards the annoyingly chirpy neighbours and their inability to come to terms with the Wheelers' plan to break out of suburban conformity and begin new, more fulfilling lives in Paris, or the crushing emotional anguish at the notion that such a beacon of hope may not end up becoming a reality, do not expect to shake the flooring aftertaste of the film for quite some time. Similarly, master cinematographer Roger Deakins' use of tight framing within close interiors creates an exquisitely subtle yet unbearably uncomfortable sense of claustrophobia, perfectly coupling the barely perceivable silent emotional scream of repression pervading the film. Finally, the film's unexpectedly unorthodox yet somehow fitting final shot is so mischievously welcome that it just about merits seeing the whole film in itself.Despite the hype, the genuinely masterful performances generated by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cannot be ignored, their shining chemistry both during romantic interludes and hysterical screaming fits creating a supremely affecting piece of interpersonal drama. Few sights are so disillusioning as seeing the enthusiastic, hopeful spark in the eyes of DiCaprio at the film's opening being replaced by a flinty, critical stare painfully shortly afterwards, encapsulating the impish youngster being swallowed up through a desire to fit in with the environment surrounding him. Similarly, Winslet's eyes denote a harrowing sadness which similarly becomes increasingly deadened, to the point of the viewer being hard pressed to avoid tears themselves, conventional narrative or not. The tremendous performances of the lead duo are well supported by the efforts of Kathy Bates, gleefully irritating yet crucially heart wrenching in turn as the Wheelers' chirpy neighbour. The explosive Michael Shannon barely holds back from chewing the scenery as Bates' son, recently released from a mental hospital, with Shannon's caustic tone perfect for his nonconformist character's bitter rants. Finally, Dylan Baker is a wryly delightful presence as DiCaprio's alcoholic co-worker who hides from the dismally monotonous workplace through drinks and witty criticisms.Despite being a class act on all fronts, Revolutionary Road is in essence just as cinematically hollow as the lifestyle depicted, offering little new to offer regarding its subject matter. Nonetheless, the exceptional cast and powerfully measured direction cannot be ignored, nor can the film's lingering emotional clout. Yet, one cannot help wishing for untrod territory to be explored, or at least for Mendes to stay away from suburbia for future cinematic offerings.-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sam Mendes Hates American Suburbs,"The New York Times called this ""pessimism without redemption"" -- that's pretty accurate. Despite strong performances by DiCaprio and Winslet, the film never exceeds a relentless hammering of the banal American suburban existence by Sam Mendes. Within 5 minutes, we see an all-too-real-feeling argument between our lead couple over the realization that Winslet's character is just not a talented actress. From there, we are subjected to a near 2 hours of the worst moments of couples therapy. The problem with Revolutionary Road is shared by both the source material (Richard Yates' novel) as well as the direction. Mendes' earlier treatise on suburban existence - American Beauty - worked because of the self-deprecating humor of Kevin Spacey. Here, there's no humor, just multiple layers of misery. It doesn't help that a little careful scrutiny of that misery uncovers how trivial the couples problems really are (the couple wants to move to Paris because they are in a rut living in the NY metro area. Funny how no one asks, ""Why not get another job?""). In the end, R^2 is really a mediocre stage play filled with misplaced angst. Without any real drama (or perhaps too much of it), I really left the theater asking myself ""who cares?""",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
You will think about this movie every day,"This is one of the best Sam Mendes films I can think of. Casting was perfect, and the story was impeccable. The story takes place in the 1950s. Being an American History teacher, I adore films about the 50s. This movie captures the prison in which women may have found themselves being married and attempting to fulfill the stereotypes of what a woman was supposed to be in the 1950s. Kate Winslet captures the hell she is living, and allows the audience into her tormented world, even if only briefly. You feel for DiCaprio's character at times, but realize that both of them are victims of their era, not of each other. The last 15 minutes of this film are burned into my mind, and I think about this movie constantly. The acting is superb, you will not be disappointed in any way with this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gilded cage,"I have not read the novel, nor, I believe, anything else by Yates, though I would like to. From what I understand, it does not delve as much into the female lead as this does. I knew that I wanted to watch this from the moment I saw the trailer, and it did not disappoint me in the least. There is so much poignancy and so many brilliant observations about human psychology, nature and relationships in this, and, without knowing with certainty, I can imagine that they can be traced back to the author of the book. This is immensely realistic, as well as rather authentic... it really does feel like something out of the 50's. The plot is compelling all the way, and it develops well throughout. This is well-paced, there is not a boring moment to be found. The characters are credible, well-written and deep. Every role is well-cast, and DiCaprio and Winslet(who seems capable of exuding a ton of emotion with as little as a glance of her eyes) are flawless. All of the acting performances are spot-on. This is engaging and impeccably dramatic. You can't help but sympathize with the pair's struggle against conformity. This is not for those who see films as being escapism, as you might expect from anything by Mendes. The editing and cinematography are excellent, and the look of this is not glamorized. There is infrequent strong language, a little sexuality, and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with an interesting and informative commentary track by Sam and Justin Haythe(who adapted this for the screen), a well-done featurette, and deleted scenes with the option of hearing the director's thoughts on them. I recommend this to everyone mature enough to appreciate it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Devastating look at one very desperate housewife and her family, hard to take but easy to admire","April Wheeler is one very desperate housewife in the 1950's. She married her attractive husband, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), thinking his unconventional ways and casual attitude toward his jobs would result in a less-than-ordinary life. However, once April got pregnant with her daughter, and her younger son, Frank changed. He started to work for the same staid Manhattan firm where his father had toiled for years and he moved his family into a lovely home in suburban Connecticut. Consequently, April is in a state of slow suffocation, for although she appears to be the typical, all-American housewife, she is not. One day, April greets Frank with a big smile and a nifty family party for his 30th birthday. That's because April has hatched a plan. Why can't the Wheelers move to Paris, which Frank saw and admired during his military years, and which would surely hold a bevy of new sights and sounds? Frank would not even have to work, April would work as a secretary for a government agency and Frank can figure out what he really wants to do in life. Caught up in April's enthusiasm, Frank agrees to the new venture. But, then April finds out she is pregnant with the couple's third child. What will happen to April's dreams of a new life? This is a devastating look at one very desperate housewife and her unhappiness with a picture-postcard family existence. April's problems are compounded by the fact that she lives in the 1950's when women were just beginning to break out of the typical homemaker ""mold"". In the 21st century, many couples grow apart as they grow older and there is not as much of a stigma to ending a marriage and starting all over again. Yet, Frank is a sympathetic character, too, for he is not the money-driven businessman that many folks are, but he does have a family to support and his feet are more rooted in reality than April's. The result is that the Wheelers are a couple in desperate need of serious counseling but they don't get it and tragedy ensues. As the principal actors, Winslet and DiCaprio are incomparable in their difficult roles. Winslet embodies the beautiful, unhappy April as few actresses could but DiCaprio, despite receiving no similar award nominations, is every bit her equal in his part as the torn-in-two directions husband. All of the supporting cast, from Kathy Bates to Michael Shannon and the rest, are absolutely marvelous, too. The scenery in suburban Connecticut is lovely, the costumes well chosen, and the production values are first rate. As for the story and its direction, by Sam Mendes, they are monumentally powerful and sad. Not all of us are cut out for the ""normal"" family life and to feel caught in a life style you don't love is a major downer. Therefore, this is not the film to see if you are in a state of depression or are experiencing any difficulties in your own family relationships, for it will thoroughly demoralize you. But, if you are a movie fan who yearns for a film to ""shake you to your bones"", with a strong story and great depth, this one just can't be missed. Mendes, as in American Beauty, is a master at showing the dark side of anyone's seemingly sunny life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Feminist Propaganda.,"This is one of the worst movies i ever watched. Starting off nice, it soon deconstructs the golden era of the 50ies in which a man was still a man and a woman knew her role until it becomes emancipation propaganda. Kate Winslet playing a badly educated witch in a world full of liars and with a husband without honor and strength. This was the exception back then, 99% of the people lived happily. Who wants to see movies that show life as it should not be, in which you do not feel strong, feel better, look up to. I watch movies to feel better after i watched them, to let them strengthen my values and in the end myself; or to just entertain me. This movie cannot satisfy any of these desires, actually it makes me feel sad, depressed. I can imagine some lesbian feminists or maybe suppressed women may enjoy this movie due to the parallels to their lifes, but that's about it. A waste of Winslets and DiCaprio's acting skills.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Intense and uncomfortable, this film dissects the end of a marriage like no other.","I heard so much about this film that I felt compelled to see it, especially considering that it is directed by Sam Mendes (one of the great directors of today) and starred by Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio. Everything seemed to be an excellent film... and what I came to find is more than enough to satisfy my expectations.The film is a family drama set in a 1950s suburb, one of the most interesting decades to address these issues given the rapid changes in the lives and habits of American families, and the obsession with appearances and the perfect life, the which is particularly palpable in suburban families, always worried about what their neighbors will think. The script for this film introduces us to a family that couldn't function worse: after a quick and fleeting infatuation, the couple Frank and April Wheeler couldn't be more unhappy, enduring a conflicted marriage, jobs they hate and a suburban life that, inwardly, they despise. Eager to change her life, April asks them to move to Paris, France, but several events delay the trip as their marriage falls apart.This is a hard and difficult film, which tackles two main themes in a caustic and uncomfortable way: the first and most important is marriage, especially those accommodating and loveless marriages, which go on supporting each other year after year. The film highlights the differences, sometimes irreconcilable, between the characters so much that it is anti-romantic. The second major theme to be addressed is the modus vivendi of suburban American families in the Fifties, with their hypocrisies and obsession with appearances and the perfect life. Sam Mendes, by the way, did a similar critical exercise a few years earlier, in ""American Beauty"".Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio are the featured actors in this film. They've been great friends since they starred in ""Titanic"" and their friendship was the basis of a fruitful collaboration, in which both always ask for more and better each other, aware of their abilities and the excellent chemistry they manage to maintain, making the love scenes into poetry and giving the most tense scenes a palpable electricity. Winslet was particularly committed, convinced that the film was a good idea. She was responsible for the participation of her friend DiCaprio, to whom she gave a copy of the script. The result is one of the most intense, complex and powerful works of her acting career. She also wanted to draw attention to the dialogue, particularly when the two characters fight. There are truly powerful words, with a cruel harshness that is hard to hear but exudes credibility. There are also good performances by actors like Michael Shannon or David Harbour, but always in the third plan.The film is not very long, but it develops quickly, and in the first few minutes you realize what lies ahead: Sam Mendes shows us a tough marital fight full of sarcasm early on, setting the pace to the film and developing as well as the characters, as well as the social background through which they move. The sets and costumes are excellent and reproduce very well the suburban environment of the time, with the standardization of life and tastes, men dressed almost identically, women with long skirts and the one always worried about her home and her husband. The mentality of the time and the social context are part of the film as if they were another character: if we consider that that marriage failed because of the cowardice of not defying the conventions with an exciting trip to a country where they could live life without so many rules, the villain ends up being the hypocritical and restrictive social environment where they lived.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Thought provoking, haunting, uncomfortable mirror - in other words AWESOME!","Praising individual performances seems such a trivial tribute to this masterpiece... but boy do they deserve praise! I did not bat one disinterested eyelid while watching this dark insight into 1950's East coast suburbia. The quintessential American dream - an adorable young couple, a house on a manicured lawn, kids playing, summer trappings, friendly neighbors - in stark contrast to the debilitating internal conflict and crumbling foundation of the focal social construct - the married life of Frank and April. Sounds clichéd but so is breathing and eating. How did we get here? Start with a layer of sweet-talking, charm and maybe physical chemistry, knead that into a wedding cake mix, pile on top of that foolishly optimistic unfulfilled personal dreams, cover with social pressures, appearances and innocent children's futures and top off with self-inflicted guilt brought on by impulsive behaviors. Sprinkle the need for caring and being cared all over that concoction and add a dash of desire to feel important. That is surefire recipe for disaster even on its own, but when a mentally 'unstable' John Givings (Michael Shannon) projects piercingly true insight into what issues are really at play versus what the protagonists fool themselves into believing, it is accelerated into a hopelessly fast and explosive meltdown. I am inclined to wonder though, if the setting of this movie was 2009, would things have turned out differently. This movie will haunt me for days to come. Bits and pieces are certainly lodged permanently in the psyche.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

What if the American Dream is a nightmare?,"Revolutionary Road (2008), directed by Sam Mendes, is a great vehicle for Kate Winslet. Winslet is an actor whom I truly admire. A critic has called her the ""Meryl Streep for her generation,"" and I agree. Leonardo DiCaprio does a reasonable job as her husband, although for most of the film his expression varies between a scowl and a dark scowl.Frank Wheeler is living the 1950's American dream--well-paying job, beautiful wife, two kids, shiny Oldsmobile, house in Connecticut. April Wheeler is living the dream as well. It's true that her career as an actor has gone nowhere, but she loves her husband and her kids and their beautiful home.Except. . . Frank says he hates his job, and April thinks they should be looking down on the life they're living. They know they're better than other people they see around them. Her thought--let's go to Paris where I can work as a secretary and you can find yourself.The problem with the script is that there's a major scene missing. We're led to understand, in context, that Frank had great dreams for himself, and April shared those dreams. That point is never made clear--when did they decide they could do great things, and what talents did Frank have that people around him didn't have? (We also never see Winslet, as April, acting. Early in the film, we're shown a scene where she's acted in a community play which, apparently, was horrible.)The film contains some sub-plots, which basically serve as filler. Frank has a dalliance with a secretary, one of their friends is in love with April, and a mentally ill man is the only person who both sees the truth, and is able to tell the truth about what he sees.The strength of the film is in Winslet's acting, and in the basic question: Is the perfect life really the perfect life? If it isn't perfect, what then?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The look of others...,"It takes a while for a director to make a really good film. By this I mean a film that not only contains visual beauty or technical mastery. These where things that reigned all over ""American Beauty"", ""Road to perdition"" and ""Jarhead"": but the first one was too wise about its limits, it believed it was better than it really was; the second one was too cold, too exquisite and the third one failed to grab the viewer completely (even when Jake Gyllenhal did his best efforts). With ""Revolutionary Road"", Sam Mendes enters a whole new world; the world of a film that arouses feelings on the viewer: the world of a really good film.This new world is in a way also a world he knows. The film is set in the suburbs, where the Wheelers, Frank and April (Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) make a living. Also in a way, the context is different than the one Mendes worked with in ""American Beauty""; it's the 1950's and things were decidedly different, but the core is the same: a hell that's waiting to make an appearance in a pleasantness that doesn't seem right. The scene before the title appears could very well be ""the first day of this couple's life"", but the language in Justin Haythe's script (adapting Richard Yates' novel) lacks Alan Ball's philosophical and sometimes pretentious search of meaning.However, even when I want to, it's not fair to say ""Revolutionary Road"" is the better version of ""American Beauty"". This film has something the other one didn't care much about, and that's how we see ourselves in someone else's eyes; or even better, why do we have to see ourselves in someone else's eyes. The Wheelers are a couple without convictions. They do what they do in life because it was the best they could get and they chose not wanting more. A nice, well paid job for Frank, two lovely kids, the role of a kind housewife in the hands of April This is what the neighborhood knows about the Wheelers: Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) thinks they are adorable, so does their friend/neigh bout Chep (David Harbour). Yes, it's all true, but the viewer is allowed to experience a little more.The tension is developed inside a big house that Roger Deakin's cinematography captures as an unbearable scenario. Mendes works this from every angle possible: outside the house the tension can be sensed, but never comes to life. Without mattering who they are sharing company with, after a first fascinating discussion in the middle of the highway, every argument occurs indoors. There's one scene in which Frank chases April through the woods, shouting mildly, but it doesn't become more than that. In the house, however, passion flies through the walls; among the couple, with the children nearby and with two particular visits of a peculiar human being called John (a very good Michael Shannon).So? Which one is it? Do we have to care about what the people around us think? Are we making our own living or are we just satisfying someone else's wishes? And whose wishes are those? As I said, this last film by Mendes makes room for emotions. Much has been said about Winslet and DiCaprio's reunion after the success of ""Titanic"", and the fact is that their work here is brilliant for the opposite reasons that made their chemistry possible in James Cameron's film. There, they couldn't be together, and the passion and the relationship was almost platonic; their encounters lasted nothing. Here, they are already together, and the relationship has lost, with the years, a passion that's still passion. But it doesn't want to bring them together; it's a passion that's tired of trying to keep alive something that's dying. Thank God that DiCaprio one day decided to make only good movies, because when he wins in intensity there's no one who can beat him.With these two fantastic main actors, technical mastery, beautiful (almost excessively correct) visuals, intriguing score (yes, Thomas Newman) and the mentioned intensity, Mendes may not even know why he's done his best movie. It's not in the screaming, the crying and the suffering of two people that's explicated to the bone. The true greatness lies -and I think the director wanted people to think this of all his movies but never achieved it- in everything else: in the silence, the looks of everyone involved in the tale, the decisions the characters take and we work so hard to figure out why. That's what strikes us deeply: the rest only increases the hit.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
great movie,"When I sat down, I was wondering if the film I was here to see was just a remake of the magnificent ""American Beauty"". It isn't, Revolutionary road is much darker than its predecessor. For the last hour and a half, I couldn't look off the screen due to the intensity of the tragedy lived by this couple. The acting is very impressing particularly Leonardo DiCaprio who seems to be on top form. Kate Winslet wasn't good enough for the part but who is? Sam Mendes might have aimed a little too high with the female character, tortured and yet full of hopes. However, revolutionary road left a good impression on me. More than a remake of ""amercian beauty"" it's a sequel showing the troubles of the American society.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Revolutionary Road"" - Leo and Kate on the screen together again...","I believe that it was in early 2008 that I heard that a new film was coming out that would be pairing stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on the screen together again, 11 years after they were the king and queen of the world in ""Titanic"" (1997). That long wait happens again in the 2008 film ""Revolutionary Road.""Now I'm a guy and I'm a sucker for romances, so that when I heard that the power-couple of ""Titanic"" were teaming up again for a new film due out later in 2008, you can bet that I waited with eager anticipation to see this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, in all likelihood, made film history with ""Titanic"" by becoming probably the new Hollywood screen couple. And while the two are together again in the Sam Mendes-directed ""Revolutionary Road,"" they are very much the complete opposite of the characters they made famous 11 years prior in ""Titanic.""""Revolutionary Road"" is an adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, and concerns the Wheeler family, spear-headed by Frank (DiCaprio) and his wife April (Winslet), who live with their two children in a lovely New York suburb. Remembering that the two are the opposites of the characters they portrayed in 1997, their marriage is very much on the rocks from the opening moments. Set in 1955, they live a picturesque life as a picturesque, perfect American couple, you know, the type of unique American family that all the rest of American families should try to be like.Things couldn't be any more farther removed from the truth.Frank hates his job as a lowly tech salesperson, and has often dreamed of better things in life. April is pretty much the ideal housewife who does the incredibly simple task of making a decent home life for her family. April soon comes up with the idea that in order to get what they both want out of life, that it would be nice to move to Paris, France, and try to start over. She'll get a job as a secretary, she says, while Frank will stay at home with the kids and try to figure things out. It's a lovely dream, but a highly unrealistic one, and soon numerous factors (internal as well as external) come out that threaten to tear this already faulty family unit apart.Now, I'm not one to really jump on the bandwagon of the latest Hollywood flick that's primed to sweep the Oscars. However, I found ""Revolutionary Road"" to be something that is a little bit higher than the usual Hollywood drivel. I found the missing link in most Hollywood pictures purely in the star-power of the two lead performers. It was a sight to see DiCaprio and Winslet together again. (I might as well as proclaim them as my ultimate, favorite screen couple.) That they're together again under different circumstances and playing vastly different characters than the ones they immortalized in ""Titanic"" is part of the experience. I found their characters to be brutally honest about themselves and inherently imperfect, but full-blooded and really life-like; essentially, they're real people here.I like Leonardo DiCaprio. He is one of my favorite actors. He has shaped up in the time since ""Titanic"" to become one of the film community's most versatile and talented performers; he is no longer the ""King of the World"" boy-toy he was in ""Titanic's"" hey-day. (When is this man going to win an Oscar, or at least a Golden Globe?) Kate Winslet proved to be the real winner here, since she won a Golden Globe for her performance here (as well as an Oscar for ""The Reader,"" which I haven't seen, but I say she should have won it for this film, too). Her performance is honest to begin with, but halfway through takes a turn down a much darker route that was totally unforeseeable by anyone in the audience.""Revolutionary Road"" is a real movie, a real movie that is full-blooded and smart. I should have said this way earlier, but I had to watch the film for a college class recently, and it was my first time seeing it. I have no idea how I missed this movie while it was in the theaters. But I was glad I had the grand opportunity to see what was one of the best - if not the best - drama films of 2008.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Back in the Gray Flannel Days Before Mankind Discovered the Clitoris,"After seeing yet another existential evocation of dystopian lives in 1950s suburbia (try the far more campy melodrama, Far From Heaven , or the far more gentle satire, Pleasantville, for a set of comparisons) it is obvious why the next step in American cultural evolution following Frank Lloyd Wright's inspired masculine tract house angularity involved both the ""Feminine Mystique"" and the ""Hite Report."" The sex in these 'burbs was just god-awful. Dicaprio's office stud was, at best, a six to seven pump chump fighting to beat a soft boiled egg timer when he played kitchen man to Winslet's unfulfilled housewife. Not surprisingly, she cheated to find better, but the guy next door was a truly pitiful front seat three stroker, if that. Did people of this type during this time period really screw so industrially? I mean I know the proverbial back seat drive-in movie thing was likely a fast, furtive and mostly clothed affair, but if this movie makes any statement about the banality and hopelessness of these characters' predicament, it is in the bump and grind of their everyday lives, or the lack of any to be precise. These well-suited and fedora clad men had won the war, then came home to fight meaningless memo battles within art deco wood and frosted glass foxhole versions of Dilbert's future cubicle hell. They wound up all pea and no cock, and their poor drab hens paid the real price.I can easily picture Eddie Haskell as a selfish and quick lout bumbling about darkly in the back seat of a Studebaker between double creature features, but. I wonder if this is what it was like in Ward and June Cleaver's bedroom, or in their kitchen when Wally and Beaver were off somewhere being all American boys?(Curious Note: Actor Dylan Baker, who plays DiCaprio's cubicle inmate at work, strikingly resembles the model for the father subject in the infamous 1930s anti-Depression propaganda billboard, ""World's Highest Standard of Living, There is No Way Like the American Way."" This billboard was made world famous through Margaret Bourke-White's classic ironic black and white photograph showing poor African-American flood victims lining up for relief in front of one in Louisville, KY in 1937. The billboard artwork, though it depicted an upper middle class white family enjoying ""prosperity"" as the Depression presumably ebbed in the late 1930s, is nonetheless eerily prescient for, and evocative of post war 1950s material culture.)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Up there with the greats,"Revolutionary Road is an exquisite piece of serious melodrama. Much of the emotional depth relies on what we don't see. Don't hear. And don't have explained. Characters control their feelings rather more than American cinema would usually like them to. That, will hopefully put off many a teenage cinemagoer who would be bored rigid by a lack of explosions. A lack of over-acting. A lack of subject matter one can relate to without at least one failed marriage, one relationship you get up for but would rather not, and a long period where the choice between emptiness and hopelessness stretches out like a life sentence. Di Caprio an Winslet are reunited. This time, it's not Titanic that fails to reach its destination, it's the American Dream.Take a moment to recall a time when you had something all figured out. How everything would be just perfect. If only people would do it your way? Trapped inside individual visions of perfection, Frank and April communicate at emotional cross-purposes. They are an idyllically good-looking young couple in 1950s Connecticut, buying their first house. Expecting their first child. The world is opening up to them. Have you been there perhaps? Just a few adjustments. Tweak each other's views.What do you do when you love someone and they won't see sense? Frank tries to disabuse April of her childish notions of being an actress, something she has trained for. She's awful at it anyway, he's right. Why can he not see that this is not the way to be supportive and loving? April slips jarringly from being the perfect wife to putting on perfection as a show. Then she has a bright idea. Let's start again. In Paris. Frank will have time to find what he really wants to do in life instead of an advertising job he hates. Deep down he loves her. If she can only just re-kindle that.The problem with pretending to be nice is just that. If you have to pretend, then deeper issues are not right. Sooner or later they will come to the surface. Stuff about the symbolic nature of the title (the street where Frank and April live is called Revolutionary Road) could fill pages. But the film's strength is that any deeper meanings are secondary. There is sometimes a great temptation (certainly by this writer) to interpret films within a social context, to analyse their moral agenda. While this provides intelligent gratification of consciousness, it can blind us to the power of film as autonomous art, the precise use of a dramatic device for its own sake, the carefully crafted harmony of costume, lighting, sets, inflection and intonation, and the many formal techniques unique to cinema among the arts.Winslet is here most diva-like, more self-assured than in many of her flamboyantly emotional parts. She delivers her lines with scalpel-like precision, and at last cuts the profile of an actress destined to become legend. Di Caprio is still underestimated as an actor in my opinion. Here, he plays off Winslet with the fire of a young Brando. As they throw emotional punches at each other, they are like two five-star boxers. A surgical jab to weeping wounds which hide tears. Pain inflicted without breaking rules. The cut and thrust of barbed words eliciting the worst. Is change possible without destruction? Bring on a neighbour's son, a mathematics Ph.D certifiably unsocial after repeated electric shock treatment to 'fix' him. Now a Village Fool like those of legend, who can speak the truth that no-one dares. Nowhere is such an occasionally theatrical device deployed more scathingly than with Michael Shannon's character, John Givings. A man who is past caring, towering over Frank and April physically and intellectually, he shreds any illusions we dare hold for their sake.Perhaps I am wrong about teenage audiences. Some did walk out. But I remember Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. One of the first 'adult' themed films I saw as a young lad. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, bickering incessantly, and pointlessly showing off encyclopaedic command of words just to needle each other. I had to make myself sit through it. But the film made a deep impression and I look back on it now as a classic. I hope some young viewers will have the same experience with this Revolutionary Road.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrible - Avoid this bomb!,"Revolutionary Road stinks. The story was stupid. The acting was so-so. The dialog was asinine.

Please.My wife loves Leonardo and these types of movies usually, but even she was begging me to Fast Forward thru this mess.I can't even begin to tell you in detail how terrible this movie is. It seems that the Producers wanted to capitalize on a Titanic reunion of Dicaprio and Winslet, mixing in the odd storyline of this bomb, thinking that Sam Mendes could work his American Beauty masterpiece.Do Not Be Deceived. This movie just sucked. This couple is unhappy. Oh boo hoo, he has to commute to work each day. He didn't want to do what his father did, and that is where he is. Kate Winslet does nothing, and complains about it, so hey, let's move somewhere different. Then the idiotic sex scenes, awkward pauses, strange blow ups by various people, odd neighbors, all done with the 1950s look, and hey, you have a winner - give me a break. How Winslet was able to keep herself from laughing at her stupid lines is a miracle. Dicaprio had to really blow up a few times, but it just seemed forced, and like I said, stupid.I would give this a 0 rating except for the fact that the costumes/background effectively evoked the era, and that they convinced two fine actors to waste their time with this mess.Do not go down Revolutionary Road.

Remembrance of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet just came back from the Titanic falling in love and put themselves in their own whirlwind of chaos and conformity. It's the 50s, the man goes to work while the mother stays home be homemaker with the kids. Unfortunately the couple is the center of the film and they are basically at odds with each other for what is better for them as a couple. When the couple decides to move to France to live, everyone around them neighbors and even the real estate agent played by Kathy Bates is pretty much asking why. Then DiCaprio changes his mind and a volcano has erupted to a point the couple are at odds and fighting with each other at all times. This film really reflected the 'hopeless emptiness' the couple are living through and even Michael Shannon as the real estate agent's son who was released from mental hospital steals the show. Shannon is the driving truth no one addresses in this film. Shannon plays a character who was crippled by the time he's living in and shown he had no filter when addressing the faults the couple shows.

 I personally like this better than ""Titanic"". The main reason for that is there isn't a subplot like the ""necklace"" in RR.

Extremely realistic and moving,"Movies like It's a Wonderful Life and American History X show us how grateful we should be for our lives and how we should respect other people. Revolutionary Road, however, shows us how frustrating life can be. I've wanted to see a movie that finally nailed this, and I think I got it with this movie. It shows us that giving things up for our dreams isn't easy at all, and sometimes we need to check to see that those dreams are realistic and easy enough to do. This was the whole theme of the movie and I couldn't have asked for it to be better. Leonardo and Kate were acting gold and were completely believable together.

Both Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet emote vigorously until they appear to get severe hemorrhoids (fatal in the case of the Winslet character). Sometimes the only interest in this film is the exquisite 50s design.

"Fabulous acting, heart-wrenching story","Revolutionary Road is probably most known for its long awaited reunion of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The duo last met in 1997 on a doomed cruise ocean liner in the phenomenally famous blockbuster Titanic. Ironically enough, in 2008, the sinking ship in this situation is their marriage. Through a series of violent arguments and morally questionable behavior, Frank and April Wheeler play the exact opposites of Jack and Rose. Instead of being driven mad with affection for each other, they are stuck in an unhappy relationship being driven mad by all the restrictions that their stagnant lifestyle imposes on them.Trapped in the confines of 1950s suburbia, the Wheelers are living with their children in a quiet little house on a quiet little street. April stays at home and Frank goes to the office. Every day, though, things progress more and more into disillusion as the two start to wonder where their hopes and dreams went. Their lives have been restricted to boundaries of their seemingly picture-perfect life, but on the inside, the strains of commitment and ennui have weakened their relationship significantly. The film is somewhat of a mockery of how we are all forced to hide our problems and put on the old dog-and-pony show to make us look nice on the outside, while behind closed doors there are struggles no one can imagine. Things start looking up for the Wheelers when April suggests that they move to Paris and finally do what they've always wanted to do. An unexpected pregnancy, though, prevents them from going and so begins a slow, downward spiral that's painful but fascinating to watch.The performances of Kate and Leo are arguably the strongest of each of their careers. There's, objectively, nothing to criticize about them. So much pain and emotion flies between them that just watching the Wheelers exchange words is exhausting. Even though their characters are constantly hurling insults at each other, there's still an innate chemistry between them that makes them mesmerizing to watch on screen. DiCaprio's performance all but brought tears to my eyes as the husband who tries his very best to support his family, but is fed up with his mind-numbing job. His tense relationship with his counterpart only makes him all the more stressed and genuinely confused about how to fix the situation. April seems like more of the free spirit and although Frank cares for her, their values are starkly different. One particular scene that especially moved me was after a particularly bad episode with April, he comes downstairs to find her calmly cooking breakfast as though nothing even happened the night before. In response to April slinging an ""I hate you"" at him the previous night, he just looks at her and asks—something to the effect of—""you don't hate me, right?"" It's just a few, simple words, but they succeed in being the most poignant words spoken throughout the whole movie. It's great acting, and DiCaprio does not disappoint.Kate Winslet has never been under appreciated as an actor, and rightfully so. Every movie she's in, romantic, dramatic, funny, what have you, she always plays the part. She has mind-blowing versatility, and Revolutionary Road is no exception. April would be easy to make into the villain. After all, she's upstaging her family in pursuit of a pipe dream, she has unrealistic expectations of her husband, and she's overzealous (arguably, to a fault) when it comes to the chase of said dreams. Winslet, though, is able to make a sympathetic plight for April. Although a severely flawed character, she's still humanized and relatable. Not to mention, she's a powerhouse screen presence and she's so tapped in emotionally to her part that it's riveting.The general consensus among critics and audiences is the not-so-cheery ending. One can't help knowing that something bad is coming considering the gloomy tone of the whole storyline, but thanks to DiCaprio and Winslet, the depressing plot is still watchable. Mostly due to the actors, Revolutionary Road may not have been a hit during awards season (whoever is responsible for DiCaprio not earning an Oscar nomination should be locked up), but I was glad I saw it. The directing (by Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes) is precise enough to allow the actors to do what they do best and the source material (the novel by Richard Yates) is nothing to sneeze at. Hopefully, Kate and Leo will reunite in the near future to deliver the same gripping performances as this one.My grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worse than one star,"Picked it up from the library, for free, and was still disappointed. Horribly uneven writing, horribly uneven acting.

When both are down it is embarrassing. Good stars attract, but the end product is simply not worth your time.

Tour-de-force,"Move over George and Martha. Step aside Archie and Edith. Take a walk Oliver and Barbara. Here comes Frank and April. They are in the house. They have arrived and they mean business. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio give tour-de-force performances as a couple in conflict. Separately each character is likable, indeed wonderful, someone you would want to have as a friend. But together? Oh boy! Hold on to your hat because you'll be going on a ride, with a lot a bumps along the way. The director has taken what would otherwise have been little more than another hokey Hollywood potboiler and has raised it to the level of a classic. This movie is devoid of the mucky sentimentality that reduce such stories to sappy melodramas and instead deals forthrightly with the trials and tribulations associated with unmet needs. For one wants freedom and other wants security and they struggle to bridge that gulf. Ms. Winslet and Mr. DeCaprio were wonderful in Titanic. In this movie their performances are better. They're older but still retain that youthfulness which make them so appealing as actors. Also kudos to Kathryn Hahn who is one of the great comic character actresses. There is no bad guy or good guy, just people struggling to get through life and not be emotional frauds.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
No MMMovieMMMagic here!,"As far as entertainment goes, this isn't it. Michael Shannon does a great job of playing the mentally disturbed friend and Kate Winslet is great as the psychotic house wife but the entire story is boring and virtually unwatchable. I would rate this as slightly above ""The Hours"" as one of the least entertaining Oscar nominated movies I've ever watched. As I try to see more of the Oscar nominated movies prior to the event, I hope to watch many who are more deserving of the recognition.I can not believe that IMDb users actually rate this movie as a 7/8 out of 10, only reasoning I can use to justify such a rating would be that people are using an Oscar nod as justification to have to like this film. Either that or those who didn't like it didn't want to waste the time writing a review.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
American Beauty Part Two!,"Revolutionary Road is a very strong drama that focuses around the happiness, or I shall say unhappiness of a middle-class, married couple of seven years. While not reaching the heights of 1999's American Beauty, this film serves the same purpose. They both touch on the subject of the dour effects that some people have about their status and how they are not living life the way they want to. In other words, this film can serve as a prequel to the fore-mentioned film. But this is a well-acted, tense drama that stays true to the literary source novel.Sam Mendes, who previously directed American Beauty, directs a film about a couple named Frank and April Wheeler. They are seemingly happy as Frank commutes to New York City for work and April is the typical housewife. But Frank despises his job and April is not pleased about how her life turned out to be. One day, she suggests moving to Paris. While reluctant, Frank finally agrees. But complications ensue which causes problems after problems and can the Wheelers survive these problems?A film like this needs to rely on their actors and thankfully this film delivers. The film reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since their historic pairing in 1997's Titanic. They both are fantastic and their chemistry is as great as always. It's funny because in Titanic, you can see the romantic love. In this film, you can see the tough love. Michael Shannon delivers one of his best performances as the son of the realtors who suffers from mental issues. We also get good performances from Kathy Bates, Kathryn Hahn, and David Harbour.Overall, Revolutionary Road is an excellent film. It plays out to be a small-town drama, but it goes bigger than that. I liked how this film can be described as a poor-man's American Beauty. It essentially is, but they are both excellent, unique films. The cinematography and costume design is great and same can be said for Thomas Newman's quiet, but excellent score. This is a really good movie built around the talents of Leonardo and Kate. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Don't give up your dreams, don't become responsible adult","The book and the movie ask a fundamental question: do we choose to live our life to the fullest and fulfill our dreams or do we settle for the far from glamorous suburban life of reasonable adults in a society tailoring our dreams in order for us to buy more of the bullshit it sells. It is brilliantly acted, scripted and directed, you'll see the couple drowning in his incapacity to take a chance and live the dream instead of dreaming their life thus feeling bitter and acrimonious about it. In the 50's you would think the decision of not living the dream reasonable, in today's world, we know we're lied to, deceived by ""the markets"" and the advertorials so we may as well do as we dream, because it does not matter, society is not designed to make us happy (not even happy customers !), fulfilled so if you have a passion, just go for it, live every minute of it, regardless of tomorrows.

A very moving movie with great answers!,"Revolutionary Road comes as a period film set during the times when computers needed sales executives to sell them! The first credit should go to the stellar acting performance of both Leonardo and Kate Winslet.They have done a terrific job that no point of time you get to realize that its just a drama. The movie is about a young couple's dreams of having a extravagant life which takes a flight to neverland after their marriage and hence they find themselves as a normal generic couple with two kids. But April(Kate) still does not want to quit trying and proposes for a new life in Paris for the family.Can Frank(Leonardo) give into this new wild plan with an existing steady job and promotion in hand and also April pregnant with their third child,is all the movie's is about.

Tragic love story from American Beauty director Sam Mendes.,"Revolutionary Road is a tragic love story about two people who cant quite find a way to make things work.The film,which is adapted from a novel has so many layers of meaning yet is in its own essence,a very simple and straightforward story.Set against a 1950's backdrop and directed by Sam Mendes,Revolutionary Road is a deeply involving drama which re-unites Titanic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Both stars deliver excellent performances truly bringing fully to life the characters and their contrasting plights. The suburban setting and score by Thomas Newman inevitably remind of Mendes' earlier film American Beauty.A similar kind of tragedy is explored here, as was explored in American Beauty.Mendes seems interested in peoples relationships and the painful dysfunctionality that can arise when two forces aren't pulling in the same direction within the confines of a family unit. Its great material and Mendes delivers a fine film,aided by a committed cast and some great on location camera work and production design.It doesn't indulge comedy like American Beauty but its more than a match in the dramatic stakes. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
You Say You Want A Revolution? It's Not Here.,"This movie gets three stars for having the great talents of Leo, Kate and Kathy Bates in it. If not for them, it wouldn't rate any stars. It boggles my mind that so many people gave this movie a high rating.The story begins with a fight and if you turn off the movie after that first scene, you can save yourself the extra two hours. There is no story arc beyond what your assumption would be from that first fight. Nothing unexpected happens, and no one changes in the film from the people you see in that first fight. It is so boring I was willing the time counter to move faster. If it weren't for Kate and Leo starring in it, I would have turned it off, but felt an annoying obligation to watch, thinking maybe there would be something more just around the next corner. No such luck.Revolutionary Road left out the revolution and revelation while promising expectations that never get delivered. Yes everyone has dreams and some people are fearful of reaching for them, some settle and are happy with that and others can't abide settling. Any other way of expressing that theme would have been more interesting than the un-revolutionary, unremarkable, downright banal road this film took.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
An astounding piece of cinema art,"This is one of a very few reviews I wrote, despite the huge amount of movies passing through. Its just that this one has made a very strong impression, stirred me so deep I was surprised it is still possible. There is no ""action"", not even any dramatic events along, no special effects or mind-boggling ideas. It is just... it brings ups things that are so fundamentally TRUE, so much in the core of people and their relationships, and simultaneously so BASIC, that mesmerizes you completely. Many time I would jump of a seat and run describing the storyline to my wife (who is in no position to watch movies right now), which triggered quite an involved discussion. The actors were at their best performance I have seen to them so far, and there were many great roles by Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio, you will agree. I like Leo, but I couldn't believe he is capable of such act. I am not familiar with other director's works, so I can't compare, but the entire piece feels very different from the load of of the Hollywood movies, despite being in the same format. Michael Shannon was brilliant - hell, there is no single mediocre performance in this move, despite there is of course some marginal roles. Summarizing, I am amazed such movies are still possible, such storyline can be made and such act can be observed. If you are disappointed of the western cinema, or you think you've seen it all - Revolutionary Road is the movie which will return you hope.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
NOT LISTENING; BUT TALKING,"The existential problems of White people are here shown to lead to functional neurosis; meaning being able to function politically, but never personally. This is especially emphasised here given that the only obviously-certifiable character (played by Michael SHANNON) is more sane in his understanding of the world than anyone else (albeit that his response to his own insights is decidedly anti-social).White people's problems-with-living are inevitably passed-on to their children as they also, in their turn, seek to achieve the meaning, the identity & the value largely absent from a culture superficially-addicted to materialism. But this central theme is not fully-explored, save for the lead (played indifferently by Leonardo DiCaprio) working in the advertising business - which he hates for its essential phoniness. But what in his family made him that way, we might well ask? And why is his response to it so weak?Thus, no solution to the problems of the two central characters is ever presented, except the pointlessness of running away from one's problem when they will never run away from you. The best that the wife (played by the always-superb Kate WINLSLET) can do is to procure an abortion so that no more suffering people are brought into the world.That White people lack the courage to be themselves explains a lot regarding their higher rates of, for example, suicide, depression & loneliness. They are thus reduced to acting-out their lives (while never truly living them) according to stage-plays written by others, regardless of self-esteem or whether or not those others have their best interests at heart; ensuring that they never actually achieve any self-interest or self-esteem. (This is exacerbated by the fact that Caucasians are also taught to be morbidly fearful of other cultures even if they could learn something from those cultures to their advantage.)This essential phoniness regarding one's relationship with oneself and regarding that with other people can only lead to bitterness, frustration & resentment at the resultant fear of social ridicule, ostracism & censure. Being different to other White people and, thereby, running the risk of psychological suffering for not confirming with their limitations and fears - albeit, paradoxically, conformity with those with whom one can never be friends with anyway precisely because of the difference.The insightful writing is good, but the 1950s suburban milieu is largely pointless since the issues discussed here would be true in any White ghetto at any time during the last 500 years. Still, the acting performances generally excellent - particularly Kathy BATES in a supporting role - but where are the true revolutionaries? Not here!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Contrast between make- believe and honesty,"The story takes place in a typical American suburb, a married couple loves each other, they have two children, a dog... Actually they do not have the dog. And they do not love each other very much. It’s the opposite- they are depressed and desperate about the monotonous life they live. This is exactly what is the film trying to say us: it makes the contrast between make- believe, which is created by the society and honesty (truth), which... which is always there, but nobody knows why. This contrast is unbelievable shocking and for the audience sometimes also ironic and, of course, fascinating. These two „values“ are „fighting“. Which one will win? The more sociable. What will it cause? Only depression and at the end- death. All this with great performances and soundtrack.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Most Underappreciated Novel in American Literature,"I have mixed feelings about the fact that Richard Yates did not live long enough to see his greatest novel made into a film, especially since the novel itself is about performance and performativity. I'm sad that he wasn't here to get a taste of the wide recognition and praise his work so richly deserves, but I am glad he did not have to witness the pallid, dull melodrama that was made of it. To be honest, I could not even sit through the entirety of this thing. Listen, the performances were good (DiCaprio is perfectly cast as Frank) and the movie captures the time of its setting well, but that is where it ends. The director of this movie seems to have a very superficial understanding of the novel, which I am here mainly to urge upon viewers of the film and for that matter on everyone. Revolutionary Road lost out to Walker Percy's The Moviegoer for The National Book Award in 1962, ironically enough. I enjoyed Percy's novel, but I will not ever read it again, while I return year after year to Yates, whose prose is so fine and perfectly turned that I can think of no other American writer besides Hemingway with whom to profitably compare him. Both writers do brilliantly what novelists today seem to have forgotten how to do, which is to tell first and foremost a riveting story. Both writers do this while at the same time constructing absolutely perfect and multi-dimensioned works of art. Indeed, I had read Revolutionary Road many times before deciding to teach it in a course I designed called ""The Problem of Mimesis in Post-1945 American Literature,"" and when I read it to prepare to teach it, i.e. Read it critically, it was only then that I discovered how minutely and interconnectedly all of its parts enmesh and work, like the movement of a fine watch. Please read this book. It is an unqualified masterpiece, and it is a tragedy that it is not more widely appreciated for what it is.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
How sane or insane are we?,"If American Beauty questioned human morality, Revolutionary Road questions sainity. Richard Yates disturbing tale of human relationship has transcended into screen by Sam Mendes.Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet who came together a decade ago for Titanic, play the role of the Wheelers, an outwardly happily married couple with two kids residing at Revolutionary Road.In the first few minutes of the movie, the audiences get to see, Frank Wheeler and April eying each other, falling in love and then cut to the present, a few years later there is sea change in their lives. Frank hates his job as a salesman in a cubicle while April's dream to become an actress is a failure. Adding to this is the stress of their marriage falling apart.And just like that April decides for them to get away from the emptiness and hopelessness encumbering their lives and start anew in Paris. She chalks out a plan to get herself a job there so that Frank can find what he really loves to do in life. All those close to them think it is the most unrealistic fantasy like idea, except for their land lady's lunatic son John Givings (Michael Shannon), who feels it's the sanest decision they had ever taken.Just as things are looking upbeat for the couple, in terms of relationship, fate takes a different turn. Frank gets promoted and Alice is pregnant. From here the tale grows into a complex heart wrenching. With the Paris dream shattered, their life once again goes topsy-turvy. And mad man John with his deep insight hurting words to set a cascade of unpredictable reactions to follow.Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are such a treat to watch. Di Caprio as a loving practical, responsible and once-in-a-while-going-astray husband, is especially good in the emotional scenes. Kate Winslet, yet again proves why she is the best actress on this planet. Michael will never be able to beat the Heath Ledger's insanity levels, but his very brief role getting nominated for the best supporting actor in the Oscars, speaks volumes.The monotonous background score by Thomas Newman is just as haunting as the movie.The movie is distressing in every right. It questions morality, fickleness of the human mind and its unpredictability. Who or what are we living for? For our own selves or for others? These will be the questions that will linger in your mind after watching this Mendes flick. He is a phenomenon, no doubt.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Devastating movie with amazing performances,"Sam Mendes returns with another picture following the lives of suburban families in America. In this one, the story is set in the 50's and takes place in Connecticut. No Kevin Spacey this time to steal the show, but Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet make up for that. They respectively portray Frank and April Wheeler who form a couple after meeting in a bar and move to suburbs after April gets knocked up. The movie opens with this bar scene, where they both meet and April tells Frank that she wants to pursue a career as an actress. Next, we cut to a play April is in and from the look on Frank's face it wasn't a good one. The two of them get into a fight on their way home and it becomes clear that they aren't the same people that met in a bar.The main themes of the movie, as it is mentioned in the movie, are emptiness and hopelessness. More precisely, the fight against it. We first saw Frank with some kind of confidence and excitement about the future on his face, but now he's not the man that would be noticed in a bar. As he goes to work he blends in with all the other men going to work, wearing their hats and gray jackets, just like him. He has lost his distinctiveness. April wanted to act but now has to settle for a life as a housewife. They are both unhappy, lost in the emptiness and hopelessness. The American dream grants everyone the right to the pursuit of happiness, but happiness is what the Wheelers struggle with, which leads to tensions and bad decisions within their household.This particular struggle is depicted perfectly by Sam Mendes. You can feel and see the emptiness in their lives, also thanks to some brilliant performances. DiCaprio is perfect and gives one of his best performances, which says a lot. The way he expresses his frustrations was amazing, the way he desperately tries to hold back his anger reminded me of a cover trying to stay on the cooking pot while the damp of the coiling water pushes it away. Kate Winslet is as brilliant as DiCaprio is, she gives a devastating, but brilliant performance. She won that year an Oscar for her performance in 'The Reader', but she deserved it for this one as well. DiCaprio wasn't even nominated. Why, I do not know.The movie is devastating, because it is so relatable. There are so many people living in their seemingly perfect lives, but desperately hoping for something more. Every year they grow older as their regrets start to accumulate. The Wheelers want to escape from this rut and decide to move to Paris, but deep down they know they're stuck, and will never become what they wanted to become back when they were young, back in that bar. Besides this devastating look on the suburban life, there are a few lighter moments. Sam Mendes luckily lightens the mood from time to time by pointing out the silliness of this suburban life in a subtle comedic way. Only, we could have used more of this.Another strength of this movie, that simply has to be mentioned, is Michael Shannon. He plays this character, who's unfortunately only in the movie for a couple of scenes, that suffers from mental issues. If telling the truth is a mental illness, then this guy is a complete lunatic. With his character, the movie cleverly makes fun of the suburban families for being afraid of the truth to an extent that they send people who actually tell the truth for once to a mental institution. All right, there was something off with this character, perfectly portrayed by Michael Shannon by the way. It is however a shame that his character wasn't more present in the movie. The movie could have benefited from his refreshing presence.The themes in this movie are intriguing and relatable, the screenplay did an excellent job in making us understand the inner desires and motivations of the characters. The cinematography was terrific as well, and so was the entire ensemble cast. Yet, somehow this depressing tone of the movie became a drag at times. Some lighter moments could have made this movie easier to watch. '12 Years a Slave' had also this continuous depressing tone, without any lighter moments, but still managed to be absolutely perfect. 'Revolutionary Road fails at this, because even though the overall message is devastating and conveyed perfectly, the story is unfortunately not interesting enough to make your care for 2 hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mid-Century/Mid-Life Madness,"I loved this film, and I'm disappointed that it didn't receive more Oscar nods. I suspect it resonates more with women, than men. Not only are the roles of wife/mother/social being/etc. timeless, but I felt the crux of the story was April's descent into madness. She was not a well woman, and I see so little written up about it. She was not just dreamy-eyed about escaping the suburbs, but suffered from some sort of mental illness. I felt for her, and I agree that she was stronger than Frank, but her instability brought the couple's dynamic further down. Dreaming of dropping out, adultery, frustration over kids and suburban monotony are all part of (mid?) life, miserable as it may be at times. Frank tried to deal with them, though constricted by an exasperating, energy-draining wife. The 50s sets, costumes, etc. were beautiful, making the film more inviting to sink into, and I really appreciated everyone's performance. At first I, too, felt that poor, ageless Leo may be out of his league (I think that every time I see him, but then he settles into the role and, in no time, I am totally believing he is Howard Hughes!). And I noticed Frank's aging, too, or was it angst-ing? The Michael Shannon thing is a little lost on me. I just don't see that brief role as such a stretch. They say playing crazy is easy, but I say that Kate Winslet's slow slimmer to the pit of despair would be impossible for the average good actress in Hollywood to portray these days. And P.S. I would have preferred to see Kathy Bates get a nod for her role.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Grim and potent look at a failing marriage.,"It's the mid 1950s and Frank and April Wheeler are not so much facing the seven year itch in their marriage, but more an opening wound from which forms a chasm of despair that is luring them in.Revolutionary Road is a tough sell as a piece of entertainment, in fact it's probably best to sell it as a tough uncompromising expose of a drifting suburbanite relationship. Adapting from Richard Yate's misery laden ""classic,"" director Sam Mendes and his team have crafted an actors piece that is as rewarding as it most definitely is a downer. Full of deceit and sadness, it's only really with the complexities of the characters that the discerning viewer can be pulled in to the perspectives of the protagonists. That this occurs is testament to the acting ability of both Kate Winslet {April} and Leonardo DiCaprio {Frank}. Arguably two of the best actors of their generation, they each give it such believability, such desperation, it offers up an anti-dote to any effects driven picture rising up the current DVD sales charts.Clinically directed by Mendes, and given a lush 50s sheen from Roger Deakins visuals, Revolutionary Road is a must see of modern era, dramatic, dialogue driven films. If one is likely to want to see it again after viewing it is questionable. The DVD sales will make for interesting reading I feel. But once viewed it's unlikely that you are ever likely to forget having let the piece get under your skin. Something I think that this film will achieve to the majority of like minded adults after some like minded adult cinema. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What Lies Beneath,"In 1950s Connecticut, a seemingly happy young couple copes with personal problems. It's a beautifully realized film based on a 1961 novel by Richard Yates, although the screenplay is somewhat choppy. Mendes does an excellent job of evoking a period where life seemed to be simpler, but, as always, there were people who had to fight personal demons. Winslet and DiCaprio are terrific as the volatile couple, with the former seeking escape from her mundane existence while making life hell for the latter. Standouts in the supporting cast are Bates as a real estate agent and Shannon, funny and scary, as her mentally disturbed son. Newman provides a rather haunting score.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is a truly heartfelt and emotional piece done by to amazing Actors.Kate winslet- This is truly a career defining performance. She is won of the few actors who can show so much emotion and expression such a little look. The character April Wheeler is a very complicated character to comprehend.she is a truly confused and emotional mother. Kate Winlset plays her perfectly. So subtle but yet so powerful. Kate winslet was snubbed for her performanceLeonardo Dicaprio- Give this man an Oscar already! his performance in this film was fantastic. Why he did not get a nomination for this is beyond me. Frank wheeler, is a very confused person. He loves his wife but yet hates her at the same time. So much confusion in his life can often lead to emotional breakdowns which Dicaprio plays perfectly.And might I mention Micheal Shannons performance? Micheal shannon- Micheal Shannon plays Helen Givings mentally ill son John. Going to this movie i would have never suspected such a raw and honest performance. Good Luck at the Oscars.This movie is a flawless piece of cinema and is truly one of the best in years.

The Wolf of Revolutionary Road,"Revolutionary Road is a relationship drama set in the mid 1950s and follows a young couple Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his wife April (Kate Winslet). The couple live in a quiet suburban neighbourhood on Revolutionary Road with their two children. On the outside this couple seems to have it all a beautiful home, friends who live on the same street aswell as two beautiful children. Frank has a well paid job so his wife and children are provided for in every way, but behind closed doors Frank and April are anything but happy. The life that they imagined having years ago has been replaced by the so called ""American Dream"" neither one of them is happy with their life, consequently leading the couple to fight and argue about how their lives have become dull, unfulfilling and down right miserable. The two blame each other for their unfulfilling lives and after a particularly bad fight things start to unravel and they both have to make a decision to either continue as they are never fulfilling their hopes and dreams suffering and slowly ageing in their suburban hell or they can make a change move to France and start a new and exciting life.This isn't a romance story about love and happy endings this is a serious drama that tells the story of a young couple who become trapped in a life neither of them want. (DiCaprio's) character Frank works a ten hour a day job that he absolutely hates but does the responsible thing a man in 1950s would be expected to do work hard and provide for his family even though the life he is living is slowly killing him inside. (Kate Winslet's) character April is a stay at home housewife who cooks, cleans and takes care of the children while her husband works and provides for the family. She does what's expected of her as a housewife in the 1950s but begins to resent her husband and even her children for trapping her in a life she never wanted so she decides to confront her husband and hopefully convince him that they should move to France like they always dreamed or doing so they can be happy as a family again but it's never as simple as it seems as their miserable life in Suburban hell is harder to let go of than they realised.The movie has an interesting story that shows the serious and more depressing side of the 1950s American dream and that the pursuit of happiness doesn't always end in happiness and bliss. Revolutionary Road is a sad story that tackles important issues such as serious depression aswell as the stress and pressure of having a family and the responsibilities that come with getting married and having children such as providing for your family aswell as other issues like unplanned pregnancy's and abortions in the 1950s.I recommend watching Revolutionary Road if you enjoy watching serious relationship dramas that aren't afraid to take a real look at serious issues that while this movie takes place in the 1950s many of these issues are still relevant in the modern day.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
More feasible than American Beauty...,"As I settled into this movie, I began to sense a feeling of familiarity (I caught it a few minutes into it) with the subject matter, then I realized the setting and time-frame were not present day, they were, in fact, back in the 1950s. At first it seemed like an ordinary run-of-the-mill period piece, but as I allowed myself to be absorbed by the movie's theme and subject matter, I realized that it was quite an interesting story after all. In fact, it was, at times, disturbingly realistic, as I can speak from personal experience, having grown up within that same time period, when life was 'supposed' to be simpler. When I came to realize it was from the same Director as the film ""American Beauty"", I knew why it held my attention so, because this man can really tell an interesting story and is quite impressive as a creative artist. I won't say it was an entertaining experience, as the subject matter is not your typical feel-good fare, but it is a very compelling movie that I intend on watching from the beginning, and then over again, because it was so interesting. It is also much more plausible in terms of realism than its predecessor, American Beauty. Great job Mssrs. Mendes, DiCaprio, Shannon and Mss. Winslet, Bates et al!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A story of couple who have poles apart perception for life,"Set in 1950s Connecticut suburbs, the husband and wife are living their ordinary life with their two children. The husband is very satiated with his job and his life is full of excitement and pleasing challenges. He has spark as well in his life when he develops an extramarital affair with his secretary. Contrarily, the wife is living a lethargic and depressed life. She has the burden of household chores, babysitting, and keeping her husband happy, all the same, all the day. Her life becomes more depressed when she becomes pregnant. Their different lives take a turn when the wife makes a call to move to Paris and live all new life. Initially the husband accepts her call. But due to some recent developments in both lives, the husband retreats. This is the beginning when their relationship, which was painted in a fictitious light earlier, starts to show the true colour. After an unpleasant fight between them, the wife comes to realise that her life can never be dynamic and she has to live it half-hearted. Saddened with her dull life, she takes a decision which alters her and his husband's life forever.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Dark Side of The 'Burbs,"The dream is set: wife and husband with two kids will leave everything behind in suburban America and live in Paris where life and personal ambition can be achieved and, more so, felt. It's a dream. It barely rings logically now in the 21st century. So, how can it hold water during the 1950s?It should first be mentioned that this is no Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet reunion with foggy window love on a sinking ship. Winslet's character, April Wheeler, is the one who brings up Paris, and it's up to her neighbors, her husband's coworkers, and her husband, Frank (DiCaprio), to accept the venture as reality. Whiskey, chain-smoking, and superficial conversation among plastic covered couches go against whimsical idealism with an Eiffel Tower on the side. This is an easy win for the 'burbs.I loved this movie, but I also think it encompasses its own specific audience. If you enjoyed American Beauty, you are in for an enjoyably intense experience. Sam Mendes directed both, and, as a side note, Kate Winslet is his real-life wife. Mendes seems to be obsessed with what really happens behind the walls of so-called happily married families with white picket fences. It's not that he sees the suburban life as sinister; it's just too ordinary. We root for April and Frank, but we also know that a job promotion, a third child, and skeptic friends will pull them away from the dream.Watching DiCaprio and Winslet, it is difficult to remember these were the two lovebirds in Titanic. Here, their on-screen relationship is more real and fragile. They are flawed, and it is useless to assign blame as each one is genuinely trying to keep the marriage together in a low divorce rate era. Along with their first-rate chemistry, Michael Shannon gives a humorous performance as John Givings, a neighbor just released from a mental asylum with more sense than anyone in the movie.All in all, Revolutionary Road is a meticulous study of a marriage in crisis. It works best if the viewer is prepared for a tragedy to question, learn from, or simply embrace.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A cinematic punch to the gut.,"Wow. I'm almost at a loss for words. Revolutionary Road was one of the most honest and emotionally involving movie experiences that I've seen in months. It's fairly rare that a film leaves such a strong impression on me, but I'm pleased to say that it has happened once again.The music, acting, and directing are brilliant, but that is to be expected from a movie with this many talented people involved. I won't go into any particulars about the plot. It's best that a viewer experiences this with no pre-defined expectations, like I did. Just know that there are some incredibly complex issues presented here, and there are no easy solutions to be found. Revolutionary Road is undeniably sad, but there's a complete lack of those ""tug-on-your-heartstrings"" moments. It's all brutal and true to life. That's what makes the movie so compelling. You can't watch it, without thinking about yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Runaway Road,"Leo and Kate's (and don't forget the wonderful Kathy Bates as well) reunion here in 'Revolutionary Road' from 'Titanic' reminded me so much of the Richard Gere/Julia Roberts's 'Pretty Woman' follow-up/reunion 'Runaway Bride.' In both cases, the originals they starred in were incredibly better and the latter films weren't complete disappointments, just not as great. Here we have Leo acting like Leo, but much better is Kate who shows so much depth to the lost housewife of the fifties who realized what little anyone else that lived in the area/time either saw or talked about: the 'Stepford Wives' effect. Of course, I'm not talking about robots, but they might as well just be. Men: grow, find a great, but boring job, marry, have 1 kid, get promoted, have another kid, repeat. Women: just do whatever the man says. I liked Kate in this movie because I truly believed her anguish, the lost feeling she had, the 'no-escape' clause she thought there was. If anyone gets nominated, it should be her. Everyone else, including Leo, might have just walked off the 'Mad Men' extras back lot. Overall, I liked the film and the study of the two seemingly (but really not) cardboard cuts of the neighborhood (or times); however it seemed to stretch a 20-page-novelette into 2 hours of film. And boy, did it really make me want to have a cigarette, and not because of any steamy scenes.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revolutionary characters on a road that curved to brilliance,"As Frank and April Wheeler move to Revolutionary Road, it is indeed hard to remember if they are the young Wheelers on Revolutionary Road, or the young Revolutionaries on Wheeler Road. This was noted by mental institution patient, John (Michael Shannon) and I agreed with him. Part of the brilliance of ""Revolutionary Road"" is having the one character who is deemed mentally unfit also be the one voice of reason.Director Sam Mendes takes us back to the 1950s to a Connecticut Suburb, where you were supposed to get married, have kids and play house. And if you wanted to play in a pretty house with a pretty wife and kids, then you had to work at a job you didn't like. Frank and April are more perceptive and innovative than those around them, and they believed that they didn't have to live that life to be happy. They could move to Paris and do whatever they wanted.Revolutionary Road was not a straight road, and although it never really twisted or turned, it did curve. Frank and April could see past their neighbours, but they couldn't see past themselves. Instead of a revolutionary move across the ocean, we got to examine trust issues that only spanned the suburb and the city. And for as forward-looking as they are, they couldn't see what was holding them back. But we could.I was fascinated by ""Revolutionary Road"" because they gave me a revolutionary character that I could instantly connect with, and the resolutions for Frank and April were always just around the bend that you could almost see. DiCaprio, Winslet, Mendes and writer Justin Haythe have enough talent and nerve to drive me straight to the end without stalling.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
About as close to perfect as any film that I have ever seen.,"So why do I give it 9 out of ten? Because watching it was not exactly an enjoyable experience and I would not recommend this to everyone. But Sam Mendes may be the best director working in Hollywood today. Each and every performance in this film is nothing short of brilliant. Kate Winslet gives her best performance to date here and I think the same can be said of Leo. Though I continue to admire the hell out of almost everything that he has done. Michael Shannon should have gotten some sort of supporting actor nod. His character of John Givings as sort of the Id personified was probably the most difficult part in the film and he just did an outstanding job. I could go on and on,just don't make me ever see the film again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dull Movie with Wooden characters,"I really wanted to like this film kate winslet is great in it but the movie just doesn't work as a film. Its characters are just not believable and the core of the movie is just so dull that nothing interesting happens. Just because actors make a good performance in a movie sure doesn't mean the movie is worth watching.There's no doubt Di Caprio is a very versatile actor and a good actor like Winslet but the film spends far too long ith the same story thread that it just becomes dull.The ""mental"" neighbour is a joke, its like a character they just added who could point out the mess and problems that Winslet and Di Caprios characters have. Its such a lazy, lame wooden character used to put some kinda ""realism"" into the movie that it just fails big time.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incredibly depressing film about disillusionment and betrayal,"Sam Mendes, who in 2002 made the rather depressing and darkly-lit ROAD TO PERDITION, has now made a really deeply depressing film about people screaming and shouting at each other. Leonardo DiCaprio is so good at all of this vicious behaviour that one hopes it really is acting. The only characters in the entire film who are in any way admirable are the long-suffering wife of DiCaprio, played nobly by Kate Winslet (who is not afraid to do without makeup and look increasingly haggard), and a character who is temporarily on release from an insane asylum (excellently portrayed by Michael Shannon), so that it is no accident of the script that the only truths spoken in this film are those declaimed by a madman. This film is set in the leafy Connecticut suburbs near Long Island Sound (a beach of which we actually see in one scene), where DiCaprio and Winslet are 'the Wheelers', an attractive young couple whom everyone admires. Winslet is admirable, but her oafish and totally vacuous husband is not. For years she does not see this, which makes her very dim indeed! Perhaps I should point out that the title of this film does not refer in any way to any revolution, and this is not a film about Lenin or Castro. Revolutionary Road is merely the ironical name of the deeply boring and non-revolutionary suburban street in which the Wheelers live. Kathy Bates is magnificent in her supporting role as a neighbour, but then when was Kathy Bates not magnificent? There is one sensationally brilliant scene in the film where the disillusioned Winslet sits quietly smoking her cigarette while chaos reigns around her, with other people screaming and shouting like the maniacs they all are, a true eye-of-the-storm moment, carried out impeccably by the imperturbable Winslet and, let's face it, brilliantly directed by Mendes. I hate to say that because I don't like the film, but one must be fair. As so often in reviews of violent films, when I ask 'why did they make this?', I have to pose the question as to why Mendes wasted his time on this subject. OK, so he gets credit for no one getting murdered, and he did not have to wipe blood and gore off his lens. Also, there are no exploding cars, no chases, and the only violence is psychological, though that is as intense as it gets. But there are pointless and seedy sex scenes. The Germans have two words which mean 'to eat'. They are 'essen', which applies to humans, and 'fressen', which describes the eating habits of animals. I would describe the copulating habits of animals as imitated by humans by a new word, also adding an 'r', and call it 'serx'. In this film the supposedly devoted wife Winslet has 'serx' in the car with a neighbour. This scene is either inserted to show her state of despair or just because Mendes likes serx scenes. (There is an earlier serx scene between Winslet and her oaf husband which takes place against a wall of the kitchen, where fortunately no pots or pans were hanging, but although nobody banged against any of those, another type of banging did occur.) I think we might also invent a new verb for having sex, by inserting an 'r' into the one which everyone shouts (as in this film) but which, due to the hypocrisy of human society, no one is permitted to write down, and certainly not in a review like this, which might be read by an underage person of, say, 45, and cause offence. So there is serx and there is oafishness and there is shouting and screaming, and that's about it, really. Certainly something to cheer us all up! Thanks, Sam! What's next? DIARY OF A MADMAN?",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
What's the Point?,"I thought this movie should win the award for most depressing movie of the year. They could invent a new category with this film in mind. This movie is my worst nightmare come to life. Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) play a married couple in the 1950s. We understand that they are perfect for one another, but their marriage is horrible. They tear each other down and say awful things to one another. They are two wounded people bumping up against one another. They don't talk about these problems and instead focus on the surface problems. They have bought into the lie that ""this is as good as it gets."" One day, April decides that good enough isn't good enough and she wants a change. She decides she can find that life in Paris. If they would only move to Paris, then they would be happy. Frank agrees and then later changes his mind. They don't move to Paris and fight even more. The movie is this couple fighting the entire movie. Instead of talking to one another, they decide to have affairs to numb the pain of their lives. They tear each other apart until there is nothing left.Now don't get me wrong, this is a well-made and interesting movie. I was riveted the whole time, and my heart was beating fast the entire film. I'm not really sure why that was. Needless to say, it was intense. The acting was superb. Forget about The Reader, Kate should have received an award for her performance here. The same goes for Leo. I love Leonardo DiCaprio, and I always will. I have loved him since he was a little squirt on Growing Pains. Both of these actors can show the torment they are feeling with one look. Then, effortlessly, they cover it up to hide their pain.That would be enough, having two lead actors work this kind of magic, but the supporting cast is perfect as well. John (Michael Shannon) is perfect as a tortured mathematician whose had shock treatments. He is like an oracle who can only speak the truth, even though no one wants to hear it. There is never a dull dinner party when John is invited. The next door neighbors say much more when they are not speaking.All that being said, what is the point of this movie? I am trying to imagine someone trying to spin this to a studio . . .Storyboard guy: Okay, Joe, so there's this married couple, you see? And their both young and beautiful. They meet, get married, and they're miserable.Joe: Mmm-hmmm.Storyboard: One day they decide to move to Paris, but the husband, see, he changes his mind, and they don't move to Paris.Joe: Mmm-hmmm Storyboard: Then they are still miserable, you see? Joe: Mmm-hmmm, but it ends okay, right? Storyboard: No, it gets worse.Joe: Mmm-hmm. Well, I'm sold.It's not a movie that will make you cry. You just feel empty, and wonder what the heck just happened.What do we learn? Don't get married? Is the moral really you should have moved to Paris. Let's just get real here. It wouldn't matter if they lived in Paris or not. Neither one of them could admit their fears to one another. They never helped each to grow or took the time to reach out to one another. And that's the trap they couldn't escape, not suburban America.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could somebody please tell me what is it about?,"Could somebody please tell me what is it about? My first hypothesis is that the film illustrates a thesis that couple who believe themselves superior to everybody else end badly. Perhaps; but it is hardly worth making a movie about. Otherwise, I was at loss as to what was the plot of the story. She is frustrated in her role of a housewife, but it is not her husband's fault that she miscalculated her professional talents. Her lack of realistic assessment of herself and the situation is dramatically emphasized by her revolutionary plans for life: completely unrealistic. Besides, what is it that her husband is supposed to find when he seeks himself? My second hypothesis is therefore that the film is intended to illustrate the harm done no doubt to great many young people in the 1950s by the existentialists' myth of an ""authentic self"", which sits somewhere deep in us, to be dug out. What is more, the husband does actually get an interesting job, a job that, as we now know, has a brilliant future. Further, his infidelity is difficult to understand. We, the Hollywood clients, know that powerful men have romances with their secretaries. But secretaries choose powerful men, not zeroes in cubicles. An alternative template is therefore a passionate outburst of love, but both seem to be doing it rather of boredom, if anything. Nothing against Di Caprio and Winslett  they are playing well, but what are they playing?",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Less Than Meets The Eye,"While the film has all of the trappings of Oscar gold including a large marketing campaign, a top shelf cast and Golden Globe nominations it fails the biggest test: Watchability. After an intriguing first half hour the film seems to slip into a predictable pattern and by the end that pattern has worn out its welcome.Director Sam Mendes is no stranger to marital drama. He swept the Oscars with ""American Beauty"" a film that made Kevin Spacey a star and was extremely accurate at mining the contradictions of upper middle class domestic bliss. The wild success of ""Desperate Housewives"" owes more than a small debt to that film. His follow-up ""Road To Perdition"" broadened the scope but at its heart was a study of the family. Turning his focus to a popular and critically acclaimed novel I must say that he falls flat this time despite the efforts of DeCaprio and Winslett, the pair that hold the record for the most successful box office champion of all time.""Road"" is set in about the same time period as AMC's critically acclaimed ""Mad Men"" and is about a couple approaching their 10th anniversary. They live in a nice house and have two darling kids and are friends with other couples. The film suggests that according to the standards of the current zeitgeist they should be happy and content. But the script suggests that the pair once believed that they were ""special"" above the milieu of everyday life. Unforetunately there seems to be very little that is ""special"" about them unless you consider the husband's extramarital affairs at work or what would appear to be the increasing erratic behavior of his wife to fall into any ex halted category.At first the aggressive banter between the pair seems jarring and somewhat unique if not totally captivating. But precious little happens in the story and we are left to chew on basically two performers showing us all of their chops and if we can draw anything from the finished product it may be that either Mendes is not that great of a director or maybe that these movie stars are not great movie artists at least not good enough to carry an entire film without any real support. DeCaprio seemed to blow away his detractors with his stunning work in ""The Departed"" but in retrospect the kudos may actually belong with Scorsese who helmed that project. I guess that everyone will draw their own conclusion but my guess is that simple deduction would place the blame on the performers.The glowing reviews, award nominations and the cast will most likely bring the public in to see the film but my guess is that this Road will end up being less traveled than others.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Waste of Talent,"Perhaps 3 out of 10 is a little bit generous for this monstrous waste of time, but I feel I had to at least give the actors some credit, because they made the best out of an insufferably dull and pointless story. That's about the only nice thing I can say about this film. I went to see it and walked out after an hour. I want that time back! The premise of the film as a suburban couple who are unhappy with their lives. I guess the idea is that people might relate to it.

Enough with bashing suburban life,"I am so sick of watching movie after movie bash suburban life as some sort of collecting bin for sellouts. Makes me want to wear an apron and pearls around the house just to be spiteful.Kate Winslet's penchant for choosing roles (and husbands who direct movies) that diminish the importance of doing what's right in life indicate am immaturity that will become more and more unattractive as her body stubbornly continues to age, leaving her brain behind. Selfish, unrealistic, and simplistic, her characters (and herself) seem so indulgent that I feel like I'm watching a 3 year old have a temper tantrum every time she's on screen. Kate, sweetie, growing up is actually incredibly freeing...you should try it.The movie industry's obsession with mocking the American family unit, although quite transparent and cliché in movies of the last thirty years, has also unfortunately been quite effective. The nuclear family is under attack, along with the American dream. The Artistic Elite dance a jig at the realization that their incessant pounding in films is successfully ushering societal norms to their doom; rising divorce rates, out of wedlock births, and abortions continue to feed the Left's gleeful attacks on family values. Congratulations, Hollywood...the propaganda you've been pumping out for the last decades is coming to fruition, culminating with the sheeple's unquestioning adoration of tripe like ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""Little Children"", to name only two.The fact that one Hollywood couple (Mendes and Winslet) account for such a large majority of these types of films says so much about what I assume goes on behind closed doors in THEIR home.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
