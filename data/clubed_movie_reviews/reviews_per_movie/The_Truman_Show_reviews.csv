One of the Most Original Films Ever Made,"'The Truman Show' epitomizes strong and original storytelling on screen. This film is emotionally engaging, didactic, witty, dramatic and very unique. For those unfamiliar with the concept, Truman Burbank has never left his ideal home town of Sea Haven. What he doesn't know is that his entire environment is a materialized set and he is the ignorant star of a reality TV show of epic proportions.Taking this entirely original concept, writer Andrew Niccol and director Peter Wier take the viewer into territory uncharted by anything in film history. Thus, the plot is entirely unpredictable but still flows along expertly. The tightness of the screenplay and the immaculate pacing of Peter Wier contribute largely to this film's brilliance.The acting performances are amongst the best I've ever seen. Jim Carey is superb as Truman, effortlessly conveying his fears, desires and personality. Ed Harris is excellent as the reclusive creator of the production. In addition, the entire support cast appears synthetic enough to let the audience know they are ""acting"" for Truman but in some scenes let their ""genuine"" feelings shine through. The ensemble simply cannot be faulted. Carey was hardly done by not to get an Oscar nomination for his performance.The music and visuals are top notch. The cinematography has a reality TV feel that is clever but never intrusive. The shot selection is of the highest quality, particularly in the movie's final sequence. Muscially, this film is incredible. Phillip Glass is a dream on the piano, perfectly evoking the mood for each section of the narrative. The two combine excellently during the scene in which Truman breaks his routine for the first time. During the sequence, Truman makes subtle changes to the bland routine he follows compliantly every day. The emotion of the music when combined with the apparent simplicity of Truman's actions makes this scene one the most powerful I'v ever experienced.This film is an absolute gem. It effortlessly combines everything a classic film should have. It has comedy, drama, strong character development, atmosphere, originality, superb visuals, a superb score, tight writing, raises interesting moral questions as well as providing insight into the human condition. One cannot watch this spectacular film without wondering how a human would react when put in that kind of situation. It touches on our sense of adventure, desire for conformity and the courage we require to question the life we are presented with. 'The Truman Show' does all this in the most accessible and compelling fashion. One of the greatest films of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good Afternoon, Good Evening, and Goodnight","One of the most creative films ever conceived, let alone made and executed- The Truman Show is on all fronts an absolutely perfect film- and will stand the test of time as an absolute classic. On every singular level this film works astoundly- jim Carrey provides a pitch perfect performance as our titular star Truman Burbank- in an incredible casting decision that I am sure turned a lot of heads at the time. Yes we see some of that classic Carrey throughout the film- but the man can act, and never before had it been brought to such attention as it had with this film- and he captures his role perfectly. The other actors do an excellent job as well, namely Ed Harris and Natascha McElhone- as well as Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich. The direction is fantastic, and much needed for the creative vision of the film at hand. The script is not only well done, but incredibly thought provoking, original, and brilliantly put into flm format. The music is fantastic, letting us feel so much emotion from such simple and classic pieces of work. The pacing is excellent, and the film leaves you with a smile and you wanting more- as I think any good film should. In the end, I have absolutely no complaints about The Truman Show. I've seen it more times than I can count, and it's easily one of my favorite films out there. Its a creative masterpiece that is unlike anything we would ever see today, or anything before it. It may be 20 years old, but The Truman Show may just be one of the most brilliant and influential films ever made.My Rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Genius,"I asked a friend to describe The Truman Show.  He said, ""No, it's not a comedy, well...not exactly.""  I didn't quite understand until I watched it myself.  Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately.  The point (the media and its destructive powers)  is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals.  Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless.  Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here.  This is a thinking person's movie.  If you can't see the underlying message here, of course you won't like it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"It's undoubtedly one of my favorite movies, the kind of movie that changes our lives, as well as looking like a long episode of Black Mirror.","As inventive and creative as Weir's staging is, The Truman Show wouldn't work without credible Truman. And Carrey carries off the tricky role with a chipperness that belies a deep-seeded longing for more in life than surface perfection in all this movie is one of my all time favorites.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very Philosophic,"An insurance salesman/adjuster (Jim Carrey) discovers his entire life is actually a T.V. show.This movie has been brought to ethics and philosophy classes and used as a tool for discussion. Unfortunately it was never used in any class I took (despite being a philosophy major), but I guess we cannot all get that experience.So much to ponder: was it right to treat Truman this way? Was the television executive playing God? If the wife (Laura Linney) was only in it as part of a contract and not because she genuinely cared for Truman, what does that make her? And what if this really happened? Would people watch it or rebel?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A True American Classic,"When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.Weir, who directed the great 'Witness', uses different camera angles to make you feel like you're actually watching 'The Truman Show' and not a movie. He ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped Carrey and Harris give immaculate performances. Andrew Niccol script is a real star in the movie too because of it's inventiveness and ingenuity. Overall, 'The Truman Show' is what I like to call a true American classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the best movies in history,"I loved this movie. Everything about it. It is one you just want to watch over and over again. Jim Carey, as usually, played an amazing role. He made you think you were him, as the whole movie did. Watch it... its a must.Imagine being captivated all your life in a show, without knowing. Your neighbors, your family, your loved ones... everyone you ever knew were just actors, pretending to be people they are not. Well Truman Burbank not only imagined it, but also lived it. This is a hilarious movie, that will catch you from the first minute you watch it. Just be aware... once you start watching it, it will be difficult to stop. I rate this movie 5/5, with no negative comments.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Lawn Mowing At Its Best,"""The Truman Show"" owes a lot to the direction of Peter Weir. Weir refuses to pump out the movies in a search for extra dollars. Instead he chooses wisely and directs brilliantly. Just by looking at a list of his movies will surprise and even amaze you. So as you would imagine ""The Truman Show"" is another success.Truman Burbank has the perfect life, or so he thought until finally his life long suspicions about his world begin to unravel. Even though the idea for Truman is not totally original, it is thought provoking enough and allows the audience to wonder, what if? If you think this couldn't happen, just look back over the years at the stupidity of the human race and think again.Jim Carrey once again nails his role, as do the entire cast. It is rare he fails to perform at a level that perfectly complements the movie and its genre. This is something he does not receive enough credit for. Acting for a comical role or a more dramatic role requires no less effort for the performance to be spot on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant. One of the most interesting films of the last 10 years,"""The Truman Show"" is a rarity in Hollywood - or movies in general - a film that actually makes the audience think, and is about ideas. How do we know what we see is real? Why do we accept what is around us without questioning it? What would happen if we found out that a fundamental we were making about the world turned out to be completely wrong? You'd think a movie that was about those things would be a chore to get through, but in fact ""The Truman Show"" is great fun. I certainly wouldn't call it a comedy (although there are a few light moments here and there), but it's not too heavy and goes down easy.It might sound like exaggeration, but the scene where Truman first starts to realize what's going on is one of the best scenes I've seen in any movie, because of Carrey's acting, the direction, and also because of the Philip Glass soundtrack (which was critical to making that scene work).If you haven't seen The Truman Show, do yourself a favor and check it out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

An On-Film Miracle,"Although it sometimes seems that Hollywood is catering to the lowest common denominator of everything, The Truman Show is proof that there are great ideas that are able to be turned into great movies.  Jim Carrey plays an excellent role as a man with whom you can emphasize as well as be entertained by.  The film's surrealistic nature is frightening when the viewer realizes the legal feasibility in today's society, and it offers a great message about who or what we assume God to be and how He (he?) would react to our personal drives for discovery to challenge a world we treat as an aquarium.  Some things to note and ponder: The way the real-life viewers ignore the real lives of their compatriots and customers while focusing on a false life on screen; whose life is more real and whose is worth living?  Also, note that Christof does not have his name listed among the ""real world"" in the credits, but in ""Christof's World.""  His high-profile media-driven life is no different from Truman's!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Takes a little while to get into, but after the climax, you won't want to stop watching!","In the Truman Show, we follow the life of Truman, someone who was adopted by a film corporation at birth and lives as the focus of the most famous reality TV show, without even knowing it. This show is on 24/7, following every little detail of Truman's life. His little town is all he knows, and for years, he is okay with it. Since he is the star of the show, he is the center of attention of the town. Eventually this fact sticks out to him; Truman starts to figure out that something isn't right and decides to do something about it. He tries to escape, but he encounters many obstacles keeping him on the TV show's island. This movie inflates the idea of how far we will go for our own pleasure. In the movie, the whole world knows about the TV show, that the main actor is being watched 24/7 without knowing it, and that his life is being controlled by the cast and directors, yet they do nothing about it. In fact, they don't want to do anything about it; they enjoy it. Truman has no privacy, but no one seems to care; it must be alright since they are getting entertainment out of it, right? The movie also uses irony to convince the audience of flaws in our society. When Truman is struggling in his life, he turns to his ""best friend"" who talks to him using the director's words spoken to him over his earpiece. One of the most ironic line in the movie, in my opinion, was when Truman's best friend turns to him during a serious conversation and says, ""The last thing I would ever do is lie to you,"". This is ironic, because of course as he says this, he is lying. He is trying to convince Truman that he is just thinking crazy thoughts and everything is normal, when he actually knows that the whole world is watching is life play out. The Truman Show really makes us reflect on our lives; how far do we go for our own pleasure? It uses many satirical elements to convince us of this flaw. At first, while watching the movie, we find it crazy and over-the-top at this world's crazy idea of reality TV. When we stop and think about it, it makes us wonder how far-fetched it really is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but it could've been great","This is a good movie, and it could've been great, though unfortunately it wasn't.For one, the idea for the story was thought-provoking, intriguing.

Who knows.The acting was, well, ... it was fine enough, though I can't honestly say that it was wonderful, because I've seen a lot more which was better. Ed Harris was good, and Jim Carrey was OK. I guess perhaps all those rave reviews came because people got a revelation with another side of Jim Carrey in this movie, but I think he still has a long way to go. Still, this is a good start!This is a good movie, though it could've been great. Too bad it wasn't ... Anyway, we can hope for better movies. Get another great idea. Then make it !!!!!!!!

It _had_ potential.,"When the movie started I hoped I'd see a movie that utilized the potentiality of what this kind of plot has: Finding that your whole life was one big lie - and the emotional crisis that follows it. Alas, that was not to follow - I hoped the movie would go on from the point Truman successfully escaped the place, but instead the movie ended.I was dismayed that the director didn't realise what great potentiality the movie would had if we could see the emotions Truman would go thru when he finds the Real World(Tm). One would go insane from going from a safe haven to a more unfriendlier and tough world, which would be very interesting to see - and give the movie a much more emotional edge!

Ambitious and Entertaining Treatise on the Reality Media Creates for Us,"It's not often a Hollywood film arrives with such lofty ambitions as this. On one hand this is a high concept comedy in the vein of ""Groundhog Day"" about an unwitting man whose entire life has been a TV show.  This is also a Jim Carrey vehicle designed to display his charms.  On the other hand this a very satirical look at the way the media manipulates our reality.  The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. a higher power and reality vs. fantasy.  It doesn't always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could.  Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining.  There are some great cinematic moments here.  I loved the ""stolen kiss on the beach at night"" and ""Cue the sun!""In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current ""reality TV"" obsessed culture.  Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do).  The universe does not revolve around us.  In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic ""childhood"" existence.  How's it going to end?  Who knows...but things will never be the same.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Completely blew me away!,"The Truman Show, an absolute classic, was a movie that blew me away. This film is genius on so many levels.The film follows Truman Burbank, a man living in the perfect world of Seahaven, who is unaware of the fact that his entire world is a large set and he is the star of a grand TV show, known as The Truman Show, created by Christof.If you've only heard the synopsis now and never watched the movie then you must be wondering ""How will this movie work?"". I had the same thought before watching it. After viewing it I can say that The Truman Show is exceptionally made and one of the greatest films ever to come out.What makes this movie undeniably amazing is the direction, screenplay and acting. Peter Weir's direction is simply outstanding. There isn't any moment where you feel bored since the film paces extremely well. The cinematography and shot selection is perfect. Both add to the realism and make the idea of this world being a TV show very believable.The acting all around is fantastic. Jim Carrey plays Truman effortlessly. Aside from the script, Carrey makes the character of Truman believable and lovable with great emotion and personality. Ed Harris was also brillant as the manipulative creator of the show. Everyone else's performances felt real as they pretend to be in the same fictional world as Truman.The most praise I have to give this movie to is Andrew Niccol for giving us this unique and thought provoking script. He has wrote a script that will get people to think because The Truman Show is much more than what it looks like on a surface level. As you dig deeper into the many underlying themes of the movie, that's when you realise how profound it really is. The film's plot is very interpretive. Many viewers will come up with different theories trying to piece together the actual meaning of the movie. There are ideas relating to the way media manipulate people, God, reality shows, desires and much more.The Truman Show is an example of how great cinema can become. Weir and Niccol have done an exceptional job and I applaud their efforts. This is a movie that gets people thinking and highlights many relevant ideas in an entertaining and accessible way for everyone to enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Tru(man)ly remarkable!,"Have you ever thought you were being watched? Like you life was possibly a Television show? Well, Truman Burbank never did and this movie tells of how he found out his life was a TV show.Quite possibly one of the most imaginative plots ever, Peter Weir's The Truman Show shows how one man's vision (Ed Harris) of having someone's life be on TV (that being Truman played by Jim Carey)...without him knowing it. A totally real show that has no boundaries except the walls of the enormous set. With actors playing the roles of the townspeople in this perfect community, as it seems.Jim Carey is brilliant as the confused insurance salesman who just wants the truth about his life. The death of his ""father"" drowning at sea has given Truman a reason to stay in his town and not venture off. But the urge to see the woman of his dreams is all to much. She was moved to ""Fiji"" because of some problems. Laura Linney plays Truman's wife. She isn't only his wife but is a walking commercial. Whenever there is a product she brings home, it seems like she is telling the world how great it is. Noah Emmerich plays Truman's best friend Marlon. This always uplifting character brings comic relief for Truman when he needs it most. When Truman's world seems to be falling apart, he's there. When Truman just needs a friend, he's there. Marlon is the one part of his life that makes it seem so real when everything else seems so fake.What makes this movie so enjoyable other than the story is how the people act in this ""town"". The way they make sure Truman stays there and doesn't leave. How everybody has a routine and even the weather is controlled. In the opening scene Truman wakes up and heads off to work to have a stage light fall right in the street. Where it came from?...he doesn't know. But doesn't worry about it because life is going great...for now. Ed Harris's character Cristof a.k.a. the Creator is genius and maniacal. With his people working around the clock to make sure all is well, this world he has created is now a world wide phenomenon. He is on top of the world with millions of people watching his creation unfold.This sensational film about a man trying to find his way in the world is incredible. When everything seems like it doesn't add up, it just keeps getting more complicated and giving the viewer one hell of a good movie. The Truman Show is in a league of it's own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Oh, and in case I don't see ya","With its (all intentional of course) cheerfully colorful cinematography, cheesy music and one-dimensional supporting characters, it's easy to miss just how brilliant The Truman Show is; it's in fact one of the most important cinematic creations of the 1990's, at least as important as darker films like American History X and Fight Club, and one that works on several different levels. Because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the post-modern age, in the light of the reality TV syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow, it's also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankind.For Truman's story is man's story; and it's difficult not to see the importance in the names given to the lead characters. True Man's life, the film says, is an illusion, a lie. Or perhaps  all our lives are illusions, but the True Man is the one who figures it out and seeks a deeper truth. In its essence the point is very similar to the one The Matrix made; The Truman Show is a fascinating trip through Plato's Cave, and while it takes a rather simplistic look at Plato's philosophy  because any other way would be impossible in a film of less than two hours  it doesn't dumb it down. The Truman Show is a deep and intricate film that deserves repeated viewing and gets better with time, and can be discussed for hours.Writer Andrew Niccol  who made his breakthrough debut one year before with the critically acclaimed cult favorite Gattaca  lost the Oscar that year to the Academy's favorite Shakespeare In Love, and director Peter Weir got most of the credit for the film; but while it's certainly an important achievement for Weir and the best film of his long career, it's Niccol's sarcastic, intelligent, innovative script that made The Truman Show great; that, and the amazing performance by Jim Carrey, who showed his fantastic dramatic skills here for the first time. Carrey is enchanting in the lead role as the ultimate everyman Truman, and we're as fascinated with him as the show's fans in the film. Praise should also go to Ed Harris, who plays Christof, creator and director of The Truman Show (and again, special attention should be given to the character's name)  and also to Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natasha McElhone, Harry Shearer, Peter Krause, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the wonderful supporting cast, both in Truman's world of Seahavan and in Christof's 'real' world. Finally, a word of praise for the excellent musical score, composed by Burkhard von Dallwitz and the great Philip Glass, which compliments the film's atmosphere to perfection.The Truman Show is not an easy movie to absorb; it's a disturbing tale and a disturbing message, which takes some time to seep in, and while it's entirely unconvincing as a reality and even as sci-fi, and feels more like a metaphor than a story of a specific man, it's also entirely involving and demands to be taken at face value. Truman's character is irresistibly charming, and just like the people watching The Truman Show, we believe in him and identify with him completely. The beauty of The Truman Show is that it's lots of fun; it proves that entertainment and art are not necessarily opposing ideals. By being entirely entertaining and gripping, it gets its messages across a whole lot better.The Truman Show is now eight years old: the way I see it, once a decade has passed, a film can begins to be considered a classic. The Truman Show will pass that test. In any possible aspect, The Truman Show is one of the absolute best films of the 90's, and one that will remain relevant long after reality TV has bitten the dust.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Such an original idea, I only wish it was more developed.","The idea of living in a tv show, where your entire life is made up by a director, is overwhelming in itself. In the beginning of the movie, it really makes you think about life itself and it brought so many philosophical questions to my mind. Witnessing how the people he considered friends, and even his own wife didn't actually care about him was heartbreaking, as they were all just actors.
That being said I believe so much more could've been done because they had such a brilliant idea behind it. The ending really leaves you wondering and I just can't help but wish for more.

Jim Carrey is also perfectly cast as Truman, and he completely sold his character to me in a not-so-over-the-top comedic and also somewhat dramatic performance. The more I watched, the more addicted I became - like a soapie. This was the whole idea of the movie and it effectively came across as such.Ed Harris is also great in his role as the film's antagonist.

"Overrated, and only passably entertaining.","The Truman Show is easily one of the most overrated movies of the 1990s. While the premise is excellent, and a number of the supporting performers (especially Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich) do well in their roles, in any star-oriented film, the final judge of the movie's quality must be the star. Jim Carrey ultimately fails to deliver.  In yet another example of his unique, non-acting acting style, he manages to miss (or overshoot?) moments many other actors of lesser stature would hit dead on.  What could have been a very powerful movie dealing with the pressures of life and the changes of aging is ultimately reduced to a hollow, meaningless study of its star. Since the material does not allow Jim Carrey to do that at which he truly excels--outrageous physical comedy--he looks and feels very stiff and very miscast.  Watch the movie, if you can, for its interesting plot, sets, and supporting performances, but try to ignore Jim Carrey's non-performance.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
very good,"Have you ever felt like your not alone in you house. That maybe just maybe there's over half of the world watching you. The Truman Show is a film about a man called Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Who lives a normal life; with his normal job. But he is living in an abnormal world. Because Truman is living in his own world called sea heaven; sea heaven is actually a set and his home and job is all a lie. Truman has a world based around him and what ever he does the citizens of sea heaven have to go along with it. His Mum, Dad, Wife and even his best friend are all actors. The Truman show is filmed with the highest technology in cameras around. Small clip on cameras that can clip on to a jacket and not be seen. But when Truman sees that elevators have 4 men drinking tea in the back of them and that the radio has co-ordinates of his position on it he starts to get suspicious. The Truman Show has been nominated for three Oscars and has won three Baftas. Award winning director peter weir worked with paramount pictures to make this film a masterpiece. The Truman Show is a film that just about makes up for the horrible disasters of Godzilla and Armageddon, this film might be the film of the 90's.The Truman Show had a strict budget of $60 million and earned $125 million in film screenings alone. The Truman Show hasn't got any fancy graphics or any expensive cars or props its just pure film making and passion.Overall the Truman Show is a very good film, but my only criticism is that some of the background actors didn't look like they knew what they were doing.

Very engaging even for non Jim Carrey fans,"As many fans know, Jim Carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy. His comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. But anytime before 1998 I think I can safely say that not many people saw Carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasn't truly in the comedy genre. I definitely didn't see it coming. And to be honest, I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy it. But in the end, I did, not only because of how well Carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up.The plot is about Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who is viewed live 24 hours a day, uncensored, as a soap opera to the real world through public broadcasting. The thing is, Truman Burbank is the only one who doesn't know this. Everything else around is all a set-up. And when I mean everything,...everything...is a set-up. Even the sun is fake! Nothing is real. All the people Burbank knows are all actors. People who go through the same routine every day.And that's partially what makes this film so great. Every piece of the ""set"" that Truman Burbank lives in is so believable. Along with this is Christof, acted by Ed Harris. Christof is the creator of Truman's world and he essentially plays God. Everything that Truman Burbank is as a person, was created under the supervision of Christof. The whole story itself, written by Andrew Niccol, brings up the controversial issue of nature vs nurture. Who should have control over whose life. Well I think that answer is obvious.Jim Carrey himself actually does have some comedic moments but it's not because he wants the movie to be a comedy. Carrey does what he does because it is the connection to how a human would react to such a situation that makes it funny. And along with those funny moments comes a real emotional performance. Sure Carrey can deliver laughs but also proves that he can portray human drama. That's a question a lot of people wanted to see if Carrey could pull off and he did it well.Adding to the emotion is composer Philip Glass' score. Yes, it did evoke the right emotions and I don't think it needed a theme either for this particular story. Usually I do, but it didn't seem necessary here. Unfortunately for me, I prefer to see Jim Carrey in his comedic skin. I didn't mind the different role that he took on here but it didn't feel like I was watching the movie I wanted to see. And I'll admit, I put too much thought into believing Jim Carrey would've made the film more comedy than drama, so basically I disappointed myself. So on that note, it could be disappointing to fans of Carrey for his comedic films as well.As the first drama film that comic gut buster Jim Carrey stars in, it is not that bad as some would expect it to be. Carrey can deliver a performance like real human but for the hardcore fans, it may upset.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Among the most uniquely brilliant films ever,"The Truman show is unbelievably thought provoking on so many deep levels.

Too Many Missed Opportunities,"What would you do if you found out your wife was not your wife, your mother not your mother, your friends not your friends, and your dead father neither your father nor dead? This film was packed full of opportunities to explore the human and emotional issues behind these questions in a powerful and thought-provoking way, but aside from a couple of scenes, failed to do so.Jim Carrey stars as Truman Burbank, whose entire life (since before he was born) has been the subject of a television show. His world (unknown to him) is a huge studio, replete with oceans, artificial weather, etc. Everyone with whom he interacts is an actor hired to play a part. Carrey shows the ability to transcend the usual comedic roles he plays and displays dramatic talent, but either he or the writers (producers, etc.) seem to feel the need to keep falling back on his comedic talent (facial expressions, etc.) rather than allowing the drama of his journey of self-discovery to build. A glimpse of what might have been possible with this movie occurred in the scene where one almost thought he was about to kill the actress playing his wife as he crumbles psychologically with what he recognizes to be the inconsistencies of his life, but there are too few of these powerful moments.This was a good movie, but could have been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I didn't like it.,"The structure of the movie felt off to me. The first two-thirds of the film is from Truman's perspective, where we see him living in a wholesome, isolated town and starting to notice odd happenings around him. However, the premise was already revealed in every trailer, causing the film to drag as we wait for Truman to catch up to us.The big reveal finally happens two-thirds into the movie, but it feels anticlimactic. Truman has spent his entire life living in a gigantic artificial television studio where his life is broadcast around the clock to an audience. His life has been predetermined by TV producers, right down to who his wife and best friend are, all of whom are actors. Truman's entire reality is a farce that everyone is in on except him.The movie's premise is great, but it doesn't do enough with it. The film's final third finally becomes what I expected it to be: a satire of media consumption vs. Reality where the premise is explored more. However, it ends too quickly, and more could have been explored.Christof, the creator and executive producer of the show, is an eccentric visionary who has ruled over Truman's entire existence for a lifetime. He sees himself as a great figure who has created a utopia and wants to protect Truman from the outside world. Christof is a unique, more interesting character than Truman, the supposed protagonist. However, so much more could have been explored about him. Truman is not an interesting character, and Christof overshadows him. The story's climax is Truman choosing whether to stay in Christof's TV studio reality or walk out the exit door, but I've never been invested in this.Despite having some great ideas and social commentary, the movie suffers from all these issues, and it didn't quite work for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
And the point was . . .?,"What I liked about The Truman Show was the setting and the cinematography.  The production values are good, which sometimes impresses me more than it should.  At least in this case the resulting sense of realism is very satisfying.But the story seemed muddled and pointless, Truman goes through a random process of discovery, and then breaks free.  So what? Can it be possible that the message of this movie is that we watch too much TV? That many of us have trouble distinguishing entertainment from reality?  That everything in life is an illusion?  If it isn't one of these hoary platitudes, what is it?  Even when someone suggested that the movie is an updated version of the escape from the Garden of Eden, and so probably has something to do with loss of innocence, I still end up asking ""So what?""  There's a dorm-room earnestness about The Truman Show that left me cold.  You might love it.  It's definitely worth a try.The Truman Show may be like Citizen Kane, a movie that everyone knows is great but that hardly anyone asks for at the video rental store except extreme cineastes.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
camera lucida,"Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the most famous man in the world, and he doesn't even know it. Raised entirely 'within' a television show which comprises his entire world, Truman is an Everyman for the post-television age. Truman's world, ""Seahaven"", is an Eisenhower-era model of American bliss, recalling the prison-like Port Meirion and the moral certainty of Bedford Falls (Its a Wonderful Life). Surreptitiously filmed around the clock by 5000 hidden cameras, the show exists inside an enormous geodesic dome with simulated weather and even its own ocean. Through a series of production blunders Truman slowly realises that he is being controlled and that perhaps all in his world is not as it seems. His surrogate father by proxy, 'Christof' the producer/director, goes from being benevolent social scientist to evil genius as his attempts to frustrate Truman's wanderlust become more and more deadly. Will he escape?The film raises some interesting points about our fascination with life as seen through the magnifying lens of tv, and the morality of real lives viewed as so much entertainment. But like most soaps the scenes from ""The Truman Show"" that appear within the movie are variously dull, mawkish and sentimental. At points the film has a problem deciding on whether it is going to be a straight escape-chase movie or a philosophical piece about morality and technology. The t.v. show's inherent blandess also lends little to the pace or our sense that there are characters worth caring about.Carrey is good. This in itself is gratifying, and a tribute to a script that walks the tightrope of imitating bad t.v. in tandem with the metaphysical angst of Truman's unique situation. If it isn't quite the film it could have been, The Truman Show is still pretty much unique in the recent crop from our cultural overlords in Hollywood. No arthouse here, this is a watchable, big-budget think piece, with well-executed and stylish direction. Its too early to say but this film may have given some execs at NBC, ABC et al. one very bad idea...",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"original, funny, touching, compelling","Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives an ordinary life as an insurance man in an idyllic seaside town Seahaven. He would love to go to Fiji but he is trap on the island by a fear stemming from a childhood trauma. It turns out his whole life is manufactured by TV artist Christof (Ed Harris). The Truman Show is the most popular TV-series in the world. His wife Meryl is played by actress Hannah Gill (Laura Linney). His best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) along with everybody in the town as well as the town itself is completely fake. Even his childhood trauma was manufactured. Questionable things keep happening.

"The Truman Show — Exposing reality TV, and giving a sweet tale to make you think","The Truman Show is a tale that will tug at your heart strings. It's the movie that showed the world that Jim Carrey could play drama. His wild gesticulating or face distortion barely make an appearance compared to his previous incarnations.The film feels a little tacky, but it's dealing with a tacky subject: reality TV. It rode the wave of its inception as well as initial popularity and at the same time as it was making fun of it. Each character, but the main one, is a caricature of reality TV and its entourage, even its dissidents. It feels as fake as its subject, yet it brings important points.

Life eventually imitated art?,"I remember hearing the briefest of synopsis of 'The Truman Show' in a film magazine that was promoting the next year's upcoming movies. It just read, 'Jim Carrey discovers he's a character in a TV show.' I have to say that that description hardly blew me away as I didn't know what to make of it. Saying it like that makes it sound much more simple and goofy than it really is. I didn't go and see it when it was theatrically released, but after the positive word of mouth it generated, I felt I had to see it for myself.I can't really sum it up any better. Jim Carrey slowly discovers that the world around him is one giant TV set and he's the (unwitting) star, as cameras have been following his life ever since his birth. It was actually a pretty novel concept back in 1998. 'Big Brother' and various other reality TV shows had not yet taken over our airwaves, making this film quite ahead of its time.Carrey plays, 'Truman Burbank,' a happy-go-lucky fella who slowly starts to realise that there's something very wrong with the world and its inhabitants who exist all around him. From there, he slowly begins to unravel the plot for himself. It's all great fun and you really want to root for Truman to succeed in escaping this 'prison/goldfish bowl' he exists in. Jim Carrey is known for his 'larger than life' characters, but I'm pleased to say that he's dialed it down here and is much less manic than his other outings such as 'The Mask' or 'Ace Ventura.'Not just is it a quirky little drama, but it throws in many a dose of healthy social commentary of society and their obsession with television and the characters they spend their lives watching. However, I doubt that the film-makers ever realised how true to life this would all be with the amount of reality TV shows which were to follow it.Personally, I loved it and - despite it being a bit out of date now - I think it holds up perfectly as a warning of our obsession with TV. For what it's worth, I'll mention my friend's thoughts on it. He didn't like it because he thought it was all too far fetched. He felt that if the cameras had been following Truman since birth (approximately thirty years by the time we join him), that would mean the TV show started around 1968 and, back then, studios didn't have the technology to pull this off. I simply disregarded that as a nit-pick. This film is too good to look that deeply into and risk putting yourself off enjoying the ride.I guess I'll leave it up to its 'tagline' to say it best. 'On Air. Unaware.' Well done to the Marketing man who came up with that one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Truman the Show and Truman the Movie Worked,"""Truman"" was the first serious movie I'd ever seen from Jim Carrey--heck it may have been his first non-comedy period. This movie was stunning. What was so amazing was the fact that they let you in on the secret pretty early instead of leaving it as a twist. So instead of finding out at the end of the movie that it was all staged we find out relatively early which leaves us something else to look forward to: will he ever find out? And if he does, what will he do?Carrey was great as the simple small town happy character. He brought the character to life which made it all work. Truman couldn't be a skeptic, he couldn't be a big dreamer, he couldn't even be a roamer; he had to be the exact type of character he was for it all to work. Truman, the fictitious show worked and ""Truman"" the movie worked.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Interesting Concept, but Boring","One of the rare roles where Jim Carrey is a ""normal"" guy, he's not goofy or over the top. It's interesting to see him act this way, but frankly it comes off a little on the boring side.The overall concept of the movie is interesting, because its far outside of the box of a normal movie. A man being watched 24/7 on tv, while he lives in a fake world unknowingly. The movie could have taken that plot and made it darker or a lot more funny, instead it was given an even balance which came off slightly boring. I think the real question would be, why would anyone want to sit down and watch this guys life on television. He has such a ""normal"" boring life. Every day he does the same thing, he never fights with the wife, he's always happy, and he sells insurance at a desk. If you were going to make a tv show, you'd think you'd want to spice up the issues to make it interesting. Or perhaps in today's society, 2022, we have become so used to tv shows that have extreme drama, that it's hard to watch the normal.Not a bad show, good acting, some funny stuff, but could have been more extreme.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

this makes big brother look like child s play,"I sometimes wonder how my life will be if it were a TV show, I see this movie and i quit the wonder.The Truman Show was written by Andrew Niccol who got the inspiration from an episode of The Twilight Zone called ""Special Service"".After the script had gone through some re-writes, Jim Carrey was picked for the role, although the makers had to wait for him to have a clear schedule before he could start shooting.Made with a budget of over $ 60 million dollars, The Truman Show was a financial success and also was nominated for three categories in the Academy Awards, but did not win any awards.The movie tells the tale of an Insurance salesman Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who lived his entire life, since before birth, in front of cameras for The Truman Show.Unaware of this fact, Truman's life is filmed through thousands of hidden cameras, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and broadcast live around the world, allowing executive producer Christof (Ed Harris) to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior when put in certain situations that are concocted by the writers.The thrill about Truman's life is that everything is arranged for him, down to the woman he married to his best friend.The movie cinematography is such a way that you get to see mistakes from the show makers and how they arrange things in the back end to make Truman do some particular things.The script and the movie lines are fun, especially when the Actors had to advertise on the show. The could be a conversation going on then one of the actors will just drift to talk about an object in such a manner you wonder if they have lost it, only for you to figure out seconds later that it was an advert in the show, that was very creative.Before making this masterpiece, Jim Carrey had just finish Cable Guy (1996) and Liar Liar (1997).The movie is directed by Peter Weir (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)), who did a great job pulling the viewers along as they watch a movie of a show.

"Peter Weir, Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, wow wasn't I in for a treat?","After being blown away by Fearless, I set out to see more of Peter Weir's work. Along the way I came across The Truman Show. After watching the film, I have nothing but praise for this film. The Truman Show is a truly dazzling and sophisticated satirical comedy drama on media omnipotence that benefits from fine direction and performances. Beautifully scripted by Andrew Niccol and flawlessly directed by Weir, the film is utterly captivating from the start right through to the truly poignant finale. Here Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the star of the world's most popular reality show. The catch is he doesn't know that. Truman believes he lives in Seahaven an island community that is somewhat idyllic, but in reality it is just a set housed in a studio with his friends and family as actors. This realisation and how it comes across is ambitious admittedly, then again I find Weir a fairly ambitious director, but it comes across as brilliant. Aside from the directing, concept and script, the acting really does soar here. Having loved his performances in Liar Liar and The Mask, I was looking forward to seeing Jim Carrey in a more dramatic role, and his restrained performance while funny in parts(in a subtle way in alternative to hysterical) is very sympathetic and moving. Ed Harris is great as Christoff and Laura Linney is outstanding as Meryl. Overall, brilliant film, it is funny but poignant too. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A true man shows,"This is among Pete Weir's best ,just a notch or two under ""fearless"" or ""witness"" and much more worthwhile than weepies like ""dead poets society"".Jim Carrey is ,relatively speaking,sparing of gestures and ,hem!grimaces.However,in my humble opinion ,the best performance comes from Laura Linney,who's very funny,delivering lines as she would do commercials,and always with that suave smile on her face:she really acts as if she's in a play,and she 's anyway, as Paul Mac Cartney sang in ""Penny Lane"".Ed Harris is effective as a sort of God (TV has replaced God in many a home,like it or not),his spectacles and his bonnet make him almost unrecognizable.The humanism displayed by Weir is very close to that of Frank Capra,and Jim Carrey is some kind of James Stewart of the nineties,naïve,with a big heart.And like Colombus (his boat isn't it called ""Santa Maria""?),he has discovered a brand new world.Whether it's the best one remains to be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amusingly subtle comedy that parodies TV shows.,"The Truman Show is one of Jim Carrey's most successful comedy films along with Dumb And Dumber, The Mask, Ace Ventura and Liar Liar, however this movie is the most well received by the film critics and earning an 8.1/10 on IMDb and a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes (as well as a 90 on Metascore but nobody gives a damn about Metascore). So it's no wonder that some people are still thinking about watching the movie and reading reviews, and one of those people used to be me once, and I'm surprised you're reading my reviews out of all the ones. I'm glad you're reading this, and I'll try to give you the best effort for a review possible so you can see whether you'd like this movie or not.The Truman Show can be interpreted as a basic comedy movie to pass time by some but it can also be interpreted as a misunderstood masterpiece because of the specializing in cinematography, subtlety and wittiness in the subject of TV shows. In reality TV shows, people like Truman live in them for basically the entirety of their lives and the only difference is that they are fully aware that they have been living in one while Truman is completely unaware. However, Truman begins to gain suspicion after strange events happen and he begins to suspect things while we, as the viewer, are completely aware that the strange events are because of the fact that he is in a TV show. As usual, Jim Carrey brings his humorous characteristics as he reacts to these strange situations such as product placement, coincidental happenings and bad luck and we, as the viewer, are amused when we watch him in these situations because we know he is in a TV show. While these situations are funny they are actually very thought-provoking and they may question your life itself and how the process of Reality TV Shows work and whether or not the actors in Coronation Street are like Truman - except that they are self-aware of it being a TV Show. We then watch these TV Shows with heaps of effort and we enjoy them, however are we really to care of the impact of TV Shows? After an episode we just flick it onto another channel until dinner is ready.Still not sure whether you will like this or not? Well, if you are a big fan of Jim Carrey's outrageous but intelligent humour then I think you will enjoy this movie. While this is a lot more subtle and thought-provoking in terms of humour than Jim Carrey's previous comedies, it still sticks to the humour we know and love from Jim Carrey however on a lower volume than it is usually played. If you are a fan of thought-provoking, cynical satires then I think you will enjoy this film as well. If you are a fan of good cinematography techniques then I think you'll enjoy analyzing this film. If you simply want to watch a good film then watch this. If you are not a fan of Jim Carrey, satire, cinematography or good films then this film is not for you. Simply put, this film is a comedic masterpiece that may be to some tastes and below others depending on the type of films you usually take interest in, but for me it was a delightful treat that just whizzed past my expectations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

It's one of those things that SAYS it's going to do something.  It tells us what it intends to show, then proceeds to NOT show us, but to restate the thesis!  And the audience is expected to buy into the notion that the film has actually explored the issues... whatever they are.Truman, for me, is all statement and no delivery.  It gives us a wonderfully correct theme...a charming, easy to root-for hero...a potentially exciting and interestingly equivocal villain...then blows it all away because it hasn't got the courage of it's own set-up.What WOULD make Truman, despite a lifetime of conditioning, get on that boat?  NOTHING!!  He so easily accepts the unacceptable, he so easily overcomes every problem the film gives him, that there is no dramatic tension, no questions, no...no film!Of course, it presents us with a user-friendly, feel-good ending.

Too facile...like Jim Carrey's talking butt...an easy laugh, a go-for-the-guaranteed-result.

Black Comedy,"""The Truman Show"" is about as depressing as anything I know.  It is about a society that is so jaded that the interactions in their lives are wholly inadequate--they prefer a fictionalized world to their own.  What is really sad is that this began in the fifties with ""Father Knows Best"" and ""Leave It to Beaver"" and exists now in the tiresome parade of sitcoms with their vacuous double entendres and empty lives marching across the screen. Whose wholesomeness, whose sexual manifestations are these?  With children gunning each other down in schools--desensitized to common respect (and I'm not just talking violence but respect for anything) to mindless, thoughtless pursuits of gratification.  We are the idiots watching ""The Truman Show.""  The greatest tragedy is that what might be looked at as outrageous is actually occurring every day--we just haven't put artificial walls around our little town.Jim Carrey is quite good--he can shine those pearly whites at the camera with the best.  But couldn't it have been anyone?  His efforts to free himself are not of significant because it can all be rewritten anyway.

As Amazing & Magical As Can Be.,"The Truman Show is original and provocative movie that has a place in all our hearts. Jim Carrey breaks his typecast funny man role and becomes a more serious character. Of course there are cute and funny moments, but it is just his kindness and casualness that gets the audience cracking up. It is not meant to be funny, just nice to see. So nice, the audience can't help but smile. The storyline itself is original and suspenseful. It is not meant to be a thriller, it just happens to be exciting.This was before the days of reality TV. Nowadays, almost everything is reality TV. Everybody in reality shows know they're being filmed, but what if they did not? What if literally everything somebody did was being broadcasted to the world 24/7? That is just what The Truman Show is about. Jim Carrey plays Truman who has had a camera on him since birth. He lives on the island he grew upon which is completely fake. Ever since he was a kid, they have tried everything they can to keep him on that island, even going so far as having his father drown to discourage him from ever sailing off. Actors play his friends, sand is fake and everything on the island is controlled. It is amazing to see all of this, and freaky how possible it all is too. The filming of Truman's every move may seem boring, but the world loves it all, as the title character is oblivious and goes about his life as an average joe. After all, Truman just works at a bank like thousands of others. Sympathy grows towards Truman, but his life is so full of joy.Truman is in his thirties and has had a camera on him in his fake world all his life. After a while, would there not be malfunctions or mistakes? It all starts when he sees his father being taken away on a bus. There have been subtle clues his whole life, but nothing he really gave a second look at.

One Of Jim's Best,"This movie is done brilliantly. You feel for Truman, since you as an outsider are looking in on his life. You want him to figure out the truth of what he is really doing and what he is really a part of. The concept of having someone live their whole life in a TV show and not know it really isn't as far-fetched as it seems. Truman has a few psychological problems, but with cameras everywhere the network would know if someone was trying to get him to realize the truth. This movie is one of Carrey's best and it is shot brilliantly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A truly beautiful movie,"I saw this movie tonight and it made me feel like I was touched by the God of movies himself. It was one of those moments when you just hit the perfect movie, with the perfect cast and a perfect story.This is, truly a beautiful, uplifting piece of cinematography. The props, the costumes, everything was equisite to the last detail. But most of all the story itself. What a beautiful idea? Truman Burbank, an office worker is the centre of The Truman Show, which is a TV reality show where he (unconsciously) stars in the main role. Doesn't that sound intriguing?

A True Masterpiece,"The Truman Show is disturbing, insightful, very deep and a masterpiece. This movie is thought provoking making you challenge the way you see the world today, it's social norms, what we have been told to believe for so many years. It's about waking up from both a psychological and a spiritual standpointTruman is a man who throughout his entire life and most of this movie had no idea from the moment of conception to still when he's a fully grown adult and married had has whole life turned into a 24 Hour TV show for the world's amusement and trapped within a fictional world with the same old peopleHowever little by little, Truman comes to realize everything is not as it seems and begins to realize the world he is living in which is a giant life size studio, his wife, his family and his best friend isn't all what it appears to be. He essentially realizes he's living in a fantasy world and goes on a quest to free himself from this invisibleThis movie plays on not just waking up and challenging everything around us, it shows Dystopian levels that our world is getting much closer and closer too - mass surveillance in the form of facial recognition technology that's trying to be implemented in all retail stores as a way to buy goods instead with our credit cards. It's a form of tracking and monitoring. If you do and say the wrong thing as people in Truman's life that actually were reaching out to tell him he's living a lie are quickly taken off and put back into the real world and the overbearing of an authoritarian Governments looking to control and watch every aspect of our livesIn the movie's case the studio lead by ' The Truman Show's' director - Christof, who controls every aspect of the show, the people around Truman who follow Christof's rules and not actually helping Truman and the show itself. Notice his name - Christof = CHRISTof. They used Jesus's name for this character to appear as omnipotent or thinking he's Jesus himselfSeriously! A kid like Truman who from even before he was born was given to a production company to have his entire life filmed on camera for the world to enjoy 24 hours a day within a studio is just disturbing and a reality show on a whole different levelThe ending to this film is just perfect, it really is. Not only does Truman finally break free from his prison to enter the real world for the first time, it cuts to black. We as the viewers wanted to see what would happen next but when you think about it. We are as much to blame as the audiences shown in this movie watching Truman still wanting his life to be exposed.An absolute masterpiece with so much hidden meanings and depth, You could even consider this to be a horror movie because this is literally life imitating art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Intriguing premise but overrated,"The Truman Show has an intriguing premise - a reality TV show whose star is oblivious of the proceedings, believing it to be real life.Jim Carrey turns in a strong performance as a man who ultimately realises that his whole life has been a sham. His growing awareness that all is not well is effectively essayed, and a long way from his previous OTT comic roles.There are effective moments - the jarring product placements for the benefit of viewers, the reappearance of the father that Truman believed drowned as a child - but once the premise is established it all becomes rather predictable, and the satire rapidly tails off.For a much more effective (and more prescient) satire on TV, I'd recommend ""The Year of the Sex Olympics"". Ignoring its low budget and certain dated aspects of its production, it is far more thought-provoking.In the final analysis, ""The Truman Show"" would have worked better as an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" and without the needless chase and escape scene at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Timeless classic,"Everyone at some point in their lives has been bothered by the notion that their surroundings are all an elaborate prank, that somehow every single human being but them is in on some giant impossible joke, watching their every move for strange and unthinkable purposes. What if my life isn't real? What if all my friends and family members aren't who they say they are, and I'm just part of some ungodly social experiment? What if my life as I've known it just isn't.. real? For Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) these concerns are very pressing, as he discovers throughout one of the most thoughtful, touching, creative and insightful films ever made. Director Peter Weir works with a script by Andrew Niccol to bring us this now timeless tale of a man existing in a patented pastel world that was never his own and always destined for him. Truman is the unwitting star of his own television show, inducted into its gargantuan studio set since the day of his birth, and conditioned to believe all his life that the people, places and events around him are in fact his real life. Cruel? Perhaps, but the film never takes sides, instead favoring wonder over analytical dissection, a wise move. Even the conductor of this whole absurd symphony, a prolific filmmaker played by Ed Harris, gets his moment of sympathy which can be read as preening ego or the desire to connect with his leading actor beyond the pixelated jumbo- tron he sits behind, depending on how you view the situation. Truman has a lovely wife (Laura Linney), a salt of the earth best friend (Noah Emmerich) and the perfect little white picket fence life. But none of it is real, or at least organic in the sense that every person deserves out of the womb. Truman is a rat in a very elaborate maze, but like anyone who's had the wool pulled over their eyes, eventually he begins to see lights of authenticity piercing the seams. Gradually he begins to sniff out the ruse, like a child losing their innocence, and questions the eerily idyllic life he has been given. The people, or rather, actors in his life react in different ways. Some panic, others stick to the script, and Harris sorrowfully watches his controversial creation awaken beyond his control. Carrey is a starry eyed revelation as Truman, in one of the most overlooked performances of the century. His arc is the stuff of dreams, spanning the lengths of naivete trapped in a bubble that bursts into affecting, starry eyed realization and wonder. Every moment is owned by him, every beat is resoundingly hit in flawless fashion. When a mysterious and beautiful defector (the luminous Natasha Mcelhone) enters his life to play the part of whistle-blower, it's the first genuine and non-puppeteered interaction he's had with a human being. Sparks fly high enough to reach the heavens, and it's the catalyst for a journey to find the self, the reason for his predicament, a world beyond the Lego brick suburbia he has known and the next step in his impossibly unique life. There's a piece of Truman embedded in every viewer beholding, and I believe that's why the film has held up for so long, and been beloved by so many. Every human being has insecurities as large as the fake sound stage that raised him from a pup. Every one of us has at one point felt the alienation he must have gone through upon realizing the truth. In a story so larger than life, we find the answers, or at least a modicum of such, to what it means being a person in this world. Carrey's Truman is an achingly relatable avatar of this and a direct conduit into the essential. Couldn't have picked a better actor to bring all of this to life. Couldn't have made a better film about it. A classic. Good morning, and in case I don't see you: good afternoon, good evening and goodnight.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A social fantasy story,"The Truman Show is a perfect example of how much money a ""high concept"" movie can make. It's also a textbook case of how shallow a high concept movie can be if you don't find the right structure to express the inherent themes. That this movie is being heralded as the most original of summer '98 says more about the sad state of creativity in mainstream Hollywood and the need to sell magazines than it does about the quality of this film.Most screenwriters know that high concept is essential for a script to succeed in mainstream movies. What most don't know is that high concept only gives you two or three fun scenes. Then you have to know how to develop the high concept through opposition and theme to get two hours of great writing.The Truman Show is a story of a man who discovers that his entire life is a television show. This puts us in the realm of social fantasy, an advanced form of fiction that allows the writer to compare social worlds. Fantasy always involves two tracks, the fantasy world and the real world it is commenting upon. Without the real world reference, the fantasy story is clinically interesting, as an act of creativity, but never compelling.When you look at the structure the writer chose for The Truman Show, you see immediately why this movie was doomed to blow most of its immense potential. Instead of starting in the mundane world then going to the fantasy world - as most great fantasies do - the writer chose to have the hero - and the audience - slowly discover that he is living in a fantasy world. That makes the hero a kind of detective solving the mystery of his own life.This choice appears, at first glance, to be a good one. Audiences love a mystery because mysteries give us a clean desire line and a lot of reveals. And a detective story where a man solves the mystery of his own life is a brilliant premise.Problem/Need: But the reality here is much different. The so-called ""coming-to-awareness"" structure causes you to start your hero as a clean slate. He's quite happy with his life before things fall apart. But this means you cannot detail your hero's Need, whether psychological or moral, up front. Since need is the wellspring of any good story, and the source of the self-revelation, this is a serious loss. Truman is portrayed from the beginning as little more than an impossibly cheerful optimist.Desire: The detective structure, in this case, also gives the hero the lowest of all possible Desire lines: to escape. By ending the film with the moment he breaks out of his trap, the author guarantees that this low desire will structure the entire story. And that has a devastating effect on plot. Instead of giving us lots of great reveals, we have only one, repeated time and again: ""I am caught in a fictional world."" Opponent: Using the detective structure also diminishes the Opponent. In the Detective Class I talk about the negative effects of hiding the opposition. The most serious drawback is that we have no opportunity to contrast the values of the hero and opponent until the end, when it is too late for detailing and texture. In The Truman Show, the director is nothing but an omniscient presence until the end of the film when he spouts a few platitudes about Truman being the star of his own world.Since the opponent in a social fantasy also stands for a larger alternative world, the detective structure makes it impossible to have a deeper comparison between this safe, fictional world and the freer, real world outside.A look at the premiere American social fantasy on film, It's A Wonderful Life, shows how important the right structure is to making the larger themes pay off. It's A Wonderful Life uses an elaborate storytelling structure in order to give us the centerpiece of the film, which is an immediate and highly detailed juxtaposition of the same town under two different sets of values. The Truman Show gives us only one version of the world for the full two hours.Battle, Self-Revelation: No wonder, then, that the Battle and Self-Revelation are anticlimactic and stale. Truman gets smashed in the boat by an all- powerful director and has a simple self-revelation - ""I'd rather be free"" - that was a foregone conclusion from the first reveal.Social fantasy is among the most challenging and satisfying of all story forms, especially in film. But it requires a mastery of craft and theme to fulfill its massive potential. Finding a great high concept premise is the single most important factor in successful Hollywood screen writing. And it certainly made everyone associated with this film a lot of money. But it is not enough for great writing.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I'm watching you!,"I have definitely imagined that my life was being filmed before and I'm still not convinced that it's not true. There's no way the things that have happened to me aren't scripted or haven't been constructed by some evil director. I'd love to chat to the viewers of my life and find out what they think of my one liners and throw away jokes, because, let's face it, I'm fricking hilarious.But for poor Truman it is definitely not a fantasy. He has been filmed since his days in the womb in the style of 'Big Brother' and he's only just started to suspect that life's not what he thinks it is.The film is very cleverly made, with great use of angles and filters to give the impression of various cameras and the use of Truman's audience to give balance with the real world helps to bring the show to life too. The product placement advertising also makes me laugh.It's probably my favourite Carrey film, as I'm not usually a fan of his and although he only has a relatively small part, Ed Harris gives a great performance too.Can you imagine if they tried to do this today for real?

The Truman Show is one of the best films of Jim Carrey's career,"The Truman Show is one of the best films of Jim Carrey's career. One of the best movie dramas of the 90s.

The script of the film ignores many details that even the most unbiased viewer pays attention to. But this is not done, the message of The Truman Show in another. There is a vivid reflection of modern society in this hypertrophied toy world. The work of Christophe's team reflects the state.

One of the most earth shattering films ever made!,"""The Truman Show"" is an absolutely amazing film that transcends beyond the boundaries of conventional moviemaking and storytelling.  I remember coming out of the theater the night I saw it not knowing how to feel.  Should I laugh?  Should I cry?  Be happy or sad?  It was unbelievable!  The idea of a man's whole life being televised and scripted is certainly an original and creative one, and on the whole, an upsetting one.  It's hard for me to watch Truman Burbank, brilliantly played by Jim Carrey, suffer and be so blatantly deceived and lied to by those he crosses and even lives with.  He doesn't know that his whole life wasn't under his control, until things in the show don't quite go as planned.  A piece of equipment from the set falls from the sky, Truman bumps into his dead father who wandered into the set, and he learns his wife actually hates him.  What really upset me about the film was having to watch all those actors and actresses lie, betray, and deceive Truman.  Worse yet, the fans of the show are cold hearted and cruel enough to keep watching, even at the peak of Truman's suffering.  Of course, that's what people do with movies and TV, watch people go through their trials and tribulations, pains and sufferings.  The only difference here is that the star of the show isn't pretending.  Luckily, he takes action and initiates an escape, while the shows creator battles to keep him on the set.  Finally, in a devastating scene, Truman comes to terms with reality, that he never had a life.  Thankfully, it was redeemed when he proudly walked out of the set and ventured out into the world.  What you may not know is that ""The Truman Show"" is actually a film about God.  The creator's name is Christof, related to Christ, and he orchestrates every day of Truman's life.  ""Don't worry about tomorrow, because God has already taken care of it for you."" Also, I didn't think Christof was playing God.  I thought it a satirical way, he really was God.  He was the creator of a show that ""gave hope, joy, and inspiration to millions"", as did God with the world and his son Jesus. His wrath and anger was inflicted upon Truman when he tried to leave the set, or the Garden of Eden, and learn the truth about his life, thus receiving the fruit of knowledge.  Christof throws a violent, Biblical storm at Truman, and after Truman survives the storm, he screams out ""Is that the best you can do?"", on his sailboat the Santa Maria, or the Holy Mary.  The ultimate is the ending, where Truman appears to be walking on water towards the stairway to Heaven, not knowing if he is dead or alive or if it's reality or nightmare.  Christof speaks to Truman through the clouds in a deep, God-like voice, telling him that he has been watching him his whole life.  Another aspect of Christof's God-like qualities is that he isn't actually evil, and all he wants is to do what he thinks is best for Truman. ""In my world, you have nothing to fear.""  A couple of times in the film, Christof pets Truman on the TV screen, a sign of gentleness and love. Finally, Truman gracefully bows before God and walks out of the set, and into the unknown world, thus Adam and Eve leaving the Garden of Eden and venturing out into the real world.  The whole awesome power of the climax brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion.  It's the first time in my life that a film could have such a strong, inspirational impact on me. It really shook me up!  I was deeply upset that this film got a disappointing 2 Academy Award nomination, neither of which won.  Jim Carrey wasn't nominated, although looking back on his career as the rubberfaced maniac who talked out of his ass in Ace Ventura, it's amazing that he was even involved in such an earth shattering film, let alone play the main character.  But he did it.  He gave Truman a likeable, intelligent, curious, and sad quality.  I remember seeing the trailer for the first time in theaters and thinking, ""Oh boy.  Another Jim Carrey comedy.""  How wrong I was!  This film was a serious, provocative, and inspirational one that put away all the laughter with the exception of the man in the bath tub.  I remember desperately trying not to cry at the climax, watching Truman bang on the wall of the set, learning in a painful instant, the reality of his life.  What would have been really sad is if he never escaped, although an ending like that would be pointless, because the message and the meaning would be lost.  Hopefully, the AFI(American Film Institute) will put this on their list as one of the best films ever made, which I strongly would stand up for and believe it to be true in every sense of the word!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not That Original Or Groundbreaking,"Let's not delude ourselves that THE TRUMAN SHOW is all that iconoclastic , prophetic or mind blowing original . In the late 1960s Nigel Kneale wrote a BBC teleplay called THE YEAR OF THE SEX OLYMPICS where very similar ideas are explored so the central plot of a man having his whole life manipulated and broadcast to billions of watching people isn't all that clever if you're familiar with the works of Nigel KnealeI have to confess that while this movie was released in 1998 a couple of years before reality TV saturated the airwaves of western television i had never seen it until a couple of days ago which means my view of this movie especially its plot is prejudiced by a force fed television diet of ordinary people going about their lives so the idea that billions of people watching a man selling insurance comes across as totally ridiculous to me . We've seen BIG BROTHER become a parody of itself ( And has been parodied in the recent series of DOCTOR WHO ) while other similar shows have suffered from slipping ratings and critical backlash . So it seems ridiculous that billions of people across the globe are compelled to watch a mundane real life show for thirty yearsNot to be totally negative what the producers have done with THE TRUMAN SHOW is structure it correctly where it's revealed from the outset that Truman Burbank is unwittingly living inside a massive TV studio . If the story had been constructed as a M Night Shymalan type mystery where it's revealed to the audience at the end that it's all a television show this would have been a disaster , can you imagine the word of mouth giving away the ending ? Without hammering it home there is a logic to the motives of producing a show like this - Product placement , and Jim Carrey gives a restrained performance and makes Truman a sympathetic character .

Truman Show Is A Pretty Great Satire,The Truman show was a wonderful movie. At first you're happy with Truman and his life being a TV show star but soon after you realize Truman's whole life is a lie and you become overwhelmed with the hope that Truman will soon see past his false life and realize what is really out there beyond this fake TV show life. You also realize how bad it is that they are allowed to adopt Truman when he's born and make his life a TV show. This will most likely infuriate you as you realize what there doing here is completely wrong and shouldn't have ever happened. Then you have to consider what I believe to be is a satirical piece in this movie. I believe the satire part show how the government is in control of all of us and we are all Truman. Only by questioning what is right and what is wrong will we actually find the truth. The director is like the government. They want us to to stay in what they think is a nice place to shelter us from the real world. Even if we want to escape they will try to keep us in here for what they claim is our good.

Cinemetaphysical!,"You may not like it, but you have to respect it.Brilliant, thoughtful director Peter Weir (The Last Wave AKA Black Rain, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Master and Commander, Gallipoli, Dead Poets Society, Fearless and many others) teams up with excellent screenwriter Andrew Niccol and a great cast to give us a science fiction film with a range of emotions exceedingly rare for big budget mainstream cinema. In addition to the really disturbing questions the film raises about the nature of reality, metaphysics, religion, entertainment, human cruelty, voyeurism, and the concept of freedom, the film also offers a glimpse of humanity simultaneously occupying its worst and best aspects.The cast is phenomenally good. Carrey gives Truman the life his rich and sympathetic character he deserves - providing some of the most disturbing comedy I have ever witnessed. Tasha McElhone, Ed Harris, Peter Krause and Laura Linney are all excellent - though you may end up hating most of them for various reasons as the film progresses.Truman's entire life, from his birth onward has been one long TV show. He is literally being broadcast 24/7/365 and he knows nothing of it. His mom, wife, best friend, and everybody around him are all cast members. And the show is shot in a giant set which simulates an island. Because of a traumatic experience with the sea during his childhood, Truman does not feel free to travel away from his island home.Yet Truman is oddly compelled to explore the world and has begun to suspect that something is very wrong. Meanwhile, in what we like to think of as the REAL WORLD, everybody is watching him. People stay home from work to participate vicariously in his life in hopes that they will somehow catch a clue to ""how it will end.""This film is pretty heavy. You might find it amusing the first time you watch it, but once you've allowed it to exhaust you a few times, all that is left is the superb craft and the intense and disturbing ideas it constantly bombards you with. The film has a dark side and a hopeful, light (but never airy) side which - amazingly - is exposed concurrently with the heavy stuff.The cinematography is as picture-perfect as most of the work Weir is associated with. The acting is remarkably good all around, with those mentioned above in the outstanding roles. Sound is usually a very important component of Weir's films, but it's a little underexploited in the Truman Show - perhaps to (sometimes with painful force) draw the audience's attention to the profoundly insane dialog.The Truman Show is plot heavy, heavy, a little funny, and profoundly smart.

"Thoroughly annoying, vacuous and simplistic","I feel gutted after fast forwarding this heap of embarrassment. I have rarely seen a movie so devoid of entertainment value, intelligence or plot. A guy in a virtual world finds out he's not in the real world, sails off to find the edge of the studio, finds it, has a sappy talk with God, -The End-. In between: Highly annoying people smiling smiles as seen in 1950s commercials and a script from Airplane III which never made it to the big screen for perfectly healthy reasons.Why wasn't there any subplot, some deeper meaning, some...Oh I don't know, ANYTHING! If they tried to have any, it surely was smashed during the employment of the 3 megaton thermal nuclear device that was used on the silver lining. The entire story was so laughably straighforward, even primates would find it insulting. I'm truly sorry, but this movie's glaring emptiness and it's pitiful acclaim completely beggars belief and really challenges my mental sanity when thinking about it.0/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Carrey's first serious role,"This is the first movie I saw where Jim Carrey plays it pretty straight laced and goes more dramatic. This movie is about the ultimate Big Brother television show. Truman Burbank is adopted by a network and his life is on full display 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all without his knowledge. He lives in a giant dome that recreates an island town. To prevent him wanting to leave, as a small child they instill a deep, fierce fear of the water. Every resident of the town is an actor, some of them having been there for the majority of their lives. Every interaction of his life is scripted as best they can, until one day Truman gets an inclination that not is all as it seems. While Truman struggles to find the truth, the world watches on.
While I have enjoyed watching this movie many a time, it does have one flaw, to me.Laura Linney, an actor that I have in all her other roles, seems miscast to me in the part of Truman's forced happy wife. Laura typically plays such a strong female lead that perhaps it was just her having to play an actress cowed into catering to Truman, a person she clearly dislikes, was what I did not like about her here. Were it not for this small flaw I would have given this 10 stars. This is a great look at mass consumption of media and the ultimate greed that is at the core of the human species.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
really doesn't have much to do with reality shows,"Some IMDB reviewers of the Truman Show has suggested that this is a satire of reality shows.I disagree. It is much more a satire directed to Hollywood pretentiousness and egos.More importantly, it is mainly concerned with how we are programmed to accept societal perspectives and ideas without question.These are forced upon us, and they form a wall around our reality.  Breaking through that wall is what the Truman Show is all about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I freaked out for three hours after I saw this incredible film,"I stopped watching tv for two weeks after I saw The Truman Show, and now I try not to watch anything other than the news or movies.

One of the best films of the year,"The Truman Show is a dark drama that is well done by director Peter Weir, writer Andrew Niccol and star Jim Carrey as the dramatic lead.  I truly believe Carrey should have gooten the Oscar.  His performance as Truman Burbank, the simple yet always wathced (for many years) on television by millions of viewers, person should have got him the Oscar for best actor. He doesn't portray the usual goofy comic guy, but this time a simple man who is in the media crossfire, and he doesn't even know it.  It's like putting a guy who thinks everything is normal in a wrestling ring full of actors who improvise.  Well done dramatic composition that looks at how sick we have become.

Ingredients for a classic but something is missing..,"It is safe to say that ""The Truman Show"" was ahead of its time and deals with topics that are currently more relevant than ever before. The success of reality television has defined much of the entertainment world in the 2000s and blurred the line between public and private. Moreover, social media is all about building fasads, living in a fake reality and striving for fake happiness. Nowadays smartphones monitor our everyday life and collect data for the algorithms run by big tech corporations. They certainly know how to keep us entertained and in our own bubbles.One of the main ideas of the movie is summed up in Shakespeare's famous quote ""All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players."" After watching the movie one can not help but think how the world we live in and the everyday activities we perform truly differ from the ones of Truman. It is also easy to find traces of Plato's Allegory of the Cave and the philosophical discussion of our world being the best of all possible worlds.It is an interesting thought that if everything would be handed to you in life just as scripted would it be possible to be happy. In the movie the best of all possible worlds built for Truman resembles the middle class dream whereas the outside world might be more meaningful but filled with uncertainty and struggle.Despite the interesting ingredients something is missing to make the film an all-time classic. The treatment of the main themes is light, the resolution comes quite easily and the movie does not dig very deep into the psyche of Truman. Unfortunately, I am not sure either that Jim Carrey is a perfect cast for the role of Truman. Even so, I would recommend watching the movie. It is just that after being originally amazed by the idea of the movie it does not generate many new thoughts that would stick and grow over time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
As Good As It Gets,"Everyone comments on how well Jim Carrey performs in the movie, but they are right on.  I never liked any of his slapstick comedies, except his sketches on In Living Color, but I wanted to see this film because it seemed to be similar to the themes in 1984, by George Orwell. It does have that Orwellian style but it does do one thing that 1984 didn't...left the audience with hope.  I would proclaim this to be a great American film that ranks up there with The Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather, and Citizen Kane.  10/10, 5 stars, A +.

Immediate thoughts,"My favorite part is actually the uncanny advertisement delivered by Meryl during her conflict with Truman, very ironic... the ending is a bit less intricate but also thoughtful. Not intricate enough because I think the portrayal of Truman's escape as his grand success simply omits the fact that he will never obtain the ""real"" life he desires given his global popularity.

If we don't then we are not getting it's point and we are lacking.  Jim Carrey does do a good job. However, Ed Harris' character is ridiculous, He's just not believable. The main reason this movie fails is the storyline is ridiculous; it's just to far fetched. Society isn't so cruel that we would allow let alone watch a show like Truman. Celebrity Boxing and Survivor Sure. But the premise for The Truman Show is Cruel the main character is not a voluntary participant. Basically he's Innocent and being violated and we are supposed to think everyone thinks it's ok.The Truman Show wants to be taken seriously and thats not possible with this weak, far-fetched story.

"Great! A social experiment, not very moral. It's amazing!","Even being released in 1998, the film ends up being even more current with time, as this type of ""entertainment"" is even more profitable and famous today. The film still addresses Plato's Myth of the Cave in a never-before-seen way, the same addressed in films such as The Matrix, Fang Tooth and Jack's Room.The Truman Show ended up becoming a cult film, with several studies in various academic areas, generating several debates about the sociological issues that the film invokes. Bringing super interesting subjects from our society, leading us to think and reflect on our lives, how far can capitalism work with entertainment without being considered immoral? When is the entertainment of others no longer considered entertainment? These are questions that the film leaves behind.The performances are excellent! Whether from the show's extras or even the main characters, they do what is asked very well. But obviously Jim Carrey is great! Simply sensational, one of the best performances of his career, whether in the comic or the most dramatic tone.With a good direction, an excellent script, on-point performances and a theme that ages like wine, the film is consecrated!

Most Creative Movie I've Seen in a Long Time,"I think that the Truman Show is very much a satire, and a relevant one at that. The purpose of the film is to criticize the entertainment industry, and the lengths they will go to for ratings. It is meant to target the makers and producers of reality TV trying to make them realize the error of their ways, as well as the damage they can do with their platform. There are countless examples of of reality TV shows that have gone horribly wrong. As well as several times where individuals in the entertainment industry have snapped from the pressure that producers, directors, and even co-stars impose on them on a daily basis. The audience however is for everyone because we as viewers can also contribute to the problem by supporting the show, and making the producers feel like they have to exploit their actors for more views and better ratings. It is interesting to see Truman's growth as a character develope in such a unique way.

This concept was so fascinating to me, and is even more ironic today, in that we have phones and are always connected with the outside world.

Moreover, these days people just want attention and they just can't live without some electronic gadgets. It's insane when you think about all this. All are trying to become Truman these days.No words to describe Jim Carrey's acting. He is our childhood star. Sadly, he was typecast in comedy roles, but luckily, we got some legendary dramatic films from him.

Superb and brilliant film!,"I need to finally say this. Andrew Niccol has done two movies, and both are on my top 3 list. Gattaca was AMAZING! Everything about that movie was spectacular! Now here comes The Truman Show, which was written but not directed by the genius, and is almost as good. The story is SO unique! There has never been anything like it before! Jim Carrey is exceptional! Peter Weir, who did another movie on my top 3 list, Dead Poets Society, did a FANTASTIC job directing this story of paranoia! And of course, the script is brilliant. Jim Carrey should really be proud of himself for doing such a different role, and to star in a DRAMA-comedy. This movie is definitely on my top 3. That's funny, my top 3 movies all have something in common: Ethan Hawke is in Dead Poets Society and Gattaca, Gattaca was written by Andrew Niccol along with The Truman Show, and Peter Weir directed The Truman Show along with Dead Poets Society! (Note: I do not count the Star Wars movies on my top 3 list because I don't count those as movies, I count those as empire's.) I am very glad that this story had very little comedy elements in it. It was mostly drama and fantasy. This movie is a very unique and special movie, and I highly recommend it to everyone who likes unique stories.

"An excellent concept, a reasonable film","This film would not normally inspire me to write anything but I am astonished to find it listed in the top 100 films ever, as rated on this site, and disappointed to find that the majority of people's reason for rating it so highly is the mere concept behind the film. A few years back this would have been truly imaginative but we live in the age of Jennicam. When I saw that the film was coming out my reaction was sort of ""ah, yes, I wondered when this film would show up"". When do we get a big-budget cloning nightmare film in the wake of Dolly the Sheep? (Maybe we have and I missed it. I'm not counting Multiplicity).My friend who arrived late for the film didn't know the premise and spent most of the film trying to work out why Truman's life was so peculiar, which he says made it very entertaining. Since I knew what the film was about, and it unfolded before me exactly as I expected, I found it somewhat less inspiring.

Really nailed the role he was playing and never really forced out any humour. The character Truman was really likeable and relatable also! Whilst quickly on that topic, the film isn't a comedy really (not a negative at all), but I noticed that Netflix etc list this as a comedy so don't go into this film expecting a typical Carrey comedy.This film is so ahead of it's time its unbelievable. To horde in on the current zeitgeists of todays world (CCTV everywhere, life is a simulation and the TV media and the power they have) and direct a film that's entertaining at the same time is really rare. You often find with these type of social issue films that they focus too much on the messages they are trying to portray and not the plot, this nails both really well. Again, the fact this was made in the 90s is just honestly baffling and if that exact film was made right now it would not only do well, but the messages shown would be hard hitting.Yeah, please watch this film if you haven't already it's great.

And watching him on this role was very surprising, because he does an excellent performance. I also want to say that Ed Harris is amazing too. After watching the movie, I thought about it for a couple of time, and I noted how well done it was.The movie has a lot of religious connotations like Christof being a kind of ""God"" for that fake qorld, or even the name Truman, which can be translated as ""True Man"" something really interesting.

truman show,"okay.i just seen this recently.a couple of weeks ago and it apparently did not leave a lasting impression on me.it is not a memorable jim carrey movie.it is mediocre at best.not a memorable classic like the mask and ace ventura series.it is rather a spinoff of comedian goes to drama documentary style projects that are not meant to leave lasting or meaningful impacts of memorable sorts. the men in the control room are not convincing in their roles and they are not to be known in fond terms of myself as a viewer of this barely mediocre jim carrey project.especially at the end where the guy with the glasses acts like he's a god and starts almost appearing that way as we hear his voice being broadcast towards carey's character(truman) and proceeds with his unforgettable line of,""well,why dont you say something now,truman?say something goddammit! i hated that part.he reminded me of the typical sinister puppetmaster mindset of the very flawed corporate self righteous scum of the country.that guy really needed a swift kick by jet li into his stupid ugly mug if i must say so myself. anyway.i guess it had it's points but basically very much more towards being a forgetable and flawed project highlighted by stupid godwannabee characters like that stupid jerk with the glasses at the end. i liked carrey's response to that jerk though.the way he kept his cool and proceeded with his exploited life so gracefully and sportsmanly as he did was poetry in motion if i must say so myself. for it's points(carrey's usual versatile acting abilities)which resonated and made up for the wannabee jerks and had a redeeming quality in itself,i give this one a 6.0/10.0 if you like to see jerks put in they're place and are able to overlook flawfull acting and truly unmeaningfull attributes of a good film then give it a try,i guess. peace out.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Slippery Hollow,"Yet again this film illustrates that the Hollywood machine should on no account attempt films which speak to you at some deeper level. Stick to making thrillers, Sci-fi, romance, mainstream comedy etc which they excel at, but leave subjects like this to the European cinema or at least to the East Coast tradition. Failing that, only a director of the stature of David Lynch has the breadth of imagination to tackle a story line such as this.Quite simply the problem is that the film cannot make up it's mind whether it's a moral fable or (by a huge stretch of the imagination) a representation of some form of reality. As a result, it continuously flips between these two genres and cannot quite make up it's mind which path to take or which one to stick to.As a representation of reality, quite apart from the corn like the director wearing a beret (gimme a break), the wife trying to do product advertisement in the middle of a flaming row (!!!!!!) it's just too full of illogicalities and inconsistencies to bear even a remote resemblance to any real life situation. One might just about accept that were the whole populace of the 'set' also in the same boat as Truman himself, the scenario might ... just might ... work, but a solitary figure in a landscape of actors and extras???? Anyone with any experience of working in entertainment media sector could tell you that's simply not feasible. And the 'fable' angle doesn't work either because direction and production strive too hard to show film pertains to a real life situation.But the most glaring hole in the whole storyline is why go to such lengths (and expense) to examine human reaction in a supposedly 'Real-Life' situation.

It could happen to you!,"99 minutes, USA
With ""The Truman show"" Peter Weir delivers an impressive movie, which is still relevant in these days because of the ever-increasing influence social media and various reality shows hold on our society.In this movie Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, whose whole life is documented on TV and controlled by the director Cristof who is played by Ed Harris, of the TV series ""The Truman Show"" in which Truman is unknowingly the star. Therefore, he lives in a fake town called Seahaven where cameras film every moment of his life. Furthermore his friends, even his wife Meryl who is played by Laura Linney, neighbours and colleagues are all actors. Truman lives an ordinary, but boring life until one day he gets suspicious about numerous odd events. From there on the main character tries to escape his false reality while the producers of ""The Truman show"" try to stop him.Although the director did a good job introducing the characters to us, Truman, the only person who is supposed to act completely himself behaves a bit over the top in my opinion. Apart from that everything appears believable, and the colour scheme of the film makes it enjoyable to watch.The film was gripping from the first minute on and in the end, you could feel Truman's pain especially because of the dramatic music. If you want to, you can really think about the deeper provocative topics in this movie, such as the loss of privacy, loneliness and living in a delusion, all of which our main character has to suffer but you can also just watch it for enjoyment with your kids, as there are a great number of funny scenes in this film as well, for example Truman's wife advertising different objects, without him noticing. Precisely for that reason I liked the movie so much. During the play, you get to know the characters better and better and you find yourself rooting for Truman. In case of the plot, it's in a way predictable, but it didn't bother me much because the director constantly throws in little events that I didn't foresee which kept me attentive.Overall ""The Truman Show"" is a thrilling and touching movie which impresses with its closeness to reality and its actuality. Therefore, I would definitely recommend it because I think it is of great worth for our society and everyone can profit from watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I am now a True Man,"Reality show within a film. Crazy concept. Things don't fully establish till more than half the film and you slowly get it. Perfect example of taking a concept, exaggerating it by 100 times and you've something out of the ordinary. Existential. Makes you question life, God and your own identity. Nice how they show all the abnormalities in the 1st scene so that we feel just little and just enough strange like Truman himself does with the happenings around him. And after we the viewer and Truuman find out what is happening, he goes through that first scene again with similar abnormalities and now we get it completely what we didn't get in the beginning. Nice that they show the island and everything too because from the beginning the audience doesn't feel cheated. We also see from the beginning that the audience is watching everything and we aren't in dark about anything. Just as much in the dark as Truman is and nothing more. In fact we are less in the dark than he is. But the situation is so bizarre on such a large level that we don't get it. It's not a complete suspense and thrill but just enough.

All because it depicts our current world perfectly. Most of the society thinks they are living their normal life and that they have a full control over what they watch an spend on the internet. They don't realize, however, that all of it is just an illusion, created by algorithms of social medias, which the main goal is to have as much attention of the society as possible.Also, the paragraph above is about Gen Z and Gen Alpha, and what about Millennials, Gen X or Baby Boomers? Reality shows existed for a long time now, and are still very popular among older generations like them.

This film is comedy and drama all in one.Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives a happy and ordinary life as an insurance man.

His town and everyone around him are fake, actors.,, The Truman Show,, is the most popular TV show in the world and almost every person is watching him growing up. Truman has one big dream: going to Fiji. Unfortunately he is trapped on the island because of a child trauma. One day questionable things keep happening, Truman starts to get a clue.The story is very creatively done and the actors played their roles carefree and theatrical. However I personally found the camera positions not chosen well. How does he not notice a camera right in front of his face? It's not realistic. Also the movie starts of very slow and doesn't gain any traction until the middle of the film, where Truman starts to realise things are happening.

Entertaining Interlude,"I am not a Jim Carrey fan.  His performance on one of the MTV award shows a few years ago was a prime motivator in my having that channel removed from my cable service.

Certainly gives one second thoughts as to just how much television intrudes into all our lives - shades of ""1984"" - not too far away folks!  If we're not careful.Sterling Ed Harris, as always.I was disappointed, however, not to see the reunion between Truman & Sylvia.

Not that bad but Not that good - or even more than marginally original either,"Back in 1990, at about 3pm I was watching an episode of The Twilight Zone where a man had caught someone removing a hidden camera from the wall in his house. This leads to a series of discoveries, such that he is on a television station dedicated solely to showing him and everything he does, 24 hours a day. Furthermore, he finds his life has been manipulated, they have set him up with a better job and even his marriage and so on - stop me if you heard any of this before. Obviously on a smaller scale but close to identical, the difference being he has benefitted as much as he has lost out in the invasion of privacy, maybe even more, thereby leading to an intriguing and enigmatic ending.This in itself isn't a problem really. However, there are problems in this film. The foremost one is that, as with any long running enterprise of any kind, it when things go wrong, it's quite believable that they occur in a cluster.It is not believable that for such a long running and highly controlled operation as The Truman Show that the operators would miss Truman's father getting back on the set AND him finding people waiting ""off stage"" where there should have a lift AND not having anything prepared if Truman were to ever want to see what his wife does at work (what, no contigency plan written a long time ago, only something thrown together at the last minute that only just works?) AND the policeman at the ""nuclear accident"" by name AND the truly clumsy fashion cars block his attempts to leave which might as well scream TRUMAN, you're living in a dome and we're all watching you on TV.Yes, things would go wrong and almost inevitably a whole lot at once somewhere along the way but it's hard to believe the operators would be so inept so many times in succession over such a short period of time. The script falls down in clumsily presenting these scenes instead alternatively, have things that don't fit together perfectly (the people setting it up only work there, Truman is living it every day and would spot things they wouldn't) but are more subtle with Truman picking them up piece by piece and eventually working things out that way. Becoming gradually aware over time in a much more gradual and subtle fashion than the way that happens.Ed Harris is excellent and the way (to Truman) his voice looks like it is literally coming down from the heavens is great. Jim Carrey and the rest of the cast do quite well in the acting department.Of course, just to extrapolate from the ending knowing big business the show could go on after the end: imagine the interviews with Christof, the following and documenting of Truman in the outside world, tours of the dome, even the sale of houses inside it. Inevitably the selection of another child and starting the thing again. There'd still be money in it all.So anyway, just remember, not bad but could have been better and don't whatever you do call it original, almost exactly the same thing has been done maybe as much as 10 years ago or more.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Carrey's Greatest,"""The Truman Show"" may be one of the greatest films that has ever touched on the subjects of existentialism, consumerism, Americana, and television culture. It is a masterwork of cinematography, with creative shots and compositions done in-story through hidden cameras. The fake reality in which Truman (Jim Carrey) lives is an elaborately created set, with hundreds of extras literally playing extras. Fake advertisements litter the film, a commentary on product placement and consumerism. It is truly a world within a world.The movie has great performances, arguably Carrey at his most subdued but still very improvisational and electric. In many respects, he is a modern day Chaplin with his body language and expressions. That comparison might be scoffed at but I really think that Carrey is a master of comedic acting. Ed Harris also does a great job as Christof. There are heavy overtones of religion in this movie, ""Christ"" is literally part of his name.Very well made and one of my all-time favorites.

"Interesting Story, could have done more with it","I finally watched the Truman Show after all of the talk I had heard about it and all of the articles I had read. I really had high expectations for the film that was supposingly ""robbed"" of a Best Picture Nomination. I must say I felt let down.Anyone who thinks that Jim Carrey's performance is Oscar-worthy is insanely out of their mind. Saying that is similar to asking why Tom Hanks didn't get an Oscar nod for ""The 'burbs."" Carrey gives a decent performance that to me differed in no way from any of the performances that he has done before. There are still elements of his comic side (scene in which he drives around in circles trying to foil the other cars) present here and he really never comes through with any element of real drama, it all seems fake. However, who knows? Hanks started his acting career by doing mainly comedies until Philadelphia and look what happened to him.The film itself is directed well by Peter Weir who I felt had so much potential to use other interesting facets of the life of Truman. It seems that we are given a quick intro into the life of Truman and are all too quickly rushed into his ploy to get out of the dome and fly to Fiji. If only the first half of the film was devoted to what life is like for Truman and some of the neat ways everything that he does ends up on camera, this film could have been much better. We are hardly introduced to his family, friend and co-workers before the film turns on itself and leaves a lot of interesting issues untouched.The Truman show is a good film overall, however, not even close to the near-greatness achieved in two of the Best Picture nominees that I have seen so far (Saving Private Ryan, Shakespeare In Love).

Interesting enough, but I just have a hard time believing this show would have stayed on the air from this guy's birth to the point of being a grown man with a wife. No show lasts that long and this show would be rather dull one to watch. This one is at its best when it is more comedy oriented. Unfortunately, it is more of a drama and takes itself to seriously when it should be more fun to watch. Carrey does do a good job in the main role, but Ed Harris is just too bland for me. I can't believe he was nominated for an Oscar for this role...he just was not very good to me. I also don't think this TV show is realistic in that I would think it would be illegal to keep someone basically as a prisoner without their permission.All the faults aside though it is a rather good movie to watch, I just wish it were a bit funnier.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
don't over analyze,"""The Truman Show"" is a film in which Jim Carey plays the character Truman Burbank who is an insurance salesman that seems to want more out of life. He finds later that there is something strange about his surroundings that isn't authentic. There must be someone watching him because everything seems to be orchestrated.He goes on from this to the discovery this hypothesis is true and that there has to be more to the world than he has seen. He tries to escape his surroundings that he was groomed to be accustomed to, and finds that magically every attempt that he makes is unsuccessful because something always comes up as a block.This aspect of the movie portrays much of what one must imagine would happen in the raising of a wild animal in a controlled environment. They would either find that there is no way out of their environment and eventually give up, or they would rebel. This would be much like in ""Jurassic Park"", where the dinosaurs find a way out of the fence of the controlled environment. Truman is a wild animal that is kept in a controlled environment that is against his innate will and instinct. His instinct is to explore and find meaning to life. He is a wild man on the lose, and nothing can stop his aspiration to venture to the unknown. This is much the same in ""Jurassic Park"", in that the animals that once ruled the earth have an instinct of free range. They will, by their instinct, find ways to become top of the chain again.There are many that will find that the movie ""The Truman Show"" has some underlying spiritual meaning and that the producers had some great theological statement to make about how we view God and whatever else may come to mind. Many may even say that it is a statement of theodicy in that God has everything perfectly orchestrated to his will but makes mistakes in his outtakes. Others may say that much like what the Mormon church believes, God was just a man that was given high power of which he abused and screwed up thus bringing disorder to his creation.While all of these are legitimate statements about this movie, none are quite on par as much as to say that this was a movie for the sake of entertainment and poking fun at reality television. While reading many interviews of Weir, one will find that it was a satire on reality television and that it was to show how fake it was. It is almost as if it were to show the persons involved in reality television are pets that are subject to what the master throws at them. All of their responses are controlled and generated responses from a learned behavior in one way or other. These directors have simply learned how to manipulate those responses to get good ratings.Unfortunately, unlike ""Jurassic Park"", ""The Truman Show"" is not worth a sequel. The movie was poorly made and had a juvenile story line. The plot development was not adequate for the audience to fully connect with all of the characters. It was obvious that the prime focus was to give Jim Carey a character portfolio that would bring his career into a deeper, more meaningful position. While this being true, more than likely, this was the only way that a writer of a movie in this caliber could get his work published; one can find an actor with the need to diversify, come up with a budget, and create a film with a big name and it instantaneously happens, they have a career.For any person to say that this movie had any type of effect on them spiritually, would be to say that the ""Care Bears"" shaped their epistemology ultimately leading them to Jesus. There is about as much spiritual meaning to this movie as there is in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and to say otherwise is to deny that of the words of the director and to read cosmetology into ""Gandhi"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Unique Movie and a Story,"The Truman Show has an extremely unique concept executed to a predictable, yet flawless storytelling experience. Jim Carrey gives the performance of his life as the main character, who starts to question his own existence in a seemingly perfect world. There's a great usage of humour, the script was very intelligent, and phenomenal suspense about discovery. This all makes it the classic that we know and love. Also the themes of escape and exploration, generate something that we can relate to in our own way. Its a great film.The Truman show is very interesting because of what he have than in his life.

Quite possibly the most intelligent allegory ever put on screen,"This is a perfect film. Andrew Niccol, a genius of frightening allegories(Gattacca, S1mone) created a brilliant story of a reality TV show(before we HAD reality TV shows) created by a demented genius known only as Christof(Ed Harris) about the life of Truman Burbank(Jim Carrey, in what is his first and best dramatic role--I can't believe he wasn't nominated!) who lives the American Dream in a picture-perfect island town. From the start, as you see that everyone he meets(or is supposed to meet) is an actor, and people are glued to the TV 24-7 to watch his life unfold. The movie is a frightening tale of manipulation, reality, environment, and a number of other things that haven't come to mind yet. Laura Linney, as Truman's ""nurse"" wife Meryl is hilarious when she picks up an object and speaks to the camera, advertising the item to the audience while Truman just watches, a little bewildered by her enthusiasm. Noah Emerich as Truman's beer-guzzling best friend comes up with some subtle yet humorous lines: ""You've got a DESK job! I'd kill for a desk job."" Natascha McElhone also shines as the girl who stole his heart, exposed him to the truth, and now is part of a minority of people protesting to free Truman. As Truman's suspicions arise about his life we feel with Truman, we become just as intrigued by his adventures as the people watching him on TV, and perhaps more compasionately. Ed Harris adds subtle charm to his character as a man who admires his art so much, and takes it so seriously, that he has come to forget that he's not God, and that Truman is a person just like everybody else. As long as he can keep him afraid of the water, Truman is a prisoner, never going to Fiji.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Review of Satire,"The Truman show is still pertinent and significant to today's society because it addresses the power of the media. It targets people who watch reality TV and producers in the way that they try and gain viewers. The Truman Show is a horatian satire because it addresses a group of people as a whole, and it was humorous. Many uses of the language of satire was found within this film. The use of inflation overstated how reality show effects society. Their corporation adopted Truman and placed him into a fake society. Almost how reality TV stars are basically living in fake societies. The use of situational irony showed how everyone watching the Truman show knew that Truman was on a show, but he didn't. The use of deflation understated how commercialism is so ingrained into our society. They made it seem like it was no big deal when advertising things in front of Truman.The Truman show has a great cast and a great plot, but I feel that it was more of a science fiction/drama/comedy movie before a satire. I understand the undertones of the satire addressing reality TV, but I think that the movie wasn't really to make you think about reality TV in today's society, but the idea of reality TV in the future.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Interesting concept,"With all the reality shows currently on TV it feels almost like the concept presented in ""The Truman Show"" would be the next logical step.The Truman show is about the insurance salesman ""Truman"" whose life is a TV-show. The biggest reality show in history. He is filmed around the clock and has been for all of his life. The only thing is, he doesn't know it. But now things are happening that makes him question his reality. How will this affect him? ""The Truman Show"" is a very entertaining film. Besides the interesting concept presented it is also well written, well acted and masterfully directed. What also makes it entertaining is the way that you feel sympathetic towards the characters, the way that many of them are believable in their artificial way. Jim Carrey does some of his best work here as Truman, far removed from the antics of the Pet Detective.In the end what raises this movie above the crowd is the interesting concept. A concept that should give plenty of food for thought for people with tendencies towards paranoia. It also asks important questions about the importance of freedom vs. security. Questions that are more important today than ever before.I rate this 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Revisiting The Truman Show, I'm reminded why it stands as a beacon of originality in Hollywood. In an era often criticized for lacking fresh narratives, Weir and Niccol's collaboration is a testament to innovative storytelling.The script, a clever concoction of wit and depth, comes to life under Weir's excellent direction. The film's uniqueness is its strength, crafting a world that's both captivating and thought-provoking.Jim Carrey, in his inaugural major lead role in a drama, proves his versatility. His portrayal of Truman is a revelation, showcasing a depth not always associated with his comedic prowess. Laura Linney, too, excels, navigating her neurotic character with precision and forming a dynamic duo with Carrey.Despite the passage of time, some elements may feel a tad cheesy, but the film's dramatic beats remain impactful. The emotional resonance is undiminished, and the comedic elements cleverly complement the overarching narrative.The Truman Show unfolds as a well-rounded comedic drama, seamlessly blending moments of greatness with an engaging storyline. Carrey's performance, coupled with Linney's nuanced portrayal, elevates the film to enduring greatness. Its ability to balance humour and drama, even after multiple viewings, cements its status as a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

"Disturbing, compelling, relevant","I happened along the Truman show when it played on television. Thinking it would simply be another Jim Carrey vehicle (I'm not much of a fan of his outrageously over-the-top style of comedy) I passed it by. When I came across it again, flipping channels, I stopped to watch for a bit. Needless to say, it only took a few minutes until I was completely engrossed in the story, and angry that I had missed the first half of it. Surprisingly enough, while channel surfing later that same night, the same movie was playing yet a second time on the same channel, right after it had finished the first time.What struck me as extraordinary about this chain of events was that it was disturbingly similar to the strange coincidences experienced by the title character of the film. Truman Burbank has lived his life believing himself to be no different than everyone else around him. But after a few strange events happen, and an ever strengthening feeling that the world seems to stop when he isn't around, Truman begins to notice signs that all is not right around him. Unbeknownst to him, Truman Burbank is the most famous man in the world. But sadly enough, it isn't the world he lives in. All his life, Truman has grown up in a completely simulated environment, a gigantic set. Truman has lived for 30 years on television, 24 hours a day.I have to admit - the concept was unique. And the execution was excellent - as we slowly discover Truman's situation, we develop a bad taste in our mouths at the sheer lack of humility it would take for a human being raised for the sole purpose of providing fodder for a television show. We sympathize and pity the innocent Truman, as he makes up feverish solutions for his feeling of being followed, including that his 'dead' father is actually alive, and looking for him. This goes far beyond any cloning moral dilemmas - this is a truly sick concept.Director Peter Weir, who is emerging as one of Hollywood's most talented directors, plays the disgust element regarding Truman's situation strongly. He also provides an interesting portrait of the media and television industries, part satire and part thoughtful reflection. Yet it's hard to believe the 'thoughtful reflection' side when all audiences watching Truman's show seem to be characters straight out of a satire - ditzy restaurant waitresses, a cackling man watching from his bathtub... we can't take these characters seriously enough to reflect on what they represent in our society. Nevertheless, Weir maintains a firm directorial hand throughout; his pacing is superb, and his choices of music are, as usual, unexpected, refreshingly different (droning didgeridoo in the background reminiscent of 'Dead Poet's Society'), and completely succeed in beautifully complementing the film.Weir is no stranger to casting comedic actors in dramatic films, he evoked a similar performance out of Robin Williams in 'Dead Poet's Society'. Here, he manages to morph Jim Carrey from playing the role of Truman as a straight out comedic role into playing a real person, who has the occasional comic moment. Besides being refreshingly subdued, Carrey also turns out a brilliant and consistently watchable performance, which is lucky, since his character in the film parallels his character's role on the TV show. The entire picture revolves around Truman, and Carrey carries (no pun intended) the film with ease. It comes as a let down then, when Carrey lets himself drift ever so slightly over the top at parts, when Truman starts to go hysterical, believing people are following him. In these parts, we start to see Jim Carrey, and not the masterful facade of Truman Burbank he has created.The supporting cast is less developed, also paralleling Truman's TV show, where characters seem to simply float in and out, never really connecting with the lead. The character of Truman's wife, played by Laura Linney, is hastily and sloppily written out of the story, leaving more room for a developing romantic subplot (which, mercifully, is only taken to a certain level) between Truman and a former 'cast member' (Natascha McElhone) whom Truman believes is the only woman he ever loved, and who, in turn, has developed feelings for Truman. But McElhone has one of the flimsiest characterizations in the film, despite how pivotal her character is, only really getting the chance to stare anxiously and complain about how this treatment of Truman is wrong. It's nice to see cameos from Harry Shearer as yet another news anchor, and Paul Giamatti as a show technician, but most of the acting support comes from Ed Harris' masterful performance as Christof, the man who orchestrated and directed virtually every aspect of Truman's artificial life. Harris is spellbinding, overshadowing every actor present except Carrey himself as the character stubbornly refuses to come to terms with the moral issues of his hit TV show.Don't be mistaken into thinking The Truman show is a typical mainstream Jim Carrey comedy vehicle. If you go in expecting this, you are likely to be disappointed. However, if you go in anticipating a thought-provoking masterfully executed film which raises significant moral questions and causes us to strongly re-examine our TV addicted society... you may find that The Truman Show is about as good as you could hope for. If it wasn't for the flimsiness of the supporting characters, the occasional plot hole and Carrey very occasionally drifting into his OTT comedy persona, The Truman Show could easily be the best film of the year. As it is... well, to say the least, it definitely deserves a viewing. And don't be put off by dislike of Jim Carrey - if you didn't like him before, you will now.-9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Unexpectedly stunning,"I'm embarrassed to admit that I missed this film first time around.Finding it in the cheap bin at the local supermarket, I decided to give it a try.Wow.

It's difficult to keep the lump from your throat in the last moments of the film.Ed Harris, always a great performer gives a perfect role as the arrogant controller of the TV show that is Trumans (Carreys) life. Other supporting roles are equally well acted.But it is Carrey who gives a stunning performance, this is no mere walk through of a man out of his depth, it is nothing short of an Oscar wining performance, and that it was completely overlooked just goes to show what a mockery the Oscars can be.The film is thought provoking and humorous, tension building and provocative, in fact everything a great film should be.

Brilliantly Original,"""The Truman Show"" is one of the most original, captivating and entertaining comedy-drama's i've ever seen. This movie is very different from any other movie i've ever seen. Eventhough in plot it's not extremely deep, it has an excellent premise which is more than a twilight zone rip-off.One of the things that sets this movie apart from other alternate reality movies(edTV, Pleasantville)is the exquisite acting. Led by the pitch-perfect performance from Jim Carrey this movie has a great mix of excellent character actors. But like I said it is all fueled by Jim Carrey's brilliant Golden Globe© winning performance as Truman Burbank, a man whose life is on television 24/7. It is still beyond how he didn't even get nominated for an oscar when his performance was by far the best of that year. The other oscar worthy performance comes from the great Ed Harris(The Abyss, The Rock). Unlike Carrey, Harris did get nominated for an Academy Award©(He lost to James Coburn).When you put all that together, along with the brilliant direction of Peter Weir, and you not only the best movie of 1998 but also one of the best movies of the 90's.

**** (Out of four),"Some general comments about the grave injustice of this film being robbed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would obviously be unnecessary due to the high amounts of people demanding an explanation for the inexplicable lack of a Best Picture Oscar nomination for this film. So let me just go about in praising this film: ""The Truman Show"" was definitely the best movie of 1998 and one of the five best of the decade, behind ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Schindler's List"" and ""Forrest Gump"".  What struck me about the film is just how meticulous everything was.  Andrew Niccol and Peter Weir really thought everything out to its fullest dimension!  It took me two viewings to appreciate this film's greatness, but the scene that will always strike me is just how carefully orchestrated Truman's moonlight stroll by the beach with Lauren/Sylvia is used to elicit an emotional reaction.  Chopin's ""Piano Concerto No. 1 in E Minor"" has never sounded so melancholy and beautiful as this wonderful scene, and the breathtaking imagery and careful build-up to Truman's makeshift assemblage of her face is one of the most impressive and subtle plot developments I have EVER seen. Weir does not bang us over the head with this film, unlike some films that were inexplicably crowned with the sheath of greatness (namely ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" or ""Saving Private Ryan""...a well-made film, no doubt, but not the greatest war film ever made).  Whoever claims that this film could have been more missed the point of subtlety that this film was trying to get across...what did you want, Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis suddenly appearing on the screen to deliver some Oliver Stone-style message on violence or the JFK conspiracy?  The film's climax is one of the most surreal and strangely moving pieces of cinema I have EVER seen, and just the way Carrey enunciates a pained ""Was nothing real?"" to Ed Harris was worth an Oscar nomination alone.  Give me Carrey's nuanced performance over the contortions and muggings of Benigni anyday, a trait he must have inherited from...Carrey himself!  Oh well, to give this film the recognition it deserves would be to misrepresent the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a sincere, incisive group of people instead of the smug and sanctimonious group of bootlickers they truly are.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"«It's not Shakespeare, but it's genuine. It's a life»","""The Truman Show"" is a completely original motion picture. For good and for bad, it is very different and a unique movie experience.In general, ""The Truman Show"" is okay but far from perfection. Some moments are a bit boring. It was directed by Peter Weir, the same guy who directed ""Dead Poets Society"".""The Truman Show"" is a movie which makes us question this: «What if my whole life was nothing more than just a reality-show? What if my whole life was just a television program? What if the whole world knew everything about me and my life?».That's exactly what happens with the character Truman Burbank. He doesn't know about this, but as the movie runs he suspects that something's wrong and slowly he finds out the truth. He also finds out that even his wife, his best friend Marlon and most people he knows are actually hired actors. However, Sylvia (Truman's dream woman) is the only one who supports him and feels ashamed about what they are doing to Truman.Jim Carrey does a great job as Truman Burbank. However, Jim Carrey is hilarious as usual in this movie but at the same time he does a very good job as a dramatic actor. Yes, this was his first dramatic role ever, which was a challenge for Jim Carrey, but ended up as a victory.Ed Harris is great as well in the role of the arrogant program's creator Christof. But the other actors do a good job either.This movie is distinguish for being so different and fresh, but at the same time it has the power of letting me paranoid. It's notorious how after this movie came out lots of reality-shows were made (naturally inspired by this movie's idea).This movie looks simple in many ways, but it also has some amazing and original things: a perfect sunset, a nice and lovely town (Seahaven), beautiful sceneries, stunning views of Seahaven surrounded by the sea, the moon which is Christof's studio, different and good camera angles which give us the impression that Truman is being watched (including from the inside of the electronic climate controls of Truman's car - somebody explain me how did they do that?), the rain falling on Truman, the incredible storm caused by Christof's selfish orders and even that final part - when Truman walks through the sea and Christof talks to him from the sky. That final part is so well made that we can consider it magical.By the way, I can't finish my review without talking about the soundtrack. This movie has brilliant and very smooth classical music by Frédéric Chopin. It's so beautiful and wonderful! Besides, there's plenty of more instrumental songs (not classical, however), which are equally awesome and very relaxing to hear.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I love this film.,"I think this is a fantastic film. It is one of my favorites. I think it is funny, touching and even sad. You can't help but feel badly for poor Truman when he starts discovering things aren't what they seem. I think my absolute favorite line in this movie is from Christof when he said ""Cue the sun"". Sure, maybe its impossibly expensive to build an entire town inside a sphere and create a TV show about a persons life without them knowing it. But when was the last time you saw the Star Ship Enterprise (or Voyager) flying over earth ? Its a great fantasy movie, thats all it is. The acting in this movie is superb, especially that of Jim Carry and Ed Harris. Ed Harris' character is so evil, the way he thinks he knows what's best for Truman. One line he says ""I am the creator...(pause)....of a television show that brings hope and joy to millions"" Its almost as if he has a God complex. Well, I think he does. I have to wonder, if such a show actually aired, where a persons life was on the air 24/7 from infancy to adult, would we actually watch it ?",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Director: Roger Elbert (1967-2013)This movie is a movie for everyone. You can take something from him.Maybe you can already see in the title what's about.In reality, it's Seaside, a planned community on the Gulf Coast near Tampa. In the movie, it's called Seahaven, and it looks like a nice place to live. All people are just actors. Certainly Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) knows nothing else. You accept the world you're given, the filmmakers say.Truman works as a sales manager for an insurance company and is happy with Meryl (Laura Linney). He is happy, in a way, but he already feeling something strange. Something is missing, and he thinks that he might find it in Fiji, where Lauren (Natasha McElhone), the only woman he has really loved, is.But how does he get out of this fake world?Truman's world is controlled by a television producer named Christof (Ed Harris), whose control room is located high up in the artificial dome that forms the sky and horizon of Seahaven. Meanwhile, the whole world watches Truman's every move, since his birth, and some viewers even leave the TV on all night while he sleeps. He becomes to a real star.In summary, it is a very interesting film, because you can see how easily people can be controlled and guarded.In my opinion, the end was very exciting but too short. Throughout the film everything was described very precisely, but at the end it was very short and very quickly over.I also didn't like what they did with Truman.If I were him, I would be very angry and wouldn't want to have anything more to do with this series.

To keep someone in a place and intrude on their life is not in my mind good viewing but evil. Ed Harris' character should have been arrested for kidnapping not given awards. I thought Carrey's acting was just the same as the rest of his stuff just toned down slightly. The ending was totally implausible and unbelievable. I do not have one nice thing to say about this film, all Truman's co-workers obviously were too greedy to see what they were doing was wrong. I know it is just a film but with the way television is going this type of thing is potentially just round the corner and it will be a big mistake the day that someone actually does this.

Meaningful,"It's been about a decade since this film came out, and the sad truth is, the majority of people haven't learned. Reality TV is not dead, but has rather flourished, and is gradually becoming more and more perverse(indeed making the idea presented here seem almost tame by comparison, which is a very unpleasant notion to consider), digging deeper into the lowest common denominator to grab attention(worse still, it's working), and they are at least as shallow as they've always been, quite possibly worse(I won't claim that I watch them), and costing depth in real people, by abandoning it in favor of more ratings-grabbing ""entertainment"". Niccol is not a man who favors superficiality, or that which seems, at first glance, to be perfect, beautiful, or even right... nor is he one who keeps quiet about his view on said subject. One needs to look no further than two other movies he wrote, Gattaca and S1m0ne, both of which he also directed(he is perhaps less shrill in his protesting in the former and this, compared to S1m0ne). I've not watched much of Weir's work... to this day, only this and Dead Poets Society, which my review will immediately reveal, I did not find to be anything special. Therefore, I don't know whose idea it actually was to let the imaginary hidden cameras be our eye into the world of Truman... whether Niccol had it in the script, or Weir thought it fitting... but I commend and respect whomever thought of it. The score and music are fitting. The acting is good, all-round... Carrey surprises. Harris is marvelous. Carrey may have some sillier moments in this, but it is a film separate from his comedy work. Those seeking his typical brand of humor(which it should be noted, I am somewhat fond of) won't find that satisfied herein. Exposition is delivered with fairly good subtlety. The writing in general is excellent... Niccol hits the mark entirely, and maintains a realistic tone, steering carefully clear of the pitfall of mockery to the point of the ludicrous, which he would later fall into with S1m0ne, and his continued exploration of reality is interesting. I personally make it a point to keep up with what the man is working on. The satire and cleverness found in his work deserves recognition. This, as The Cable Guy, has some social commentary on the viewers, but on the whole, this is by far the superior film(sorry, Ben). It is but saddening that it would seem that the film caused exactly what it may have been trying to prevent. I recommend this to fans of science fiction, Andrew Niccol and Jim Carrey as a dramatic actor. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"A Clever, Unique, Well Acted Delight,","The Truman Show is a fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline and a stellar cast. You will never find a movie that is anything like it, it's incredibly unique, if any other film tried to imitate it they would be caught straight away, as we see a man's entire life filmed by a worldwide tekevsion show, unbeknownst to him. It really explores this interesting formula to a significant degree, unlike some movies that often fail to deliver their full potential, we see Truman disovering the truth about his world and struggling to uncover it, we also get to see the effect the Truman show has had on the world and, the most complex part of the film, how they have managed to make the show work for all the years of Truman's life, there was no aspect that felt unexplored. The cast is outstanding and were all very able to act with this unusual storyline, Jim Carrey delivers one of the finest roles of his career, being able to showcase his talent for both comedy and drama, he has some hilarious parts, but also plays a very complicated, complex character very effectively. Carrey is also joined by talents such as the great, underrated Ed Harris, playing a man obsesssd with the world he has created, Natascha McElhone shines as a woman who has fallen for a man she can never be with, while Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich play two actors struggling to hide the truth from Truman, stellar acting all around. Funny, dramatic, intense, whimsical and simply fun, I find it hard to understand what I have done to deserve a movie as beautiful as the Truman Show.Truman Burbank is a happily married salesman who soon starts to feel that the world revolves around him, however, what he does not know is he's the star of the worlds biggest reality show, as he was legally adopted by a television corporation.Best Performance: Jim Carrey",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Review: The Truman Show,"The Truman Show is the perfect option for a movie night with the family. It's a film for young and old with entertaining conversations among the characters and a good sense of humor.As we can see from the title, the film is about a man named Truman Burbank which has been filmed in a gigantic set since his birth. He lives like a normal person but with the difference that his entire life is a TV show but Truman has no idea that everything is fake. Even the people know about the director of The Truman Show, Christof and how he exploited the 30-year-old. But nobody cares about the huge lie he has to live with since he was a baby except Lauren. She wants to safe Truman.The story is really unique what makes the film really interesting and entertaining. The locations are beautifully designed and the acting is well done.All in all, the film is a must to see and deserves definitely a recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A movie to sleep through,"This movie was one of the worst movies that I have seen in a long time.  The lack of a storyline in the beginning and the slowness of the movie provided a very boring movie.  By the time the storyline became evident, I was falling asleep and then had trouble keeping my eyes open for the remainder of the movie.  I was told that the end of the movie was the best part. However, if you cannot get through the beginning, the movie is just not worth watching.  Jim Carrey's role was a good one, but it would have been a better character if they had casted a more talented actor.  I feel that the movie could have had great potential, but bombed out due to lack of acting and a weak storyline.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
They Don't Get Any Better Than This,"An on-film miracle is the only words to describe this masterpiece of a movie. Peter Weir's dark insight into the world of television is more powerful than those classic films ""Network"" and ""Broadcast News"", in that it uses an imaginary, but starkly realistic story to show how people bring what they see on t.v. into their lives, overcoming their own personal lives. Jim Carrey does his best and succeeds in a great but non Oscar-worthy performance. But Ed Harris is the real star here, his role which contains only several minutes of screen-time represents the evil face of the media. His powerful performance really deserves at least an Oscar nomination, along with the overly underrated Peter Weir who has made four of the most original films of alltime now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A friendly warning.,"The movie is absolutely brilliant. However, I can't help but notice that this movie might trigger somewhat of an existential shock to some sensitive viewers.

Damned near perfect.,"My only gripe is the product placement gag, intended to be surreal, but in fact prosaic - as well as silly.  Surely the evil genius behind The Truman Show would have come up with a more creative source of funding...?But we're talking about, what, thirty seconds of footage?  Apart from this `The Truman Show' is a film so finely crafted it sings.  Lovely to look at and intelligent as well.  One of the two peaks of science fiction cinema of the 1990s (the other was `Twelve Monkeys'), but this rather understates the case.  Jim Carrey was inspired casting.  I don't care whether he's technically speaking a good actor or not - he might as well be, since he's perfect as the hothouse-produced Truman Burbank, who doesn't know he's performing in front of a huge audience but who's unconsciously adopted one or two mannerisms of someone who does.Amazingly, some critics have complained about the end, motivated, perhaps, by the vague feeling that no symphony should ever end on a sweet major chord.  Honestly!  Some people wouldn't know a good story if it fell out of the sky and hit them.  The entire film was concerned with the inside of Truman's dome.  We were told, of course, that there was an outside world, as there must be, and we even saw bits of it - but only those bits that were directly connected to the inside of the dome.  When Truman finally, after a GOOD story, dammit, emerges from his egg, the story simply must end: there's no other way to end it.  I hope all those people who wanted to know how Truman will cope with the outside world get their wish.  I hope there's a twee, tiresome, mind-numbingly tedious sequel which tells you everything you want to know.  Serve you right.  You can watch that; I'll watch the breathtaking original again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Truman show review,I liked the truman show because i think the film showed that sometimes what you see isn't always true. Some things are fake and when you can't see that its dumb but you can try to change that. The film was really good and the actors did a great job because the show felt like you were a part of the story and it also showed that when you love someone you would do everything to do things with them and make them happy. When you only watch a few scenes you will not understand much because its difficult to umderstand if you didnt watch the whole film because its complex. I think the film was good and when you watch it you have to watch it till the end because thats the best part. At first i didnt want to watch it because i thought it was horrible but in the end i think it was a pretty good film.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Truman Show proves that an original concept can provide an innovative and engaging story.,"In a time where the UK has 'The Only Way Is Essex', 'Geordie Shore' and 'Made in Chelsea', reality TV shows are a massive hit. I wish they weren't, but they are. It's clear to see why. Observing the lives of others on a routinely basis makes you feel like you know them on a personal level. The same applies to this film. Truman Burbank is unknowingly in a hit reality show where his life and world is fabricated. He starts to find odd idiosyncrasies in his day to day routine that makes him question the legitimacy of his world. Straight up, this is Jim Carrey's best film and best performance. He controls his usual animated comedic mannerisms to create an understated and emotionally captivating performance. Peter Weir's direction is also compelling, utilising hidden cameras in this false reality to enhance the TV show-like qualities, making the experience feel real. But what really puts The Truman Show on the map is the concept. I've seen this a good few times, and every single viewing gives me a sense of euphoria. The ending might be slightly underwhelming but when we get to the final five minutes, it's like we've completed a quest! Me and Truman, together. The narrative evokes many themes. The idea of our lives being dictated by a higher power. The right to have the freedom of choice. Exploring the concept of fate and destiny. Is it subtle? No, but it doesn't need to be. That's the point of the plot. I adored the small details that reality shows include, like product placements. Laura Linney staring at the camera talking about cocoa...it's a thing of beauty and kinda makes me want to buy some. The natural progression of Truman discovering unusual happenings was well paced and all the loose ends were tied up nicely. Overall, a fascinating and enthralling study of reality TV shows with a career best performance from Jim Carrey.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Actually Really Good,"Truman Show is a really memorable movie. It flows very nicely, and is dark and funny at the same time. It has a happy and sad atmosphere throughout the movie. It is possibly one of Carrey's best movies.A man who lives in a perfect town realizes he wants more. However, he finds he's unable to leave. He begins suspecting something weird is happening. In the end, he finds out he's an actor on a TV show about his life. The whole world is watching this man growing up from a baby to his current age. He's not a normal guy, he's actually the biggest star in the world.It's a cool premise about what life really is. What else is out there? How small are we? There are no stunning performances or moments. It's a Jim Carrey movie. But a good one at that.7 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A beautiful film about how society can indoctrinate and blind you from what is actual.,"We have gone deep into the material world, even finding the so-called God particle, but we have never been more limited, more ignorant of who we are, how to live, and we do not understand the mechanism by which we create suffering. Our thinking has created the world as it is now. Whenever we label something as good or bad or create a preference in our mind, it is due to the coming into being of egoic structures or self-interests. The solution is not to fight for peace or conquer nature, but to simply recognise the truth; that the very existence of the ego structure creates duality, a split between self and other, mine and yours, man and nature, inner and outer. The ego is violence; it requires a barrier, a boundary from the other to be. Without the ego, there is no war against anything. There is no hubris, there is no overreaching nature to create profit. These external crises in our world reflect a severe inner crisis; we don't know who we are. We are wholly identified with our egoic identities, consumed by fears and are cut off from our true nature. Races, religions, countries, political affiliations, any group that we belong to, all reinforce our egoic identities.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Truman Burbank is a financial adviser in the small town of SeaHaven.

It is both a comedy and a drama, so everyone can get something out of it no matter what they like. Although there is some language, most of the movie is pretty family friendly. It also has a great message about reality TV. One thing you should look out for though is that the ending scene is very intense and may give children nightmares.There is some profanity including the sh-- word, hell, and godd---.

An everyman finds he's the star of his own little world. Interesting concept with decent execution.,"Somewhat disappointing resolution that doesn't quite feel satisfying. The actual movie did not feel as psychologically horrifying as the concept could have been. The alternate love interest subplot was poorly done imo; he barely has any interaction with Silvia but still pines for her years later, and the scenes with her watching him on TV don't really add much because the ending only shows her leaving her house.

"Better than Carrey's usual, but doesn't live up to the hype","While it's certainly refreshing to see a movie with Jim Carrey in it that doesn't involve rectal rhetoric and other childish antics, I was disappointed that The Truman Show failed to live up to the extreme ballyhoo that preceded it. Certainly it would be difficult for any movie to shine under those circumstances, but a better effort would've been nice. A simplistic plot that could've been explored fully in a Twilight Zone episode (and, I think, probably was). Intentionally bad acting by Burbank's ""supporting cast"" was off-putting, as was the logical inconsistency of the basic premise: that the dreary details of an excruciatingly boring life could be the source of endless fascination for millions of viewers.

One of the best movies of the decade!,"Had the chance to watch this movie only now, but I was completely stunned by how good this movie was. When I'll think back on the classics of this decade (the 90's) like The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Saving Private Ryan, The Green Mile I'll be adding this movie too.The premise was very simple and yet the way the movie develops itself is fantastic. You basically know from the get-go who Truman is and what's The Truman Show. The Show itself is what surprises you, moves you, inspires you on so many levels. I'll mention some of them: 1. First there's the manipulation theme which by the way mentioning it in my time (the year I write this review) is so relevant and is amazing how a movie 21 years old at this time was able to predict something so big that is sort of happening right now. 2. Then there's the freedom theme which in this instance basically says: don't be what others or what this world may want you to be. Be yourself, find your own unique path! 3. This one is one that basically tormented Hollywood for decades to come and is the Life is a lie thing or Life is irrelevant or Life is meaningless in the way that everything is just on a loop. Everything that happens is not real, that you are living only a scenario or a dream (see Inception).I could go on and on about the whole messages this movie transmits but you get the point. Aside from that the performances are all fantastic especially from Ed Harris and Jim Carrey who gives one of his best ever performances. The only thing distracting from that are his momentarily Ace Ventura- moments, but aside from that is maybe on par with his performance from Eternal Sunshine of the Spottless Mind. The score is fantastic and well suited for this type of movie. Everything else is just flawless and if I were to pick a thing that bothered me or a thing I didn't like I would have to really search and nit pick it.A masterpiece in every way possible that surprised me, inspired me, moved me and entertained me a lot. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Review of all aspects of the Truman Show,"The Truman show sits on a genre crossroads, with comedy, drama, romance and thriller all coming together to form one of the greatest films of the 1990's.The island of Seahaven is not far off being the perfect place to live, it is inhabited by the friendliest people of the United States, and with scarce litter and impeccable weather it is almost too good to be true. For all his life Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) thought that his lifestyle was no different to any other American's, with his perfect wife, delightful neighbours and 'loyal friend' Marlon (Noah Emmerich) who pops round with a four-pack of beer every now and then. It is when suspicions mount in Truman's mind, as to why members of the public ignore him if he runs in front of a moving car, or don't so much as turn a head if he curses in the middle of the street, that the plot line begins to unfold.As he strings together proof of his suspicions, Truman begins to plan his exit of the conspiracy that he feels is going on around him, at this point we meet the ""all powerful"" Kristof (Ed Harris), who is the director/producer/creator of the hit television program; The Truman Show. After meeting Kristof the audience realises that Truman is permanently being surrounded by a hive of actors and actresses, who improvise their everyday lives to create this haunting illusion of reality, so that Kristof can continue to run the world's most popular television programme.Kristof doesn't just want to make money from The Truman Show; he wants to mould the perfect man, by acting as the puppeteer above Truman's life. Kristof adopted Truman as a baby and from that day forward has put every emotion, thought and experience into Truman's head; I think that Kristof's character wants to create a world that contradicts the real world of poverty, crime and war.The Truman Show only concentrates on the last few days of Truman's life in Seahaven, but with the use of flashbacks the scriptwriters manage to give the audience a wide perspective of what has happened in previous episodes of the show - which were somewhat faulted by 36 year old Carrey attempting to play an 18 year old boy, a feat that not many actors can achieve without the help of plastic surgery. Needless to say these flashbacks inform us on the first girl that Truman ever loved: Sylvia; a rebellious actress who met Truman as a teenager, and attempted to tell him the truth before being thrown off the set by protective producer, Kristof.Director Peter Weir creates the idea of reality television by filming most of the movie with ""hidden cameras"". So wherever he goes, the fact that we are seeing Truman through a keyhole, or a car radio adds to the theme of the movie. I didn't tire of this, but at some points I couldn't help but wonder how there was a hidden camera filming Truman from underwater, but it's hard to enjoy such a momentous film if you pick out mere technicalities like that.The plot is tightly evolved around the idea of Truman feeling trapped, and he attempts to escape this incredulous lifestyle of perfection on several occasions.These actions conveniently allow Kristof to display his power, by trying to psychologically and physically stop Truman from leaving the island, using subliminal hints on the radio, and graphically showing aeroplanes being struck by lightning on posters. These unsubtle methods were one of the funnier moments of blatant censorship in the film, but when they fail to change Truman's mind, and he sets sail to leave the island, Kristof directs an electrical storm to strike his boat. This great film has got the nail biting climax that it needed to make it memorable in the film industry for years to come, as the film to create the craze of Reality TV.The Truman Show would almost definitely make my list for the top twenty films of all time. It gave Jim Carrey the boost in his career that took him away from his 'less sophisticated roles' such as; ""Ace Venture, pet detective,"" ""The Mask,"" and ""Dumb and Dumber."" This serious roll as Truman Burbank proved that Jim Carrey has got more than one genre of acting style, and since then he has continued to show his true potential as an actor in recent hits; ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" The Majestic,"" and ""Me Myself and Irene."" One thing that I hold against this film is that it began the reality TV plague that Britain has been infected with for the past six years. Programs like Big Brother, I'm a celebrity get me out of here, and Pop Idol have leached off the prospect that Andrew Niccol thought of when writing the script; filming the everyday lives of people for the public's entertainment. The fact is, I can no longer turn on my television without seeing a disgusting northern family get filmed ""swapping wives"" with an ideal posh family, or watch a celebrity eat a cow's testicle, and then puke it up shortly afterwards: and I therefore put the entire blame on George Orwell, and Andrew Niccol (writer of the Truman Show).I first saw this film when I was 8 and thoroughly enjoyed it, the sunny setting and funny scenes of Truman in front of his bathroom mirror are ideal for pleasing the younger audience. The concept of Truman being watched wherever he goes is probably more haunting for adults than children, so therefore I would say that it is suitable for almost anybody, probably not a film for the claustrophobic though.The turning point of Jim Carrey's acting career, and a film that caters for any mood! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Reality...What A Concept,"Haven't you ever wondered what it would be like to be the star of your very own ""Truman Show""? Have you ever wondered if you in fact are?Imagine for a moment a documentary, featuring one Debbie Samuels who you remember as that girl you liked in the ninth grade and once thought she liked you. Only here she is a disgruntled ex-actress named Morgana Windemere, who complains about how the writers once told her to give you significant glances, then suddenly decided to ""go in a different direction.""""I thought I was going to be the co-star, you know, the girlfriend, but then they said I wasn't working. Even though HE liked me. They made me snub him in the cafeteria and then said my family moved to Canada. Not even a farewell episode."" Elsewhere on the show, onetime childhood bullies complain about the unlovable characters they had to portray. ""All the writers ever did with that guy was have us beat him up,"" one complains. ""They said it was good for the ratings.""The concept of ""The Truman Show"" is a lot of fun. Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, who gradually comes to realize he is in fact being watched by everyone in the sheltered community of Shorehaven where he has spent all his life. Indeed, there is a reason why Truman's wife approvingly holds up household products in the middle of dinner conversations, and why the travel agency features posters showing planes struck by lightning: He is the unknowing star of his own sitcom.I wish I enjoyed the movie as much. Though funny in parts, it is more of a wet-eyed spectacle featuring an often-serious Jim Carrey staring upward in one of those ""what-does-it-all-mean"" poses that has marked too much of director Peter Weir's work since ""Dead Poets' Society. Aiming for maximum uplift, the film sometimes forgets to keep its feet on the ground.The film is in many ways like ""Being There,"" the fragile but brilliant Peter Sellers comedy with a similarly minor key classical music score. But ""The Truman Show"" is less sure of what it wants to be. At times, it's a broad satire on modern life, like when Truman watches people walking by his house and figures out they are on a loop. At other times, it goes for a more realistic bent, with a group of people who advocate Truman's release (including Natascha McElhone as Lauren, Truman's version of my Debbie Samuels) and a headstrong director with a God complex, named Christof naturally enough and played by Ed Harris.""We know how jealously you guard your privacy,"" a smug TV commentator (Harry Shearer) begins a rare interview with Christof, ironic of course given Christof's treatment of Truman.More comedy could have been mined from the concept of Truman, but comedy is not Weir's forte and except for that travel agency and a scene where Truman watches his wife in surgery, the film plays it straight.Still, Truman makes you think even if it doesn't make you laugh, and there's a satisfying conclusion that teases out the metaphysical concepts the movie has played with all along. It's manipulative, yes, but genuinely clever. If it doesn't make you look extra hard in your bathroom mirror the next morning, maybe you're just looking into the wrong camera.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Great Idea, Not-So-Great Execution","I loved the concept of the movie.  The idea of a reality show based on one man's life and following each and every of his moves was brilliant, especially when you consider how millions of viewers are attracted to today's ""reality"" programs, such as ""Survivor"".  I believe this movie alone may have paved the way for some of today's shows and were inspired by real-life shows that preceded the film, most notably MTV's ""The Real World"". When it's done properly, you get a movie which centers around a man who begins to question what is real in life and what's not as the world that he is raised in begins to unravel.  Two major problems, however, plagued what could have been an instant classic.The first is the lifeless reactions of the viewers.  To me, the film portrays the viewers mostly as people who sacrifice their own lives to watch someone else's.  Now I know this is true in the lives of millions, but even for a phenomenon like ""The Truman Show"", a show will also have millions of critics, although not as many as there are supporters.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I saw there was only one standout skeptic who understood the whole thing, and there were many more who shared the same views but were not seen or heard at all.The second and the most unforgivable error was the ending, which I felt was an anti-climatic conclusion to a movie that built up a great deal of drama before it.  The ending was terribly written and did not have much depth or thought into it, and its closure was much more predictable than it should've been.  I'm not asking for much;  I just wanted a final conflict featuring the best and worst of both sides, which I felt didn't happen.All in all, a 7 rating in my opinion may be a bit sympathetic, but I felt they did everything else so well, only that it deserved better.  It featured Jim Carrey expanding his talent and playing his role almost to a tee, backed by a strong supporting cast, and featured a good plot outline and great scenery.  I would still recommend this film to anyone, but I would keep in mind the two significant flaws that kept this movie from joining the ranks of the elite.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Way Over Rated,I thought this movie was over rated.  Once you realize what is going on the movie gets real dull.  The idea that someone grew to adulthood without ever leaving the town is ridiculous.  With all the hype I thought it would be much better.   A more entertaining movie with a TV theme is Ed TV.,2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful and funny,"""Truman Show"" belongs to a breed of movies that are different, imaginative and funny. It's most famous cousin, ""Forrest Gump"", was just as great to watch.Never liked Jim Carrey much. I just thought of him as an overrated clown whose movies were only rented and enjoyed by boyfriends who actually thought ""Cable Guy"" would be entertaining for his girlfriend too. But he is perfect as Truman, the ultimate TV-series hero. I don't think anyone could have played the role better.The setup is fantastic, the idea soars high and will be hard to duplicate, and I hope we will be spared any sequels. In any event, the originality and sense of wonder that prevails here is hard to achieve - but ""Truman Show"" really makes it.By the way, I think Ed Harris should be given greater roles.

Rachel,"I asked a friend to describe The Truman Show. He said, ""No, it's not a comedy, well...not exactly."" I didn't quite understand until I watched it myself. Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately. The point (the media and its destructive powers) is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals. Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless. Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here. This is a thinking person's movie.

The Truman Show is a touching story of a lifetime that shows how insensible the human being can be and makes us think about our own lives!,"On the air, unaware, being watched by the whole world! It's show time! It is the Truman Show! A touching story of a lifetime that shows how insensible the human being can be, manipulating a man's life and feelings, confining him to a surreal world where life can even be perfect but is lack of sensibility; just because it makes good television. With this extremely inspiring and original screenplay by Andrew Niccol, spectacular art direction by Richard L. Johnson and costume design by Marilyn Matthews, a wonderful dramatic score composed by Burkhard Dallwitz, a show of interpretations by Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank and Ed Harris as Christof, and a remarkable direction by Peter Weir; the Truman Show is an entertaining and dramatic cinematographic production that makes us think about our own lives.

What we all would like to do,"One way to look at The Truman Show is as a satire on modern television. Another way to look at it (and the one I prefer) is as the story of the only modern day man to ever go up against God.  That is something we all would like to do at one time or another in our life; to just go up against the omnipotent force in our lives and ask questions, make demands, defy them, etc.  When Truman is facing both his fear of water and the power that controls his life at the same time, it was one of the only two times a movie has made me cry (the other being the ending to Cuckoo's Nest).  Nobody else can say that they have first stared down the being that guides their universe, let alone say that they have triumphed over them.

Well...It's Not Bad. It's Not Good Either,"In this movie, Jim Carrey is Truman, a man whose life is a fake one... The place he lives is in fact a big studio with hidden cameras everywhere, and all his friends and people around him, are actors who play their roles in the most popular TV-series in the world: The Truman Show. Truman thinks that he is an ordinary man with an ordinary life and has no idea about how he is exploited. Until one day... he finds out everything. Will he react?Hmmmlet me see where to start with this movie. It was weird but wasn't that weird compared to other movies. And it was disappointing. I expected more from this kind of plot. The plot was excellent, but the execution wasn't all that great nor interesting to catch my attention.I was actually quite bored within the first twenty five minutes until the plot started moving. Yeah, it started getting interesting but still, wasn't interesting enough. It felt way too long, for some reason and slightly boring. I really tried to like this movie. I really wanted to but it didn't work for me.The performance by Jim Carrey was good and sometimes funny, giving us a comedic relief. Laura Linney's performance was weird and Noah Emmerich's decent. The cinematography was fresh and original, since it's like Big Brother all over again. There are some surprising plot elements which caught my attention.This was a good movie with a good score but, I expected a little more of an ""oomph"".

"Same prison, different door","From birth, to growth, to death, our understanding of the world has always been limited. We will never be able to understand the world like the Almighty God. We have to rely on various carriers to get rid of our physical barriers, so that the mind can reach the long past, think about the long future, imagine the alien world, to meet our infinite curiosity and knowledge desire. In this sense, we have to agree with McLuhan's wisdom: ""media is the extension of human body"".
However, the paradox of the development of civilization is that it often goes to the opposite side of itself and becomes the accomplice of deprivation of freedom and elimination of subjectivity. Today, the popularity and rapid expansion of electronic media in the world has fully realized McLuhan's prediction of ""global village"". Because of this, people all over the world can watch the world of Truman on the same earth at the same time, so as to deduce the prying desire in human nature so vividly in such a vast space-time range.
The tragedy of reality lies in that in this era of media, no one can escape the fate of Truman, and no one has full confidence to say that he has nothing to do with Truman. In all kinds of TV reality shows, can't we see the shadow of Truman? When we are cheering for the super girl, can't we see the shadow of the audience holding the TV and Truman together?

Revolutionary Film,"The Truman Show is not a movie that one can just casually watch, it is a work of satire that manages to provoke thought in the heads of all people through its ability to show how powerful the media is, and what impacts it has on society.In order to achieve that message it goes on to inflate the lengths that we would go to entertain by creating a display of horrible ethics in the way that Truman was used without knowing or giving consent. The whole movie manages to be one big hyperbolic metaphor for the societal problems and manages to strive towards fixing them in a blame by praise format due to the way that they show how great the show is, even though they are being incredibly unethical. Even with the beauty of this film's satirical elements, the movie managed to show other incredible aspects in the form of Jim Carrey performing in a more sensible role with none of the slapstick that he is infamous for, and the other thing to consider is that the biggest of the movie impact is the popularity of reality television that was sparked by its release, and how those shows still dominate a plethora of channels to this very day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The theme in the movie that impacted most is the freedom of choice. It doesn't matter the choice you make as long as you get to make it.

Very blunt satire,"Very polite, VERY VERY pretentious, the religious overtones way too obvious (Christof? A voice in the sky?) and successful because there was nothing better to fill it's niche- copyright suit notwithstanding.  The whole point of satire is to have a little bite, like American Beauty, Natural Born Killers, even Cable Guy just to name a few.  TTS had no bite at all, more of a light gumming on the media's wrist, which is something the media actually likes- sort of a Friar's Club Roast situation.  The media candidly acknowledges the low level of quality in their product and makes very lame attempts to cover it up.   The Real Worlders, and the people who watch them, know the show is cut, chopped and edited into something very far removed from what they experienced.  And the argument that we as a society watch too much TV has been around from the day TV was mass-produced.  The Truman Show doesn't make the media shake it makes them nod their heads like, ""Yep, we're that bad.  And if we had the resources at our disposal, we'd do something like The Truman Show if we gave them enough reason to tune in.""

Totally worth watching,"103 minutes, USA (1998)The Truman Show is a psychological comedy-drama directed by Peter Weir in 1998. Starring leading actor Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, the movie narrates a story of a man who lives in a simulated reality created by a TV show about him.Truman is raised in a fictional town called Seahaven, which is actually a huge studio under a dome. While he enjoys a normal life, he doesn't know that all the people around him are actors, playing in a television show that films his everyday life through many hidden cameras. The main goals are to prevent Truman discovering the truth and show the real and genuine emotions of the main character to the whole world watching. Christof (Ed Harris), who is the director and manager, controls the entire show and every decision as what happens with Truman next is up to him. With strange things starting to occur, he slowly realises that he lives in a false reality.The entire film is interesting and fascinating and attracts many viewers with its absolutely original screenplay.

Satirical Aspects of The Truman Show,"The Truman Show is an interesting story about a man named Truman who has spent his entire life in a literal bubble, with all of his friends and family actually being actors for a television show just about his life. As the story progresses the satire of the story becomes obvious. The satire of the Truman Show is the amount of manipulation that the media goes through in order to produce something for their audiences. The producers built an entire town for Truman, ruined lives, and psychologically scarred Truman with the ""death"" of his father. Another interesting point concerning the Truman Show is the way that nothing is truly fake, it's just manipulated. Most of the characters had genuine emotions concerning Truman, but they were fed their lines as to manipulate the scenes in the way that the producers wanted for it to go. The Truman Show also brings up the private vs. public life argument. Celebrities are often struggle long and hard for a private life. This causes damage to relationships for those celebrities. The Truman Show illustrates that with the fact that the television show is 24/7. Truman is watched while sleeping, while brushing his teeth, and while they do pan-away during restroom scenes we hope, one of the goals that the producers have is the first ever live conception. The Truman Show has many different satires targeting a wide range of topics surrounding the spectrum of media influence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A film with enough levels for more than one viewing,"Can ingenious satire be intrinsically infantile and naive? Yes is the answer after having watched The Truman Show. Who haven't had a sinking feeling that the entire world was plotted against you, that everybody seem to know something that you don't? In the case of Truman Burbank, that feeling ultimately proves to be the truth. His entire life has been a 24/7 reality television show, all his friends and family members merely actors scripted to do whatever the show's creator, Christof, decides for them. It's a life lived on false premises, but in which everything is taken care of.Truman's life is a lie, but perhaps that goes for all our lives? That is one of the many moral dilemmas The Truman Show implicitly raises. Another is the concept of voyeurism, and our inclination for it. And although those responsible for Truman's life, meaning virtually everyone, both those who set it up and the public who condone it by watching the show, aren't exactly vilified by the filmmakers, our sympathy is with Truman and his quest for freedom, meaning to break free from the confines of his controlled life. It's hard to watch The Truman Show without pondering our own highly controlled modern lives. As such, the film is just as much social satire as media satire, depending on whether you view media's role in the film as instrumental or metaphorical. Either way, this is a film with enough levels for more than one viewing and for a timeless artistic value. It is also notable for being Jim Carrey's breakout role as a serious dramatic actor, even if he also here proved himself more apt in the more lighthearted segments than the deeper and more pondering ones.Peter Weir directed with a solid sleight of hand from Andrew Niccol's script.

Definitely Different but broadly entertaining,"There is one fantastic reason to see this movie, it has broad audience appeal yet at the same it is very different from other movies and no one has ever recreated it....yet.Truman, played by Jim Carrey (Great acting, but not really Oscar quality material) lives blissfully aware that he life is just a television program. But his journey is to discover the truth about his life and attempt to escape the illusion.Australia director Peter Weir has often delved into the theme of isolation, in the Australian outback with ""picnic at hanging rock"" (I went there but I was disappointed not to disappear), on the Ocean in ""Dead Calm"", in the mind with a post traumatic syndrome suffering plane crash survivor ""Fearless"" and in an exotic community ""Witness"" (The Amish in the big city and Cop in the Amish community both experience this).Often disappointing for people who love Peter Weir, the Truman show appears on the surface too light and fluffy, but we find the same themes being repeated here.Does this movie reflect the relationship between God and humanity, children and parents or government and society...yes to all the above. However I feel the main theme is the relationship between the American people and the unreality of American TV.Truman is trapped in a giant studio with an artificial sun and weather. He can't escape because people try and stop him and his own fears. Fears that reflect how television and movies (which appear on TV) make viewers feel about the rest of the world.Most criticisms of this movie fail to see the truth behind the illusions. The overly constructed world that Truman lives in reflects the reality of TV but makes it harder for us to identify with Truman and his personal despair. This movie requires you to watch it with your brain turned and you must attempt to deconstruct this world. Something that is not common in a mass market appeal movie.Sometimes criticised for not being dark enough (just because the lighting is bright and shiny and Truman is a happy and wacky guy these people say it is not dark....they need a good slapping). Sometimes criticised for being too superficial (that is the point, that is what TV is like).Sometimes criticised for not keeping many of the incidental characters around long enough (Truman exists in a world where he is the only ""real"" person so it is a solo journey and only the shows producer, who represents the world and not a person, are part of).Sometimes criticised for not showing Truman's interaction with the real world (I agree but that is a different movie and something done better many times over ""Being there"" for example).What does it all mean, my own take is this. Television is not trying to keep us down, but challenging us to take on the adventure of life. Television doesn't want us to avoid reality but to go turn off the television and find the best and most exciting reality we can. If you are not brave, clever or good enough for the world, don't blame television.I would challenge those who didn't like it the first time to revisit it. For those who haven't seen it, watch it dude, there is nothing else like so you are either going to like it or not.Oh...and one advice for Mr Weir...people who like art-house movies are not really that intelligent. Next time use lots of spooky dark art noi lighting and they will like it too (that was irony by the way).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Life is A Satire.,"This movie the acting is amazing. The plot is very unique and ABSTRACT, and this predicted stuff like The Big Brother. What's terrifying is that most of us are Truman in the end. We all have a circular life, our life goes in circles.I have to say that the only negative i can give this is the ending. I wanted a more expanded ending to what occured with Truman?? He just closed the doors, and that's how it ends. It's a bit annoying i was hoping to know what happened to TRUMAN after all of this?Because we followed him since he was an BABY! It would be awesome to have a PART 2 sequel to this movie. Anyway, that's just a minor negative, to an awesome movie! I actually knew what i am getting into and i love when i know when i know zero about the movie.Anyway, the whole life of TRUMAN is a lie in the end, and that's horrifying. All of his life was forced into this tiny city and it's scary, that everyone knows who he is in the whole city. Ultimately this is a film that really screws with your mind, and it does it's job pretty well. My time just flied during this film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Beauty,"I would suggest that this film is beautiful. Carrey's performance, the sets, the direction, the music and the plot all exist with a certain kind of beauty. Truman is the Everyman, a Trueman that we all hope we would be, the innocent while everyone else is in on the sinister secret.

Relevant Commentary on the Mass Media,"I found the Truman show to be a very interesting, through effective, satire. In Truman's world, everything is perfect, from his perfect wife, Maryl, to his desk job just a short drive away. In short, Truman is living the American Dream. What he doesn't know is that his life is just an illusion carefully tailored by a television producer broadcasting his every move live, 24 hours a day and that everyone in his life is an actor. After a series of small mistakes and mishaps by the cast and crew of the show, Truman slowly begins to question his world, peeling back layers of the giant set. In this movie, the producers of the show act as the media, constantly stimulating our minds with directionless static that, without careful attention, can fall onto our radar as all-consuming. Truman, in this show, acts as the everyday person, completely absorbed in our world of media, news, and mundane reporters. The repetition of Truman's daily life reflects our own, in this day and age. What, really, then, is our objective in life if we continue to live the same loop for so many years? We have goals, yes, but why are we still stuck in the cycle every day? I loved this movie because the viewer acts as both the observer and part of the issue at the same time. Because we were so focused on the story, we weren't aware of our surroundings in real life, which was brought into clearer focus when Truman became justifiably paranoid. The viewer here is both Truman and the creators of the TV show. This was an incredibly real movie, especially in this day and age where we are so engulfed in media 24/7 and I would recommend it to everyone, especially children who are more vulnerable to media influence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Best Film of 1998,"Jim Carrey couldn't have asked for a better role to express his dramatic side.  We watch Truman Burbank for two hours, and although it's only a movie, we become part of the TV audience sitting on the edge of our seats wondering ""How it will end"". Peter Weir creates a world that seems unreal, but in truth isn't far from reality. In world of MTV's ""Real World"" and Jerry Springer exposes, we have begun to crave voyeurism. The Truman Show isn't about Truman, it's about society.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A good idea even Hollywood couldn't ruin,"When it came out, I remember thinking of ""The Truman Show"" as just a Jim Carrey vehicle - little more than an announcement than he had decided to be a dramatic actor now. Perhaps because of that conclusion I didn't watch it until recently. The movie is actually pretty good, and Carrey's casting is more than just a cold bid for box office dollars over picking the actor best suited for the role.The premise, which oddly is much more relevant in 2011 than when the movie was made in 1998 when reality TV was in its infancy, is that Carrey's character, Truman Burbank, has been raised inside a gigantic television set and every moment of his life has been broadcast on television to a mostly adoring public. He is a television sensation interacting with actors and extras in a carefully controlled world, and has a sort of goofy sitcom way of conducting himself, complete with catch phrases, that is perfect for the show he doesn't even know he's staring in. This sort of ""goofy everyman"" angle actually helps explain why such a show could become popular, and is perfect for an actor like Jim Carrey who might very well be described as a ""goofy everyman"".Of course, everything starts to unravel and the film becomes about if Truman will escape from his constructed world, or if he will even want to. We follow his travails along with Cristoff (Ed Harris), the diabolical creator of the world, but also through numerous fans of the show, a real cast of average Joes and Janes. We also learn about Lauren (Natasha McElhone), who infiltrated the world briefly and is Truman's true love interest, but was whisked away by the producers and is involved in a (apparently unpopular) movement to free Truman.Living in a media-centric world, it's hard to not find the premise and possibilities of the story intriguing, even fascinating. It makes for compelling drama, and the comedy is just fun enough to not be annoying, but the reason to see this is the story, not the jokes.The movie works. I found myself wishing they'd let him interact with his world more, instead of thrusting predetermined life events on him. Wouldn't it have been more interesting, and less likely to fail, if they'd given him some more freedom to live his own life? I also wish the movie had explained a bit better why the life of an insurance salesman could be so interesting - much of it would seemingly be pretty boring, daily routine. No doubt his otherwise monotonous days were scripted with plenty of amusing events, but we never actually saw any of these.The movie has obvious philosophical and even theological themes, but is not anything dramatically deep. I'll forgive it for that, especially as it manages to be meaningful without being pretentious.""The Truman Show"" is just a good premise told in a competent enough manner. It's one of the more original big budget, big name films that Hollywood has cranked out, and it doesn't squander all of that potential. This movie seems to have somehow fallen by the wayside a bit, but now more than ever it should be quite enjoyable if you haven't seen it before.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Am I mistaken?,"This (2005) is only the second time I have seen this film since it was released. It holds up really well but today's viewer must realize that this was made before ""reality TV"".

Carrey shines in an amazing movie,"The Truman Show is one of those movies that doesn't come along very often. It is a great concept, and it turns out wonderfully. Jim Carrey turns in a great performance as Truman Burbank, who spends 30 years living his life in a TV show before realizing what's going on. It's not what you might expect from a Jim Carrey movie. There is no slapstick gross-out humor in the film. The movie is a drama that has some funny parts, but it is not intended to be a comedy. Not that that's a bad thing. In fact, it's a very good thing. There was nothing weak about Carrey's part in this movie. It proves that Jim Carrey is a truly gifted actor, unlike so many others who have made their name in slapstick comedy (Adam Sandler...). Carrey shows that he has a wide range of talents, and pulls of the dramatic acting without a hitch.Of course, there's more to the movie that just Jim Carrey. Peter Weir does a great directing job, giving us the views from the cameras that watch Truman's life. It works very well. And the supporting cast turn in great performances as well, especially Ed Harris as Christof, the director of the show. Of course, the other actors are overshadowed by Carrey's performance, but they still do a great job.""Touching"" might not be a word commonly associated with Jim Carrey films, but this one is. It has sad parts, it has happy parts...it is just a great drama. The only thing it doesn't have is the slapstick humor that got Jim Carrey famous. And I for one don't miss it. See this movie, it is truly great. Everyone involved does a great job, and Jim Carrey establishes himself as one of the best actors of our time, maybe of any time.Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

some docs out of the 'box',"The Truman Show, this name is going to be historic forever, just because it is an attempt completely different, out of the box, unique. The moment you watch it, one is made to think ""can such ideas be really crafted in a motion picture?"" The director Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol must be specially praised for such a work.Now don't overlook Jim Carry, he is a master man as always with Ed Harris' intense performance. This movie may also remind one about the story of a frog in a well who thinks that the well is everything, the whole world. Not like that but being a comedy it shows what might happen with such a life entrapped yet unaware of anything. At the same time we see the desire of freedom and lusty minds who seeks entertainment. It questions as to what do we prefer, humanity or false entertainment at any cost for momentary escape from reality in our life.The film is certainly not preachy but makes one to think about various cobwebs that are and that may entrap us time to time. The thing that lacked in the movie are, as i felt, editing and cinematography. It was typical and simple.

"The Truman Show is a cultural phenomenon, with the right to studies from different academic areas, heated discussions about the limits of freedom and privacy","Although reality shows have emerged since the 1940s in the United States, it was only in the mid-2000s that we had the biggest explosion of programs focused on capturing ""reality"" using participants and confining them in surreal situations, as in the case of the from Big Brother, a show that dominates the audience in several countries whenever it is on air - in addition to the bizarre name that honors the greatest social critic brought by George Orwell in 1984. Strangely, even launched before the popular explosion of the format, Andrew Niccol and Peter Weir managed to deliver a prescient and, thus far, timeless work. The Truman Show is a classic crowd pleaser. Eccentric, original, quick and easy, hardly any viewer will dislike this brilliant story.A lot can be said of Andrew Niccol's scripts, but it's rarely possible to dismiss his premises as ordinary. In his second work for the cinema, Niccol elevates the cinematographic narrative in elaborating a metalanguage of the main sense that involves cinema: vision. In this story, we look at the life of Truman (Jim Carrey), a friendly insurance salesman who lives on the quiet island of Seahaven. So far, nothing more. However, the truth is that Truman has no idea that his entire life is the subject of the most popular reality show in the entire world: The Truman Show. However, some strange knowledge takes the normality out of the protagonist's routine, raising several doubts about the reality he lives.The objectivity with which Niccol works his story is one of the greatest strengths and also a major flaw of The Truman Show. Mechanically, the screenwriter presents Truman's normal routine, presenting his work, key characters of the meticulously constructed narrative for everyday life and, above all, his enormous fear of water - a fact satisfactorily explained by the use of flashback. Very quickly, the screenwriter already presents the various flaws in the production of the program, making that reality made up more and more superficial. The feeling of paranoia grows, fueling the protagonist's dream of traveling to Fiji, a place that an old flame would have traveled to after being disconnected from the show, after all it was not the romantic interest planned by the megalomaniac director of the show, Christof (Ed Harris dominating the role).It's quite convenient that all of Truman's relationships with others are fake, after all, everyone who lives in Seahaven is just a contract actor. Niccol doesn't mince words to completely transform Truman from a happy citizen to a complete paranoid. The concept is very interesting, bringing to light the truth that despite being the star of the show, Truman has absolutely no control over his destiny. All narratives are created and manipulated with psychological games so that Truman is a slave to the show and, therefore, when he finally decides to travel to see the world, the fabricated reality of the show begins to fragment. Despite its immense size, the world of The Truman Show cannot accommodate other destinations besides the fictional city.It is precisely in the second act that Niccol starts to fail, appealing too much to narrative conveniences, coming close to breaking the suspension of disbelief. Despite rendering comical excerpts and other powerful ones such as Truman's nervous breakdown, Niccol shows the show's production as perfect incompetents showing incomplete sets, official radio broadcasts to direct the actors, in addition to not-so-subtle attitudes to display a complete farce in the functioning of the show. City itself, as if the reality of the show was constructed as Truman passes through the venues - something that yes, makes Christof more complex, but also reveals a general incompetence for the director of the most watched show in the world.The film's messages range from the simplest to the most possibly hidden: from the criticism of an unbridled capitalism that deals with a single life and puts itself above it - see the marks that some characters make a point of highlighting - to the fact that it is common to accept all around without even checking. Is it part of the routine? So it's normal and right. This mistake, which anyone can make daily, has another face: freedom from habits. Thus, Truman's day-to-day life is naturally shown, with his greetings to his neighbors in the morning, his daily trip to the newsagent, his meeting with a couple who, making small talk, only places him in front of a large advertisement pasted on the wall and his work. In fact, in the midst of all this, there are the viewers of that reality show, who have followed the young man for more than 30 years and, for a long time, have only observed his routine. The repetition of Truman's life only reflects the repetition to which those who watch him submit. And it's this power to hypnotize and stick the viewer in front of the TV, which many real reality shows would come to have.As much as the script has a predictable progression - it's obvious from the beginning that Truman will discover that his world is a great farce - the path taken by Niccol's text and the way in which Weir unleashes the discoveries is very intelligent. Added to this is the air of human villainy that Ed Harris bestows on his Christof - full of a paternal affection that, until a few minutes from the end, it is not known whether it is for Truman (who he saw grow up) or for the show itself -, and the cruelty of the construction of a psychological affected by trauma - especially the one that implants the father's death by drowning and makes him terrified of water.What is interesting is that there is indeed a self-consciousness on the part of Niccol regarding the exaggeratedly rapid advance of the narrative. Knowing that he will soon sell out Truman, he presents a new point of view to show the core of the show's backstage, in the room where Christof and much of the broadcast crew reside. Based on this, the screenwriter begins to present the show's ethical problems, other audience reactions that condemn Truman's imprisonment, in addition to showing more incompetence of the production. The core only gains strength when Christof finally reveals the truth to Truman, in the most beautiful scene in the film. Ed Harris and Jim Carrey reach the pinnacle of their performances to show a revolted relationship between creator and creature, but an emotional and very tender speech in which Niccol tests the limits of the spectator's moral judgment, after all what is better? Living in a prison where you will always have everything, free from the ills of the world, but without any privacy or being free and knowing the worst that humanity has to offer? In this philosophical tenor that takes a long time to arrive, Niccol manages to end The Truman Show with a very powerful message.The story does not lose its voyeur taste and obviously plays in this field to attract the public. The expectation common in reality shows is extended to the film, where questions about Truman's future or how the show would end end up being the curiosity that keeps us attentive and this demonstrates Andrew Niccol's great creativity in making use of external experiences. (C. S. Lewis; The Twilight Zone) to flesh out the story and Peter Weir's competence in honestly using the script's acid criticism disguised as carefree entertainment, which, ironically - realize the abyss within the abyss - ends up being the proposal of the movie we see and of his own world, since the criticism of the ""Truman Show"" also exists in the ""world outside the program"", inside the film.Director of photography Peter Biziou knew how to work very well with different types of lens and image projectors, following the general proposal of the production that the dynamics of TV should not depart from the work. Techniques more present in First Cinema such as fisheye or iris imagery (angling or adding dark fades to the edges of the frame to highlight the center) were used to the right extent, as were accurate color corrections for Truman's fictional city and the world. Exterior to it, which we seldom see except through the eyes of the spectators.When we see The Truman Show, we realize that everyone is connected to the character and the show in some way. Whether they agree with Christof's methods or not, everyone watches the program, cheers for the character (each with a personal interest in him, who is nonetheless a semiotic object of desire), expects something from him. Realize that the spectator's relationship with the various media is just one aspect of the work, since the same attitude can be observed in everyday life, of people who ""watch"" others, demand certain postures from it, expect them to win tests, to be something previously organized, written, agreed upon. It's as if Niccol and Weir transferred the show to a scenario where people follow a life they believe to be normal, obeying rules they were not invited to make and allowing the increase of extras and agents who will give continuity and legitimacy to these pre-existing rules and postures. -established. The Truman Show turns out to be our own lives, ""watched"" a little less evidently (or not?) by our institutions.Even so, the tale brought by Weir and Niccol is a cultural phenomenon, with the right to studies from different academic areas, heated discussions about the limits of freedom and privacy. A show airing a show and criticizing the show people paid to see, as well as met aphorizing those people's lives as part of a show as well. Truman, in this whole story, is as real and as fictional as any of us.

A heartfelt dramatic satire that remains one of Jim Carrey's best,"This was an incredible, heartbreaking, yet uplifting story of a man who discovers that his entire existence is manufactured. Jim Carrey gives a powerful performance as the titular character, whose wide-eyed optimism and sense of humor make it nearly impossible not to root for him. We, as the viewers, are treated to three different perspectives: Truman's World, Christof's World and the rest of the world who have been watching Truman's life unfold since the day he was born. Beyond the creepy, suburbanesque world that Christof created for him is the real world where billions of people watch him day in and day out. One thing that movie does extremely well (although I don't think it was the first) is how eerily prescient it is in predicting the nature of reality TV and its effect on our culture. It also explores themes such as the nature of reality. It's just an incredible film all around, and should be seen by everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"With what is definitely one of Jim Carrey's best performance, The Truman Show presents a fascinating story, told from numerous perspectives.","The Truman Show is a television show about the real life of Truman Burbank, who has lived his entire life in a giant soundstage and who has no idea that his life has been broadcast to the world since his birth. Clearly, this is not a realist film, but if the production of something like The Truman Show were possible, literally and legally, this is probably about what it would look like. However, given the relatively exciting reality of everyday life (exactly what the movies are there to help us escape from),  I doubt that the show would be quite so widely followed, or that it would have such an obsessive fan base.This is a very challenging type of movie to make, and the effectiveness of it reflects the skill of the films creators. As was the case with the Back To The Future series, all of the obvious problems with such a concept are dealt with and the ways that they are solved are explained in the film. You have people trying to let Truman know that his whole life is televised, you have his deathly fear of water (stemming from his father's `drowning' and explaining his failure to leave his happy home even once during his entire life),  and you have things like Truman hearing people on his car radio as they follow his every move, lights falling from the ceiling of the soundstage, etc. All of the close calls' that you would expect to happen when keeping someone unknowingly trapped in a confined space are presented, and when Truman starts to catch on to the whole thing, the movie really takes off and starts getting really exciting.The Truman Show allows Jim Carrey to engage in several different kinds of acting, even, although briefly, the goofy comedy that he is best known for. But here, he introduces a new kind of comedic acting (at least new for himself), in which he goes along with strange things and pretends not to be weirded out, such as when his wife shows him what she bought at the supermarket, explaining all of its qualities exactly like a TV commercial (`Wow. That's amazing!'), which is intentional because the product placement is the only way to have any kind of commercial in The Truman Show, which runs 24 hours a day. This is tied in with his suspicions about what is really going on when it happens one time in the kitchen of his home, and his wife is talking like a commercial again. This time, Truman comes out and finally speaks what has been on his mind for so long, in a bit of hilarious dialogue that is very effective in the near-thriller story that follows (`What the hell are you talking about? Who are you talking to?!').When Truman seems to lose it and attack his wife, she screams `Do something!!' and Truman's suspicion's are confirmed. This is a significant scene because not only is Jim Carrey not giving us goofball comedy, but he actually appears menacing, which is totally unexpected given his iconography. Laura Linney plays the role of his intolerably tolerable wife with the incessant smile, and Ed Harris fills in the role of the producer of The Truman Show, in an uncharacteristic but very effective performance. This film is a great example of how an impossible story can be made to work and be fun. Peter Weir lends his direction skills to this unique story, and with great success.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Was nothing real?,"Jim Carrey is an odd one isn't he. Much loved for his slapstick stylings, I've never really warmed to that side of him. The Truman Show is different. Yes there's Carrey's silly side, but here it makes perfect sense in his fictional world with every detail dialled up to eleventy-stupid. It's the sinister underbelly that's that lights the touch-paper though, it's ridiculously troubling, taking a baby, putting him on camera, cutting him off from the real world and fabricating a picket fence utopia without his consent or knowledge. It's the knowledge factor that's key for Truman, not his lack of, but his thirst for. This is Ed Harris' world, his character Cristof's idea of utopia and as Truman grows up, he outgrows the godlike creators vision. Sure there's love too, a longing for someone, but Truman is an explorer, it's in his soul and can't be contained or controlled. It's a film full of spirit, as well as chuckles and twilight zone drama, but it's the rooting for the underdog urge that makes me love this so much. Maybe we see ourself here somehow, don't we all sometimes imagine ourselves as the star in our own show and what is real in our consumer world anyway. ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented"", but we all know what's real and what's fake... well just about. This is a fun film, a simple premise, yet feeling utterly original and as over the top and grand as the world it displays. It's cinematic to the core, even boasting a Philip Glass score and is probably my favourite Carrey film (although Eternal Sunshine is great). A joyous ride to the end, with genuine heart in mouth moments. ""Was nothing real?""... well who knows!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Over-hyped and overrated,"When ""The Truman Show"" was originally relased, I was eagerly awaiting the chance to see it...I'm glad I missed it... I went into my recent rental viewing with the same attitude I go into all movies that generate a lot of hype, ""this sucks"".....well, I was right...Other than Jim Carrey's Truman, all of the other characters were wooden, and poorly acted.  Laura Linney's Merel was the worst offender, as was the Marlon, the best friend (I don't remember the actor's name,not will I even attempt to find it, as it would be a waste of time)The ending was possibly the worst I've seen to date, leaving you with a ""that's it?"" feeling in the pit of your stomach....If you haven't seen it yet, let me save you the trouble. HE GETS OUT OF THE SHOW BY WALKING THROUGH A DOOR!!!!!!!!!I wasted 3.75 on a rental and an hour and 45 minutes on this, I know many of you will disagree with me, but this is simple fact.....The Truman Show should be cancelled",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Simply incredible...an original masterpiece,"This movie proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Jim Carrey can be taken seriously as a dramatic actor.

Fascinating and provocative. Funny and tragic.,"The Truman Show is a fascinating and provocative movie. It has an absurd premise that initially seems too fantastical to be true. However, as the film progresses, you discover that you're drawn into the bizarre universe it conjures.As Truman Burbank, Jim Carrey delivers a remarkably restrained performance. Of fact, things are far more strange than they seem on the surface; he's just a regular guy going about his life as he sees fit. As you attempt to decipher the true nature of Truman's created reality, the film keeps you wondering the entire time.The Truman Show tackles several intriguing concepts on free will, privacy, and the role media plays in our lives, even though the idea is ridiculous. It is displayed in a way that's entertaining yet makes you ponder some deep philosophical questions. The ending is especially clever and satisfying.I don't want to give away any big surprises, but let's just say not everything is quite as it seems in Truman's small island town. The Truman Show is a smart comedy/drama that sticks with you. It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for something whimsical yet poignant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Simply a Classic,"103 minutes, USA (1998)This humorous and yet thought-provoking film directed by Peter Weir was a major success and well received by the movie industry.Truman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey) is a 30-year-old insurance salesman and husband to Meryl (Laura Linney) in the idyllic island Seahaven, who is the unknowing star of a 24-hour reality show and whose existence is run by the creator Christof (Ed Harris). Yet despite the perfection that surrounds Truman, he wants to see the world, and furthermore track down the mystery girl (Natascha McElhone) who tried to reveal the truth to him and stole his heart years ago. As Truman starts noticing unusual elements and behaviors, he begins to question his life and slowly realizes that the whole city somehow revolves around him.The Truman Show speaks volumes about the manipulation of television, especially the engrossing and voyeuristic nature of reality TV, which, in my opinion, Peter Weir managed to convey perfectly. Nevertheless, I do believe that the movie started off rather monotonously and only got suspenseful in the last part, when Truman instantaneously started realizing the truth.All in all, I really enjoyed watching this movie and I would definitely recommend this classic slice of '90s cinema for people of all age.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Jim Carrey's best film and needs to be watched by everyone at least once.,The Truman show is not only a great original movie but probably Jim Carrey's best performance.The film is about An ordinary man who figures out his entire life was a lie and he was being filmed the whole time in a reality TV show with paid Actors. This film is probably one of the most original ideas and I think most people can relate to at certain times of their lives and has spawned movies that are close in idea. I would give The Truman show an 8/10 and I believe the film deserved at least one Oscar for the amount of work and creativity put on the film.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

How would you react if your whole life was a TV show?,"The best part about this movie is the connected unrevealing of the small facts that bother Truman Burbank, and the meaning of which he just cannot percept initially. The movie has great pace and does not waste time to explain how Truman's life was captured on T.V., but straightly starts from how Truman gathers the facts which lightly unreveal about something that has constantly haunted him: his whole life has been captured on T.V.Excellent direction, in a manner in which you believe that you are watching a reality show more than a movie. Great performances by Jim Carey and Ed Harris. The movie has the most symbolic and sarcastic ending I have ever witnessed. Obviously, a genuine masterpiece without the usage of sex, violence or offensive language.

The Truman Show,"The Truman Show is a comedy which is directed by Peter Weir and has been published in 1998.Truman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey) was adopted as a baby by Christof's company (produer of the show, played by Ed Harris). He is the main character of the ""Trueman Show"" which follows his life since his birth without him knowing and can be seen on TV. 29 years later he starts to get distrustful when a film light crashes right Infront of his house or when he hears the productions walkie talkies on the radio describing where he is at that moment. He often searched for ways to Fiji where he hopes to find his high school love Laurent or Sylvia which was taken of the show for wanting to tell Truman the truth about his life, despite of having a wife called Meryl. One day Truman manages to escape the cameras. This is the first time all cameras are cut.I personally liked the film but found Truman's character annoying at some points. My favourite part was at the end when Truman left the set after talking to Christof. There is not much to criticise. I would recommend the movie.

A straight actor and to be honest, I prefer Carrey in Truman Show and ESOTSM and even Man In The Moon to his comic performances. A funny man he is but unlike say, Bill Murray (a fave of mine nonetheless), Carrey can make the change from funny to straight easily. Watch this film and question life itself. Like The Prisoner and other such things it can throw up some questions.

Seahaven Island: Who'll be next to leave or be voted off?,"This film rightly forecasted that a voyeuristic-dominated society like Western consumerist America pop culture will move toward peeking through the windows as the next step in TV programming.  Already this week, the CBS network is building up anticipation for Survivor 3: Africa and Big Brother 2 while other broadcast and cable networks follow with much of the same (MTV's REAL WORLD of a few years ago).  In the world of Truman Burbank, the all-seeing, all-knowing (supposedly) Christof plays ""God"" with maniacal gusto.  He's like the Grand Inquisitor in THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV. Director Peter Weir and Original Screenplay author Andrew Niccol have shown convincingly their audience that today's Pop Culture in the light of day is pathologically or at least neurotically obsessed with ""on-camera"" peers who have been manipulated into ""maze-like"" situations and problems. Mainstream TV audiences (according to ratings surveys) want to watch religiously as people are ""voted off"" or ""lose a challenge"" for a weekly dosage of bread and circuses.  From scene to scene, Truman gets tormented, teased and finally caught up in a deadly hurricane as his TV audience sits back and breathes sighs of relief.  He does have one true friend inside his tormenting contrived ""universe"": a beautiful informer-traitor named Sylvia/Lauren who cheers his efforts to find a real world apart from the Land of the Smirks, Patronizing Product Placements, and Constant Surveillance.

In my opinion i think this is one of Jim Carey's best.And as i stated before the supporting cast is amazing.I love this show within a movie and highly recommend it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
TV movie,"Supposedly, this was the film Jim Carrey needed to make. That as may be but was he really the right man for the job. Carrey has carved a career as a rubber faced comic actor who acts at the top of his voice a lot, but the Truman Show demands he portray what at first seems a mid-life crisis but later develops into full paranoia, albeit justified.Meet Truman Burbank. He is the future of television. His show beams around the world 24 hours a day. Everyone loves Truman. People collect Truman memorabilia and videos. He has theme bars named after him. But Truman Burbank does not know any of this. He lives in a world populated by principal actors and extras. Truman's life is a carefully orchestrated soap opera. Controlled that is until he becomes dissatisfied with life and wants to move away from the sleepy island he calls home. His repeated failure to get away arouses his suspicion that his life is not his own.There are many faults in The Truman Show. For instance, onscreen the show's creator Christophe tells us the reason Truman is so popular with the audience is because his life is idyllic. Yet the character we meet is an insurance salesman living in fifties America. No offence intended to our American cousins, but it is never really explained why this irritatingly twee view of America should cross international cultural boundaries.Another down side are the unsympathetic characters on display. This is surely due to the fact that everyone is playing a character who is playing a character. The only genuine person is Truman and he is played by Jim Carrey and, worse, has led a life so mind-numbingly normal as to be almost abnormal.The good thing about The Truman Show is that the concept is very strong. Director Peter Weir brilliantly keeps up the Twilight Zone-style paranoia and the film is very well scripted. Despite being generally irritating, Carrey is not a disaster in the role and he does encourage you to sympathise with Truman.Most of the philosophy spun regarding our TV watching generation comes across as a bit hackneyed, however the final scene of the movie sums up telly addicts the world over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
a masterpiece,"I've watched quite a few movies over the years.  The friendly neighborhood Blockbuster Video people could probably retire on the money they've made renting to just me.  I've seen the entire AFI 100 and every critically acclaimed movies that I can find.  Even so, I'd have to say that The Truman Show is one of the greatest movies ever to come out of Hollywood.  It's a perfect film.  The acting is great, the screenplay is phenomenal, and it is a very deep and symbolic movie.  I've seen it seven times and I pick up something new every time I watch it.  Even the title character's name, ""Truman Burbank,"" is oxymoronic and symbolic.  He is a ""true man"" who is the product of Hollywood.  You can even spot a few allusions to the crucifixion when Christof tries to stop Truman from escaping by flipping his boat.  The depiction of a Utopian society reminded me of Alduous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" a world were freedom did not truly exist even though the citizens thought it did.  Why did they not do anything?  It's just like Christof said in a memorable and disturbing quote: ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.""  This cynicism is thrown at you one last time in the final scene of the movie.  Two security guards, upon realizing that the show is over, shrug and say, ""Hmm, it's over. Let's see what else is on"" while stuffing their faces with pizza.  Likewise, viewers of this movie may see it and say, ""Hmm, it's over"" without giving it a second thought, not realizing the significance of the movie.  Don't see this movie if you're not willing to think.  Don't see this movie if you're looking for a superficial, slapstick, screwball comedy like most of Carrey's other pictures (You'll be disappointed if that's what you're looking for).

Along with ""A Clockwork Orange,"" this is one of two movies that I have given a ten out of ten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good film,"Good film The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. A higher power and reality vs. Fantasy. It doesn't always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could. Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining. There are some great cinematic moments here. I loved the ""stolen kiss on the beach at night"" and ""Cue the sun!"" In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current ""reality TV"" obsessed culture.

Greatbut overshadowed by the original script,"The concept of this film is genius: Truman is the star of his own series, and he doesn't know it! A wonder that Hollywood finally managed to create an intelligent, funny, emotional, esoterical, mysterious, philosophicalin short an all covering film that is really touching. In the first, somewhat overlong half the story is following the main hero Truman through his point of view and elaborating his quiet, normal life while the director Peter Weir is cleverly choosing strange camera angles to give the feeling as if he is being spy-ed by someone. In the second, and much more intriguing part, the story shifts to the outside"" world and to Christof's 10 mile wide studio from which Truman is being monitored by 5.000 cameras 24 hours a day for a TV show.---------------------The themes of this sci-fi tragicomedy are quite fascinating existential ( finding out who we are and stopping anyone who wants to control our life ), philosophical ( what is real and what not? ) and even subversive ( the media changed the world so much that even a lie can pass as truth ). One of the best scenes is the one where Christof touches the sleeping Truman on the screen at night, creating a strange feeling how he is present in his life although he never met him!""The Truman Show"" deservedly won 3 Golden Globes for best score, main actor Jim Carrey and supporting actor Ed Harris, who was also nominated for an Oscar.Still, as much as I love it, I have to admit that the original shooting script by Andrew Niccol overshadows it. There we had a much more intimate storyline and original ideas. Some of the highlights there were that the location was New York (!), the scene where Truman accidentally discovers the word Trumanesque"" in the dictionary, the building of the fake town Sydney, Chloe's marching in into Christof's room and telling him that Truman didn't masturbate for 2 months, the dialog between a caller and Christof ( I enjoyed your work, Christof, but I can't say I saw all of it.""  Who can?"" ) or when Truman disguised himself while entering an xxx store all the while some two viewers had an ironic dialog ( What's with the disguise?""  Maybe he doesn't want to be recognized."" ). I can't understand why those scenes were deleted. True, the script ending is much weaker than the movie ending, but all in all it gives an better impression - and elaborates the plot more. It's sad because with that script this could have easily been even better.Grade: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Truman Show,"If you think Simon Cowell is a television control freak, just meet ""Christof"" (Ed Harris) who built an huge great dome you can see from space, populated by dozens of ever-changing actors all so the ever-curious world can follow the life of one man. ""Truman Burbank"" (Jim Carrey) has lived what he considers to be a perfectly normal, trouble-free, life that has led him to his currently, happily married, status with ""Meryl"" (Laura Linney). He hasn't quite seemed to clock that every day bears a striking resemblance to the one before, but if it ain't broke... Then he begins to notice things that trigger some cerebral rebellion to his Elysian existence. He begins to realise just how unnaturally predicable everything in his life is whilst recalling his old flame ""Lauren"" (Natascha McElhone) who was inexplicably whisked away from a midnight seaside rendezvous. When his car radio accidentally picks up the talkback frequency and he quickly thereafter stumbles upon some sloppy scene-setting, he begins to question his whole reality - and boy is he in for one hell of a shock! What can he do, though? Every attempt to ""escape"" is thwarted and we know he is terrified of the water... Will he get to the truth? Easily Carrey's best role in my book, as he plays the good natured but slightly vacuous character whom we see evolve into someone much more capable than many - including his puppet-master - think possible. It's a comically savage indictment on the routine nature of the life so many people go through as one year follows another with little, if any, change to the safe daily regimen. The writing allows Carrey to deliver a plausibly characterful effort that's entertaining and engaging and hats also ought to come of to his on-screen wife (Linney) who presumably sacrifices quite a lot for her art and watches the man she cares for become a bit of a personality car crash.

"'Somebody help me, I'm being spontaneous!'","Truman is an authentic man in a false world.Truman Burbank, insurance broker, thinks he's living a normal life. However, his life is technically fake, falsely created and showcased on international TV. His wife, Meryl, and acquaintances, Marlon, are all actors and it's all for himself. You're watching The Truman Show, a first hand experience of extreme reality TV. On air and unaware.Jim Carrey (The Cable Guy, Ace Ventura) acts in an extraordinary, straight role as the unsuspecting Truman and, surprisingly, gives us a commonsensical and elegant performance. The bigoted view of Carrey is not a respected view, but The Truman Show hosts the verification that Carrey in actual fact can act without throwing himself around the set. I couldn't possibly see another actor playing Truman by any means. Jim Carrey has the enthusiasm of a child and something which on no account lets you disregard him, corresponding Truman.Ed Harris' amazing feat as Christof completes the movie's stratagem. Harris has an imperative role as the originator of Truman's world and the administrator of the show. Christof, who theoretically plays God, directs the Truman Show and creates story lines. As this God figure he guides Truman through a false life, introducing fresh citizens and unscrambling predicaments as a quantity of plots go wrong. Christof's control room is an impressive element of the movie, as you see hundreds of monitors concerning various cameras, a large screen overlooking the entire room and even computers which manage the habitat's weather and have power over daylight.The motion picture's plot is an, appreciatively, clear plot. The viewer watches The Truman Show similar to if it is a normal channel on television. concealed cameras first lead you throughout Truman's regular day as an insurance broker, stumbling across people he recognizes and being involved in subtle product placements. Yet, another day he meets his Father who, Truman believed, drowned after boating in a storm (this was a clever way to make Truman petrified of water so he can not escape from Seahaven). Unexpectedly, Truman's Father is taken away by unsystematic people and Truman is left bewildered. Feelings of a previous love-at-first-site, who broke in to the Seahaven studio, confound him more, believing she was taken to Fiji. Truman, in conclusion, decides he will getaway from Seahaven and escape, oblivious that he's in a film studio.The production begins with introducing the appealing concept of actors. Instead of opening by introducing the authentic actor's names, they are specified two names in the motion picture. for instance, Meryl, Truman's wife in the show, is named Hannah Gill in the real world. This tells us that merely Truman, who's name by opportunity can be pronounced as True-Man) is authentic in Seahaven. As well as these, a succinct interview with the show's foremost actors explains The Truman Show.The Truman Show is based on reality TV and has an analogous perception to Big Brother. Seahaven, Truman's home town (fashioned for Truman by Christof) has approximately 5000 cameras, several as minuscule as a pin head. The cameras are located where Truman can be seen perpetually. Cameras are even in the most incongruous places, like Truman's office pencil sharpener, in addition to a dog collar. George Orwell's 1984 can strongly be compared to The Truman Show, with the concept of someone being watched all the time and being trapped in one place, in Truman's case, stuck in Seahaven. The issue of voyeurism can also be concerned within The Truman Show, and if a program of such correspondence should actually be aired devoid of Truman's authorization.The Truman Show is a tremendous film for the whole family, and can be enjoyed even after the 103 minutes. Issues concerning such a product being created in our lives can be safely debated with your family. A second watch is also recommended, as many new features are unlocked after the end is revealed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Artificiality exposing artificiality artificially,"I should preface my comments by saying that I prefer old movies, that I am stuck in the past and hardly ever enjoy a movie made after 1975, one of the reasons being that recent movies seem to include their own rave reviews. So much money is at stake, that a movie becomes the equivalent of Columbus's voyage.This movie is flawed on several counts: There are at least three or four Twilight Zone episodes based on the concept of someone unknowingly living an artificial life. The Twilight Zone (TV show) has everything that this film lacks: artistry, conciseness, originality, bite, and that gorgeous black and white, with plenty of shadows. The Truman Show is a one-idea, one-gag movie. Moreover, the whole notion that artificiality is bad is flawed: we are all artificial, knowingly and unknowingly. We all play roles all the time. Thus, to deplore artificiality amounts to deploring life itself. If Truman doesn't know his life is artificial, that makes it non-artificial, doesn't it?",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Reality and the Viewer: The Truman Show*,"""The Truman Show"" (1998) holds a place as a cinematic cult classic with its extraordinary screenplay and flawless editing. The film narrates Truman's life transforming into a televised series, skillfully exploring the delicate line between reality and behind-the-scenes manipulation. Its exceptional screenplay beckons the audience to step into Truman's world, offering a thought-provoking experience as we follow his inner journey. While one might envision a technically enhanced remake, the film's uniqueness and depth of characters remain its distinguishing factors. Without divulging spoilers, ""The Truman Show"" provides a captivating thought experiment on the concepts of reality and observation, delivering an unforgettable cinematic gem to film enthusiasts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Unique, Ambitious, Well Executed","Jim Carrey shines once again in this film, proving (as if he has to at this point) what a strong actor he truly is.
The Truman Show follows a young man (named Truman) who isn't aware that his entire life is a reality show. The movie focuses on his gradual awareness and attempts to break free of the control that unseen forces have over his every move.
It's an extremely unique idea, and it makes for a very ambitious film. It's the kind of idea that needs to be carefully executed because it's an easy one to fail to correctly portray, but the team behind The Truman Show did a fantastic job. At no point in this movie does it feel like it's dragging. At no point was I compelled to check the time on my phone.

Time to make some enemies on imdb! I like it!,"I note some imdb reviewers comments. Those people who describe The Truman Show as ""boring"" or ""not funny"" completely miss the point. I would venture to suggest that they are the kind of individuals who watched every episode of Dallas or Dynasty (or for my fellow Brits, Coronation Street or Eastenders). These types do not like to have their addiction mocked, which this movie does so well. REAL life is not perfect, with every little thing being organised to suit. As someone once said, ""s**t happens"". Although I may not have cast the admittedly excellent Carrey as Truman, his eventual desire to find out if ""the truth is out there"" is human nature at it's most real.

"A classic from the 90's, almost a prediction of modern times","First time I watched this movie was when I was 12. A the time I did not have the tools to completely understand the movie and the message behind it. My girlfriend never watch it, so I took advantage. Jim Carey is surprisingly good and so much different than any other movie: he is less comedic, he does not do his typical funny and strange faces like in ""Ace Ventura"" or ""The Mask"". He was always a very versatile actor. But I consider this one one of his best one, still today.""The Truman Show"" was made in a period in which television was deeply changing, where reality shows were exploding as a genre. I have always considered this production as a critique of this kind of empty and useless form of entertainment, that unfortunately became so popular and still today is very important for so many networks, as a lot of people watch them. Truman is a prisoner of this kind of entertainment (as a lot of people are), the only difference is that he did not have any choice, while common people can always to turn off the TV. The concept is very original and in my opinion way ahead of many productions at the time.Actors are phenomenal and you can actually see how much fake characters around Truman are, while the main character seems to be the only genuine one, that wants to escape from that golden prison, just to explore the world and reuniting with the true love of his life. This difference is very well highlighted.""The Truman Show"" is not a movie to underestimate: it may seem a light-hearted, but in reality is far away from that.

The Truman Show - A True Man's Reality,"The Truman Show - A True Man's RealityIt's an excellent interpretation of Demi-God & Human relationship. Although a poor man's representation  but surely a pretty good one.Ever since the infant (Jim) was in the womb  the Director(Demi God) , with the help of scientific advancement & technology, took the entire growth process, delivery, childhood, adulthood, marriage.basically outlined the life cycle of the child born. The human Director was trying to act God in front of the other viewers and the rest of the viewers  ie. common mass were watching it helplessly  rather enjoying the candid attitude and behavioral pattern of Jim Carrey.They stopped him from pursuing his own desires, failed him in school, rest of all the others who were with him were just a part of the huge studio as made by the Director and were acting all the time  making a fool of him  so basically he had no true friend  all actors !But a human Director is after all just a human. In comes a Lady  who tries to warn Jim of his delusion and gives him hints of his freedom. But soon the Director and the other team members take over and make Jim fall in love and even eventually marry the one they chose for him.He was shown carrying on with life reluctantly when suddenly he realizes that things are not what it seems to be  he then starts to investigate and finally break opens the cocoon (studio premises) he had been living in for so long ! Demi-God a.k.a. Director tries to give him a lot of hard ships  storm, tempest etc. but he could not stop Truman (Jim) from manifesting his own true self !This is the case with every human being  but most of them are happy as actors , some as helpless knowledgeables witnessing the suffering of a poor man who is being fooled by the entire world but are still sitting pretty about it  very rare few have the guts to break open the cocoon like Swami Vivekananda and his kinds- who, when open up their respective cocoons, let the entire world know of it and its possibilities !",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Pogey ako,"As many fans know, Jim Carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy. His comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. But anytime before 1998 I think I can safely say that not many people saw Carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasn't truly in the comedy genre. I definitely didn't see it coming. And to be honest, I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy it. But in the end, I did, not only because of how well Carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This is one of Jim Carrey's more precise acting roles. He has a plethora of energy, but manages to keep it reined in. Laura Linney is average, Ed Harris underperforms, and Noah Emmerich almost steals the show at times.

Insightful and delicately beautiful,"Peter Weir is one of the most interesting directors working today.  His casting of Jim Carrey as the titular Truman may have raised some eyebrows, but then Weir has never been known for his conventionality.  Weir has a way of drawing great (or at least greatish) performances out of his actors: Robin Williams in ""Dead Poets Society,"" Rosie Perez in ""Fearless.""  And Carrey has shown seeds of greatness before; rent ""Doing Time on Maple Drive"" (if you can find it) to see what I'm talking about.  Truman's entire life, since the day of his birth, has been orchestrated on a giant television studio set, the only world Truman knows, and televised worldwide as ""The Truman Show.""  Truman represents something impossibly difficult to find in our society today: an absolutely innocent person.  This goes a long way to explain his public's fascination with him.  Ed Harris brings a bizarre dignity and ethic to his portrayal of Christos, the god-like creator and director of ""The Truman Show.""

My favourite film of all time!,"The Truman Show is a movie I would not claim to be the best movie ever made. However it is one of the best movies, and it is definitely the one I care most about. The reason why this movie works so well for me and why i think it is so unique is that this movie lies perfectly in the sweet spot of what i like. The movie is not too long. Not too short. Its sad, but not too sad. Its funny, but not to annoying extend. Its a clever film, with an interesting plot but not in a way you have to use 150% of your brains to keep up. The characters are unique but none is acting over the top. The music is beautiful, original and perfectly fitting. The decor and setting is very well done. Just perfectly balanced. Most of the times when I am watching a masterpiece, there is always a drawback (like for instance a film being too long, or having boring bits or being too complicated or forced at times) The Truman show has no drawbacks for me.Another thing i need to point out is the message of this film. This film is about a man who is trapped in his own reality show without knowing it. Ever since he was born he is recorded and everyone surrounding him even his parents are actors in the film. He lives in a complete lie where all of his surroundings is a construction for his television show. This means that he never left the film set for his entire life due to fears of traveling that they gave him when he was younger.This is where i think this is one of the most poetic films of all time. You have a kind man living in a created paradise where everything is perfect. If he will just stay where he is, he will always be save, with a good life, without any harm or problems. And the only thing he wants is to get out! It shows how people are not made to live in a perfectly controlled environment and that there will always be a natural desire for imperfections and freedom in a lifetime.Also Truman finds true love with a woman that start to care about him. But she wasn't one of the actors that he was supposed to be with. She is the first one to try to get him out of this place. I'd love her part because she is an active being trying to help him out even though she doesn't have the power to do so. (I think this is important because I feel a lot of classic and well received movies unfortunately tend to portray women as kind of useless beings at times). So to have her as a character that means much for his desire to escape but also her active role of getting him out i find very refreshing.So they take her away from Truman, and they make sure he will never meet her again. They make Truman mary another woman who is just an actress. Their love isn't even real. Now the beautiful part is that the other woman can still follow The Truman Show on television and see how truman still thinks about her. I think that is both sad and romantic at the same time.She also has a button on her clothes that says: ""How's it going to end?"" Both Truman and the audience is wondering the same thing throughout the movie. And that is also the main question of the film itself. How's it going to end?Another thing i love is that this movie has no clear villain. The only person you may consider a villain is the person that took most care for Truman his entire life, but also destroying him at the same time even though he doesn't want to. And that is the director in the film. You feel that everything he does, is meant to do right yet he does everything so egocentrically wrong. There are scenes in which you can feel his sadness about his own undoing. Directing The Truman show made The Truman Show also become his life as well. And he loves Truman more then anyone else. He honestly believes what he is doing is the right thing for Truman. It makes you wonder, who actually lives the lie here? I have never seen a 'bad guy' being portrayed so originally.Besides all this, Truman is played by Jim Carry. And it is in my opinion together with his part in Eternal Sunshine his best role ever played. He is not as Jim Carrey-ish as you picture him in most movies.

Not the Great Movie I was expecting.,"Someone suggested to me that this movie might have been far, far more successful if it had been differently structured: imagine if, like Truman, the audience hadn't known until the end that Truman was in a TV show.  It might have given the movie a certain sense of pathos and let the audience identify a lot more with Truman.  As it was, I think that too much was given away too soon...knowing that it was a TV show in advance, made it harder to identify with Truman's dilemma.  It made all the show's action seem stilted, the reintroduction of his father obvious, and subplot with the mysterious redhead, unconvincing.  Even the social satire came off as overwrought.  As such, The Truman Show was not the great movie I was hoping for when I went to it.  It had great potential, and squandered it.

"Everyone raves over it, but I think this is where he started going down.","This is one of those times when I must differ with other reviewers. I didn't like this one. I support Carrey's attempt to jump into another genre, and the work itself is awesome. Carrey's performance clearly rocks. But the whole premise was affronting. I, frankly, hated this movie. Carrey's performance makes it worth the hype, but the story itself was a cold, calculating, cashing-in of the talent, and I can not find anything enjoyable about that.This work was clearly intended to make you think. It endears you to the main character (Carrey), introduces its premise (which was refreshingly new), and then lowers the boom. It was the boom I couldn't swallow. I found this work horribly disturbing, and just plain sad.Frankly, in spite of the glowing reviews and excellent numbers this work received, I believe this is the pinpoint of the decline of Carrey's career.

Don't Believe Everything You Hear,"What if everything was not as it seemed? What if you were constantly under watch by everyone you know? It's hard to imagine. But in the Truman Show, it covers just that Truman Burbank lives in a fake world. His friends and family are actors. He is a walking advertisement. Everything he does it noted down. But he doesn't have a single clue! In this gripping comedy-drama, the script writer, Andrew Niccol, gives you an insight into what it would be like to never have privacy. Truman Burbank, played by the hilarious Jim Carrey, is in his late 30's. His positive outlook on life and his happy personality make him vulnerable and unexpecting of everything around him. His whole life is censored she has no idea of his celebrity status, so as you can imagine, finding out his own secret would lead to severe reactions and consequences. This film with it's staggering earnings of 125 million dollars is different to your stereo-typical movie. There are no big monsters, no damsels in distress, just your everyday man with a BIG story. I would call this film though provoking, interesting and tense. There are many opinions as to whether this Paramount Production has a suitable ending, but mine would be yes, it does. I feel that often when watching films, if there is an undecided ending, the film becomes more personal to you because you can let yourself imagine the ending. Who knows if there would ever be a show like this in real life? Perhaps here would be, as culture becomes worse and people have less morals. Although the Truman Show is an individual and creative film, I think that perhaps the script leaves something to be desired. Maybe it could have delved deeper into what some of the actors were feeling but still, a very tense and gripping film. Jim Carrey's performance shows that he can act much better than most think, challenging himself with more diverse roles. Although some people believe Jim Carrey to be a comedy-only actor, in the film, you see a much more emotional side to his acting. The Truman Show has a surreal feel to it. Often the light seems too bright, the moon too perfect, or the clouds too fluffy. It really adds to the film, making it seem even more like a fake world than it already did. But to be honest, even though I still have some criticism about the Truman Show, I couldn't stop watching it! It's truly 'edge of your seat' stuff and there is never really a boring scene or a dull moment.

Astounding Cinema,"The Truman Show is cinema at its highest pinnacle- it's the sort of film that all others should be judged against. Though its pace is consistent, never reaching fever pitch, its concept is ground breaking and its storyline magnificent. Jim Carrey is Truman Burbank, an ordinary man, living in an ordinary world. At least that's how he defines his world, for unknown to him, he is the star of the world's most popular television show, 'The Truman Show', which has captured on film every second of his thirty year existence. Everyone he knows are actors, every situation that arises is perfectly choreographed. The idea behind The Truman Show is genius, as was the casting of Carrey in the title role. All too often criticised for his slapstick style in movies such as 'Ace Ventura' and 'Dumb and Dumber', Carrey puts on the performance of a lifetime as Burbank, whose life begins to collapse around him. Also of note are performances by Laura Linney as Truman's 'stage' wife who finds it increasingly difficult to cope with Truman's developing ambition to discover life beyond his manufactured world, and by Ed Harris as Christof, who has single-handedly created and moulded Truman's articifial world. The brilliance of The Truman Show is that it works on so many levels, and plays up to man's greatest fear: that his world is not so secure and perfect as it appears. The Truman Show is astounding cinema. See it. Be Thrilled. See it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A brilliantly thoughtful movie,"A transfixing mind-boggling production. Truman Burbank lives in picture-perfect Seahaven. Everything is seemingly immaculate. What he doesn't know is that every moment and aspect of his life is set up and being watched and scrutinized. His entire life is being documented on secret little cameras everywhere and on almost everyone he meets. His perfect world is a television show running 24/7 and being watched by billions. The connotative language throughout the deeper parts was absolutely moving. It made the watcher think about what it would be like for them if they were in that situation and feel horrible for Truman. The idea of media control is still in today's society. We are starting to see some debate over the way the media manipulates public opinion. It reflected perfectly how amoral and invasive our culture industry is becoming. At the time the movie was produced the world was just beginning to see reality television and today it's everywhere and has progressed so much from even the movie. It in under the assumption of being another hilarious Jim Carrey comedy but turned out to be a thought-provoking and rewarding film that it is. The inflation of the idea of the power abuse of the media was big. The morals and the point of the film wasn't overwhelmingly beaten into you. The final scene is a much anticipated glorious end to a great movie. Its nice to have a movie make you think rather than brainlessly watching another reality TV show.

A powerful allegory for the condition of so many people,"The concept of The Truman Show itself is fascinating, thought-provoking, and, at times, haunting. The film revolves around Truman, a man who unknowingly lives his entire life as the star of a 24/7 reality show, all while the world around him is fabricated. As Truman slowly begins to sense that something isn't quite right, the film takes us on a journey of self-discovery, questioning the nature of free will, privacy, and the limits of control.What really struck me, though, was how the film serves as a powerful allegory for the condition of so many people feeling trapped in their lives, unable to break free from societal expectations, routines, or the search for a deeper meaning. Truman's desire to escape his confined world resonates deeply. His search for truth and growth-both physically and emotionally-is a reflection of how many of us feel at some point in our lives: suffocated by a system, yearning for authenticity, and looking for the courage to step into the unknown.The Truman Show masterfully weaves together elements of social commentary, philosophy, and emotional depth, all while delivering a film that is both entertaining and introspective. It's a rare gem that makes you laugh, question, and reflect all at once. Carrey's performance is at the heart of this experience, and it's a testament to his versatility as an actor. Known for his comedic brilliance, Carrey's portrayal of Truman Burbank is a revelation. His range is so much deeper than the slapstick roles he's often associated with, and it was genuinely surprising to see him tackle such a nuanced and serious role. Carrey's ability to balance vulnerability, confusion, and the dawning realization of his reality is nothing short of captivating.

Certainly, the plot line concept is a reversal of the sad US shock/chat shows with a twist of sci-fi.In this case the ""prisoner"", Truman, is unwittingly exposing his (sanitised) private life on 24 hour TV, and is happily trapped in a safe world until he actually finds out that he is trapped.But that's it really - the film is then plotted as a comic realisation of this concept with no further depth at all. It dips deeply into the American sugary sentiment pool,  and is a vehicle tailored for Jim Carrey - an opportunity that he does not waste to be less ""goofy"".Don't worry however, everything is handed to you on a plate in an explanatory section in the middle of the film, just in case you are a little confused. It's as sinister as a choc chip cookie.So - entertaining, enjoyable, well produced - but leave it there! It will run and run on US cable for years to come.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
We are all believers,"What's great about this film is that although ostensibly it's about society's obsession with TV and voyeurism, the influences appear to be things like 1984, The Prisoner, and even man's attempt at spirituality. There's a little bit of Truman in all of us - seriously, how much freedom do we really have? Don't you ever feel like you have no control, and wonder if there is someone out there plotting your destiny?A clever film indeed, if only because it raises issues and encourages us to ask questions. Also beautifully played - for the most part straight - by Carrey. Natascha McElhone is wonderful if under-used. Harris is surprisingly good as the self-appointed creator (of what, exactly - in his mind?!) Original, inspiring, warm and funny.

It was fun yet scary at the same time.. looking everywhere for cameras and asking my friends if they're actually actors... oh goodness that was a simpler time of life :)
enough with that now let's talk about the movie!This 1998 masterpiece has Truman Burbank played by none other than the brilliant Jim Carrey, Jim (at the time) didn't do a lot of serious acting roles so seeing him on screen like this really made an impact! From start to finish i sat on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens to the lovable main character Truman and what'll he do next! This movie could be considered emotional because of the astonishing journey Truman goes through, however it glides more into the drama or sci-fi movie category according to Google, this fantastic movie was nominated for 3 Oscars, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor.

"Great humor, greater discussion","The Truman Show is a satirical film that represents the craze of ""reality"" television and the media's manipulation of society. Though the film was made over 18 years ago, it is still very relevant today. In a giant domed community, Truman Burbank is living a perfect life that revolves around him. There are cameras everywhere and everyone, including his loved ones, are actors. The only person who doesn't know his life is a television show is Truman. In our current society we are heavily influenced by media. Throughout the film you can draw many connections to the media's influence on our lives. The media influences what we believe and what we do with our lives. Perhaps we are all being controlled under a figurative dome which is being held up by the media. The Truman Show also targets ""reality"" television. As reality television continues to grow in popularity, (such as Keeping up with the Kardashians, The Real Housewives, Duck Dynasty, Jersey Shore) the movie attacks the connotation of ""reality"" in these shows. We believe that life can really be like what we see in television, even though life is far from what goes on in reality television.While I was young I had liked to think about the concept of what if my life was a television show. This made The Truman Show extremely enjoyable as it brought back those memories and truly showed this concept in action. The movie contains great humor along with a perfect example of dramatic irony, being that Truman is the only person that doesn't know his life is a reality TV show. Overall, the movie is very enjoyable as it has a dramatic plot full of humor and entertainment. However, this movie is far different than others as it requires far more thought about how society is being portrayed in the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Will Likely Be More Important in the Future,"""The Truman Show"" is one of those films that is good, not great, but will likely mean a lot more to the cinema in the future.  The film deals with a man (Jim Carrey) who has literally had his entire life scripted and filmed for a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week, and 365-days a year television station.  The creator (Ed Harris, in an Oscar-nominated role) controls everything in Truman's life and is a type of god figure.  Carrey slowly starts to realize that his near-perfect life is not at all what it seems and becomes bent on freeing himself from a personal prison which he has been in his entire life.  The screenplay and direction are insightful and overall excellent.  Carrey and Harris both give top flight performances and the overall creativity is second-to-none.  Much like ""Network"", ""The Truman Show"" will likely become more important with age.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

great movie a little bit cheesy and a bit overrated,I am not hater of this movie but some of the songs where bit bad in it I am not saying its not an awful movie but being that some of the songs where bit bad there some good songs in it. OK about the story its about guy who has beem taken care of some actors in this and he does not know its real and many people try to get in his way to stop him getting into other places as well. He trys to get out but fails he trys one more time to get out because in his teenage hold he find someone that he really loves and they took her way from him which is the fact he want to get out and find his true love that was the fact that made this movie really good not to bad not to stupid. I love the boat scene where he trys to get out which really good but and thats how movie should be. I know that some people disagree about this but I don't disagree about hating this movie.

"Thought Provoking, but Strangely Paced with Sudden Stops in the Story. Mishandled sense of darkness.","Jim Carrey is a difficult actor for me to love. His style of acting is definitely niche and not many films managed to utilise him appropriately. The Truman Shows manages somehow to overcome his manic tendencies and produce a more compelling, more loveable character. However the origins behind his character's likeability and positive outlook don't match the script he has been given, and as the film progresses we get very little real insight into what Truman is really thinking, and more importantly, feeling.The pacing is also questionable - the film somewhat just stops dead halfway through and Ed Harris's character really should have made a more subtle gradual introduction rather then spend an entire act with him just making an introduction that he should have had much earlier.Also starting the film with outlining its premise was a big mistake. The audience would have benefited greatly from sharing the unravelling of the mystery alongside Truman, making us feel more connected to him rather than feel like a co-conspirator. I found it difficult to derive the humour when the film shows a lot of dark psychological manipulation and in the end, attempted murder live on film witnessed by studio executives.Much like original, slice of life movies, they appeal greatly to those willing to stretch their imagination, but for those really needing convincing of the world, and more importantly the inner thoughts of its main character, the film fails hard.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

At the end of this movie, Truman chose to step out of the show and enter into the real world. Is this a better choice for him? As a audience, I may think ok Truman has suceed, he get rid of the control of the company. But the reality is, the world ouside even much darker than the show. The show is designed by Truman so he won't get real hurt in it. The reality is fair and everyone will get hurt by it. I knew the core of life is to experience, to feel and to get injured.

MISSED OPPORTUNITIES,"The famous Truman Show, after postponing for a long time, I finally decided to watch it. My expectations were high, since i have seen some edits and reviews, all titled as the greatest movie, that is capable of changing your life. Well, because I am into philosophy and psychology i was very excited to dive into the movie. I admit, idea is brilliant, story is interesting and last scene is on point. BUT there huge sense of discomfort
and emptiness, which i get, comes from the fact that whole world is just pretending to be who they aren't, everything is fake and yeah, emptiness is what they create, i still feel, that there should have been more personality to the creator of the TV show, there should have been better reasoning for creating this tremendous project. Movie had a big potential and i feel disappointed to learn that it was wasted. Idea of constantly being watched, being entertainment for others while having no real life or relationships, could have been more evolved. I mean, WHAT IF creator grew up thinking, that he was not in charge of his life, people made decisions for him and had a theory that life was a simulation, so he wanted to become ruler of someone else's life. My point is, we need some backstory. AND main character could have had more emotions to itself!That's all i wanted to say.( I emphasized things i thought movie lacked and reasons i did not give that last two points)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Foreshadowing our Future as Humans,"This film was really good and it's a bit scary to watch it today with how our species has progressed. Truman wants nothing more than to escape the island, find his girl, and just live life but feels like he can't make the break and that he feels watched. It feels opposite today where we need to film everything we do, post every update of our lives, etc. I believe a film as strong as this is something we all need to sit back and enjoy. Look how crazy this concept was in the 90's. Now it's what most of us desire instead of trying to break free and just live life.

His ever charismatic but very human performance beautifully disguises the underlying themes of psychological damage and torture that run through the film. Even when awful characters are manipulating him, the jaunty music of the fake TV show is usually playing, keeping the narrative feeling light when underneath it is anything but.The more you watch the film, the more you realise its horrific undertones and how brilliantly ahead of its time it was in predicting reality television and the vapid nature of consumerism surrounding it.A testament to the talents of Peter Weir, The Truman Show holds up as a shining example of intelligent tragic comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Interesting TV show in a movie.,"The Truman Show is a TV show in a movie, starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank who lives in a utopia-type town, where he is unaware that his life is a T.V. show and those around him are ""actors"" within the show.This movie starts off very slow and does not gain any traction until almost toward the middle of the middle, where Truman begins to realize that there is something wrong with the life he is living in. That is where things gain steam and become more exciting as the film progresses.Jim Carrey's acting was pretty good, as is Natascha McElhone, the actress who plays Carrey's love interest. Much of the other cast members acted too carefree and theatrical, which rendered them somewhat annoying. It was also distressing to see all of the characters in on this conspiracy of exploiting Truman's life in worldwide broad-casted T.V. show, making you root for Truman to outsmart the conspirators and escape the ""fake"" life they have envisioned for him.This movie sends a message that life is not simple and there is no such thing as a perfect world. Despite all the problems and turmoil in the world, there is nothing greater than your own freedom to live your life and make your own choices.Again, the movie takes quite a long while to gain any momentum, and Burkhard von Dallwitz's music score for the film seemed very out of place for the story.

A uniquely genuine masterpiece,"Jim Carrey proves to the world that he can do a whole lot more than talk out of his ass, with this brilliantly astonishing performance. He plays Truman Burbank, a normal white collar suburbanite who works in real estate and leads a simple normal life. However, his life is anything but normal. From the moment of his birth, his entire life has been shown on television live and unedited to an audience around the world, the island he lives on is a gigantic sound stage, with close to 5000 cameras, and with the great wall of China is one of two man made structures still visible from space, his wife, best friend, the people he works with, and the people he sees everyday are all just actors. The most amazing thing about this innovative premise is the fact that Truman is completely unaware of all of this. The premise of this film is how he finds out about the reality of his life, and how to escape this prison.The Truman Show is Peter Weir's finest film ever, and the always excellent Ed Harris who plays The Truman Show director, Christof gives his best performance since Glengarry Glen Ross. Jim Carrey gave the best performance that I have seen in 1998, and Laura Linney  provided some comic relief as an over acting actress playing Truman's wife. As the #2 film of 1998 (next to Saving Private Ryan), and one of the 10 greatest films of the 1990's, The Truman Show ranks as one of my top 30 favorite films of all time. This is a film that truly deserves a 5 star rating. Comedy, drama, romance, and even suspense, this film as something for everyone, and is one of those rare films that has something for everyone, it even has an important moral message behind it. The fact that life is too sacred and precious to be entertainment for someone else.This is one of the most uniquely original motion pictures that I have seen in a long time. Absolutely not to be missed by anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent, indeed!","It is actually a surprise to me that Jim Carrey could perform so well. I have missed both ""Man on the Moon"" and  ""The Truman show"" when released... missed on purpose, actually:   After a friend of mine dragged me into a theater to watch ""Dumb and Dumber""... well, you know the feeling.  I couldn't bear to watch this guy again.  I was wrong, oh I was wrong. I rented the film on video, mostly because of the director.  Peter Weir has never been one of my favorites, but surely the man knows how to make a good film. Well, actually after watching ""The Truman Show"" Peter Weir is just a step away of becoming one of my favorites. It is a brilliant film.  Great concept, intelligent script, great performances.  And the greatest of them - surprise! - Jim Carrey's Truman !Astounding , how a man can do this to himself.  I mean, acting as the ""Dumb"" (or the ""Dumber""???) and Ace Ventura etc and then... unfolding a unique talent, not only once but twice - ""Man on the moon"" is another strong recommendation. If you haven't seen this film... do it now.  It is worth a lot more than the 103 minutes of your time it is asking... a whole lot more!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One Great Movie,"The Truman Show is not a comedy, although that's where I found it at my local video store.  It's a difficult film to categorize; part science fiction, part social satire, part romance.  One thing I can say is that it's a masterpiece of storytelling and film-making.

In ""The Truman Show"" it is all about Truman Burbank(Jim Carrey), who ist the main character of the famous TV Show ""Truman Show"". Truman lives in a world of lies, all people around him are actors. The mastermind behind this show Christof (Ed Harris) tries everything to keep Truman in the artificial town Seahaven, but some mistakes of the regie bring Truman to the idea to leave the town in an exciting final of the film.Peter Weir did a great job with this film. It is an excellent balance between a comedy and a drama. Jim Carrey plays Truman in a silly way, what sometimes can be quite annoying. You can follow the story of the film easily. This fact is, especially when you watch this film with children, very beneficial.I give this film 9/10 because it is great entertaining for the whole family and the story and the actors are very good. I would definitely recommend this film, because it has a strong message, which make you think about the reality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Great Movie!,"I finally saw ""The Truman Show"" and I absolutely loved it. It happens often that directors have great idea but struggle to implement it well. But not in this case.

Are we prisoners of our own reality?,"This movie has affected me deeply. I haven't felt this compelled to break away from my own reality since reading 1984 for the first time. The Truman Show is my favorite of Jim Carey's movies. A touching tale and one that makes you ask the age old question ""how would you act if cameras were on you 24/7."" I dare say I would hate to see what would be on my television show. Regardless, Jim Carrey delivers a perfect performance and I recommend this to everyone and anyone.

The Truman Show - A Brilliant Concept with a Flat Execution,"The film captivates with its unique idea - the protagonist lives in a world where things are not quite what they seem. It's a thought-provoking story about freedom, control, and the boundaries of reality.However, the execution leaves mixed impressions. Despite its intriguing concept, the pacing feels too slow, and some moments drag on. The emotional intensity is lacking at times, and the main character could have been explored more deeply. Jim Carrey delivers a solid performance in an unusual role for him, but at times, he seems too restrained.Overall, the film stands out for its originality, but its execution could have been more engaging.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Truman Show by Naomi,"The Truman Show Have you ever wondered 'what if my life is actually a film?' Well, for Truman Burbank, that thought is a reality.... As the camera starts rolling and our 103 minute journey begins, we meet Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a man who has been filmed since the day he was born. He lives in a made-up world with a made-up family in a made-up town full of actors. Meryl (Truman's wife) is an advertising 'perfect' wife as far as the eye can see. Many other reviews that I have read of this film (I do my research you see), have praised Laura Linney (Meryl) as a star actress. While the part is played to perfection, the fake demeanour is so obvious to viewers and so unclear to the gullible character of Truman. I however, find Meryl's character the only blemish in this film. I am not criticising Linney's acting skills, but the personality of her character. I find the fake and false charade grates on me and I find myself wanting to slap the practised-in-the-mirror smile right off her face. So while I can tell you the flaws of this film, I can also tell you its highlights. It's a funny, happy comedy in a sort of could-be-a-pantomime way. I liked it, I didn't love it, but it's a family film all the way through. My criticisms are trumped vaguely, by the staggering figure of $125 Million box-office takings (It started with a $60 Million budget). This film takes an unusual and unique approach to the family film market, no princesses or castles and while you could say it has a happy-ever-after ending, the cliff-hanger toned it down. It may not be the best film, it may not be the funniest but it was good. Kids will like it. 3 out of 5 Stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Truman Show,"93 minutes, USA (1998). In ""The Truman Show"" Truman Burbank ( Jim Carrey ) lives on a small island called Seahaven but what he doesn´t know is that it actually isn´t a island but a huge set fitted with 5,000 hidden cameras to broadcast his life worldwide on everyones TV. All the people he thinks to know are actually actors. The director of the show is Christof ( Ed Harris ). Truman´s dream is to find Sylvia ( Natascha McElhone) his true love but he can´t leave the island because of his fear of the sea. During the film Truman notices strange things happen in Seaheaven. He is starting to realise that his life is a huge lie.The film is very entertaining. The actors are well choosen and the storyline is easy to follow. I think it is a bit unrealistic that Truman never noticed the cameras around him. I still enjoined the film and would defenitely recommend watching this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The most unrealistically realistic movie,"First I admit that as an after-00s, I wasn't interested in this soooo much when I watched it at the first time with my dad, though he continuously iterated how good is that (well now I do believe that it literally means a lot to those who are born in 70s because 90s was their shining era, right) . But few years ago, my crush in high school set the Truman show poster( the one with Truman's laughing face on it) as his line profile, and I immediately rewatched it that night in order to discuss with him on the other day(yeh such a indecisive valley) but wow it turned out to be resonated af. I supposed that people who are a bit cynical and negative or who sometimes figures that life is a bi*th would feel related to Truman. We're all shackled by frames of social norms and standards, struggling with what I'm supposed to be, dominated by what I supposed to do. People unfriendly eyes and attention disturb us to be ourselves. Their unintentional comments hit the softest part of our hearts. All these make us live as performing an ever-lasting show, we'll never be satisfied with the suppressing and deceiving scenarios, and either are the audience, the public, the society.

Predicting the rise of reality TV,"In ""The Truman show"" Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives in the perfect 50s style town of Seahaven. Little does he know that he is the lead character in a reality soap and that all his fellow citizens are support actors.In the year that this film was released, nobody could guess how fast reality TV should become a reality. The predicting power in this respect is the most amazing aspect of this film and tends to squeeze other things to the background.This is a pitty because there is much to marvel at in this film.Think of the right balance between science fiction and comedy. It would also have been possible to make a pitchblack dystopia a la ""1984"" (1949, George Orwell) out of this storyThink also of the perfect timing of the strange events that sets the doubt in the mind of Truman Burbank into motion and makes the perfect town of Seahaven also a little weird.Ultimately Truman Burbanks wants to find out what the city of Seahaven really is about and tries to leave the city. Panic breaks out on the set of the reality show and all the support actors join in in a gigantic manhunt. At this point the movie did reminded me of the end of ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" (1956, Don Siegel), a flock of fake citizens hunting the only one left with real emotions.When Truman reaches the frontier of Seahaven, he must make a decision. Does he go for the freedom of the real world, or does he prefer the safety of the fake Seahaven with all its hidden camera's? After all a real village in the 50s didn't have hidden camara's, bit it did have social control!""The Truman show"" asks moral questions about different roles. About the director of the show, playing God in the life of Truman Burbanks. About the support characters, not being very honest to Truman. And ultimately ... about the viewers of the show, setting it all in motion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
High expectation,Although having had higher expectation as a result of the media-exposure it's a good movie. Except for The Mask the first movie in which I can appreciate Jim Carrey. Ed Harris shines as the dictatorial director(with a paternal twist in the end?). The special effects where very appealing and added strongly to the humorous scenes.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
What it could have been,"Imagine the film this wayLet's say the film is called ""Truman"" and it's about a guy who keeps finding things wrong with his world and begins to believe nothing is real.  It starts, WITHOUT an introduction to the ""Truman Show,"" and as far as the audience knows, there IS NO ""Truman Show.""  The story unfolds about a man trying to find something that's real, like the romance with that girl who was taken away.  He doesn't know why she was taken away and neither do we... you see where I'm going with this?  Now this would have been a tiresome narrative in such a long movie, so naturally, it would be very short, perhaps it would never be a full-length film.  The realization that his life is a television show would happen at the same time for him as the audience and it would be a great twist ending rather than what it is: a clever short-film idea stretched into a full length film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

That's a genius and kinda spooky concept.

The fantasy that you never thought of!,"The Truman Show is a fantasy film that was released back in 1998. The first thing that caught my attention was the concept of this film. The concept of this film was related to the influence of media in everyday life. The Truman Show is about a person called Truman Burbank who lives in a small island called Seahaven near the coast of Florida where nothing really happens. Everything in life almost perfect, but certain events of the past often disturb his feelings towards the life he lives. The sudden turn of events and suspicious happenings around him makes him more curious to discover the world he lives in. Therefore, Truman sets out on his voyage to unlock the mysterious happenings and seeks for the answers to his questions.The first person to be credited is story writer Andrew Niccol who also co-produced this film. His writing showed futuristic thinking and thought provoking ideas that were quite absent at that time zone. Director Peter Weir should be given a huge congratulation for taking up this story and delivering it in great fashion which entertaining, engaging, thought provoking and heartwarming at the end. The film starts in a slow pace as editing were quite sloppy and elevation of scenes which potentially confuses its viewers. As time went on, the introductory of characters and comic timing of the dialogues really pulled me into whole scenario of weird behaviors of each and every character in the film. The curiosity to know the answers to Truman's questions slowly crept into me and the only reason could be the ever relate-able Truman's character to real life and again, full credits had to go to Peter Weir for creating a great character that could gain our sympathy.The next thing which I was really impressed with is the dialogues of this film which was co-jointly written by Andrew Niccol and Peter Weir. The dialogues in the film really worked well with every character in the film especially in the comedy department that gave good laughs throughout the film. Coming to the backbone of this film, Jim Carrey who absolutely carried this film as his child. Jim Carrey lived as Truman in this film. The smartness, stupidity and curiosity were shown in his ever expressive face and the ambiance of his expressions could be felt throughout the film which made it a more amazing experience. Jim Carrey was the only actor that could pull off this role with such perfection. Hats off.Supporting casts in the film like Noah Emmerich and Ed Harris had important roles in the film and played them really well. The more important among them was Ed Harris' character in the film. A sense of seriousness enters the screen every time he shows up just because of his menacing and hard look throughout the film. The cast is roundly superb even if the majority of them are in minor roles. The cinematography of Peter Biziou was great all along, my favorites were the scenes at the sea and aerial shots at night. The editing of this film was good overall despite feeling slightly off place and sloppy at times. The only reason is the inconsistent screenplay of this film especially in the first hour. Some scenes were elevated in a slow pace which made the film a bit lengthy. This is the only drawback in this filmOverall, The Truman Show is a mind boggling futuristic piece of film making that is thought provoking and entertaining at the same time. It might not have won anything at the Academy Awards, but it certainly won hearts of millions watching it. This is one of those movies which is a classified classic, certainly worth watching a few times, hats off to the makers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Is this real life?,"It's shot in such a unique way that you can almost believe it's the real backstory of Jim Carrey.

"Great movie, but has inappropriate allegories.","It's difficult to add new positive comments to The Truman Show. I fully agree with the people who feel it has a strong script, superb art direction, beautiful music, very interesting ideas in the plot, extreme care in the details,... and, yes, Jim Carrey does a great performance, as well as all the actors.However, it suffers a sad weak point: I feel that the allegory of God through Christof (Ed Harris) -an allegory built not from the character name but from some events and scenes in the movie-, is very inappropriate. It's out of context, it happens just as a gag. It would be right if the movie portrayed Christof as someone who believes to be a god (which he does)... however, the movie does an effort going an step beyond, using some typical Christian-like imagery to establish the allegoric parallelism, looking like a God's caricature rather than Christof's.The Truman Show is a great movie. One of the best made movies I've seen in the last decade, despite its inappropriate allegories.I voted it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This review shows how The Truman Show shows satire,"The Truman Show is a very clear picture of what a satirical film represents. This satirical film represents how crazy a ""reality"" television show can be or set out to be. The Truman Show was made quite a bit ago but, it is still very relevant to today. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives in a community that is completely domed over. There is no leaving this community for Truman. Truman lives a life where everyone knows and revolves around him. Truman is not only a known person inside the domed community but also around the world. He is a star on a television show, The Truman Show, and he is the only one who has no idea about. There are over 3,000 cameras around town and everywhere that he goes. Every single individual in the dome are actors or actresses, even his family and close friends. The Truman Show is targeting what a lot of Americans are obsessed with, reality television. These include Keeping up with the Kardashians, Jersey Shore, Dance Moms, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and many more. What we think we would be able to have from a ""reality"" show, since it is ""real life and daily lives"", we will never be able to have. It seems to be that these so called ""reality shows"" are now beginning to be staged and no where near the real life they actually live behind the cameras. The Truman Show is a real reality show. Truman has no idea he is no camera and lives life normally doing his normal daily activities. This movie is very enjoyable with the dramatic plot and humor put into it. Although this movie is enjoyable, it does require more thought about how the society works and how it is portrayed in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Somebody help me, I'm being spontaneous!","Truman Burbank lives in the picture perfect town of Seahaven (An island completely surrounded by water as far as the I can see). He sells insurance, and his wife Meryl is a nurse. His buddy Marlon has been Truman's best friend since they were 7 yrs old, and every evening they go hang out by the shore at sunset and drink a beer.For the most part, Truman's life looks perfect from the outside looking in. Except Truman has a real desire to go out and see the world. The problem is that every time Truman tries to get close to leaving Seahaven, something gets in his way. It could be his fear of water, which stops him from getting on a ferry to the mainland,, or his fear of dogs who always block his way when he gets to the outskirts of town. Something always stops him from leaving.Lately Truman has noticed some very odd things happening in his day to day life in Seahaven. It seems like everywhere he goes people are always in sync. Like they keep repeating lines of motion and never stop. Like they've been choreographed or something. He notices it always seems like Meryl is speaking to someone other than him. What's going on in Truman's life?Answer - he's being watched by the whole world!I can't believe this came out 24 yrs ago!! I didn't like this when I went to see it.

About a man named Truman who has a great life but is not happy with it. He wants to figure out why he is unhappy.,"The Truman show was a very excellent representation of the things in life that people chase but cannot have. From the seemingly cliché lifestyle Truman lives, with friendly neighbors, a steady job, and even the typical adult look with his suit and briefcase, Truman lives the life that the average American in the 80s would want to have, and there is nothing wrong with his life at all. But is his life really perfect? Since meeting his first love, nothing in his life has seemed to be quite the same, and he wants to know why. This movie is a perfectly executed film about how the perfect life is unachievable, but his life may not be as great as everyone seems to think.The film was very well done. A few of the things that the movie did well were the way that it gave the main character, Truman, personality with almost everything he did, whether it be his personality quirks or the very catchy things he says, almost every part of Truman is extremely memorable. All of the characters meshed well, and had very good acting to go along with it. Despite being a funny twist on a problem that society faces, being the media and the issues with it, you do not really find yourself laughing at this movie. It takes a tone that really drags you into the thought processes and feelings of Truman using dark humor which is hard to catch onto.Going with the actual movie and its plot, many small things fit the movie perfectly to add to the overall experience, such as the soundtrack, and make the movie really great. The greatest part of the film is one that you will really feel upon seeing it, and it is the ending (no spoilers). It was perfectly executed and left a huge lasting impression on me after seeing the film, wishing that the movie was not yet over.Overall, the movie was well done, with a genius way of presenting a satire.

"Interesting movie, even more interesting meaning","The Truman show is a thought-provoking film with a deeper analyzation of the coming digital age. In the film Truman seems like a typical man with an indefectible lifestyle. However, what soon comes to follow as a shock for Truman is that most of his life is a set-up and he is the star of a reality t.v. show. Truman's suspicions starts as a plethora of deplorable actions from the crew occur; from common mess-ups to breaks in character. He soon realizes that this is not the life he wants to lead and that there's something more than SeaHaven: the truth. One of the more interesting aspects of the movie is the fact that it is actually a very satirical piece. The film calls to notice media manipulation, it inflates the concept and uses a blame by praise to scrutinize the issue. If you do watch this I'd personally suggest actually looking into and interpreting the deeper meaning rather than just watching the movie without a thought. If you are more into Carrey's funnier movies only manufactured for laughs then I wouldn't suggest this in consideration of the fact that it hits closer to sci-fi, drama and is a lot more than just a comedy.

Laura Linney at her best!,"A few months ago,before the release of the Truman Show,I read reviews that acclaimed the film as the most interesting and brilliant film ever done by Hollywood.I thought that those reviews were really impressive,after all,to receive the label of one of the greatests films ever done,certainly the story should have been very well related in the screen and the cast should have helped a lot.The names in the cast didn't impress me:I've never liked Jim Carrey,Ed Harris was a good but not brilliant actor,and they also had a young actress who worked in Congo and who I have already seen before in smaller roles,like in Dave.Her name was Laura Linney.But I admired a lot Peter Weir,and when I knew he was the director,I concluded that,well,the film could be what the critics were saying and writing.He had already done one striking movie,Fearless.I watched the Truman Show three times,but not for thinking that the film was a masterful piece of storytelling.I agree that we're not talking about a horrible movie,but also the film isn't excellent.We have here a good movie,with good moments,but,when analyzed conjointly,doesn't compensate.It is just another big and expensive box-office attraction that tries to be original and innovate,but tied up into the big studio's system of making movie in a commercial sense,it  ends up being the kind of movie Peter Weir wanted to avoid.He wasted the possibility of constructing an unforgettable drama,and made a weak comedy.I watched it three times because I saw a magisterial interpretation that came from I less expected:Laura Linney.As Jim Carrey's wife,she created a memorable character,always with a giant smile engraved on her face.She should be nominated as best supporting actress and she should take the Oscar home.She builds her character as a woman who,despite her beauty,her caress devoted to her husband and her impressive smile,hides the truth from him,sustains him under her control,involves him with her personality,fights to make him give away his suspecions,but,gradually,begins to fell compassion for him.Laura Linney managed a smiling woman into the most astonishing character I've seen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The first time I ever saw this movie I actually dozed off but decided to watch it again and I am extremely happy I did because this movie was so well tought.Im not too high on reality tv anymore because there is so many and getting sick of it but the Truman Show probably started all this reality tv. I would be very curious to see if they did do something like this in real life I would for sure watch it out of curiosity. I saw a few movies saying this was a very unrealisic movie and it sucked because of it well it was meant to be that way and what lord of the rings and harry potter are fictional.Anyways great movie Carrey at his best and Weir incredible director.10/10,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A sad reality,"I've been watching Jim Carrey movies all my life. It was about time I actually made it to this one. This movie really tells us a lot about the culture that humans have created through television. And today we live a a work one step closer to something as truly scary as this movie was. A twitch.tv streamer Ludwig has been trapped in a currently month long live stream I'm sure if anyone sees this in the future you can look this up. I knew about the basic plot of this movie before today of course and after watching Ludwig's stream and now being able to compare it to this movie, I am truly horrified. To know that there are people out there willing to put up their lives like this, and they always have the choice to stop. How long before we have a Truman show of our own? A masterpiece of a movie. And a scary reality of what society could possibly be capable of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Perfect for its time,"The Truman Show finds a good balance between quirky satire and Hollywood blockbuster drama. It is indeed a well-balanced and technically flawless film. It came out at the right time and gained instant critical acclaim thanks to its prophetic and thought-provoking idea. While the premise is indeed inspiring for its time, the plot development is so out of focus, and writing could have been way sharper. It falls flat and even fails at making a point in the end. It's a pity because it could have been potentially a great movie, but it just ends up being just a good comedy. I need to give credit to Jim Carrey for being bearable for once. He actually blends very well into the goofy soap opera atmosphere of the show.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Truman show. A classic!!,"This movie has one of the most original stories I've ever seen, I mean, don't you ever feel like someone is watching on secret? Well the answer is up to you, but in my case, i really used to think that when I was a child.So this movie takes that idea of being watched to another level, now there's a guy that is a super star in a reality show and he doesn't know.So if you haven't watched the film, try to watch it, you will enjoy it, I'm not lying, it's a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
All Of Life A TV Show?,"Peter Weir directed this comedy-drama that stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a seemingly ordinary and happily married man who lives in a nice town, with a nice job and friends, but grows increasingly suspicious that something is off, and it turns out he's right, as Truman is unknowingly the star of the world's biggest reality TV show, where everything has been scripted since he was a baby, even his family. Once aware of this, Truman tries to find a way out, while the show's creator and director Christof(played by Ed Harris) tries to keep a lid on the situation... Existentialist film works reasonably well, though this idea had been explored before on ""The Twilight Zone"". Still, this is an interesting and thought-provoking film regardless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
What is the cost of liberty?,"If I were in Truman's position, I would have gone mental; the idea that people from all over the world were keeping an eye on me 24 hours a day, seven days a week is enough to drive anybody insane.Now coming back to the movie, despite the oblique foreshadowing to what liberty truly is and what kind of value it holds to an individual, there is not much of a story here, it is rather character driven, and I'm sure that the majority of us (yes, that includes myself too) have tuned in just to witness Mr. Carrey flexing his thespian muscles, and indeed he's one incredible actor, who could fit himself so well in both comedic and serious roles, somebody I will never get tired of seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Jim Carrey on TV to all the world, but not overdoing it.","I liked this movie - firstly, because of the innovative idea behind it; secondly, because I liked watching Jim Carrey without all the monstrous gestures. The role of the director of the show had rather nice god-like overtones, and Truman also has a rather interestingly horrible wife...",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Old but Gold,"The Truman show was an interesting movie with a good, initial plot.It was a great movie idea that made me look at life from a different perspective. It makes you think differently and expands your awareness and observations made. It was a simple idea , but effective. The film seemed like a dream. It seemed as though Truman was dreaming it all , which has an effect on the audience and makes them feel the same way.This film is quite old, therefore it doesn't seem that realistic. The island in which Truman was living was also quite unrealistic.To improve the movie, the Truman island could have been more realistic so it was harder for him to figure out that it was a show.It would have also helped if his day to day life was a bit more interesting to increase the action and tension levels. All in all, its a classic worth watching, despite the improvements that could be made to suit the more modern world, since this was made in 1998.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Truman Show,Funny and heartbreaking and wonderful. Possibly the best movie Carrey has ever been in. And I love a lot of Jim Carrey movies.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ed Harris did it again,"With ""The Game"" it is the most original film of the last Hollywood productions. A little weak end but a great work of Jim Carrey (nice change) and superb Ed Harris who will probably fight the Oscar with Edward Burns (Saving Private Ryan).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Better than I expected, but not as good as it could be.","This is the first Jim Carrey film where he actually diverged from his industry-standard role. There were enough Carrey-isms to be mildly annoying, but not enough to ruin a decent film. The plot was really well-constructed. The acting was really quite good, especially Truman's wife and best friend, and Ed Harris brilliant job as the show's creator. And I really liked the 'set effects' that were used...especially the 'errors' that popped up now and then. The ending was overdone (don't look now, it's Hollywood!!), but ignoring the last 20 minutes or so, it was a well done film, even if it did star Carrey (can't well be perfect, can it?) 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Nearly Carrey's best...,"Jim's greatest film is Dumb and Dumber-it cracks me up every time I watch it, but THE TRUMAN SHOW is one of his best. It's got a good cast, and interesting idea, and while there're many plotholes we can avoid this by just having fun at the movies. 3.5/5 stars--JOHN ULMER",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
What a life!,"Bizarre black comedy about a life lived from birth in front of a camera. Very good show, highly unusual, and well worth the price of admission. Has to be one of the oddest films I've ever seen: Carey gives his usual great performance - as did all the other players.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"

3.5 Stars,"Wonderful, imaginative film by Weir which focuses on Truman (Carrey), a man who has unknowingly lived his entire life as the star of a television show. The film covers his self-realization and delves most creatively into the religious parallels of his life and ours.  Carrey and supporting cast are excellent.  Weir shows a new creative style of filmmaking.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very good acting.,"In this movie Jim Carrey really shows that he can act, it´s a shame that he didn't get nominated. Both Carrey and Harris are perfect for this movie. But if your lookin´ for a fun comedy with Jim Carrey this isn't the movie you want.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"*The Truman Show* (1998) is a satirical drama directed by Peter Weir, starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a man who unknowingly lives his entire life on a reality TV show. His seemingly perfect world is actually a massive, controlled set, with every person in his life-friends, family, coworkers-being actors. As Truman begins to question his reality, he discovers clues that lead him to the truth and faces the choice between comfort in the familiar and the risk of true freedom. The film explores deep themes of media control, individual freedom, and the nature of reality.*The Truman Show* (1998) is a satirical drama directed by Peter Weir, starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a man who unknowingly lives his entire life on a reality TV show.

What's the fuss about?,"Jim Carrey's first attempt at drama has rewarded him with the Golden Globe and other awards but why is this? The film is boring and not really that interesting at all. I gave it a real chance though and tried not to be judgemental because I wanted to like it. But it did fall short of being a good, inventive movie. I thought Jim Carrey was good and so was Ed Harris and Laura Linney who was really good in her role. Despite the good acting, however, the film didn't quite reach my expectations and considerably fell short of being as excellent as everyone has been saying.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi"
