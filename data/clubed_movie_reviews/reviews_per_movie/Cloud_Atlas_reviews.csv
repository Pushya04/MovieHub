It's one of the most unique films I've ever seen.,"At nearly three hours long AND with a strange and difficult to comprehend plot, I can see exactly why ""Cloud Atlas"" lost a ton of money. In the States, it only brought in about $27,000,000---yet cost $100,000,000 to make. Much of the high cost is undoubtedly due to the cast--as the film boasts some famous and high-paid actors (including Tom Hanks and Halle Berry). It's a shame really, as the film does have some nice thing to offer...though overall, it was a problematic film to watch.The film consists of many different stories that all occur many different times in history (both in the past and very distant future). And, instead of being told in sequence, they are interlaced throughout the film. Why and what these plots all have to do with each other is something the audience is left to discover or create within themselves. However, many will get frustrated because for some time, the film doesn't give you a lot of clues at to what it all means.Despite being confusing and hard to grasp, the film has several things I loved. The stars of the film all play multiple roles and you'll see many of them in many stories. This provides the actors a chance to show off their talents--especially because many times they need to effect accents and/or play the opposite gender!! Yes, most of the main cast members play men AND women. Now this never would have worked if the acting was bad and the makeup was bad--but they really shine in this film. I was blown away by the makeup and thought several of the female characters were women when they weren't--it was that convincing. Additionally, while I was a bit cold about the overall film, I did appreciate how novel the movie was--very, very unique.So how might I have wanted the movie to be instead? Well, the many stories frustrated me because some of them were really, really compelling--and seeing only bits and pieces of them was annoying. I really wanted to see the whole story of many of the stories and could have seen the filmmakers making four or five films instead of just one. I particularly liked the stories about the replicant as well as the one where Hanks played a thug author (his acting was really nice here).My advice is that this film demands a viewer who is very, very patient, content with ambiguity and who wants to see a nice experimental film-- warts and all. Worth seeing but odd to say the least.NOTE: Parents, this film is NOT appropriate for kids. It clearly earns its R rating for some extremely graphic violence and sex. While the sex is sometimes steamy, the violence is what troubles me most for anyone crazy enough to let kids watch this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A powerful adaptation to a beautiful novel,"I was lucky enough to get last-minute tickets for this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. The theatre was packed and we were thrilled to see it although we did not entirely know what to expect. I had read a part of the book but never found time to finish it.The very opening of the film is mesmerizing and sets pace for all that is to follow. Six stories are intertwined to create one magical ride through time and space, as all stories move forward as one. To those who haven't read the book, I expect you might find the movie confusing at first. It seems unclear at the beginning (and for most of the first hour and a half at least) what all these characters have to do with one another. The end ties it up quite well, but for a three hour film, you might find you've spent a bit too long grasping at straws. Just let it go and enjoy what's before you; It will all come together in the end.An important aspect of the film is that actors play different characters throughout the film, finding themselves in different stories and eras. Often it works. The futuristic plot with Jim Sturgess is one I particularly enjoy. But sometimes, it feels like they're incorporated just a tad bit much. Tom Hanks' role in the editor's story seemed huge and important and first but it seemed we were supposed to forget about it. As I walked out of the theatre, I felt I had seen not only Cloud Atlas as a whole but a series of other films as well.I think maybe for a film such as this one, actors who weren't as known would have been better. It may have been easier to believe in all their different characters and forget who they were. But as far as their performances went, well they were great. Tom Hanks shines from the opening sequence to the very end. Halle Berry was adequate for the journalist and Hugh Grant... actually it seems he's playing himself in this one too. But the true star as always is Hugo Weaving. He steals the screen whenever he appears and is mesmerizing both as the devil or a regular assassin.The costumes and make up went from absolutely stunning (it may take you a few minutes to recognize actors sometimes) to somewhat distracting. Changing the race and age of an actor has got to be challenging but it's still hard to forget who they are. I expect the film will get an Oscar for this however, as I don't think anyone will beat them in this category before winter comes. The score was also incredibly powerful and beautiful and helped set the tone for the movie greatly.Cloud Atlas will take you anywhere and everywhere. It may surprise you by its sudden burst of violence, sometimes exaggerated and almost funny, sometimes cold and raw. You might cry at times, as the characters make choices and sacrifices. One story is particularly funny and had the theatre laughing quite often.All in all, Cloud Atlas is no ordinary film. It's a voyage that will take you to places you didn't expect. Don't try to understand it, just let yourself go and you'll find you understood what it was all about. If you're looking for a linear plot, then this film isn't for you. But if you want to experience something different, then by all means, buy a ticket for Cloud Atlas when it comes out. I know I'll be seeing it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Powerful Spectacle,"I didn't find it to be a mess at all, and it was certainly the best thing the Wachowskis have ever done. I'm not sure how the directing duties were distributed, so I'll uniformly praise Tom Tykwer as well.I haven't read the book, so I can't make any comparisons there, but I don't often leave a film adaptation wanting to read the novel afterwards, as I did after seeing this.Visually stunning, epic in scope, a strong score; the sort of film that you're constantly amazed was ever made and happy it was. Equal parts comedy, romance, thriller, and dystopian speculative fiction, it really is an astounding mix of disparate elements.The biggest overall failure was definitely some of the make-up effects - trying to turn Doona Bae into a believable red-headed Caucasian woman was simply distracting - but the overall art & sound design was incredible.If I could turn channels while watching TV and switch between stories and narratives as seamlessly and as deftly as the editing in Cloud Atlas, it would honestly be hard to go back to simply watching one show at a time.Truly a marvel of multitasking on so many levels. Great stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quite an achievement,"""Cloud Atlas"" is nearly three hours in length, but I wasn't bored for a minute. The film alternates between six very different stories quite seamlessly, creating an exhilarating experience. It's part sci-fi, part historical drama, part love story, part comedy. Any number of things could have gone wrong with the film. All the different genres it brings together might have failed to coherently mesh. But they did, and it's something to see.The film takes us on shipboard in the 1800s, where a young man forms an unlikely bond with a stowaway, a runaway slave. It tells the sensitive, melancholy story of a promising young composer in the 1930s – separated by prejudice and misfortune from his lover, a man named Sixsmith. It also brings us to 1973, where an intrepid reporter finds herself caught up in a web of murder and intrigue. In the present day, the film offers up the comedic tale of a publisher on the run from a gang of thugs. Plunging into the future, it shows a dystopian vision of Seoul, South Korea that is comparable to ""Blade Runner"" and a primitive post-apocalyptic Hawaii.Linking these stories together are the simple thematic elements of love, compassion, and a love for liberty. The correspondence between the composer Robert Frobisher and Sixsmith depicts the plain beauty of love as well as any film I have seen, as do tender moments between the central characters of the portion of the film set in the futuristic New Seoul. Even in the blatantly comic segment with Jim Broadbent as the publisher, a deep passion for freedom and human dignity shines through.All the actors do a great job in their multiple roles. You can care for Tom Hanks one moment as a villager in a future Hawaii, and then revile him in the next scene where he plays a truly despicable doctor. The best performances are given, however, by Doona Bae and Jim Broadbent. I think they surpass all the rest. Bae plays a ""fabricant"", a kind of clone designed to serve humanity. Her gradual awakening to her own self-worth, to the subjugation of herself and of her people, is beautifully and movingly conveyed. She is heartbreaking in this role. Broadbent is equally excellent as the publisher Cavendish. His expressive face and popping eyes are ideal for comedy – and he's hilarious. But he's more than that. Broadbent infuses the character with a sense of sorrow and weariness at key moments. Cavendish has depth, a history, regrets from his past. Broadbent brings all this out brilliantly without losing his comic touch.Everything in ""Cloud Atlas"" comes together to create a film I found thought-provoking and highly entertaining. I don't hesitate to recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A genre-breaking classic,"There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic that will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers, just like its predecessors by Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott. Despite the many questions I had in my mind when I left the theater and the moments during the film when I felt disappointed or confused, I knew this, and I have not stopped thinking about the movie and longing to be back in front of the screen.It is easy to criticize this movie as some have done for being overly ambitious, pandering to low taste, being too simple or too complex, with too few actors or too many, or even for celebrating revenge violence against professional critics who write negative reviews. They may all be correct, but these critics will still put themselves in the same category as those that warned audiences against 2001 or Blade Runner. The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach, its visual and acoustic impact, its mesmerizing flow and its completely ground-breaking storytelling, and movie goers will see it and feel it in their guts.It is a movie that is a product of our age of internet-driven universal knowledge and vision, and the freedom we have to travel the world and jump between ages, genres, images and identities at our will. It reminds us that we are human and that we can still hear our heart beat, if we listen.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Wachowskis join forces with Tom Tykwer and overhaul the meaning of the word Epic!,"Kudos to all the filmmakers for adapting this famously ""unfilmable"" novel in such an inventive way. There are SIX separate timelines that switch after every scene, but instead of the plot, the narrative continuity follows the theme of the film. Once you clue in to that overall theme, it is no longer confusing when the story jumps from a runaway slave in the 1800s to a post apocalyptic future battle between some of the last humans remaining on earth.All this audacious style and structure makes Cloud Atlas a curiosity to say the least, but the film is lifted to the realm of ""Masterpiece"" by the all-star ensemble cast. This impressive collection of actors fires off amazing performances like the Expendables 2 fires off high caliber bullets. I mean this will long be considered one of the greatest acting clinics ever filmed, and a high point in some already outstanding careers, as the end credits alone are astonishing to watch.Overall this is a movie that transcends the simple elements of stars and plots and special effects, and boldly assumes to take the cinema to another level of storytelling, much like Avatar took film to a new level of technology a few years ago. The ambition, the technical brilliance and the passion that was put into this film makes it one of the great epics of our time.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A Potentially Great Film Ruined By Poor Structure,"I never read the book, but was intrigued by this movie because I had heard the book was very good. I don't have as much time to read as I used to, so I watched it, sort of liked it but found it kind of tedious to get through due to all the jumping around from story to story. Seeing the different actors as different characters was more distracting than anything, and the film was paced too quickly allow the average viewer to pick up all the complexities and themes the author was likely trying to convey.In the end, I found that it had a couple of good and original story- lines (particularly the Escape from the Nursing home plot, and the gay composer plot was good) but I found the other stories to be of the mostly bland and formulaic sort we've seen many times before (ie. guy finds out slavery is bad, investigative reporter uncovers a plot by an evil corporation, bladerunner/soilent green hybrid plot, and a fairly standard post-apocalyptic adventure story plot). While all of the story lines were entertaining, you never have enough time to become invested in each story or characters because the movie constantly jumped around between the six different plots. Yes, there are six different plots in this two and half hour movie, and therein lies there problem.After having watched the movie, I looked up the plot of the book because I was curious to see how the author handled the story. According to Wikipedia, In the book:""Each tale is revealed to be a story that is read (or observed) by the main character in the next. The first five stories are interrupted at a key moment. After the sixth story, the other five stories are returned to and closed, in reverse chronological order, and each ends with the main character reading or observing the chronologically previous work in the chain. Eventually, readers end where they started, with Adam Ewing in the nineteenth century South Pacific. Each story contains a document, movie or tradition that also appears in a previous story. It shows how history not only repeats itself, but also connects to people in all time periods and places.""For the life of me, I can't figure out why the directors didn't structure the movie this way. It would have worked far better. The audience would have been able to become more immersed in each story- line, and the connections between each plot would have been more apparent. As it stands, upon one viewing, it seems more like a mess that tries too hard to be clever. So then you might say ""you have to watch it more than once to 'get it'"". I don't want to have to watch a film more than once ""get it"". I paid close attention the first time. I'd rather spend my time doing something other than watching an average movie more than once. It's a sign of poor story telling if you make it so that you have to watch a film more than once in order to ""get it"".This film could have been so much better if it was structured like the book and took its time to actually tell the stories and develop the characters. Instead it was paced like an action movie. I felt like I was watching Inception at times (another annoying film that you ""had to watch more than once in order to 'get it'""). Perhaps it was structured this way due to a limited running time. But why even attempt to merge six completely different stories into a single movie in the first place? It would lend itself much better to a mini-series. Game of Thrones is the perfect example of a book adaptation that proved to be an immense success when told at a television show's pace. I feel like this movie would have benefited greatly if it was separated episodically like that.Before you respond to this with elitist statements like: ""I got it first watch, you're just too dumb to understand catch all the intricacies,"" or ""the average viewer is a moron, that's why they need all the themes and messages spoon fed to them. This film treats the audience like it has intelligence and allows to viewer to draw their own conclusions."" I just want to pre-emptively say ""no you're wrong"". The reason I think this film was a disappointment was precisely because it treated the audience like morons who just wanted to see fast paced action with no deep exploration of the themes or characters. It didn't give the audience a chance to think about any of the themes because it was too busy rapidly jumping between story-lines focusing more on action scenes rather than any sort character development. Supposedly the Tom Hanks soul goes through a whole redemption arc that I never caught because the film never actually focused on it. I haven't even read the book, yet, on first viewing, it felt like none of the major themes of the book were explored with any sort of depth. It's a shame because it seems like the book is a good one worth reading. I'm probably not going to read it now though since the movie spoiled the plots for me.That being said, I would say this film is worth a redbox rental at least. It has some good acting and some nice cinematography and special effects. It looks very pretty. The action is also quite good, although I wish there was a little less focus on the action, and more of a focus on the philosophical themes and characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the Most Interesting Experiences Ever,"This is one of those experiences that defy explanation (similar to the one I had watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey""). I had read the book a year before and if you had asked me to pick a book that could never be made into a movie, I would have easily selected this. How wrong I was. This masterful concoction kept me intrigued for nearly three hours and yet I'm still trying to figure things out. I agree with the late Roger Ebert that even with two or three viewings, I am still trying to put this all together. It doesn't matter. It's like looking at a painting on repeated visits to a museum, maybe the works of Breughel or Bosch. There are some themes that run through the multiple characters' existences, touching on oppression and endurance of the human soul. The performances are wonderful. I would imagine that the likes of Tom Hanks must have been in heaven, extending their acting chops. I need to watch the film again, but for now will leave it to those more intellectually astute to look at the implications of the tenets of this film. I would recommend it as an experience everyone should have.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good unique movie but...,"Extremely ambitious film. The way it combines six different stories from different time periods, and here we have different characters as the actors play different roles, a really ambitious, big and expensive project. I can freely say that this is a unique film, truly special, I can understand those who love the film, but also those who do not like it. Although it lasts a full three hours, I was not bored at any point, which is a great thing. The actors did a great job, visually the film is beautiful, and I even like that it requires increased attention while watching. However, I got the impression that there were too many stories and characters and I couldn't connect everything, that is, not everything made sense to me. A lot of it seemed superfluous to me and how the film wouldn't have lost much if some things had been cut. Perhaps this film falls into a special category, and that is that it needs to be watched multiple times in order to be able to understand everything.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overly Ambitious and Jumbled,"The fact that you are interested in watching this film and that it was even made should be heralded as a collective success, because Cloud Atlas is a thought provoking film. Your personal and collective philosophies will be challenged, and your emotions will be engaged. Each of the six stories address mankind's struggle against seemingly inexorable systems/oppressors, and resolve that love can help us overcome the worst hell. Cloud Atlas also requires that you have a super-trained memory because the six story lines are jumbled and unnaturally presented. I don't mind a thinking man's movie, just as long as my brain doesn't attempt to shut down after being exhausted by the editor's brutal film gymnastics.Three of Cloud Atlas' story lines are wildly entertaining. That also means that three are also lacking. If you are willing to accept that you may have to either take a notepad with you to keep track of the story lines and trudge through some uninspired acting (sometimes Hanks & Berry are flat), or commit yourself ahead of time to watch this film twice, then go out and purchase your ticket. Otherwise, wait for the film to come out on Netflix.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A soul's odyssey,"Cloud Atlas is unlike its contemporaries at the multiplex. It tells a big story in an engaging, difficult fashion. It has big names and a big budget. But it also is thematically dense it wants to tell you something through plot, characters, dialogue and symbols. Cloud Atlas is also thankfully a very enjoyable film, much longer and denser than much of what is available today. ""Ambition"" defines this film.In just under 3 hours, six radically different stories are told, and they appeal to a broad audience: a 19th century tale of unlikely brotherhood, the letters of a gay composer to his partner in the 1930's, a San Francisco- set conspiracy in the 70's, A hilarious account of an old publisher's woes. A Blade Runner-esque clone's struggle for freedom, and the survival of a tribe after 'The Fall'. Genre conventions are toppled, as these stories with different tones are juggled in short intervals, leading from comedic highs to shocking drama in minutes.But as with the characters, these plots are connected thematically, and clever wordplay and visual imagery links the stories, such as the end of a monologue referencing ""the gates of Hell"" and cutting to a shot of the gates of a building that, for Cavendish at least, is the gates of Hell. Each of the stories has strengths, a few have faults, but together the medley is incredible.I found that while the earliest two stories began slowly and plainly, they developed very well and provided fantastic drama, especially the 1849 story. The Nuclear thriller was strong, Halle Berry is great and there are some real twists, and I also loved the 'Dirty Harry' and 'China Syndrome' vibes, but comedy bled into it from the 2012 story which diminished the climax. The 2012 story is hilarious, and its first scene is a standout; Tom Hanks is incredible as Dermot Hoggins. Although while the story is interesting, it doesn't fit quite so well thematically- it's almost too light. Listening to the 'Cloud Atlas Sextet' fits with all the stories, but can't resonate with Cavendish's. The future Korea is visually stunning and communicates its themes well, certainly the darkest plot, but the action can get over the top (Yes, I know who directed this) and there are some horrible clichés. But that scene of horrendous dialogue, the weakest in the film, can't derail a great piece. Lastly is the bleak, Hawaii- set post-apocalyptic story. It was my favourite, possibly because I'm a sucker for anything involving apocalypse. But Hanks and Berry are fantastic again, the barbarians are menacing and scary, and the story is cool. It also concludes the film perfectly.I've only talked about the plot! The actors really steal the show. In the credits, each actor's name is placed with a clip of every one of their characters everyone in the theatre stopped and stayed. People play characters you had no idea they played. A few highlights: Sturgess' lawyer and the slave Autua, Frobisher, Hugh Grant's sexist nuclear boss, Cavendish and Hanks' Hoggins. Doona Bae as Somni and Hugo Weaving's ""Old Georgie"" round it out- the latter is truly a demon. Much credit has to go to the makeup, literally making actors disappear into their roles. There is a huge number of transsexual and even race-bridging roles- it's worthy of note that Lana Wachowski was at one point Larry Wachowski. Also deserving of praise, and possibly Oscars is the large scale visual effects that cover hundreds of years and look so believable. Sound quality is top-notch as well, listening to Old Georgie is chilling, as is the vision of Korean diners, and well... the whole future.But all this plot serves a purpose, and Cloud Atlas intends to tell you things. Freedom is possibly the biggest theme, as well as the idea that our actions affect others greatly throughout time: we're part of a large human network. Really though there's so much to talk about you should just see the film. There are small stumbles every so often, but the structure hides them very well. No one story takes more time than others, no one character takes more time than others, and the structure and pacing drives the film forward briskly. It's a shame this film hasn't been better received commercially, because it's a phenomenal achievement, interesting sci-fi and drama, and as of now, the best film I've seen in 2012. 8.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Like flipping channels for 3 hours.,"A grandiose production and stellar cast doesn't help this overly ambitious mix come together in a coherent movie. The series of different stories isn't set up well in the beginning so it feels confusing for a while. Then when they sort of come together it isn't clever or convincing. Maybe this story was unfilmable. It just felt like a mix of bad movies shredded and mixed up together. It tries to have a common theme about standing up to oppression of some sort or other via corporate corruption, musical composition, the slave trade, science fiction etc but in the end it wasn't worth the effort.The white actors acting as Asian and vice versa are distractingly comical although I understand there is a reason for it.It's easy to see why it wasn't a box office success and didn't receive any major nominations.Skip it.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wow - movie of the year.  A must see!,"The last time I felt like this after seeing a movie was when I saw ""Inception"" on opening night. I realized I was seeming something that was different, creative, and classic.Cloud Atlas is an amazing piece of film. Even the harshest of critics cannot say that this film is not ambitious. But I think that 99% of the people that see this film will appreciate it. I'm NOT one who tends to like films that are overly ""artistic"" (I hated ""Tree of Life"", for example). But while the overall message of the film is hard to put into words, it is easy to understand. The film is very watchable, and the nearly 3 hour length seems to fly by. The stories are sharply written, and for those who are afraid of getting ""lost"" while viewing, no worries ... you'll enjoy seeing clues that link the stories, but even if you miss the clues you still will see a story that is well explained and easier to consume than an experimental art film.I am absolutely shocked that the reviews from the ""experts"" have not been more favorable, and the lack of box office sales is a crime.

Quite the Epic,"My wife and I were able to see an advanced showing of Cloud Atlas last night at The Chicago International Film Festival. I will say that I was thrilled to see this movie from the moment I saw the initial trailer release. I am a huge fan of movies that are epic in nature and are rather daring by taking on the task of time lines that may span a millennia.I will not provide any spoilers but I will say that the film is truly grand in scope and as you may have deduced from the trailer, the film time span passes through hundreds of years and includes many characters and story lines that are interwoven or overlap.I cannot say enough about the performances in the film. From top to bottom, everyone displays amazing performances. Hugo Weaving obviously is a show stopper in several scenes. The make-up and costume design will throw even the seasoned film-goer off as the transitions made by these characters are nothing short of spectacular. I cannot see another film coming close to being in the same category for the Oscar in Costume and Make-Up.The visuals and the score of the movie were the biggest takeaways for me. There were moments that reminded me of Blade Runner mixed with Out of Africa. There are a large number of stories within the film, some large and some small, but many strong enough to be individual films themselves. That being said with the long running time of the film, almost 3 hours, coupled with the multitude of story lines and the very numerous edits, the film can be a daunting task for even a seasoned viewer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fighting to pay close attention to every detail to the first hour of the film to understand what was happening. The first 10 minutes alone caused me some confusion.This film will not be for everyone due to its complexity and length, but for those who are true fans of films this epic in nature will truly appreciate the film. I very much look forward to another viewing of the film and encourage everyone to see the film at least once.Cheers",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Daring and quite impressive,"""Impressive"". That's the best description I could come up with after being asked by my brother and sister-in-law about my thoughts on Cloud Atlas immediately following the film's second-ever public screening we'd just attended. Not a very incisive assessment, I'll grant you, but my head was still spinning as I tried to make sense of what I'd just witnessed over the film's jam-packed two hour and forty three minute running time. This may be one the most ambitious and epic films I've ever seen, demanding rapt attention from viewers as they're taken on an odyssey that spans the globe over 500 years and hopscotches between numerous interwoven story lines that incorporates just about every film genre available, featuring actors playing several different roles each. Cloud Atlas is based on British author David Mitchell's best-selling 2004 novel and was a huge challenge for the filmmakers to adapt and finance (its estimated budget of over $100 million also makes it the most expensive independent film ever made). The architects of this beautifully twisted madness are directors/writers/producers Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) and The Matrix's Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana (Lana was Larry until a gender transition that was completed about five years ago). The Wachowskis, notoriously press shy, were surprisingly on hand (along with Tykwer) to introduce the film's second screening the morning after its star-studded TIFF world premiere on September 8th at the Princess of Wales Theatre.A movie this expansive should have a massive cast, considering how many characters appear - not so in this case, though. Principle actors Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, and Xun Zhou each take on multiple roles that plays loose and fast with the actors' ages, races, and genders (Susan Sarandon, Keith David, James D'Arcy, and Doona Bae also have smaller roles). Having so many dimensions to explore with all of their characters must have been acting nirvana for this lot. For the most part, they pull off the various requirements of the roles, many of which require a significant amount of prosthetics and makeup. Several of the roles were so well disguised that I was completely clueless that a certain actor had played the role until the end credits visually made some of the big reveals (learning that Berry played the white Victorian housewife and Grant a war paint-layered native completely floored me). Sticking around until the end is an absolute necessity for Cloud Atlas - the oohs and ahhs from the sold-out audience as they discovered who actually played some of the parts was a wonderfully unique filmgoing experience for me. For all of the positive aspects that the race bending and gender bending idea brings to the film, there is the faint whiff of novelty attached to it. Things do get a little silly when you have Weaving seemingly playing an Asian character whose makeup produces more of a Vulcan look (which may have been intentional, as it's for a sci-fi sequence that takes place somewhere in the 2300s), as well as in full drag playing a Nurse Ratched-like character. The latter obviously has parallels to Lana Wachowski's own life and although the nurse character provides some decent laughs, I was a little hung up on how it seemed one of the character's main functions was to generate laughs purely based on the surreal sight of Weaving playing one truly ugly looking woman. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it.Weaving does provide one of Cloud Atlas' most memorable roles, as the seriously creepy Old Georgie, who terrorizes one of Hanks' many characters. Hanks does some of the best work I've ever seen from him, playing four different characters that range from an unscrupulous doctor in the 1800s to going far against type with maybe the film's standout character, a modern-day thuggish British writer named Dermot Hoggins who gets the ultimate revenge on a critic for a bad review. Berry is excellent with her predominant roles playing an ambitious reporter in 1970s San Francisco and a political figurehead (from what I could grasp) aligned with one of Hanks' characters in the far future, in one of the film's few story lines that doesn't quite work. Also great is Broadbent as both a composer and playing a man tricked into living in a retirement home, who provides the film's best comic relief.The weighty Cloud Atlas principle themes of philosophy, reincarnation, oppression, and destiny, along with the film's highly challenging pace and complex non-linear storytelling construct will overwhelm many - that's okay, however. I was lost a number of times - not Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy-level lost, mind you, but definitely out of sync with what was happening on screen. This is the type of daring film that demands multiple viewings to completely grasp the filmmakers' grand scope and there's nothing wrong with a little audaciousness from Hollywood once in a while. Even with a big-name cast, it'll be very interesting to see how the otherwise difficult-to-market Cloud Atlas will fare at the box office come late October.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Graphic and upsetting violence,"Cloud Atlas was marketed as a romantic drama about reincarnation. The preview showed a host of A-list actors in different settings, costumes, and time periods interacting in different or similar ways with each other. It indicated the main themes would be fate, karma, and love. The voiceover featured Tom Hanks suggesting that no matter how many time periods or lives he lives, he will always find his way back to Halle Berry, who was shown to be his love interest. There were excellent special effects, and what looked like moving dramatic acting. When I saw this movie in the theaters, it was as a special mother daughter date on Valentine's Day. Boy, were we upset!Cloud Atlas is not a romantic drama about reincarnation. In fact, the original novel does not deal with reincarnation at all. Somehow the film makers thought it would be interesting to have the aimless actors play many different roles, probably as a way to keep the audience interested when there were frequent deaths and the time periods would change. If we didn't like sing seeing Tom Hanks as a villain, we could wait twenty minutes or so for him to get killed and then move on to his next segment. What the movie actually is, is a lot of special effects, make up, and great fun for the cast who get to play lots of different roles. Ethnicity and gender don't matter; the actors and actresses are made up to play all sorts of different people, reinforcing the reincarnation theme. There is also an incredible amount of violence in the film, which was not indicated at all in the trailer. It is very bloody and gruesome.Something I am quite a stickler about is violence towards animals. If in a movie, a character harms an animal in any way, I generally turn the movie off or walk out of the theater. In one scene (the Chinese laundry scene, in case you'd like to avoid it), there is a dog who won't stop barking and the villain shoots it. The reason I did not walk out during Cloud Atlas was because I sensed the movie was almost over and I was on a special date with my mom. I didn't want to ruin the evening - but the movie itself did that. Had the trailer shown an accurate depiction of what the film would be, I never would have watched it. All the people who did go see it, expecting romantic drama like I did, would not have been so disappointed. Ticket sales might have been better because people who were the target audience would have actually seen it and recommended it to their like-minded friends.Had I not been given such different expectations by the trailer, I probably wouldn't have hated the movie so much. In fact, I have sat through it twice more with the intention of giving it fresh eyes. (And since I know when the animal violence occurs, I have used the fast-forward button on my remote.) As it is meant to be, a very violent drama about human nature, it is not bad. I am able to objectively give credit where it is due. That credit should not be given to whoever created and approved of the trailer. Give the credit to the makeup artists, the art directors, the special effects team, and whoever was able to sift through the indecipherable novel to create a screenplay. Also, a glass should be lifted to whoever enticed all the major movie stars to come together and work on what would end up being a gigantic box office bomb. That doesn't happen very often.The enticing cast includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Susan Sarandon, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Hugh Grant, Hugo Weaving, Keith David, James D'Arcy, and Bae Doona. But unless you are anxious to see cannibalism, suicide, graphic bullet wounds, mass slaughtering, a creepy imaginary demon, and someone's head getting crushed by a beer keg, don't rent the movie.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to sexual content, graphic violence, an upsetting scene involving an animal, and violence towards children, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Crumbling under its ambition, its misses are big but its hits are also big.","When I was a very young writer, the generation spanning saga was always an object of my naive ambition. Granted, it was soon abandoned when it seemed impossible and I imagine many young writers have the same idea at least once when they have an idea that never seems to end. I didn't realize the concept had actually been achieved to somewhat positive acclaim until I heard of this film. Regardless to say, I was intrigued. And my high expectations for Cloud Atlas didn't come from the people involved or the story/ies itself, but the ambition of the concept and the potential for true technical feat despite the love-or-hate it reputation the film was starting to gain. I had an open mind. What surprised me first was how the film is structured. It races through all the 6 stories at once, showing what seems like a 30 second to 2 minute segment of one story then cutting to the other. This rocket pace is really hard to follow at first (even if it offers the potential for clever parallels in transitions) and it begins to feel like there's about dozen stories but it soon becomes easier to digest once the first section, ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewin"" gets into the meat of its story.The thing with a film like this with its ambition is that it's constantly building up to a grand conclusion and a grand purpose for all of it's 3 hour running time, which is really make-or- break if it doesn't live up to that every second of the way. I can completely understand why this is a love-or-hate film as it doesn't exactly deliver what it promises. Its weakest spots in the first act are very awkward to watch and this is mostly due to the hammy performances of Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent (""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" is a real weak link in general) with make-up and costumes that are very hard to take seriously. I actually stopped watching the film 20 minutes in with no intention of continuing later but I decided to persevere and give it a chance just to have an opinion on the whole thing by taking the sillier moments as tongue-in-cheek humour. But when Cloud Atlas gets going, it is an absolute boulder of escalation. When momentum builds between several stories at once, it's pure involving cinema. Not necessarily original ideas, but a blend of genres and styles that creates something exhilarating. And just like a boulder, this momentum doesn't stop easily and takes up a good long stretch of the film. Even if I'm not clear on what's going on or not enjoying what is going on, it certainly keeps me engaged.While the film struggles with creative payoffs to each story and relationship (even spoiling itself with a bizarre reference to a classic sci-fi film), the best payoffs are the end results of the parallels between the supposed ""reincarnations"" when the choice of recurring actors becomes very clear, essential and poignant. But what is the grand purpose of the film? In a film with seeming randomness but ostensible intention, there must be a point and the answer is that it's entirely political and about the evolving moral standards of society. It's about persecution of race, homosexuality and the elderly and then more vague ideas and criticisms on fuel consumption and generation and the pitfalls of capitalism and religion. Despite these bold intentions, it is very emotionally engaging, and that is due to the standout performances by Halle Berry (who is nomination worthy here), Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy and Doona Bae, who bring a grace to their roles that is so desperately required rather than the needlessly animated attempts by Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent, whereas Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant and Jim Sturgess are more-or-less serviceable and only sometimes invisible.Its technical feats are, like the stories and performances, hit-or-miss, the biggest hit of which is the rich and cinematic score, which is probably the film's finest achievement and guides us through the film better than the editing itself. The visual effects are okay, they're best when it's the vast landscapes of the last two stories rather than the action sequences where the characters don't appear to really belong in the scene. The costumes and makeup, while impressive for their variety, are much better when they're subtle. The first three stories are much superior to the last three, albeit much less ambitious. They're key to providing the 70s thriller atmosphere of perhaps the best story of the six, ""Half Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery"" (which must be on a par with ""Letters from Zedelghem""). Otherwise many of the transformations are quite bizarre and look like spy disguises (particularly Doona Bae in the first story and Hugo Weaving in the last). Cloud Atlas is an interesting film, and unlike most viewers, I'm in the middle of the love-hate, as the only thing I actively dislike are half of Tom Hanks' characters but there's plenty to really like. It's not exactly art, but it's certainly got meaning and heart and is epic in every sense of the word.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A bold, audacious tour-de-force in cinematic storytelling","This movie is a fusion of several genres (drama, adventure, sci-fi, comedy, romantic tragedy) as well as an attempt for an art-house cerebral movie to attain commercial blockbuster status. In my opinion it mostly succeeds, but finding a large mainstream audience is its biggest challenge to be met (at this point, before wide release).Imagine taking six short (but big-budget) films with different stories and directors and combining them into an anthology feature, united by a common theme and cast of actors in different roles, and then editing the entire thing out of sequence. The ""nested"" narrative of the book has been re-arranged for the sake of the visual medium of film, and after first being introduced to the 6 worlds, it's not that hard to keep track of who's who, what's what and where & when. Frankly, it's a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination for Best Editing - it works very well considering the challenge of making it flow coherently.The cinematography, set & art design, music score and performances range from good to great. The make-up in some cases created a distraction (a Korean woman transformed into a red-haired Caucasian; Hugo Weaving as a buxom female nurse) but it adds a bit of fun to the experience. There's a smörgåsbord of material here for most people: human drama, mystery, violence, sex, adventure, farcical comedy, gloomy sci-fi and occasional romance (both gay and straight). It's 6 movies for the price of one! Just be ready to spend almost 3 hours in your seat and suffer a bit of whiplash as the transitions can get frenetic at times, with multiple cliff-hangers happening simultaneously. Like a good roller-coaster, it has its lulls and rushes. Some might find the finale a bit conventional, sappy or anti-climactic. But there's no denying this is a big, expensive gamble on the part of the Wachowskis and their producers. Hopefully it'll achieve the kind of success they got with the first ""Matrix"" and not the fate of the abysmal ""Speed Racer."" (PS I saw the film at its world premiere at TIFF.)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"An ambitious, unique achievement","Whether or not this film is ultimately to your taste, it cannot be denied that this film is technically brilliant. The cinematography and overall scope particularly are great. It's a real spectacle. The music really enhances the film and is amazing, haunting, and thrilling. The film follows characters in a sextet of stories across hundreds of years across the world: the Chatham Islands in 1849, England in 1936, San Francisco in 1973, London in 2012, Seoul in 2144, and Hawaii in 2321.But the film's strength, its scope, also at times functions as its weakness. And therein is where the film unfortunately falters. I'm torn about this film. I've never really seen anything like it, and I understand what the big message is here: reincarnation, and that are lives are not truly our own as they're passed on and on for generations to come. The film is weighty and formidable, a real feat of cinema. But I couldn't help but think that the film collapses under its own weight. It feels convoluted, ostentatious, and even a tad pretentious. It feels like it bites off more than it can chew.Some stories are more entertaining and engaging than others. The Seoul storyline is the most entertaining, moving, and thought-provoking. And the 1973 storyline is filled with mystery that makes for a good watch. The other storylines range from good to just okay. The 2321 storyline, while is has some unsettling moments, the dialogue is often really difficult to understand as the characters speak in a broken English dialect, which unfortunately took away from the viewing experience. Moreover, because there are multiple stories, the pacing can be choppy. Chunks of the film feel fast, other parts slow, and other parts are downright boring. But that's almost certainly because of the change in styles between the different storyline.To that end, the use of makeup on some of the actors is questionable and distracting, especially when they're meant to be playing different races. Particular instances that stood out as egregious: an Asian actor wearing a red wig and color contacts to appear white; a black actor wearing a blonde wig, beige makeup, and color contacts to appear white; and several white actors wearing eye makeup akin to yellowface. Mind you, I bring this up not because I believe it to be in poor taste nor racist, which some reviewers have opined, but rather because it sullies the film's immersion.The acting across the board is good. What's interesting about this film is that since there are six different stories packed into it, each of the main actors alternate between having lead, supporting, or cameo roles in each story. So while you get to see an actor shine in one or two storylines, they barely have any screentime or off on the sidelines in other storylines. That said, Bae Doona in particular is the standout. She has the most compelling story, in which she's the lead, as a clone in a futuristic dystopian Seoul, Korea. She is really impressive and her performance is touching, heartbreaking, and bold. Jim Sturgess is also great. Halle Berry, Tom Hanks, and Ben Whishaw are good too.The film certainly isn't for everyone, but it is remarkable in what it tries to achieve and say about life and the human condition. While it may spread itself too thin, it is still certainly worth checking out.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It's grand, funny, deep, and ambitious. But it's also weirdly flat, the meanings thin and obvious.","Cloud Atlas (2012)It's no secret this is an ambitious film, over two hours long with three directors and scenes set in six distinct time frames over several centuries. It's also widely known that the main actors, a half dozen in all but famously Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Hugh Grant, each take on roles in the six different periods, with outrageously effective makeup that amount to disguises, at least from the viewer's perspective.What remains to be seen is how any one person will respond to the film. Me? I watched it all with interest and found parts, or aspects, fascinating. But I was never really swept away, rarely did I care overly for the various protagonists, and never did the philosophical message mean beans to me. It's dumbed down a bit, a little like ""The Matrix"" which has such ambitious meaning to go along with all the technical feats.The grand themes, which will take a good hour to have any inkling of, center around being noble and good in a world where much or most of society is against you. That's appealing--the main characters are fighting evil in the good old Hollywood sense. As you see the rise of one of these characters into a semi-god like figure (she is worshipped in the futuristic sections), you are expected to follow and appreciate the clap-trap pseudo-religious cant that comes from this woman's mouth. I liked her, don't get me wrong, but the writing is a bit childish.What hurts the film even more is the thing that's supposed to make it so amazing and fresh--its construction in many pieces. To be clear, this isn't a set of six movies, one after another. No, we shift time zones often, sometimes in a matter of moments, often to great confusion at first. As you watch you learn how to watch, which is good, and you recognize better the different situations. But as vigorous and enlivening as this is (you really have to stay alert) it isn't really always for effect. I mean, there are reasons often for why we shift from one time zone to another, but not always in a satisfying way, It's more like the director(s) are trying to keep the audience from getting lost.You might also get a little tired of the clichés that are used in each of the situations, but in fact each individual story has its interest. Some of the scenes are downright comical, practically slapstick. Others are horrifying, ranging from a personal drama and tragedy in the mid-1900s between two composers, one of them gay, to a future-based band of primitives who are being wiped out by violent huntsmen with colorful face-paint. You can see how there are clichés in the wings, ready to flourish with the right viewers.The theater I saw this in (with digital, not film, projection) made it all look very good, if a bit sterile and ""perfect."" There were twenty people there and none of them left halfway. It's not a movie you necessarily abandon once you plunked down your tenner. But it will put some viewers off.What saves it is significant. The acting is exaggerated and fun, and sometimes quite breathtaking in its deception. And the whole filming experience is so wide-ranging and ambitious you can't help but be impressed by all the work, and all the ideas at work. See it? If you liked ""Melancholia"" or ""2001"" or ""Tree of Life"" or other films of that sort, that look fabulous and deal with deep issues, you might really enjoy this. But don't expect your life to be changed. It's too trapped by its big intentions to ever wrestle free and be a true work of art.And besides, it's been decades since a good movie has been made by committee.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unless you really could tell everyone apart. But don't concentrate to much on that spotting game! You'll have enough on your hands to stay with the story. Is there a message though?

"Simply amazing, but not for everyone.","This movie was the single best experience I had had in a while. That's for starters.I came out of the theater, full of thoughts, I put my music on. And then I turned it off, i wanted silence. As far as silence goes for a crowded town.People who've seen The Matrix (a.k.a. almost everyone) and V for Vendetta, both of them, should know - Whachovskis show ugly, ""harsh"" scenes to give a meaning. This is just one of the reasons why this movie isn't for everyone. In the relatively short time that a movie can offer, you are presented with nearly all the troubles society has had over last 2 hundreds of years and, perhaps, a few ahead. Racism, homosexuality, stealing, ideals, religious guidelines, lack of knowledge about other parts of the world, the ""what does make you a human"" question and so on. Only to get rolled over fast. Cloud Atlas introduces you to all these... things... and what they cause. Never once giving an answer. And there is no time to do so, for that matter. Needless to say, people who are susceptible to these things, would either not want to deal with them or want the movie to expand on them. Neither one happens, some people are left with some emptiness.And some people who claim themselves ""intelligent"" will work their negativity on these thoughts. I had no troubles with all the various ideas thrown at me. I was slowly getting drawn into the complex maze this story offered.So - negative feedback is understandable. But I, like I said before, enjoyed this movie very, very much. Half to two thirds of the movie you are trying to grasp where the movie is going, only to realize that it is not linear, some stories hold little to no importance. And near the end you realize - it is good exactly the way it is.I'd give the movie a solid 10, the first one in over 5 years. But I do see where the negativity can come from - and I can respect that. Also I do see a few things missing. Like, how did the journalist know of the composition when she wasn't there? Perhaps it was answered in the book. But I, while understood 99% of what the movie was trying to convey, didn't see the answer.Overall - if you like to get yourself challenged, if you like a taste of sci-fi as far as ""potential things"" go, if you aren't easily offended by some... controversial, yet pretty simple ideas, you SHOULD watch this movie.

Tremendously overwhelming,"It is quite impossible to put into words how moving, breathtaking and thought-provoking this film is. Stupendous, ambitious and profound, ""Cloud Atlas"" is a once-in-a-lifetime movie of epic proportions.Comprised of six interrelated stories from different times and places, the movie is about how people's lives are connected with and influence each other. It shows that an act of kindness goes a long way, and contemplates how our actions and decisions could eventually change the course of other people's lives. It is, in a way, an illustration of the six degrees of separation that fleshes out karma and reincarnation.The film is structured as a sort of mosaic - the fragments of each of the six time periods scattered all throughout the movie, revisiting each narrative to propel the story into one humongous piece of art.The complex story lines require utmost degree of attention and a deeper level of appreciation to be fully understood. In the long run, the perplexing narrative is not as complicated as it seems.Though most people would find this three-hour mental exercise to be too confounding to the point of being burdensome, the attentive and emotionally attached will be gratefully rewarded. The film's metaphysical elements mixed with its sprawling visuals, awe-inspiring script, heartrending music, astonishing cinematography, amazing cast, and superior technical values offer a peculiar blend of cinematic nirvana, something I would call a beautiful entanglement that is better left untangled.I expect this film to be in strong contention for the Academy Awards, particularly in the Make Up and Special Effects categories. I'm hoping though that its stars won't be overlooked, especially the supporting cast.The actors play a multitude of contrasting characters it's like you're watching a grand stage play with extreme makeovers and multiple costume changes. The make-up was so well done you wouldn't recognize Halle Berry or Hugh Grant in some of their minor roles. (Make sure to watch the closing credits and you'd be pleasantly surprised to find out which characters each actor portrayed.)

Flat and empty. Cavendish can only save himself.,"To begin with, in this movie, a series of rather generic and somewhat cheesy stories unfold. When elements of science fiction are added, they seem quite silly and uninspired, and at times, downright stupid. This makes the more 'earthly' stories turn out to be the most effective. When addressing the concepts that make up each of the stories, they become Manichean and reductionist, both in conflicts and motivations, providing a very limited reflection on the themes addressed.The only story that caught my attention a little was the one about Cavendish, which at least I can say was fun.The narrative is nothing special, and the idea of telling all these stories simultaneously doesn't seem to have a purpose in itself but appears to come solely from a poor attempt to be innovative. In the end, it only results in a handful of poorly combined stories that drag on long enough to make you wonder several times, 'How much longer until it's over?'The dialogues are very poor at times, and at some moments, they release phrases that seem intentionally placed to appear eloquent, but with all the clumsiness around them, they only end up revealing themselves.The cinematography doesn't stand out at all; it looks like a commercial for the next iPhone camera.

I liked the performances of the actors and actresses Tom Hanks, Hale Berry, Hugo Weving, Susan Surandon, and others, what was great about their performances was the fact in each of the stories they all played different characters which to me is a great but fun acting challenge and they all passed. From the different accents they had to execute but physically the different make up they all had to wear and the make up work is perfect in some of the other stories some of the actors are literally unrecognizable you really would think they were different people.But most importantly I really love the story structure because it's something truly different. All of the stories are linear but there is a multitude of them, all in different settings and are told at once and not in any particular order or time. Each of them are connected and unconnected in a way, they also seem to be a Chex Mix of genres all to make a tasty snack. One story is a drama, another a suspense thriller, another some tomorrows world sci-fi, another a mix of both post apocalyptic and final frontier sci-fi, and any other genre or sub genre you can think of. There all about something and yet at the same time their not I'll leave it up to you to make your own conclusion about that but I think that's the point.Two of my favorite ones no doubt are the two stories that take place in the future, what can I say I'm a sci-fi fan. One story which is a tomorrows world story is great I really love the production value that was put into that, most of that was CGI but it was used well and with great detail, it's a future obviously reminiscent of ""Blade Runner"". But what I liked in that story was the concept was really dark as we see it's a future that has completely sold out their free will, enviorment and morals toward consumerism, greed and gluttony. The technology in that story is fascinating the use of touch and hand motion screens and others things. I like the main character whom is sympathetic and out of her element as well and the significant other helping her, it's almost reminiscent of the sci-fi gem ""The Fifth Element"" which also had the same dynamic.And the other which is the post apocalyptic/final frontier sci-fi story. Really like the look of the post apocalyptic world where it's looks and feels almost alien because of how different it is from the way people talk which is almost a Cajun like tone and certain customs. I like the chemistry between both Tom Hanks and Halle character, how conflicted in emotions both are, but also how both sort of represent they classic dynamic of nature and technology, old and new contemporary wisdom.I've said enough, Cloud Atlas is a journey throughout the ages you never know where it begins but you don't want it to end.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ambitious attempt largely succeeds in what it wants to achieve,"This is a very ambitious attempt in trying to bring to screen six or seven stories, all somehow linked to each other, but taking place in very different epochs in human history, by criss-crossing between the stories and casting the same actors and actresses in all the stories. Well, in the end, it all connects quite impressively and most of the stories are quite enjoyable in themselves as well. On the other hand, the make-up job on the cast varies from brilliant to mediocre. I have a problem with what the movie seems to saying 'though. It's nice to point out that there are always decent people however rotten the times may be, but there also seems to be an underlining theme that history repeats itself. And, the quasi-metaphysical implications are not my cup of tea.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Epic narrative-jumping sci-fi of the kind rarely attempted in Hollywood,"Bravo to the Wachowskis and Twyker for making an excellent movie that is too good for the masses to fully appreciate. Besides the already sublime editing, score, and acting, the theme and moral isn't meant to hit you over the head but rather sink in like the themes from the in-film Cloud Atlas score.Multiple viewings only bring more enjoyment, and I am glad the brothers went for V for Vendetta and Cloud Atlas instead of Speed Racer; they may not be the next Spielberg but Jarmucsh they my share the limelight with if not in style; differentiating themselves they weave spectacle into a movie like poetry, never cheapening it.

Good film after a long time!!!,"After a long time there comes a movie with some thought in it.The writers have done a good job in bringing the book onto the screen .The film defies the old fashioned conventions of the same ending and this time gives us a reason to be involved in it.The story is told non linearly.One will have to follow from the beginning to the end to fully understand the film.The film is thematic ,rhythemic and does not revolve around any character or plot.But just flows in one direction.All you have to do is ride on.Tom Hanks suits every role in this film and so does Halle Berry.The film starts from past to present to future and is an epic adventure.This is a long movie but not one minute do you take your eyes off it.Direction-8;Story-8,Cinematography-7A good film in a long time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One extraordinary and beautifully written piece,"This is my all time favorite movie for many reasons, but one that I am always so passionate about is the content, the writing of this movie. Every line sounds like a poem, and touches you in some way. Very powerful! The acting is also very strong. The actors expressed their emotions and made me believe that they are really going through some sort of emotion. The visual effects are impressive, and the credits will surprise you with what you will come to find out. The story and just the meaning of it, still to this day, I think about and every time I watch it, I learn something new, which is really awesome. My favorite quote from the movie will definitely be: ""Our lives are not our own, past and present, from womb to tomb we are bound to others, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future"" !!!

"Nice try, but too long and too disjointed","Not going to recap the plot, everyone else has done that. The first 2/3 was pretty absorbing, but finally it became apparent that the threads really weren't going to come together. I still don't know what the movie was trying to say beyond greeting-card platitudes such as ""I believe when one door closes, another opens"" and a vague sense of continuity between the eras reinforced by common actors and objects lasting through time.I'll say this is the Wachowski's best movie since the first Matrix (not saying much) but more concrete ties between the stories would have improved coherence. For example, perhaps a Fabricant-Union rebellion triggered the cataclysm implied by the far future storyline. Other elements near the end seemed to come out of nowhere (like the signed contract for something and the box of gold) but maybe I lost track of something mentioned 2 1/2 hours before. And is Hugo Weaving getting tired of being typecast as the bad guy?So overall, interesting most of the time and ambitious, but at the end like trying to pick up jello.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"I'm not known for hyperbole, so, with me writing that it's the best movie I've seen in my 55 years, that is something (at least it is to me).

Admittedly, I didn't get every single connection and nuance between/through all six ""stories"", but, for this, I don't even care. It truly did feel like a roller-coaster ride - front row for sure... and if you just sit back and let it flow over you for it's almost 3 hours, you'll get what YOU need to pick up.

Unappreciated Masterpiece,Cloud Atlas is simply one of the greatest independent films ever made.6 storylines told over 6 different timelines where actions of one existence echoes in the next. The book written by David Mitchell was an incredible read and the film does justice to the source material. The sheer scope and planning in how the film edits scenes together with the timelines and how one story is echoed in another.The acting and make up too is amazing. Especially at the end of the film when you see what actors played multiple roles.This is an underrated and underappreciated masterpiece that was way ahead of its time for audiences who were still clinging to crap like marvel and whose intelligence level is that of dumb action movies who do not posses a unique view of how great a film can be!On multiple viewings you look at certain elements and storylines in different ways. As classic as Donnie Darko. There is also an extended 4 hour version that was made that just needs to be released.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Arson,"Were I to worry about our future, it would be less about all the horrors that await than our ability to reason about them. There is a rather short tether between this and wonder about what we are doing to long form narrative. My own story about who we are and where we came from rides on the back of long, complex multidimensional stories. It isn't language so much that drives evolution but what wonders we build with it. In my life I have witnessed our expected length of concept shrink from hours to minutes or even seconds. I blamed TeeVee, then internet trends.So when I see a film constructed like this, my first suspicion is that the writers and viewers have entered into a pact: short episodes, high visual richness with an engaging, somewhat amusing hunt to find the celebrity behind the makeup. This would be a pact built on laziness and worlds too simple to live in: good guy, bad guy, savior. It would be a pact that allows us to use the length of sitting to convince ourselves that we understand stories like the grownups do. This is my first thought coming in and it puts me on guard.And this is in spite of the presence of Tom Tykwer, who made ""Heaven,"" one of the most inferentially complex long form constructions I know. Here he directs three 15 minute films. Two are trivial. The 1936 era story is in fact structured after the fashion of Kieslowski, and could easily have served to make the rest matter if they had similar anchors in the world, anchors of unknown loss. God I wish he had written the whole thing.The 2012 story is pretty darn good, too. Not because of what it contributes, which is just comic relief, but in the way it is told through references to other films. Included is the very cool notion that the film we see is the source of another, written by the guy within both. (We see a bit of this film in a later episode, shoehorned into the plot.)These are just two out of six. The last two chronologically overwhelm the rest with childish simplicity, and manic emphasis. So it lacks many of the things that matter to me when I come to a film for sustenance.But holy cow the art of how they are edited together is astonishing. Often I have some inside information about the process, but I have been working other things recently. So I just do not know whether the director-writers knew what they were doing ahead of time or some internal genius sorted it out. No matter; this is good craft and if you are in the mood to be swept up by it, it will work for you. It did for me.Others have successfully pulled off this strategy of short episodes additive in some way to give us the value from long form. That value, by the way, is to be sufficiently incarnated in the thing that when changes in it occur, we change.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A refreshing movie that breaks new ground,"Cloud Atlas is an interesting and unusual film.It's disconcerting to watch at first, because you're not sure what it is you are watching. A love story? A period piece? It kept jumping between timelines, so it took my mind a while to work out what was going on. You also see the same actors playing different roles and this threw me too. I thought they were the same person, though eventually I realized they were entirely different characters. Once I understood what was going on I was able to enjoy three long but never boring hours.I haven't seen anything like Cloud Atlas.It jumps between six timelines telling six different but intertwined stories separated across sometimes vast gulfs of time. I could easily describe what the movie is now, but I think it's more fun if you discover it for yourself. It isn't perfect and parts of it could have been better done, but I am very glad to have watched it. It's not a movie that dumbs itself down for the viewer. It's rich, intelligent and thought-provoking.Most actors play multiple roles in this film. They are all good, and Tom Hanks in particular is outstanding. Too many established actors get lazy and fill their bank account by playing the same role over and over, so it's great to see Hanks break new ground to deliver a deep performance I wouldn't have otherwise thought he was capable of. Korean Actress Doona Bae too is wonderful. So too were Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Keith David, James D'Arcy and Hugo Weaving. Even Hugh Grant. Yes, Hugh Grant.For the most part the editing works well. We never get bored, and a distressing scene in one timeline is balanced by a lighter scene in another.Professional critics didn't condemn Cloud Atlas but didn't praise it either. I think it's different and it wasn't the usual 'tick the box' review they are so used to. e.g. 'This is a good cop movie. 3 stars' 'This is a really good cop movie. 4 stars.' Well to hell with them. Perhaps they can think and earn their salaries for a change.It's a triumph Cloud Atlas even got made. The major studios wouldn't back it, so it was produced and financed independently. There were three different units filming at once. The movie was moderately successful at the box office, though I'm not sure it has yet broken even. But it's got all the makings of a timeless cult classic so with its video release I'm sure in time it will come to be appreciated. Credit too goes to Hanks who even though only an actor here, spurred on the producers and cast to get it made despite the continual setbacks. Some of the other actors too were told by their agents the producers didn't have the money to pay them, but they got on their planes and did it anyway. Far from the usual paint-by-numbers formula movie making, this was a labor of love.Cloud Atlas isn't without its flaws. A wider audience would have slid into the movie far more comfortably if they better explained we were watching multiple timelines and that the same actors were playing entirely different characters. Better editing would have removed some of the confusion, and the birthmark was silly.The worst part of the movie is the very poor 'Yellowface' make-up. Some Caucasians are made up to look like Asians, but it is unconvincing and distracting. They don't look, move or talk like Asians. If you've spent time in Asia you'll know what I'm talking about. Obviously the producers don't. I don't think the producers were being racist when they did this, but I don't think it worked either. At they knew to stay away from 'Blackface.'It's an emotionally intense three hours covering many characters. My favorite was Tom Hank's Zachry in the last time period. I loved the way he the others communicated in a dialect that was both futuristic and yet very easy for the audience to follow. ""That's fair buy. True-true?"" (trans. ""I think I've got a point."") Some professional critics complained about this. What do they expect? That in a thousand years people will still speak North American dialect as today? Talk about laziness and a lack of imagination.The movie delivers as happy an ending as is possible for such a long and heart-wrenching journey.I'd like a break from remakes. We need more brave movies like this that show us something new. Kudos to all involved.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"They Pulled it Off, Exceeding my Expectations","I had high hopes for Cloud Atas, but I didn't know how they were going to pull off 6 separate stories being played by the same actors/actresses and bring it all together where movies such as ""New York, I Love You"" had failed. I also did not know what I thought about the close to 3 hour running time and 3 directors working to assemble this truly epic endeavor.Let me tell you that they did it.Not only do they somehow achieve not feeling like their is too much going on or that parts of the movie should be eliminated, but each actor/actress really transforms from character to character and you feel something for every single one.That is freaking impressive.But what's even more impressive on this sucker is that you get sucked in during the 1st 10 minutes (unlike the book in which I put it down after 30 long pages) by the way they introduce all 6 stories up front, switch between them in an almost seamless fashion, and reduce the whole meaning of these stories down to a paragraph at the end of the movie.Gosh, the level of mastery here makes me want to vomit.If I resist the urge, let me finally ad the cinematography, acting, and makeup should all be nominated for Academy Awards. If this does not win ""best makeup,"" the production team has been robbed.Can't wait to see it again and enjoy all the little symbolic items sprinkled throughout the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Caught Between Two Worlds,"Characters in 6 different eras struggle and define themselves, decisions and acts of kindness (or evil) rippling through time and influencing other lives. In the 19th century, a young slaver is helped by a stow-away; in the early 20th century, a conflicted young composer works as an apprentice for a forgotten genius; in the 70s, a reporter investigates corporate wrong-doings; in the present day, a debt-ridden publisher goes through a number of absurd ordeals; in the 22nd century in Neo-Seoul, a clone waitress discovers the hidden power she possesses; in a distant, post-Apocalyptic Hawai, two survivors from different cultures try to activate a beacon that might allow them to escape a poisoned Earth.Long summary for a complex story. I will not look at this in the context of the source novel, since I never read source novel. But since against all odds this was turned into a film - and the ordeal endured to get it made is worthy of a book itself - how does this film work on its own merits?Tom Tykwer (Run, Lola Run & Perfume) co-directed this huge independent venture with the Wachowsky siblings (Matrix, Speed racer, V for Vendetta), and at first it is very encouraging to have such strong cinematic voices expressed through such a project. Directing duties were split depending on story segments in a way that meant the more contemporary ones were handled by Tykwer. A much more interesting, unusual and ultimately controversial decision was made to have actors recur across segments, playing various characters who differed in their gender and race. More about this later.Cloud Atlas has been praised as a masterpiece and derided as a massive folly. Whatever it is, and in my opinion it is torn between the two, sometimes within the space even of an individual segment, it certainly is unique. In fact, when commenting on films you can often single out things that worked throughout and others that didn't... With Cloud Atlas you have a less clean-cut job on your hands.For all the vaunted technical prowess and vision of its makers, Cloud Atlas has trouble keeping a balance, something it often just barely makes up for in pacing. For a 3-hour film containing 6 smaller stories and a framing device, it actually flies by. But then, on the flip- side, you often feel that we cut to another thread just as the one we were following was getting interesting. This ambiguity stretches to nearly all departments, even casting.What largely saves the film and will keep you in your seat is the ever-dependable emotional anchor that is Tom Hanks. Whatever the era, he is hugely watchable, and provides much of the humanity of the film. The same can be said for Jim Broadbent, alternating between heart- breaking coward, indifferent officer and evil old bastard depending on the sub-story. Elsewhere things get more complicated: Ben Whishaw and James D'Arcy have trouble shouldering the weight that the script piles up on them, Doona Bae is undermined by the film's most controversial artistic choice, and Halle Berry is simply terrible across the board.And for all its merits - Hanks, Broadbent, visions of different periods, the light interweaving of stories - there are two decisions that come very close to making the whole thing ridiculous: to a lesser extent, the silly future-speak from the post-apocalyptic story repeatedly makes you laugh when it shouldn't, and doesn't make sense in the broader sense of the film: why then do people use modern vernacular in the 18th, 19th and 22nd centuries but not here? The real disaster on hand, though, is the gender and racial-bending casting.Effects makeup have come a long way in 130 years of cinematic history, especially when it comes to portraying the otherworldly, but we still haven't nailed many more natural things: aging makeup is still hit-and-miss (think of ""J. Edgar""...), so changing genders and races without finding yourself in the darkest corners of uncanny valley should be quite a challenge. Here it fails miserably: the pasty, waxworks-looking futuristic Asians played by Caucasian actors are unsettling enough, but undermining poor Doona Bae's performance by trying to pass her off as Caucasian on two counts really hurts. The many faces of Tom Hanks are a bit more playful, but things become downright ridiculous when 60 years are piled on D'Arcy and Hugo Weaving plays an old nurse, and manages to be less convincing as a woman than he was in drag-comedy Priscilla. It's an impossible-to-overcome distraction in what could have been a great film, and keeps you at arm's length from an often compelling story.In the end, I do recommend seeing this. For all its short-comings, it is never less than interesting, and even its failed experiments deserve to be experienced once. It's unlikely you'll see its like on this kind of budget anytime soon.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Epic is the word,"First and foremost this movie is not for everyone. It was evident when by one hour 25% of the theater became empty. But what they missed!!! Its a 3 hours movie (not very uncommon in bollywood) and every minute was different from the other. It was like watching a very Indian classical concert where they start off slow and then keep building the flow and then break the walls of the music theater with their crescendo at the end. Its not a movie with linear plot, a very complex story spanning between centuries and places and if someone asks me what the story was, honestly I wont be able to narrate (they can read the book though which is a masterpiece). The visualizations were amazing be it in the ship or Neo Seoul, the sound effects completely shook hand with the visualization. The acting was great, costumes were great (seemed a little fake at times). The fight sequences, romance (both varieties), music all were well so well mixed in the film that it was like a nice giant cocktail.

"An enormous, ambitious film","An outstanding achievement. I haven't read the novel (though I ordered it immediately after coming back from the film), but one can tell from the film that it was a behemoth as far as it came to the film adaptation. It's surprising that any director (or even any three directors) would see it and say, ""Yeah, I can do this."" Or that any studio would say, ""Yeah, that sounds like a good idea."" Judging by the box office, perhaps Warner Brothers made the wrong decision, but the directors have tackled their endeavor with vigor and produced a monstrous, beautiful, jaw-dropping film. The story covers six different time periods, from the mid-19th Century to who-knows how long after the end of human civilization as we know it. Each tale was at some point written down, and the characters in the next timeline are inspired and influenced by those stories. The novel is told in a sort of Russian nesting doll fashion, where the next story opens in the middle of the previous, and eventually get closed up at the end. The Wachowskis and Tykwer have taken Griffith's Intolerance as a model and have the stories flow in and out of each other. I can't say which one works better, but the film's version works wonderfully. I loved the ways they find links between the stories, themes or images. The best thing is all six of the stories are equally as wonderful, so I was never thinking ""When the Hell are we going to get back to the sci-fi story?"" or whatever. I was involved with the film from alpha to omega, and never for a second felt like it was too long (or even too short). There's also the gimmick of having the main cast appear throughout each of the stories (which is unique to the film version), often playing different genders and races. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are arguably the stars and probably have the most roles. South Korean actress Bae Doo-na is most memorable in her role as Sonmi-351, a fabricated human being in the 22nd Century. Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Jim Broadbent, Ben Whishaw, Keith David, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant, among others, also play multiple roles. The fact that this worked at all is amazing.

Too confusing for me,"This film tells the story of several individuals, who are in different points of the time and space continuum. Though they might be years apart from each other, their stories are not as different from each other as expected.So ""Cloud Atlas"" is a literary wonder, but when translated to the screen, it seems to be very confusing. It tells many stories in many different time points, and they share some similarities but are not identical. An hour into the film, I thought it was about the universality of human experiences, and how karma affects past and future lives. Then I realised that it wasn't about these themes, then I got increasingly lost. The story of Tom Hanks and Halle Berry confuses me the most.

Cloud Atlas (2012),"Imagine watching a film that combines various story elements such as a political thriller, a sci-fi adventure or even a British sitcom? That is exactly what you get from Cloud Atlas, the Wachowski sibling's bold and daring fantasy epic which continues their trend of visually-driven films that they previously achieved with The Matrix trilogy (1999-2003) and Speed Racer (2008). While it failed to land any nominations at the recent Oscars, it has quietly gained momentum as an artistic masterpiece that explores the way that souls are connected throughout its several segments. An appealing cast that includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent and Hugh Grant adds extra spice to this voyage of a film....Split into six different plot-lines, the film focuses on how the actions of individuals affect one another in the past, present and future. In 1849, writer Adam Ewing (Sturgess) tries to protect a black slave who has secretly boarded his ship that is sailing around America. In 1930s England, homosexual music writer Robert Frobisher (Whishaw) agrees to work with veteran composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Broadbent) as he creates the Cloud Atlas theme. In 1970s America, journalist Luisa Reys (Berry) tries to expose corruption at a nuclear plantation only to be pursued by hit-man Bill Smoke (Weaving). In modern day England, publisher Timothy Cavendish (Broadbent) tries to sort out a massive debt only to be confined to an old people's home by his wealthy brother. In 2144 Seoul, fabricate clone Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) is rescued from her built-in environment by revolution fighter Hae-Joo Chang (Sturgess). Finally in the faraway future, tribesman Zachary (Hanks) reluctantly helps a modified human named Meronym (Berry) as she tries to track down an ancient building.Audacious is one way to describe Cloud Atlas as the Wachowskis carefully work hard to make this 'unfilmable' production a reality by adapting it from David Mitchell's best-selling novel. It demands a lot of attention from its curious audiences as they spend the next three hours intrigued and fascinated by this lavish epic and while the story lines are all completely different, the directing trio (including Tom Tykwer) manage to combine and intertwine the plots together rather than playing off each story as an individual one. Fortunately the mood of each part changes throughout as it goes from dark and thrilling to subtle and at times hilarity (especially when it comes to the Cavendish scenes). A sense of 'freedom' also connects the segments and becomes a running theme as we begin to realise that these stories do have something in common e.g. Sonmi's legacy being worshipped by the tribe. But what also makes this film remarkable is the way it merges together a talented group of actors and has them taking on several roles that mostly rely on tons of costumes and prosthetics. It also pulls off the visual effects scenes spectacularly well with the stunning futuristic Seoul sequences baring resemblance to the sci-fi world of Blade Runner (1982). On occasions, the makeup is completely inspired as we barely recognise some of the big names like Halle Berry as the white relative of Vyvyan in the 1930s or Hugh Grant as a sadistic warrior in the final story. While the film stands out as a rich and artistic triumph, the exceptional cast manage to contribute effectively in their multiple roles. Tom Hanks has a lot of fun as his different characters range from a corrupted doctor and a volatile Irishman to a heroic tribesman. Fellow Oscar-winner Berry reclaims some acting versatility from her Monsters Ball days courtesy of her different portrayals including the determined journalist from the 70s segment. Young British actors Jim Sturgess and Ben Whishaw continue to impress with their story arcs while Hugh Grant goes-against-type to play some creepy and sadistic villains who make us detest them whatever story they are in. However the two best performances come from British character actor Jim Broadbent and Asian actress Doona Bae. The former brings humour and weariness to his character Cavendish who is initially portrayed as a buffoon but manages to make us root for him as he finds himself in the awkward setting of an old people's home. Bae on the other hand is immaculate as the fabricate who begins to realise what her life has become and ultimately makes the gradual decision to try and inspire a revolution.However the problem with a film of this magnitude is that it isn't easy to sit through. Some audiences may find watching the non-linear narratives a struggle to work out especially as you wonder about what exactly links them all (it's best to rely on IMDb for that!). Paying attention to that many story lines definitely requires a lot of patience and understanding even from the most intelligent film fans! While the makeup has its inspired moments, it can also be somewhat laughable and even racist at times particularly when the focus is on the Seoul segment. One can't help but feel sorry for Asian star Doona Bae as she finds herself sharing scenes with non-Asian actors covered in prosthetics who clearly look like they have just stumbled off the set of a Charlie Chan film. But it is poor Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from The Matrix) who finds himself looking silliest of all not just in that story but also when he is in full-drag to portray the Nurse Ratched-type carer from the Cavendish scenes and his later appearance as a creepy and unnecessary demon from the final segment.The Wachowski's latest offering is confidently acted, looks majestic to watch and has the potential to be a genre-breaking classic but is flawed by its complicated narrative and (at times) ridiculous makeup. It may take a few re watches to appreciate this one better!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cloud Atlas is no ordinary film.,"Cloud Atlas is no ordinary film. It may not stand up to the critics reviews or expectations. Yes 100 million dollars price tag does push the bar. Cloud Atlas is a visual voyage . Don't try to understand it, don't put binders on the story or the performers just let it all go and soon what it was all about will not matter. I am shure everyone has heard that looking for a linear plot is not the way to enjoy this film. This is an experience and different, I will be one of those who will watch this movie over and over not to discover the little tricks and clues but enjoy the cleverness of Mr. Hanks who has nearly as many roles in Cloud Atlas as he did in Polar Express. I will watch the beauty in the talent and form of Ms.Halle Berry, 아가씨 Doona Bae, and Ben Whishaw.

I can't wait to love to hate Hugh Weaving in all his villainess evil in every manner from the powerful and dreaded Bill Smoke to the farce of a Nurse Ratched like character in masterful telling of brotherly rivalry that puts Jim Broadbent at the merciless ends of Hugh Grant's trickery.

Destined to be a classic,"Most films exist purely for pleasure, to occupy your mind for a couple hours: take you to another world, let you forget about your problems, and you leave the theater $11 a seat poorer (not to mention what you spent on consumables), yet no richer for the experience. You paid for nothing more than a memory that, more often than not, is not particularly memorable.But every once in a while you do see something extraordinary. Something that makes you want to tell all your friends about the movie you just saw, and look askance at someone who says they didn't like it, as if to say, ""What movie did you just watch?"" Or, perhaps, ""Oh, I'm sorry, were you expecting Transformers 4?"" What Cloud Atlas does that is most impressive, to me, is that it asks us, as an audience, to expect more from our movies. Most of the movies we consider great have done this: Citizen Kane pioneered, among its almost innumerable technical advancements, non-linear storytelling; Psycho had the guts to kill off its main character 1/3 of the way into the movie, setting up similar shocks in future films like Alien and Scream.Perhaps Cloud Atlas's closest comparison, however, is 2001. Both were ravaged by some critics and fiercely embraced by others. Both asked questions about the universe and our existence in it without giving us answers, asking us only to ask questions of ourselves. Neither have neat endings that wrap everything up. Cloud Atlas will probably fair the same as 2001 commercially: that is to say, make little at the box office but have a long and rich life on video. (2001 ultimately played long in theaters, but in today's industry it's unlikely Cloud Atlas will have the opportunity to stick around as long.)This film is a singular experience. I can only speak about it in hyperbole, a language previously unknown to me. People will be watching this movie and discussing it for decades. People will become filmmakers because of this movie. It will be taught in film classes. I know I myself will see it at least twice more in the theater. And thirty years from now we'll look back at the list of films that were nominated for Best Picture for 2012, and we'll say, ""I can't even remember half these movies. Can you believe Cloud Atlas didn't win that year?""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A map and  symphony,I understand why this film has mixed reviews. It contains within it a symbol of the very nature of our existence and stretches your belief system to the breaking point. In my humble opinion we work out problems in our life in stages. I went though that part of my life where my beliefs were stronger than the truth. At some point I had to decide if I was going to look for the truth or stick with a certain version that was taught to me by people who don't know how to love and accept things as they are.I like the direction the film was going but I can see how it was hard to follow for some since it jumped around. Most of the scenes connected with each other in some way and I think its up to us to find out what those connections are. It has a lot to do with how we live our lives on this earth and if we learn from the past. You have to remember where you came from to know where you are going.Cloud Atlas is like a reading a map during a symphony. The map helps you get to where you need to be in your life so you don't causing further suffering. The symphony is the compass that reminds you in which direction you should go so you don't get lost.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cloud Atlas is cinematic journey of epic proportions,"Every so often a movie comes along that is so ambitious that it pushes the boundaries on almost every level to bring it to life. No stranger to tackle this sort of task the Wachowski's most notably for their Matrix films alongside Tom Tykwer director of Run Lola Run clearly set out to do just that with Cloud Atlas. The trailers sport what appears to be a complex interesting story and an awesome cast featuring Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant, Keith David, and Xun Zhou. Could this ambitious film work as well as it seems or will it end up being to convoluted and confusing?Cloud Atlas follows six intertwining stories featuring stories of an ocean voyage across the Pacific; letters from a composer to his friend; a thriller about a power plant murder; a nursing home escape; futuristic Korea; and the tale of a tribe living in post-apocalyptic Hawaii. To say this movie is ambitious is an understatement. It has so many layers to the story, yet somehow works perfectly. This film plays like six separate films merged together with various common elements. The performances are all brilliant across the board, with Tom Hanks and Hugo Weaving really standing out. Hanks was the most unexpected, but not his acting as he has proved himself as an actor, but more the various roles he took on. Most of these are not ones you ever imagine Hanks to play and he killed every one of them better than the next. Weaving on the other hand is known for playing some out there characters and delivers like never before with every one of his characters he brings to life. Jim Broadbent delivers the most humorous of all the performances as well as the most memorable. The rest of the cast delivered so much to the overall execution of this film especially with the unexpected characters they portray. At times there are some of the actors that you will not even realize they were in the scene or the character you are watching. This movie is amazing to watch and is way more of an experience than just a film. Rarely does a film deliver almost every genre into one piece without becoming so full of itself and confusing, but here it brilliantly tells these stories effectively keeping everything needed in tact to deliver the message it is trying to convey.There are few movies that come along that truly feel epic, but Cloud Atlas is defiantly one of them. There are some moments where the make-up effects don't work near as well, mostly just coming off a bit strange, but if you let it go and buy into the film as a whole it will not deter you from the glorious nature of it all. This is an experience the few films are able to deliver on such a grand scale. It will be interesting to see what everyone takes away from the story itself and its' message as it seems to be touching on everything from love, oppression, reincarnation and more. Everyone should open their mind and let the experience of this film flow into your brain, you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Culminating in an extremely long, tiresome and superb adaptation, the chance was missed and ""Cloud Atlas"", the film's base novel remains a book impossible to be adapted","Playing with its own structure by bringing the narration (one of many) from an editor who condemns the constant use of flashbacks and flashforwards, the project is skillful in formatting a structure that flows well from one plot to another - something also benefited by the exceptional editing. By Alexander Berner, who creates a series of elegant cuts through time: in an instant, for example, someone knocks on the door of the abbess played by Susan Sarandon in the 24th century and the actress opens the door centuries earlier, like another character, while that, in another moment, two characters cross a bridge between two buildings in future Seoul while a slave walks the mast of a ship in the 19th century. Likewise, the use of several narrators throughout the projection rarely sounds intrusive, offering, in instead, a multiplicity of points of view that complement the theme of the project well.Of course, analyzed individually, the stories told by the three directors often sound silly and disposable, but the virtue of Cloud Atlas lies precisely in finding the necessary relevance when combining them into a larger narrative. Thus, if the escapades of a group of old people in 2012 represent nonsense, seeing them associated with the conspiracy of an oil company in the 70s and the overwhelming dystopia of the 22nd century sheds new light on everything by establishing a pattern that presents us with to individuals fighting for freedom against an oppressive and cruel system. Incidentally, a careful analysis will also reveal more intimate connections between the various passages, which is admirable: Pastor Zachry (Hanks) follows the teachings left by the ""slave"" Sonmi, who watches a film based on the misadventures of editor Timothy Cavendish ( Broadbent), who reads a manuscript that tells the story of journalist Luisa Rey (Berry), who reads letters sent by composer Robert Frobisher (Whishaw), who reads a book written by abolitionist Adam Ewing (Sturgess) - a ladder of connections that the narrative (admirably) doesn't try to make it obvious, forcing the viewer to pay extra attention to the plots.All the stories surprisingly connect, but there is no ""master mystery"", which would be usual in television series or films of the genre. The connection is much more subtle yet powerful, suggesting karmic relationships and past lives (every action, good or bad, performed in one lifetime will be reflected in the next). It is also curious how, in addition to the spiritual side, there is a way to make everything more physical, throwing a bit of chaos theory into the blender as well. Even Carlos Castañeda is quoted, highlighting influences from Neoshamanism and New Age in the new work, among others. Mixing philosophy with an established genre, after all, is something the Wachowskis had already successfully accomplished in ""The Matrix (1999)"". Here, however, the duo and Tykwer go much further, giving this outfit to no less than half a dozen types of films. And to unify the whole, giving an extra dose of recognition to the isolated parts, the same cast was used throughout the film. One of the most interesting aspects of the feature film was the way in which the directors dared to use the same actors in all the stories, making this great cast deliver incredible performances, be it Halle Berry playing a white Jew, an elderly woman or an investigative journalist, Tom Hanks as a revolutionary who has visions of a demon (Hugo Weaving, reprising several characters who resemble his eternal Mr. Smith from The Matrix) or the fake doctor who wants to steal Jim Sturgess's gold in the first sequel. Sturgess also plays an Asian, as well as Korean Doona Bae, who plays a revolutionary and martyr of the future as a submissive Westerner in the past. All of this through an extremely accomplished and believable make-up that, at times, deceives so well that we cannot directly identify the actor who is under it.This technical and narrative choice by the directors, however attractive it may be from a scenic point of view (allowing actors of the caliber of Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent, for example, to create several completely different characters in the same production), ends up taking away a little the focus of the story, with the audience finding themselves in a game of ""guess who?"" with each of those figures. This game is encouraged by the film itself, which asks people not to leave the room before seeing who is playing in the credits. The loss of focus occurs especially in the most bizarre transformations, such as Hugo Weaving as an Asian who chases Somni-451 and also playing a sadistic nurse who terrorizes the editor played by Broadbent. If, on the one hand, this serves to highlight the static character of some souls (mainly with Weaving, always emerging as an agent determined to maintain the status quo), the feeling of estrangement with some of these escalations creates a noise that distracts the viewer from a story hugely dependent on your ability to piece together the puzzle that forms that narrative.The adaptation of David Mitchell's literary work was called unfilmable for many years until it fell into the hands of Andy and Lana Wachowski and Tom Tykwer. The trio transformed the six stories told linearly in the book into a far-fetched plot that comes and goes making different connections over time. Incidentally, it is clear that the work inspired the directors, since there are many of the films mentioned during Cloud Atlas, especially the futuristic sequences that imply revolutions regarding the truth and how every act has a consequence, whether in the past or in a distant time. It is true that despite exceptional performances, direction and editing, the result of the narrative may fall a little short of what was expected by the stories themselves. Or rather, by their connections. Some are less interesting than others and the connection between them, however plausible and existing, sometimes seems to weaken the narrative as a whole. It is also difficult to understand the need to put so many characters on screen, no matter how much you want to establish a connection between them through the same actors. In some sequences, certain types are so useless that they are not needed in the narrative as a whole.There are elements in ""The Journey"" that wave their hands at the audience, seeking to draw them into the Great Theme it tries to develop: there is, for example, the patch on the skin that links the characters of (in chronological order) Jim Sturgees, Ben Whishaw, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Doona Bae and Tom Hanks - but what does this mean? Could they be reincarnations of the same soul? (Something that the prominence of Seoul, which phonetically resembles ""soul"" - or soul - would justify.) Or would the idea behind the production be to defend our evolution as a species over time? (Notice how the character of Tom Hanks chronologically becomes a better person.) It's hard to say exactly what the Wachowski brothers and Tom Tykwer had in mind when embracing this project, although it is clear that in every plot there is someone determined to leave some legacy and that, however much we evolve technologically, our nature is essentially destructive (which explains why in the more distant future we return to horses and arrows, even as we continue to fight). It's not a unique or original message, of course - and the three filmmakers acknowledge their predecessors by making references to In the World 2020 (when a character shouts ""Soylent Green is people!"", anticipating a third-act reveal) and Fahrenheit 451 (Doona Bae's ""prophet"" - sighs - is called Sonmi-451). This, however, does not diminish the strength of the work, which also finds space to establish Love as an operating force in the evolution of humanity, using for these all possible and imaginable types of possible progressive narratives: subjugation of blacks, homosexual relationships, Asian characters, slave labor, immigration, among others.The result, in the end, is a melting pot that mixes cinematographic genres, philosophy, spirituality, absurd theories, primitivism, nihilism, and a bunch of social awareness themes, such as concern for the environment, gender equality, anti-armament propaganda, the good and bad consequences of technological advances, nuclear threats, the inborn evil of man, etc. Perhaps an attempt to unite science-fiction, cyberpunk culture, religion and philosophy, as the directors did before in The Matrix (The Matrix, 1999), only this time with bigger holes. And if the intention was to make this overview of everything and everyone, in order to finally appear as a work of universal and timeless scope, what ends up really standing out is the curiosity for the parallel between this daring project with the lately well-commented personal life of one of the directors. Back in The Matrix, we called him Larry Wachowski and today, after sex reassignment surgery, we can call her Lana. It is impossible not to associate a film that portrays, among so many themes, closeted homosexuality and the identity crisis, in addition to the body changes experienced by the actors in each role replicated at different points in the timeline, in addition to discussing the world and its drastic metamorphoses, with all the media hype about Lana's transition. Perhaps Lana wants to show how everything is intertwined, while always changing and adapting, reaffirming her position as the now only great transsexual director in Hollywood - and because of that we have a film that is extravagant, metamorphic, delirious with ambition, but unfortunately so out of line and without a sense of ridicule. Culminating in an extremely long, tiresome and superb adaptation, the chance was missed and ""Cloud Atlas"", the film's base novel, written by David Mitchell, remains a book impossible to adapt intact and integrally.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overdose of politically correct,"Contrary to what some pretentious director may believe, one may understand a movie and still not like it. That is the case with Cloud Atlas, which mixes 6 average stories to prove that: the soul survives; soulmates do exist and white people are evil.The 6 scrambled but linked plots are book-ended by the story taking place in a low-tech post-apocalyptic future. Cowardly Zachry, played by Tom Hanks, lives with a tribe that worships a deity called Sonmi-451 and is constantly menaced by savage Kona barbarians. Despite his fear, Hanks helps a member of a more advanced group, played by Halle Berry, to launch a signal for the evacuation of what is left of mankind to another planet.This story contains the only unsolved mystery: how did Zachry's village even come to exist, considering the brutal, random Kona assaults. Also, as an added annoying bonus, Zachry has ""visions"" of the devil (played by poor Hugo Weaving, who is the villain in all the stories).In a movie this long and complicated, ""visions"" are the last thing one needs.The other story in chronological order are: in 1849 a lawyer sailing back home saves a stow away Afro-American, who strangely happens to live in a South Pacific island inhabited by Maoris. All the villains on board are white, so once back at home the lawyer decided to join the abolitionists. Also, the lawyer is married to a read-headed, freckled oriental woman (this is linked to the soulmate concept).In 1936 the love story of a gay couple is destroyed by suicide. The link with the previous story is the diary written by the lawyer and read by one of the lovers.In 1973, Berry plays a journalist who meets the remaining half of the gay couple and gets involved in a story that looks like blacksploitation with nothing to do with the rest of the movie, apart from proving that white people are bad.In 2012, an elderly publisher gets locked up in a retirement home, but manages to escape. The evil nurse of the home is played by Weaver, who looks nothing like a woman - albeit a very masculine one. The link to the previous story is a house. This story tries to offer some comic relief, but it is not very funny.In a dystopian future, in South Korea, a female clone named Sonmi-451 goes through the same plot line of The Matrix, albeit in a more condensed time-frame. Chosen by a revolutionary group for reasons impossible to understand, Sonmi-451 discovers that the world is not what it seems and that humans deserve to know the truth, only to get the group attacked by the authorities and herself in danger. She also falls for her saviour, played by Jim Sturgess (who's the lawyer married to the oriental redhead).All characters in each segment are played by the same bunch of actors, which means Berry gets to play a Caucasian blonde, Jim Sturgess is badly disguised as ""oriental"" and Korean Doona Bae plays both Sonmi-451 and a weird- looking redhead.In fact, the make-up is excessive to the point of distraction More than the idea of souls surviving and meeting again, one gets politically correct characters shoved down the throat - with the constant of Hugo Weaving, white male and incarnation of evil.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An engaging movie that requires that the viewer wants to think about concepts,"I went to see the movie with mixed expectations. I had read reviews beforehand that warned of a messy plot line with multiple stories. I was positively surprised on how untrue that was. The stories play well out in terms of pacing and characters. There are a lot of them in total, but each part (or you could say ""act"") has only a couple central characters, like you would expect from any typical story. The different stories are very easy to follow because they are so different, yet they are the same on many levels. I specially like how the film expects you to think. You can watch this movie just for the visuals, but to really appreciate it, you need to think what happened and because of what. Some reviews I've read say that the stories are not connected. I would say that if that is how you feel, you did not pay attention at all and were expecting the movie to give everything pre-chewed to you. Instead the movie expects to you to fill the missing bits, notice references between the stories and to imagine what has happened between the transitions from one story to another. There is even an exchange of lines in the movie which can pretty much be summed up as the characters saying to the audience that we won't tell you everything, you can imagine and fill the blanks yourselves. The movie has a message and after you've processed the stories, it should be quite obvious. It might not be exactly the same message as I got, but still. Music and sound effects were good, not exceptional or bad, but satisfying and did their part well. The locations and visual effects were really nice and at times stunning, fitting for the events that transpired and interesting. Acting was good, the characters were played well and the actors fit their roles neatly. My only criticism is about the masking - same actors played different roles and genders, and the masking department had not been up to the task at all times. Or maybe it is that I perceive female actors playing male characters and vice versa a bit hard to digest due to the different body/facial structures of genders. I would recommend the movie if you want to see something that requires paying attention and ability to concentrate for nearly three hours, but in exchange gives food for your thought and imagination.

The Weight of the World,"Cloud Atlas is an audacious avalanche of ideas that it took three directors to deliver. Arguably overlong and of uneven tone, perhaps the film's greatest strength is that it begs the question 'Is it not more important to have ideas than to have successful ideas.' Then again, it is too easy to dismiss novel projects in this vein as being over-complicated when they should be lauded for taking the risk to attempt something different. As ever, Tom Hanks hardly puts a foot wrong in what seem to be the most testing of roles, and Halle Berry is equally effective in convincing the viewer to swallow some huge conceits. Jims Sturgess and Broadbent appear comfortable with the tall notions that abound, and there are equally effective turns from Ben Wishaw, James D'Arcy and Hugo Weaving, who always looks like he is having tremendous fun. Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Keith David and David Gyasi also deserve a mention for their significant contribution, but it's hard to argue against Doona Bae being at the film's heart, her performance in the futuristic Neo Seoul capturing fragility while showing strength, and displaying both dignity and determination. Bae and Sturgess deliver as many emotional scenes as Hanks and Berry, and deserve high praise for it. Viewing Cloud Atlas, I would argue that, in cinema, the end is not necessarily to present a coherent outcome, but to generate contemplation of what the outcome might be, or of the path followed to reach it. In the end, Cloud Atlas could be seen as being failing under the weight of too many cinematic genres, with the comic strand in particular tending to jar against the drama and tension around it, but the writers and directors are to be commended for attempting such an ambitious project, that delivers much in the way of thoughtful cinema and compelling performance.

It keeps building and building until by film's end I was totally in love with it!,"'CLOUD ATLAS': Five Stars (Out of Five)This enormously ambitious epic Sci-Fi masterpiece is the type of life changing experience that's so inspirational and emotionally moving that it will forever change the lives of anyone who views it. That's my opinion but that's how I feel about all of my favorite films. This movie, like a lot of great films, is adapted from a book (of the same name). The book was written by David Mitchell and released in 2004 to high critical praise. It was admired greatly by Natalie Portman and brought to the attention of directors Andy and Lana Wachowski on the set of 'V FOR VENDETTA', a film the three were working on together in 2005. The Wachowski siblings loved it so much that they bought the rights to the film adaptation and promised Portman a lead role as a character named Sonmi-451. Portman had to give up the role, to actress Doona Bae, at the last second due to her pregnancy. An all star cast including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Hugh Grant, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Keith David, Susan Sarandon and Hugo Weaving (a Wachowski regular) joined Bae in the cast (all playing multiple characters of different races and sexes). The Wachowskis teamed with German director Tom Tykwer (of 'RUN LOLA RUN' fame) to both write and direct the film. It consists of six interwoven stories that span from the 1849 Chatham Islands all the way to a future post-apocalyptic Earth. The Wachowskis directed three stories and Tykwer directed the other three (from a co-written script) using entirely different crews on different sets but with the same actors. The stories play out simultaneously in the film jumping back and forth constantly while only developing each one for minutes at a time (if that).In the earliest story Sturgess plays Adam Ewing, an American lawyer who travels to the Chatham Islands in 1849 (from San Francisco) to finish a business deal for his father-in-law (Weaving). While there his heart goes out to a tribe of slaves, especially one who stows away on his ship (David Gyasi). The second story focuses on Robert Frobisher (Whishaw), a poor English musician in love with another man (D'Arcy) who's hired by a famous composer (Broadbent), in Scotland in 1936, to serve as his amanuensis. While working for the composer he develops his own musical masterpiece he calls 'The Cloud Atlas Sextet'. The third story tells the story of a journalist named Luisa Rey (Berry) who's assigned a story on a nuclear power plant in San Francisco in 1975. With the help of a nuclear physicist (D'Arcy playing the same role from the prior story, when he's much older) she uncovers a conspiracy plot involving the power plant and is marked for murder. The fourth story stars Broadbent once again, this time as a publicist named Timothy Cavendish (in 2012 United Kingdom) who's on the run from the mob friends of an author he published (Hanks), recently incarcerated for murder. He flees to his brother (Grant) for help and ends up locked up in a nursing home against his will, which he's bent on escaping from. The fifth story is set in future Korea in 2144 focusing on a clone named Sonmi-451 (Bae). Clones like her are slaves genetically engineered to serve in fast-food restaurants until they're no longer needed and killed. With the help of a young rebel (Sturgess playing an Asian, which has drew controversy) she escapes and brings about a revolution. The last story has Hanks starring as a tribesman named Zachry living in a primitive post-apocalyptic future, on an island in Hawaii, after most life has been wiped out. One of the last of the technologically advanced past, named Meronym (Berry), visits his tribe and saves his niece from dying (of illness). He agrees to guide her through the mountains to a post known as Cloud Atlas, where she can communicate with others who have left the planet.I at first did not like the way the stories jumped around so quickly. I didn't think it left the viewer enough time to get to know the characters and storyline of one story before jumping to another, making it much more confusing (than if it had been told in a more linear fashion). By the films end though the non-linear style was much more of an advantage to the movie in pacing, excitement as well as emotional involvement. For a good half of the movie I was disappointed in it because it was impossible to follow and a little boring. As it kept moving along though it got more and more interesting and exciting and kept building and building until by film's end I was totally in love with it. The conclusion is such an emotionally drenched and inspiring finish that it makes the entire, nearly three hour movie, pay off. You also understand the film a lot more, from beginning to end, once it's finished. It still requires multiple viewings and I'll probably see it at least a couple more times. I'm sure upon repeat viewing I'll appreciate the earlier, slower paced, scenes much more (that's the sign of a great movie). The acting, cinematography, makeup, set design, effects, directing and writing are all top notch. The score is also amazing (by one of the directors, Tykwer, as well as Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil) and probably the best I've heard all year. For me movies are all about moments (just like life is). I go to movies in search of great moments and that's what makes it stand out or not. Those moments also make everything else in between that much more important (just like life as well). This movie is full of many great and beautiful moments and that's why it's such a beautiful and important film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QlrJnwsHOM",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie Review: Cloud Atlas..doesn't scale much heights,"There is an interesting TV series these days, called The Touch..which covers how we are all connected in ways we can't imagine and while its nothing out of the ordinary it beautifully creates all the links to put across a coherent story at the end of 45 minutes. Cloud Atlas..is the exact opposite to thatWhat Cloud Atlas delivers is a journey that transcends multiple lives across centuries and then keeps flitting back and forth between them enough to make your head spin. When you tell such a complex tale you need to help the audience connect the dots and follow the plot in wondrous fascination (read movies like Crash and Inception) but Cloud Atlas is merciless in that department. After spending an agonizing 164 minutes, you are still as clueless as ever and wondering what to connect with what. In fact, you would be forgiven to believe that if you took any 6 random lives and drew them up together like this you'll probably see this much connect anywaysThe real hero of this terribly long tale is the, often ignored, make-up department. Most of the time your favourite activity while watching the movie is figuring out who amongst Tom Hanks, Hugh Grant, Halle Berry and the others are you really watching right now. So marvelous is the make up and presentation, that it takes a while to realize that the punk writer you are watching is really Hanks or that the savage you see on screen now is really Hugh Grant under awesome make up and prosthetics. Two thumbs up for thatWith such a stellar cast the performances are bound to be good and they are. The entire cast play their multiple complex roles to perfection, no exceptions. The music and background score which ideally should have played a more integral role given the context of the movie is beautiful but limited.At the end of it all, Cloud Atlas may be a wonderful story penned by British author David Mitchell(in all fairness, I haven't read it yet). But the lack of connect and the rather ambitious attempt of telling too much of this tale all at once, makes this movie a rather tedious and unsatisfying watch. Other than the make-up, Cloud Atlas didn't scale much heights for me..whether this journey is still worth your while is up to youTo read my reviews on other movies check out my blog at http://www.anitalks.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just simply amazing. Redefines what you can do in telling a story on film.,"The Wachowski's Cloud Atlas... Where do I even begin. It's by far my favourite film of 2012, a rousing, titanic epic that's so ambitious it seems to transcend the boundaries of cinema and go to places I've never seen the medium venture before. A film usually transports you to one setting, and captivates, you at least for a while there, if it's lucky. This one transports you to freaking six, wildly different, equally transfixing periods of time in history, each one compelling in its own way. The excellent group of actors all play at least 6 different characters, all reincarnated into different timelines, crisscrossing each other's paths, fighting here, and maybe becoming lovers there, hundreds of years down the road. It's a monumental concept that could have wildly gone off the rails and become bombastic. Despite its lofty ambition, it wields itself in a fluid, cohesive manner, every moment, interaction and intersection of character and fate in service of its momentous, forward moving, intricate chain of events that just demands multiple viewings. I've seen it over five times and still am discovering secret wonders that one only begins to unearth upon careful inspection and loving care in observing its wonders. It's over three hours left long, and yet doesn't drag for one single second, every moment a cog in its own grand design, every detail speaking volumes. The actors are to be applauded endlessly, some of them leaping right outside their comfort zone to bring the tale to life. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry take centre stage and frazzle us with performances that have to be seen to be believed, each portraying different people, Hanks from a psycho Irish boxer, to a sly 1800's doctor, to a creole speaking nomad in my favourite of the stories, so far in the future that technology has fallen and humans resort to earthen, primal ways (cue the welcome Waterworld references). Berry rocks it mostly as Luisa Rey, an intrepid, 1970's reporter laying waste to a corrupt oil executive with nasty plans played by a deliciously smarmy Hugh Grant. Grant is a prick in every single role of his, and you haven't lived until you've seen him play the face painted chieftain of a cannibalistic tribe. Ben Withshaw plays Robert Frobisher (among others), in the 1930's, my least favourite of the segments, a composer responsible for the haunting sextet that gives the film its title, with tragic aplomb that meets the tone of his composition. In a fascist, neo futuristic South Korea, a replicant slave (Doona Bae will bring you to tears) discovers her true purpose, awakened by a freedom fighter played by Jim Sturgess (you'll cry for different reasons when you see the makeup job to try an make him look Asian lol), who also plays an 1800's lawyer on a dangerous voyage home across many seas to meet his beloved (also Bae, in ginger getup). Hugo Weaving particularly stands out as always, playing everyone from a devilish Willy Wonka, to a brutal Korean secret secret police operative, and a role so fitfully hilarious I won't spoil it for you here. Jim Broadbent gets the comic relief in a powerhouse as Timothy Cavendish, a rapscallion publisher who finds himself on a heartwarming odyssey across the UK that brings to mind lighter moments of Monty Python, and is a highlight among the episodes. Starting to get the picture? I could literally got on for pages about how many different people the fearless actors play, but I want to leave it to you to explore the absolute rush of cinematic enjoyment that this is, an emotional blast of adrenaline powered storytelling that flows like galaxies above us. I could also be a moron and try to dissect the themes for you, but I'll instead leave it to one of Susan Sarandon's incarnations, prophetically and eerily imparting to us: ""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future."". Or as one of Hank's incarnations goes: ""Belief, like fear or love, is a force to be understood as we understand the Theory of Relativity and Principles of Uncertainty: phenomenon that determine the course of our lives. Yesterday, my life was headed in one direction. Today, it is headed in another. Yesterday I believed that I would never have done what I did today. These forces that often remake time and space, that can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be, begin long before we are born and continue after we perish. Our lives and our choices, like quantum trajectories, are understood moment to moment. At each point of intersection, each encounter suggests a new potential direction."". Like I said, I could ramble forever. Just trust me when I say, it's a special, special film. One that's daring enough to function on its own wavelength that some may not quite be able to tune in to, but for those that can, or choose to, it's a profound work of art that, like I said, transcends the notions of what is possible with this medium and makes us feel something that reaches past the blink of of our mortal lives here, into the deep pool of our ancestral thought and memory, and gives us a glimpse of what's beyond, the hypothetical 'bigger picture', if you will. Or maybe I'm just senile. It's up to you to watch this and decide.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Beautiful, Funny, Moving, Thought Provoking, Flawed","Saw a midnight showing of this film and was up all night thinking about it. Now, almost 12 hours later, I am finally forming some thoughts about it and I have to say: the majority are positive, and the whole of me really thinks everybody should see this movie, if only because it will give you so much to think about.From a review perspective, there is a lot that is good: the visuals, the pacing, the bulk of the script. As a fan of the book, was there stuff I missed? Characters, episodes, conversations- sure. But I get that it had to be cut down and re-shaped to make it work as a film, and I think it does work. In some ways it is even more powerful, helping to bring home a lot of the inter-connected elements of the novel's nesting stories with an extra dramatic punch that only something like film can really provide. If there are occasional mis-steps, they are in moments when it gets a little too heavy handed and for me this is really confined to the ending- the final moments of both Zachry's and Adam's stories feel just a bit too layered on, almost as if the film makers were afraid we wouldn't get it. Ironic, since the film demands so much from its audience (it's in no way a passive movie experience) up to that point, and maybe the intention was to, in some ways, ease the audience out of the three hours of wildly engaging cinema they had been subjected to.The performances run the gamut from decent (Tom Hanks) to solid (Halle Berry) to good (Keith David, James D'arcy) to inspired (Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturgess)to the brilliant (Ben Whishaw, Jim Broadbent, Doona Bae). Is the make-up occasionally distracting? Yes, but often it's supposed to be, with the men of New Seoul, for instance, looking utterly strange and phony next to the all-too-human female fabricants, and the ridiculous 70's haircuts slyly reminding you that Luisa Reyes' story is told through the eyes of a precocious young novelist. Sometimes the make-up is startlingly good- Broadbent, for instance, is completely unrecognizable as the 19th century ship captain, and Xun Zhou disappears into her role as Tom Hank's sister in the far far future. Like every other aspect of this movie, it's one more piece of a puzzle that is by turns utterly sincere and completely tongue-in-cheek.And in the end, that's what allows this movie to transcend some its flaws: for every mis-step, there is a bullseye, and it leaves you wondering if even some of the ""mistakes"" or ""oversights"" are part of the equation, intentionally done to make you think harder about what you just saw. Some of the stories feel dense and rich, some feel shallow and pulpy- but all of them are compelling and watchable and leave you wanting more. The over-all impression is one of a myriad of complex and diverse indivdiuals, who in their brief moments all contribute to a larger impression of humanity as a whole, of life as an experience, of the universe and history composed of many tiny points of light, each intrinsically valuable, but only truly catching your eye for a moment, usually as one falls to its death, or breaks from its fixed place to wander. The statement is deeply compelling, but what is more remarkable is how each element of the movie structurally upholds that core statement, as no one person or tale is allowed to upstage another (though of course, some elements will call stronger to some viewers), but the piece as a whole could not be as effective without each of them.It's a remarkably ambitious work of art, in both what it is trying to say and how it is trying to say it, and it's not for everybody. That, for me, makes me like it even more: it seems rare that such a big budget, star spangled film should take so many risks, and be so uncompromising. In light of that, I think it's something people should see, even if they hate it. Liking a work of art is less important than if we're stimulated by it, and I can't imagine anyone seeing this film and not having something to talk about afterwards.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing cinematic experience!,"Finally, yesterday I went and saw it. Cloud Atlas is one of the most ambitious and most amazing movies I've ever seen. This is the Masterpiece with the capital 'M', which makes you shiver, once you grasp the greatness of it all. The only downside I can think of it, is that you have to watch it till the last minute to truly embrace it. You got to catch all the small notes to make it coherent as a symphony. Pay attention to all the hints, that directors left to connect SIX different stories in to an epic about good and evil, karma and immortality of the soul, about the essence of humanity. If you are able to accomplish that - it rewards you with emotional, philosophical and, nonetheless, entertaining experience in the best tradition of the Watchowski brothers. Bravo! 10/10P.S. I don't respond to the criticism of this movie if one can't even connect those SIX stories. It's just the top layer of The Cloud Atlas and there is much much more than that!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretentious indulgence,"Twyker and the Wachowskis: typical wonders of movie cultdom in the '90s, coughed up this indigestible conglomeration of ""heightened"" scenes posing as a major movie, with a telltale hint of how filmmaking has deteriorated in having 25, count 'em, producers credited. Audiences rejected this nonsense upon release, and so do I, watching it tardily a dozen years late via Paramount+. It did have a useful result -helping to end the movie careers of all 3 would-be auteurs.An endless series of lousy makeup gimmicks for the famous cast members immediately turned me off, but very, very early on I lost interest completely when the directing trio had the temerity to ripoff one of my favorite all-time films (made for TV that is): Ken Russell's ""Song of Summer"".

a new addition to my personal top 10 list,"It's been easily more than a decade since a new (or old) film edged its way into my personal top 10. Cloud Atlas did just that though.If there's any justice, Cloud Atlas wins Oscars for at least screenplay and editing. At least. I'm a film editor by trade; I like to think I've got a clue or two about editing. Cloud Atlas is a film editing masterwork. And I don't say that lightly.This film is unique. To my knowledge, this type of storytelling hasn't been attempted in film before. The closest is perhaps Christopher Nolan's 2000 film Momento, but Cloud Atlas makes the non-continuity technique work seamlessly. It's just beautiful.This is a film by adults, for adults. It's no summer blockbuster aimed at 14 yo boys. It's far more, and far greater. Sit back, open your mind, and let the film come to you. Contrary to many of the reviews, this film isn't too long, and it's not at all difficult to understand. If you'll have some patience and give it your attention, it's not even difficult to follow.Best film of the year. Best film of the decade. Hats off to the Wachowskis and Tykwer. Well done. Well done indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Important thing to get into the Cloud,"Don't do like me and work too hard on guessing which souls are which in each time period, because it's almost always different ""soulmate"" couples that are featured and a major character in one life might be extremely minor or even dead in another life. Tom Hank's characters are easy to point out, but it's not so easy for the other lesser-known actors. So, that being said, the stories take place in 6 time periods in different locations ranging from 1849 to 2321, 2 of which might be considered science-fiction. The characters in each story, that are alternating and not linear one after the other, are souls that reincarnate and are somehow linked together. Those 6 intertwined stories are simple easy-to-follow affairs provided you don't think too much about identities on the first viewing. By themselves, they are of different genres (comedy, drama, action, sci-fi, romance, historical) sometimes combining (example: sci-fi romance). They are interesting, but not great. Few of those would have the potential for a feature-length film.Cloud Atlas is a bold, ambitious project with decent directing by the 3 directors, but it's moderately successful in its impact. I didn't find it too confusing and sometimes even clever in how it transitioned. I think what doesn't help the emotional impact is that it's not the same couple of souls being featured in each time frame. Some might find it a strength, I felt as if it unfocused and hindered character build-up and evolution. I would have preferred more emphasis on 3 or 4 characters instead of the dozen there was, but I have to keep in mind it's a book adaptation and it probably worked better in book format. The acting was OK, nothing great, with the highlights being Ed Broadbent (the old guy) and the main Asian actress. It was a difficult undertaking, but sometimes the makeup really failed and actually detracted from story immersion (Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving, as that woman was horrible). The film is obviously a commercial failure and I find it silly to lambaste a film for that. It might become a cult film and I wouldn't mind seeing it again although I didn't adore it. I think it's worth watching at least twice.Rating: 7 out of 10 (Very good)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A majestic tribute to fighters against exploitation,"A majestic tribute to all those who fight against the exploitation of people and their shortcomings. Or even a homage to rebels against past conventions. It's basically the Matrix in six different flavours, not only conceptually, but also dramatically and especially visually.In addition to the central message about the responsibility of each individual for the development of society, the creators did not forget to highlight the contribution of investigative journalists or remind indifference of people to the climate crisis.Intertwining stories also present rather fascinating multi-roles of actors, among which Hugo Weaving stood out for me, whom I would dare to compare to Johnny Depp from Wish.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An attempt to make a complicated master piece that failed,"I went to watch this movie with high expectations, and I didn't get what I wanted completely. So I'll explain you what not to expect in this movie, so you enjoy watching it thoroughly. After watching the trailer, I always asked my self how can such a movie suffer from not-so-good box office results? Well, after watching the movie itself, I got my answer. It now seems reasonable to me why this movie didn't sell that good: It tries to be a complicated masterpiece, but it fails to do so. I will first explain the good part then I'll get into what the movie fails at.The movie switches between 6 different story-lines in different times and even different genres of film-making! with characters having connections to characters in other story-lines. With same actors changing makeup and play different roles in different timelines. This is to give you an Inception-like feeling of connection between characters of different stories, possibly through reincarnation. This kind of movie making certainly pushed the directors and makeup artist and virtually everyone in the crew to their limits, to put all of their talent on the table. And frankly, with a few exceptions, they do a magnificent job.The movie tries to bring a complicated plot; One that you could view over and over again and with each viewing, you get new things out of it. But it fails to do so. The connections between the characters are few and simple, with almost none of them having any influence in the game. Basically the movie is 6 stories apart from each other, glued to each other to make one movie to make you feel they're related. They also mention exciting concepts like 'dejavu', 'time-space continuum', 'quantum physics' and 'Heisenberg uncertainty' here and there, but the concepts are only mentioned briefly often in a wrong way and actually have nothing to do with the movie! It's like they were not smart enough to put them in plot so just mentioned them on the pass so the audience feels there is something complicated going on there, while there is not! The actors playing multiple roles is a nice idea but unlike Inception, there is usually no reason behind it! But it's nice to see actors playing different roles in so diverse universes in one movie, and they do their job well, except a few casts are ridiculous (The Asian actor playing a blonde blue-eyed French girl and Hugo Weaving (agent Smith in the Matrix) playing the hollow in the post-apocalyptic timeline).All in all this is one of those movies that tries to look smart by putting a lot of open questions and unexplained connections to make the viewer wonder, and make a bold undertaking by mixing 6 timelines, but it ends up not doing its homework well.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pointless. Confusing. Time Consuming.  Money Pit.,"What is this movie about exactly? It is a meshing of several stories. Six and a seventh. You will ask yourself, how do I keep track? The trouble is, you can't. I suggest going to Wicki on the Internet and read the synopsis. Only then will you glimpse the meaning of this movie. A science fiction piece? Perhaps. It is about lives intertwining through time by karma or something else. It's just shy of three hours. Think you can sit your way through something that long before you begin to ask yourself, what am I doing? Granted, the acting is great. The cinematography is great. They spent oodles of money on this project. About 140 million. It shows. You can't complain about the production being of quality. But if you are no nonsense and demand clarity of a storyline, this won't easily yield anything. You are going to have to come up with significance for yourself. This isn't going to tell you what to think. The most interesting story of the six is the one of the futuristic Fabricants. Now, that is science fiction and that ""part"" was edgy and captivating. It could stand alone as a small movie by itself. Of the six this is the one worth mentioning. I suggest you ask yourself if you can afford three hours of your time without really having any satisfaction. If the answer is yes, go ahead and watch this.

The film that started my philosophical interest.,"If there was ever a film that I could say got me into analyzing and figuring out the deeper meanings behind a film, it would be Cloud Atlas. Welcome ladies and gentlemen and today I'm going to be writing my very first review which would be for Cloud Atlas if you haven't guessed already. I remember a year ago looking into this film on a top 10 list and it really intrigued me. Something about the style and look of the film caught my eye. I did some research about it and found out just how complex it was. The film is about 6 interconnected story's about different people in different locations and different time periods.The film even before watching the actual movie just hooked me. Its story was so complex, interesting, and thought provoking I wanted to figure how the story's are all connected. If I were to describe how the film is connected I would have to say the characters souls are connected. Your probably wondering what I mean by that, Cloud Atlas's main cast each play in the same stories. The difference between the actors characters is... pretty much everything except for the characters souls. For example, Tom Hanks in the first story (in chronological order of the time periods) plays a greedy doctor and is the villain in that story. In the sixth story however, Hanks plays the main protagonist and is the hero of that story. That example I just showed you tells you that the soul of Tom Hank's character is reincarnated. If there's anything to describe the interconnections its that the soul gets reincarnated into another body. Not all the characters change from bad to good however, some stay good throughout the whole movie some stay bad throughout the whole movie. The film has such amazing visuals and a great set of characters. The movie talks about slavery, good and evil, and how our choices and actions affect the future. It grips you right in the first 10 minutes or so when they show you one scene from each story in chronological order.If you want to know my obsession with Cloud Atlas I basically watched the trailer nearly 20 times, it was so engrossing. It took me a while to seek the film out and while I was doing that I looked at charts and graphs to see how all the characters were interconnected. The main reason this film spoke to me so much was the fact that it got me into complex, thought provoking films, it is the film that started my love for incredibly deep themes. I owe so much to Cloud Atlas, I bought it on Blu-ray and in total I saw it 3 times and I wish to see it more times. Its also a film that whenever I watch it I always love it and I always take something new out of it. I have no problem giving Cloud Alas my highest rating and I'm looking forward to making more reviews. Thank you for reading my first review. Thank you and Goodbye.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A collection of short stories don't automatically make an epic film, especially when they're poorly linked","Three hours is a long time when you don't really know what the point's gonna be, and eventually what it was supposed to be.Without spoilering, the anticipated twist that ought to fulfill the claim that ""everything is connected"" doesn't really connect much, except through a cinematic gimmick about storytelling (which I didn't really get until watching a few of the disc's extras afterwards). So much for the intertwined story, which wouldn't be so bad except trying to figure that out keeps you busy most of the movie.Don't get me wrong, the various stories throughout time are entertaining and sometimes even intriguing, but I can't help feel some of them could've been any other story for all the same.

It's not enough to grab the audience.What I did really like is how every era not only has its own story, but also its own style.

Still entranced one month after viewing,"This is one the greatest films ever made.Obviously, this movie is not for everyone. By this point in time, word is out that this movie is incredibly complex, difficult to absorb, and unlike anything you've ever seen. This is a large part of the reason the film ""flopped"" and is considered to be a waste by many (meanwhile Michael Bay's 'Transformers' franchise continues to gross in the billions). From a film-student critical analysis, the movie fails because of it's refusal to adhere to many of the standard movie tricks that keep the viewer oriented...or even interested. The movie has no discernible rising action, the movie has no climax, and the movie certainly is void of any traditional resolution or conclusion.The reason I feel that this movie is such a triumph is the same reason I feel I lead a fulfilling life. I strive to live in the moment...to view my journey in life as exactly that: a journey. Life is about experiencing, not arriving at a destination. Sure, Cloud Atlas's six stories very cleverly interweave similar events ands themes throughout; a reason why repeat viewings are not only advisable but absolutely necessary. There is also the fascinating acting and makeup from a set of actors reprising similar characters in each of the six stories. This feat alone is awe- inspiring as to how perfectly executed this was. MY point is that these stories are told with such mastery that the movie succeeds so completely if viewed from the perspective that it isn't necessarily going to ""arrive"" anywhere. It doesn't have to. I found myself hoping that the movie would never end, that the stories would just continue being told and experiencing all these beautiful moments...as that is where the most true joy of life itself comes from: experiencing this moment.There is so much to be said thematically about these stories and the artful way in which they are told and then retold: human kind's triumph of it's kindness over greed, karma, the desire to be free, the tragedy of bondage, the inevitable progression of technology and it's consequences, the existence of deities, the urge to survive, and most of all, love. I am writing this having seen the movie only once. After a second viewing I suspect I will take notice of even more clever connections between the stories and characters, and the same for my third viewing and so on.Anyone who dismissed this film as ""overly-complicated"", ""confusing"", or ""disorganized"" has simply not yet arrived at the realization that life isn't about some grand finale.

A Tour de Force for All!,"This is probably one of the most ambitious movies ever made. Thematically speaking, the film adaptation of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas is about as spiritually and richly provocative as could be imagined.With tour de force performances from every one of its actors is not merely a gimmick. Rather, the multiple roles are meant to illustrate the core themes about evolutionary nature and the actors do so in an exemplary fashion. This is a new form of storytelling that deftly weaves together six different plot lines across the same number of genres including adventure, romance, thriller and comedy.The science fiction cyber-punk aspects also admirably blend across 1849 through 2346 far more effortlessly and seamlessly than one would think possible.""I will not be subjected to criminal abuse,"" proclaims several of the protagonists. Each character's struggle for freedom is punctuated by their present day and past actions.Whether or not Cloud Atlas gets a sufficient mass audience to feel the same way will depend upon many things. The world has become much more cynical. As villain Hugo Weaving says, ""There is a natural order to this world, and those who try to upend it do not fare well."" Indeed, this point is well-documented throughout the entire film.""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb we belong to others. And with every crime and every kindness, we give birth to the future."" The truth is, Cloud Atlas is just the type of movie that the whole world should see and really needs at this point in time.

Beautiful and spectacular!!!,"After a long time i have seen a movie so intriguing and though there is no moral message coming out of the movie, but still it is a thought provoking movie. The best part of the movie is that it doesn't try to tie the stories together as many would have expected. In fact, even when the stories seemed related the directors tried to separate them so that they don't lose the identity. There is no story telling or spoon fed tying of different plots between the stories. The viewer needs to make those logical connections themselves which has made the movie even more beautiful as imagination is with the viewer and not with limited to what the director was thinking while making the movie.I really liked a few scenes and quotes from the movie.

"Creative, ambitious, and incredibly entertaining","I didn't expect much from Cloud Atlas. I certainly expected it to be a mess. And it was a sort of mess, but a surprisingly coherent one. It managed to be entertaining and the stories always made sense in their own style. It wasn't the ambitious failure I expected, and that's because I do think the critics were hard on it. It's certainly no Dune, and if anything, I think it's better than The Matrix. I think the whole cast did a great job, and the film is full of memorable scenes and characters. It's definitely easy to forget a lot of what happens in each story, and keep track of everything going on, but for a first time viewing it's better to just enjoy it and immerse yourself in the experience.

Bit off a bit more than it could chew...,"While ""Cloud Atlas"" is anything but a boring movie, the directors had bitten off a bit more than they were able to chew, and as such, certain perts of this grand tale became a bit too jumbled and at points it seemed like the directors just completely gave up. It was a bit too much with all the jumping around back and forth between story lines and between time periods.The storyline was interesting, but it was shot in the foot by wanting to accomplish too much and becoming a bit strained and confusing along the way.Visually then ""Cloud Atlas"" is spectacular and pure eye candy. The CGI was great and quite real, adding a very lifelike and believable atmosphere to the movie. And, for most parts, it was interesting to see the cast in all those different roles and characters. I say for most parts because when they turned the Caucasian cast into Koreans, it was just horrible to look at. They looked nothing like Koreans at all. They ended up looking like mutated burn victims. It was so bad to look at. And the same for turning the Asian into a Caucasian woman. It just looked too forced and unnatural. And this really kicked the movie on the shin and sent it down a notch.The cast was just impressive, to say the least. They had some really talented performers in the movie, and they delivered well in each of their many roles.It was a shame that the directors were tripping themselves with their over-ambitions and the God awful attempts of changing people's races, because ""Cloud Atlas"" was on the bring of being phenomenal.An interesting story, aside from the horrible flaws, and ""Cloud Atlas"" is well-worth watching. Just bear in mind that it runs at about 160 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Epic movie-making,"Technically brilliant, beautiful, challenging, intelligent, and narratively complex, but perhaps not quite as emotionally satisfying as it hoped to be. Maybe just a little too big for itself, but I wish I was 30 years younger so I would have time to watch it a few more times in my life.I love films like this. It's why I go to the movies; to be taken someplace else, to another time and another place, where I hope to see something that makes me think and feel about my life and my place in the world a little differently. Regardless of the few shortcomings which I'm sure other people have raged on about, if you enjoy looking for both the bigger picture and the smaller, more intimate moments in films, Cloud Atlas will certainly have you covered.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intriguing,"Slightly confusing but still enthralling movie that invites second viewing, this long semi-SF saga has feeling of too many chefs cooking one dish. Its perhaps just a little bit too ambitious for its own sake (three directors, countless movie actors playing various roles in different eras) and a idea of jumping from one chapter into another without really explaining what they have in common might be off-putting for audience used to follow linear story - be warned, there is not much of narrative continuity and one can find himself utterly confused with all these unconnected stories (or find them connected, I did not) however there is a very endearing enthusiasm and energy of everybody involved, which lifts it above criticism. Most of all, the whole fact that directors dared to play with such loose ideas and avoid usual clichés of start-middle-happy end in itself is perhaps commendable. Still, as much as I find myself enjoying it, must admit that TV serial might have been a better idea.Actors galore - Halle Berry, Jim Sturges and Doona Bae got the best parts.

My mind is blown.  I just want to cry a river so that orphans have something to drink.,"I think cloud atlas is one of the greatest things ever. As you can see as in my summary, I was very emotionally moved by this movie. It didn't do well in the box office apparently so I'm going to go see it again in theaters. This movie deserved to be watched on infinite loop in public places forever. It is amazing. I don't want to spoil anything, but I'm just glad that there is finally a movie that has some real connection with older sci-fi. I felt better than I did when I watched the fifth element for the first time. I hate how recent sci- fi movies leave you with terrible endings where there is no sort of resolution and you don't feel like you've learned anything and no message is conveyed.

A feast of stories.,"This is a treat that has little doses of everything good packed in. I haven't read the novel so can't comment on whether it is a good adaption, but it is a great film by itself. The acting is brilliant, the score is engaging, and cinematography spectacular.Six timelines, two of which intersect, are interwoven into one giant fiesta. There is a commonality between the themes of each story and this combined with the similar pacing of all stories and reincarnation of characters, some playing similar roles throughout others shifting from a more positive role in one to a negative one in another, integrates them all into a whole, which is a tale of oppression, predation, liberty, humor and love amongst other things.However, with all this and more combined into one single film it fell somewhat short of being magnificent but perhaps that just because I am used to single stories that can afford more depth rather than a multitude of interlinked ones. Anyhow, definitely worth a watch and pay close attention to details, it might be rewarding.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Like a 3 hour trailer for what would be 6 incredible movies,"Like lots of people who have been to see this film, I am a big fan of David Mitchell's book, and as I such I was nervous about seeing the film. I think that had I not read the book, I would not have had a clue what was going on for the majority of the movie.My main gripe is with the choice to alter the narrative structure. The way the book is laid out, with the first half of each story coming one after another chronologically, and then the concluding each tale in reverse order, the links between them are subtly drawn out and layered to add new meaning. For the film, the writers have chosen to intercut each story so that they all run parallel, which means that links between the stories are really laboured, rather than coming as subtle references. It also means that you are never able to get absorbed in any one character's journey - as soon as you get back into the swing of this particular era, the film cuts to another.At nearly 3 hours long, the film is lengthy, but paradoxically each of the six stories is only given around 30 minutes of screen time which just isn't enough for such complex narratives. As a result you only get the very bare bones of the plot - which is why I refer to it feeling more like a trailer than a full film. From the book, there is definitely scope to make each narrative into a full length feature, and I would have preferred a series of 6 films as part of a Cloud Atlas franchise.Having said this, I thought the performances were fantastic, and although the multi role- playing was a little distracting, I did enjoy watching the same actors in each story. The production design was also superb and managed to capture the strange worlds depicted in the book perfectly.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"ponderous, pretentious and sleep-inducing","""Cloud Atlas"" was the longest three hours I've spent in a movie theater in a long, long time. Twice I had to hold myself back from walking out. The theme, if you can finally figure it out, is that love and relationships endure throughout time and the heroes or the spirits of the heroes keep showing up in different times in history. But rather show things in some sort of sequence, the movie cuts back and forth from time and place without any warning. You have to keep track of about a half dozen different stories, multiple characters played by the same actors and finally you just throw up your hands and give up. Even if you could figure out the storyline, there's nothing original about it. Oh, and bring a translation book since about 25% of the dialog is in some sort of pidgin-English invented for the movie.I don't mind movies occasionally trying to shake up the traditional narrative; ""Memento"" was an outstandingly original twist on the conventional storytelling. But ""Cloud Atlas"" is not only confusing, it's ponderous, grindingly slow, gratuitously violent, self-important and dull. It cost $100 million to make and it'll no doubt enter the ranks of one of the most expensive flops in movie history. It's not even forgettable---the story is so unintelligible that you really don't have anything to forget when you leave the theater.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sci-fi thriller to delight your mind.,"""Just trying to understand why we keep making the same mistakes."" Luisa Rey (Halle Berry)What did I expect from filmmakers responsible for Matrix and Run Lola Run? A complicated, philosophical treatise on humanity—of course! But Cloud Atlas is more than that: It's a convoluted thriller with intersecting segments that eventually spell out humanity's penchant for good and evil, its ability to reinvent itself, and its undying connection down through the ages and into the future: We make the same mistakes, we get better at them, and we sacrifice to make the world a better place.As director/writers Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski, and Lana Wachowski spin the filmed version of David Mitchell's murderous, new-age, sci-fi novel, they create individual stories of oppression and redemption, tied together by the common bond of humanity and some very smooth cross cutting. The six stories, covering the five centuries through 2024, treat slavery of several kinds, care of the elderly, corporate crime, and a robotic working class up to the aftermath of the apocalypse.Although the first hour of the almost three hours is confusing and slow, eventually the characters become recognizable and comprehensible (helped subtly by the same actors playing different parts) to the extent that we care what happens to them and ultimately the human race. Stay for the credits to identify the multiple roles each actor plays (some may surprise you).Going into the film, I had a suspicion that I was going to see a version of Terrence Malick's abstract Tree of Life. Au contraire, Cloud Atlas is an action film about good guys from the past and the future running from bad guys; the key, however, is that everything that happens has ramifications for the past or the future. The weakness of this grand action is that there are too many characters and actions, weakening each with the overlay of the other.Notice I haven't even tried to explain the plot although all strands intersect in humanity's enduring struggle for freedom be it the 24th century post-apocalyptic survivor Zachary (Tom Hanks) joining with a visiting space lady (Halle Berry) or an 1849 runaway slave (David Gyasi) aided by a young sailor (Jim Sturgess). In each segment, slavery of some sort is the catalyst for rebellion. It's hard not to see contemporary parallels in warring states of Africa or even in the great divide between the wealthy and the other percent in the US.Cloud Atlas is not on Cloud Nine: Its adventures may be too many, but its themes are consistent, universal, and real and its actors some of the best of the day. It beats Kevin James's Zookeeper.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A must see film,"Fans of the Matrix films (I haven't seen them) will rush to see Cloud Atlas because two of its three directors made those movies. Others will be drawn in because of its main stars, Halle Berry and Tom Hanks. The draw for me was the third director, Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, Perfume, 3). Tykwer is simply one of the greatest directors alive today. He's never disappointed me.The best word to describe Cloud Atlas is astonishing. Some potential viewers may be daunted by the film's nearly three hour length. Don't be. This is the quickest three hours I've ever spent at the movies. The time really flew by. The directors' decision to have their actors play multiple roles is a good one. You may want to spend time trying to figure out which performers are playing what roles, but I recommend against it. Just relax and allow yourself to be drawn in to the various plot lines. You will be quickly be mesmerized.This a truly unique film, the best I've seen this year.

Among the most confusing and innovative movies I have ever seen.,"I was curious about this movie since a few years as it's considered by many one of the most complex movies ever made and it even lost lots of money despite it has an overall score of 7,4 on IMDB. And when I saw it I could understand all the mixed reviews about it and why it was like a flop at the box office.The film is about 6 different stories that occur in many different times in the course of history (three in the past, one in the present and two in the very distant future). And instead of being told one at a time, they are interwined throughout the film. All through the movie the viewer won't really understand what all these plots have to do with each other and some will even get frustrated because the movie doesn't give lots of clues to its viewers (tho I managed to understand it).Despite its confusing nature and hard to get sense, the film has some good points. All the actors (big names such as Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Susan Sarandon, Keith David, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant, Jim Sturgess and Hugo Weaving) play different roles in each story and all give very good performances also convincing too despite none of them really stands out. Some of them even play folks of the opposite gender!One of the things that grated me about this movie is that the stories were compelling and they were shown in bits and pieces. It would have been better if they showed them one at a time like they do usually in movies of this kind. I particularly liked the story with Halle Berry that with the help of Keith David is trying to expose the secrets of some maneuvers her boss (Grant) did. There was, however, some great cinematography (especially in the historical episodes) and a very good theme music.During the viewing I thought that this film is really not for anyone. The viewer must be patient and also one that wants to watch a different kind of movie every once in a while. Worth watching but very odd to say the least.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Couldn't move a muscle until the end credits stopped rolling,"I don't often get deeply affected by movies. More often than not I get up when the movies done, sigh, think to myself 'well that was nice' and carry on.But Cloud Atlas left me speechless and unable to move. It has a dizzying and profound power that stayed with me, and I couldn't spoil it by bombarding myself with any other stimuli or conversation. I'm often one of 'those people' who turns their phone back on as soon as they walk out of the cinema, but I forgot I even had one.It may take some people a while to adjust to the film's sporadic jumps between story lines, of which there are a few. You start following one set of characters, then suddenly you're following someone else, and it takes you a while to see where the thread that connects them lies.It was genius to have the same actors playing many different roles. It becomes a game, trying to guess who's playing who. The make-up is incredible, often making the actor almost unrecognizable.If you enjoy movies a little more cerebral, a little more thought- provoking and perhaps a little challenging, this is a must see.Tom Tykwer, you're brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It must be applauded for merely having the audacity to tell such a story.,"I confess that I was never the biggest fan of Andy or Lana Wachowski, best known for their genre smash hit The Matrix, perhaps the only film they'd ever directed that I actually like. However, what they cook up along with co-director Tom Tykwer is a beautiful mystery of a movie that I'm confidant will be talked about many years from now. There is no one definitive story to Cloud Atlas (Based on the 2004 novel of the same name), instead, it's a collection of stories set in different time lines ranging from 1849 to 106 years after apocalyptic events, utilizing an all star cast to wonderful effect.Despite a very lengthy runtime of close to three hours, Cloud Atlas is surprisingly easy to watch all in one sitting. It's a clever movie that mixes in a little bit of everything. Dark humor, moral dilemmas, romance, action, conspiracy, heartbreak, sweeping imagery, it's got something for everyone. How these individual segments connect to each other is a very provoking thematic detail that Tykwer and the Wachowski's love examining. It's not always done to uniformly astonishing effect, but it is ambitious in how it raises enough questions and answers, but still leaves plenty to the imagination.One element that I applaud is the decision to go in a sort of Angels In America route by having actors play multiple roles. A talented ensemble cast that includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, and many others are consistently excellent, some more entertaining than others in segments. Perhaps the most impressive aspect is the special makeup effects for the players. Not all the creations are excellent, but much of the work is so impressive that it renders an actor completely unrecognizable.It's a shame that it didn't get much of an audience at the box office, though, because it is one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences you could hope for. A lot of it is uneven, I'm not gonna lie, but these three directors, and their unique voices, should be applauded merely for having the audacity to adapt such an ""unfilmable"" novel to the screen. With repeat viewings, and staying power, this could become a beloved classic years from now.**** / *****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A nice watch about human connection,"In my experience, a Wachowskis film is either hit or miss. I would classify this closer to a hit. We follow 6 intertwined stories, connecting through time, space and genres by the power of human stories. Each of the 6 characters have a fairly simple story plot-wise, having one big problem they need to solve. The stories, as well as the characters lack a bit of complexity, but all is forgiven since delving deeper into each of the characters' arcs would inevitably prolong the movie that is already three hours long. Each of the stories differ in genre and vibe and could be made into their own full length movies, but in this case, their plot is only secondary and serves to show in which ways humans are connected and influence each other throughout history, as well as how history and human struggles and dreams keep repeating. This is further accentuated by the fact that actors play different roles in each of the 6 stories. This concept is sometimes interesting and successful, but sometimes confusing and almost parodying itself. Although the movie is a bit cliche in that it shows mostly selfless people fighting for the greater good and their happiness, it's still a nice watch and finding the different connections is fun. In the end, the catharsis leaves one with a good feeling.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Cloudy with a Chance of Karma,"This film is mildly recommended."" I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together."" - I Am a Walrus by the BeatlesBased on David Mitchell's popular novel, Cloud Atlas was given the full big budget Hollywood treatment. With a production team that creates many eye-popping visuals and its all-cast international cast ( Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, and Susan Sarandon are joined by Donna Bae, Keith David, Ben Whitshaw, Jim Sturgess, and James D'Arcy. ), the film seems to have high hopes and an even high pedigree. Directed and written by Tom Tykwer ( Run Lola Run ) and the Matrix Trilogy creators, Andy and Lana Wachowski, Cloud Atlas is a intriguing mystical journey, a messy but noble effort that is worth viewing.Six stories become one in this sci-fi fantasy epic. The ambitious filmmakers tackle a difficult book that interweaves its varied tales with time-tripping details and enough style to disguise the black hole of a script whose characters, plots, and decades collide on a phantasmagoric journey about destiny, fate, and the question of our own existence in the vast cosmos called life. All those heady topics ( good versus evil, life after death, reincarnation, karma, and existentialism ) are explored and regurgitated ad nauseam. It's heavy thinking, dude, with a heavier sleight of hand at work. No wonder the film is nearly three hours long.Visually, Cloud Atlas is a stunner, a thrilling spectacle filled with some wonderful action sequences. But for the most part, its screenplay remains inert, never building to a satisfying emotional or intellectual finish. ( I have to confess that I did unintentionally laugh a bit in the apocalyptic portion of the film where the ludicrous dialog with its rhythmic inflections kept reminding me of Barbara Billingsley's jive talk from Airplane. Sorry, but it really did! ) The stories try to unite the unending theme of oneness and our inability to control our own outcomes as the film takes on metaphysical proportions with the numerous characters involved, their wardrobe changes, and their specific situations.We time-travel through different eras with decidedly mixed results: a slave ship adventure in the late 1800's, a 1930's love story involving two composers, an 70's China Syndrome action thriller about corruption and power, a present-day comic tale of revenge, a futuristic Blade Runner influenced parable set in Korea, and an end of the world precautionary tale that seemed to reuse the macramé wardrobe from Waterworld. This anthology structure of individual sub-plots that co-mingle with past, present, and future events may have intrigued the reader of the written page, but this film adaptation becomes a bit pretentious and labored with much dependent upon the moviegoer's level of believability and personal interest. Due to that factor, some of the time passages are more effective than others. ( Personally, the story lines that were 20th century bound resonated with me while the post millennium story lines were boring and bland. )The directors may have saved some costs with their actors playing multiple roles in various ethnicities, genders, and races, but the overall effect in the execution suffers from that decision. While the majority of the make-up tricks are remarkable, other attempts fell short, particularly with Grant's old man disguise, Weaving's female Nurse Ratchet character transformation, and some of Sturgess' and Weaving's caked-on Asian make-up. ( In fact, most of the make-up for the Caucasian-turned-Korean roles were glaring missteps. ) This artistic choice weakened the film's impact as one continually guesses the true identity of the actor beneath the make-up instead of being drawn totally into the film's dense narrative. Another flaw is the choppy non-linear editing from one story to the next, a device which continually inter-cuts the action and tension of that individual segment.Filmmakers Tykwer and the Wachowskis may have had their heads in the clouds while trying to rein in this demanding novel to align with their creative visions, but, at least, their vivid imaginations allow others to see the book come to life. Cloud Atlas is an unique movie-going experience, a visual treat that entertains in bombastic ways. Unfortunately, its plot structure and words ultimately undermine the film's strong imagery.Although the thematic element of our oneness with the universe is a sound concept, the film seems to struggle to keep its patchwork stories cohesively together. To sum up my feelings about Cloud Atlas, it is best to quote the Beatles yet again: "" The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away...Goo goo g'joob. "" GRADE: B-Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: Does anyone remember a little known 1960's whodunit called The List of the Adrian Messenger, a mystery film directed by John Huston? The film's main gimmick, similar to Cloud Atlas, was its attempt to disguise its cast with various make-up applications. Behind the prosthetic layers were famous actors like Tony Curtis, Robert Mitchum, Burt Lancaster, and Kirk Douglas. That too had its share of hits and misses.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lack of structure leads unnecessarily to banality,"I quite enjoyed aspects of 'Cloud Atlas'; but to be frank, I didn't understand it. After watching, I consulted Wikipedia, which outlines the plot of the book from which the film is derived; and then it kind of made sense. The central ideas here are based on the notion of reincarnation and recurrence; of each story being told in its successor; and (in the book only) an explicit formal structure whereby each tale is split into two halves, so that each higher level is bookended by its predecessor. This lavish movie (with no less than three directors) abandons this device in favour of telling all six stories simultaneously. With the same actors appearing in many of the segments, the result is somewhat incomprehensible, especially as many of the segments have fantasy settings (and when the viewer is uncertain of the constraints on reality, it's especially hard to tell when one such reality ends and another begins). The individual fragments aren't badly done, but it's very hard to get a clear sense of a bigger picture beyond the banal message of ""everything is connected"". I would now be interested to read the book; but the film itself is too messy and undisciplined to wholly accommodate such ambitious material.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Extravagant Pieces,"As seen in the five minute trailer, Cloud Atlas is clearly about reincarnation. It is connected in six stories, in six eras, with six different genres. It begins with Adventure, Drama, Thriller, Comedy, Sci-Fi Action, and lastly Fantasy. The film also runs in almost three hours. It sounds like it's gonna be an epic thrill ride. To be honest, I'm not familiar with David Mitchell's book that this is based on. Some might not expect that all the stories are told in a complex way. They are not back to back segments. Though, they can be all pretty entertaining and gorgeous to look at, but it will still give you a strange mind perplex.Cloud Atlas is not subtle enough for its concept but you'll still get a mind perplex effect after seeing it. The stories are not told in an easy back-to-back manner. Each stories are told simultaneously for one scene to another. The film has three directors. The Wachowskis has the fantasy, adventure, and action stories. ""An Orison of Sonmi~451"" is a pure ""Wachowski"" with their trademark visual designs and action scenes. The intro of the story is intriguing then further more it gets coated on the clashing chases. The ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After"" sequence is fantastic to look at with a strange camp and whimsy that is so fascinating.Tom Tykwer takes the non-fantasy dramas that also posses some great performances. ""Letters from Zedelghem"" is ought to be depressing. The merit there goes to Ben Whishaw who placed genuine emotion to the tale. ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" segment is fun, mostly because of its quirky direction and Jim Broadbent's delighting portrayal of the character. It's funny because of all the climaxes, this one has the most exciting.For the rest of the performances, Tom Hanks usually appears as a Scottish/Irish scum, but he finally plays his earnest self in the rest. Hugo Weaving effectively uses his villainy menace, no matter what race or gender he is in. Hugh Grant has the same feat with Weaving but in a more tool type.For its filmmaking, it's undeniably incredible. The costumes, makeup, and visual effects made everything so magnificent. These things alone can already make this film worth a watch. The music score is stirringly magnetic. The visuals are breathtaking. The makeup is a bit silly but still great.Cloud Atlas is indeed extravagant. It's watchable as long as if you can take its peculiarity. It's large and long, but it will still take a bit of thinking about the connections of the stories. The entertainment and fascination is unobjectionable. The technical achievement is remarkably amazing. The filmmakers did their job well enough by their ambition. It seems like it's a serious challenge to make a film like this.

I couldn't stop thinking about this movie....,"After I left the theater, I continued to contemplate the movie and couldn't get it out of my head. It's not an easy watch. You have to pay close attention to what is going on, and you must be able to go with the ebb and flow of each story and then the story as a whole.Even after the movie, I was discussing it with my fellow movie-goer friend, making connections and comments. I enjoyed the movie immensely-- it's so unlike the many others and it is beautiful. It's message is beautiful. Sonmi's story is, without a doubt, my favorite.Throughout the whole movie I laughed out loud and I cried. This movie had me in its grasp emotionally, and I felt they did an excellent job at making each individual story seem almost as if it could also be its own movie.The only thing that was pretty annoying was that there was monologue/dialogue in an odd dialect of English that I had the hardest time understanding. It was very, VERY frustrating and the only reason I can't give this movie a higher rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A rare piece of intelligent greatness,"I just finished watching this not more than ten minutes ago, and my heart is still pounding. To me this was one of the most intelligent, well-made and inspiring films since... well since ever. It's almost reluctantly that I don't give it a full ten, but I may up the score after a few more views. Because this is a film that I need to watch again. Not simply to grasp some of the many, many well-hidden details, but also because I already want to see it one more time.So where to start? If you don't mind letting go of the conventional way of being told a story, where scenes follow time rather than purpose, this is a movie for you. If you try to connect the dots from the beginning you will simply become confused. The story doesn't unfold until the end, and this is one of the things which make the movie so very rewarding. I could sense the impact it would have on me throughout the film, only to have my wishes realized once it reached the end.Visually it's stunning. The make-up is as good as it gets. Not because the make-up artists succeed to hide the true actor behind the make-up, but because they transform the actors while allowing the viewer to see which other characters he or she are playing, thus being able to connect them to one Another, which in my mind is essential to the movie. And most actors do play a multitude of parts in this film. The rest of the special effects also serve well to bring to life the creators vivid visions without stealing the show or wrecking it.In addition to great storytelling and visual effects, the film has a message (or messages) more daring and relevant than almost any recent Hollywood release. I'm not entirely sure that all of the messages will reach all the viewers though, so I find myself torn. On one hand, I love the fact that the morals aren't being handed to you on a silver platter. It makes me feel like I have accomplished something. On the other hand, some of the more important morals may go unnoticed for some. There are however more obvious points which can hardly be missed. But these are somewhat more conventional. Sorry for being vague, but I don't want to say any more to spoil it. :)I feel I have already taken up too much time. The film may not be for everyone. But give it a chance. Those of you who will like it, will probably also love it, and may find yourselves truly affected by it as I have been.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

When you know all the different characters that the same actor are playing, you'll understand WHY the soul has been reincarnated and reborn as this person etc. It's not race-mixing, transsexual for fun - there's a deep reason!It's just amazing, smart and epic! Most of all, for those who don't see it yet, don't waste ur time watching Cloud Atlas on the internet. Caz you're ruining this EPIC movie. Go to the theater with a big screen! :))Btw where the h*ll are all the Oscar nominations for Cloud Atlas?! It shoud at least have been nominated for Best film, Best score, Best﻿ screenplay, Best directors, Best actors, Best actress, Best editing, Best cinematography, Best sound, Best visual effects, Best costume, Best MAKE UP. This is bullshit. Those dumb, narrow-minded, ignorant academy and critics are a joke. I haven't seen a more masterpiece ever, and I won't for many years to come. This is a joke.

"Worst Movie I saw in a Theatre, actually I left mid way","Saw the IMDb ratings for it, above 8. Great stars Tom hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, expected it to be great. Also saw the director have directed the famous Matrix series whom I am really fond of. Went it with a couple of friends. 1 hour into the movie, one of my friend fell asleep. Can't blame him. Wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.The worst thing was it had a couple of parallel stories with the same set of actors. Couldn't get what is the connection between these movies. Also it had a constant switching between this parallel stores every 15-20 minutes making it more difficult to focus on one. This movie was so confusing and got on my nerves, we had to leave it mid way. Believe me don't waste your time",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Engaging enough, but superficial and pretentious","The effects were good, as was the acting. The story? Each story is OK, but this pretense that they have something deep to sell, something profound that ties them all together -- was nauseating. Trying to shove mindless gobbledygook down your throat through lecturing? Gimme a break. Without that, I would have pegged it at 7. But that alone knocks it down by one. P.S. The strange futuristic dialect was cool. The high tech futuristic city, very cool (except for the gross parts). The obvious re-use of actors for different roles? That's just nonsensical, as it implies parallels between stories that are superficial at best, if they even exist.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wonderful movie,"During the first 20 minutes of the movie, I had no idea if this evening would end with a big disappointment. I have seen the different threads of the story developing and needed time to get used to it. But I am glad, that I did trust the directors, that they would know where this journey would lead. After the screening, no one was willing to get up. They all waited till the end of the closing credits. It was a weird but great movie experience. As far as I thought about this movie yet, everything made sense. Not on the first glimpse, but on the second or third. It is a well elaborated story and it is amazing, that all those story-threads, time lines and so on, fitted together. Some directors are over-challenged with two separate story lines. At the end: I did not like the part with the devil. It reminded me of ""Faust"" and could have been illustrated in a different way. Over all a great movie, that will be watched again by myself.Btw. In Germany six year old could have watch this movie, if accompanied by their parents. This is not appropriate, because of the blood and brain splattered on the wall and the cutting of throats, the sex scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A brave film, which I fear is doomed at the box office.","Cloud Atlas is a brave project and kudos to all those involved. The acting is top rated, as are the effects and the whole film is engaging but I fear its doomed to fail. Mainly because of the attention span of the average cinema customer. In these days of fast editing and smash cuts, it seems that if something does not happen every 3 minutes that people will lose interest.Its a sad fact that a large percentage of people who this film is targeted at will either ,not be able to sit through the long running time, without texting to all the people they know that they're bored or be able to understand it. I myself found the first 30 minutes hard to concentrate on, mainly because of the dis-jointed nature but stuck with it and found it an enjoyable and touching film.

In a league of its own,"When I first watched this movie a few years ago I didn't have the same level of appreciation I did than when I watched it most recently. It is truly epic in every word. A masterpiece of a new kind has been created with Cloud Atlas. The ongoing impact of kindness and evil is portrayed with such perfection throughout past, present and future. Watching this film just makes me want to be a better human being. We can all be better. And cloud Atlas leads the way not only how we can be better, but also why. The messages throughout the film are truly spine tingling. We are bound to one another. Every action we take has some sort of meaning in another world, another dimension or another time. Ultimately we must avoid making choices which we cannot live with. In a day and age ruled by corruption and evil it is so timely to have a genuine reminder that there is more to life than simply being selfish and caring for yourself only. This film gets points for being both entertaining and educating, but you must be prepared to surrender your attention for the entirety of the long film as otherwise you may find it ''boring.'",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"no man/woman is to ""small"" to make the difference","It's quite difficult to review this movie fairly. It has a great story. The book itself was a bestseller. All of the 3 directors gave it their own touch. The whole point is also well put - no man/woman is to ""small"" to make the difference. It sounds like a cliché, but the story is told in an unique way. The makeup is something that also makes this movie great. Most of the actors play several different characters, and the transformation is unbelievable. All actors (especially Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent) did their best in this one. One of the problems with this movie would be low pace. Story goes from one era to another in every couple of minutes, but still it is not so confusing. Yet it is quite slow when you put it all together. For a movie that is 3 hour long and has such a complex story it is exhausting to keep full concentration. I watched it in a full theatre, and after second hour you could hear some people snoring. At the end everyone left their seats and nobody said a single word. I never saw such an reaction (or lack of it) from audience. Some were probably thinking about the point, but most of them were glad it was finally over. All together the movie is worth watching, but I recommend - during afternoon projections.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie Hell. Six stories told in ten minute segements over three hours of time. Give me a break.,"Cloud Atlas is the story format I would envision if there were movies in Hell. Ever tried watching six different movies in ten minute segments over three hours of time? It is annoying and tedious, and even if you make it through, the idea of ever having to watch it again sounds like work.There are some who find Cloud Atlas to be impressive, seemingly for no other reason than it has a lot of stuff in it. If I didn't already make it clear, Cloud Atlas rolls together six different alternating stories, and despite what some would lead you to believe, they have nothing in common except that they use the same actors. This is supposed to suggest some sort of parallel worlds of reincarnation, but the roles have nothing in common. They are totally different people with no correlation to each other. So why is this even a point worth making?Each story presents a different conflict, whether that be in the form of slavery, sexual oppression, oil companies, racism, money, or tribal barbarian hordes... basically whatever the author could think of at the moment, and he came up with six. I think liberation from oppression is supposed to be the transcending factor here, and the movie tries to neatly wrap everything up with a narrative message at the end, essentially telling us that people who fight oppression are good and people who create oppression are bad, and that our actions effect the future of our reincarnated entirely different selves and other actors who are rotating through different character roles of different stories. I'm going to be blunt here; as it is portrayed in this movie, this is a dumb concept, because if one incarnation is an oppressed gay composer, and another is an abusive villain who has no awareness of his other selves, then contextually it doesn't matter... no more so than if you had the an actor play Captain Hook in one movie and then later plays Sneezy the Dwarf in another. You have one actor playing two different roles in two different movies. So what? And even if you want to fall back on the theme of oppressed vs. Oppressor, then drop the pretentiously complex method of using six stories and just find one good one. You might find yourself asking, why didn't they just play each story all the way through one at a time? I have no idea. Not complicated enough maybe?The individual stories are not bad, but the directing is poor, especially in the first hour, as every story feels rushed and insincere, and all the characters lack tonal believe-ability.Cloud Atlas isn't bad, it just isn't good either, and it seems to want to be more than it is. There also seems to be a lot of characters randomly smoking pot in this movie, which makes sense, because this movie often mistakes complexity for creativity, and fails to deliver meaningful impact.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Forget an Atlas, you're going to need a GPS","For a film with multiple directors and 6 different story-lines (and even several different genres within a single movie), it wasn't quite the train wreck that I expected. The excellent cinematography and the ensemble cast were its saving points, and I must admit that the premise of such a film in itself is unique. And while I did enjoy seeing the actors play varying roles in different time-lines, I'm on the fence as to the effectiveness of the make-up and costumes. Some were very good (Hugo Weaving as the demonic Old Georgie) and on the other hand, very cheap and cartoonish (Donna Bae, an Asian actress, as the 19th century Caucasian female, Tilda Ewing). Not that I have an issue with an actor of one race playing the role of a character from another race. It's acting, so I applaud it. However, if the director is going to take this approach, then it should be taken seriously and the make-up should be done right. Just take a look at Robert Downey, Jr. playing a Caucasian method actor, Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder. In the film Lazarus appears stuck in his role as a black soldier, Sergeant Lincoln Osiris. Most importantly, his make-up is very convincing, even though the audience knows Downey's character is only playing the role of another race.Moving on - the good points aside, I'm not sure why the film has received such high ratings from viewers. Nearly three hours of zipping back and forth at random between 6 different plots is a daunting task for the audience to keep pace with, and I agree with others that it would have fared much better as a mini-series on HBO or something. However, even this isn't the film's biggest sin. The biggest flaw of the film is that the writers try to force connections between the various plots and time-lines where, for the most part, none exists.""I've read letters written by this so-and-so musician from 36 years ago"" and bam! There's a connection Or ""I've seen a film about the life of this so-and-so author from 132 years ago"" and bam! There's a connection Give me a break! That's no more a connection than me one day listening to a little known composer like Hungary's Zoltan Kodaly (with no previous exposure or recollection of him), then developing an instant connection to the guy. It's shallow and a cheap way to move the plot along. With the way the movie zips back and forth between story lines, most people had trouble just figuring out what the heck was going on, let alone trying to recognize the connections between the different plots. Which brings me to my last disappointment: the movie makers ask the audience to investment nearly three hours of their time to this project, which requires the viewer to use vast amounts of mind power unlike any other film. The suspense builds, builds, and then builds some more but in the end Cloud Atlas didn't really deliver the ""bang""; makes one feel cheap and dirty after giving this film so much time and cerebral commitment. That's not a good thingThere's also a preachy theme that runs throughout all of the 6 story lines (some more than others), so it wasn't a big surprise that the filmmakers would try to end things on a high moral point. But it misses the mark, and only furthers my opinion that they rushed each story in order to cram them all into one movie. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind preachiness in a film, so long as it's warranted. Here, the stories just don't resonate the deep meaning that the movie makers are trying to get you to buy into.

Almost Epic?,"The storyline, that of Sonmi451, was an almost verbatim replay of the story of Jesus Christ. I for one, found that refreshing. But knowing that the political inclinations of the directors are more in line with those who feel that the needs of the many are more important than the needs of the few, I wonder if they were even aware that this story is in direct contradiction to there socialist ideal.I found the performance by the actress portraying Sonmi451, Doona Bae, mesmerizing, and I hope to see more of her. Jim Broadbent delivered the only Oscar winning performances in the entire film. Other than that, the other performances were only average from the likes of Berry and Hanks, nothing too memorable. There were quite a few moments that fell short of there potential, hence my 7 star review.It is truly a beautiful movie and a pleasure to watch, but the message is just far too obvious. ""Everything is connected!"", is hardly a revelation to me. If it is a new realization to you, I just wonder what rock you were hiding under prior to this movie.

Portmanteau poem,"With a tone of told-you-so pomposity, ""folly"" is the go-to term used by professional critics with regard to risky big-budget films with disappointing box office returns. Cloud Atlas is no folly. Yes, it is vast in architecture and ambition, but it is also profound and lyrical. I wonder if those journalists who dismiss it as pretentious and/or shallow and focus on mocking its prosthetics shouldn't revisit the idea of what film is for, and remember the art of suspending disbelief in the service of the imagination.David Mitchell's novel (which I've not read) has been adapted for the screen by three writer-directors: Andy and Lana Wachowski, of The Matrix and Bound fame, and Tom Tykwer, most famous for the films Perfume and Run Lola Run. (Like a modern-day John Carpenter, Twyker also worked as composer on Cloud Atlas.) Together they've created a three-hour movie composed of myriad stories spanning different time periods. The actors - Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Ben Wishaw, Jim Broadbent et al - each play different characters throughout these stories, regardless of age, race or gender. It's a conceit that works because it is a film about the connectedness of humanity, and it embraces its own preposterousness with a consistent joviality.At three hours, the film is never dull. In fact, if anything, I felt some sequences could have done with some fleshing out. Perhaps a five- hour director's cut is on the cards. The stories are spliced together, often overlapping in dialogue and incident, and the effect is beguiling yet coherent. A portmanteau film is only as good as its weakest story, and thankfully none of the stories are weak. Even the most generic fable - ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing"", set upon the high seas of the pre-Thirteenth Amendment Americas - gets its moment, providing the film with its affecting finale.As the stories unfold, one becomes aware that they not only linked by blood but also by theme: the freedom of the individual against the backdrop of the freedom of civilisations. A shambling breakout from an old people's home (with Hugo Weaving as a Nurse Ratched-esque overseer) is offered equal triumph to a hoverbike escape from a 22nd century Neo Seoul in the throes of a fascist lockdown. The secular free will of our species - what some would call a ""human spirit"" - transcends time and space and the arbitrary genetic borders it is in our nature to overcome.Cloud Atlas is the kind of rampant, deliriously overreaching cinema whose story is felt as much as it is followed. You'll find flaws abundant (the filmmakers do trample the line between ideas and gimmickry at times), but every one is vanquished by a shot or line or scene that lands perfectly on its feet. Besides, with a tapestry this broad and elegant, it's not about the individual stitches, it's about the dazzling whole.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Joined IMDb just so I could post a review on this movie,"It appears to me that all of the reviews on this movie are either 10/10 or 1/10. To all of those who boast this movie is ""The best movie ever created"" or ""a most inspiring masterpiece"", your reviews, to me, are incredibly naive. If you can actually decipher this movie then sure I suppose I can see where you get your ""masterpiece"" view. What's happening here though is that you are focusing purely on 'the story' and completely forgetting that it's a movie. You are finding some sort of poetry that makes sense to you and inspires you. Where you are naive is when you say 'the movie' is what is great. What is great, in reality, is the story. You would be just as well served by reading the book. The movie, however, is so horrible it's painful. If the movie was a Shakespearean play performed in Shakespearean times then I can understand how people could enjoy it. It honestly views as a play on a stage. The made up languages, accents, and ways of speaking are so outlandish it's impossible to follow, and horribly acted... The feeling of the movie is fake and incredibly laughable; especially when it's clear that the director was going for realism and suspense but failed so very horribly. If you are looking to be inspired and want to see what people are talking about with their 10/10 reviews then I would suggest you read the book.

Incredible in Every Aspect,"This movie really does have something for everyone. However, many will be turned off by one or both of the movies difficult aspects. 1. The movie is too long.

With so much going on, it's difficult to want to miss anything for fear of not seeing a critical plot point. This being said, everyone should see this. Whether it be the stories, the characters, the settings, the CG, the makeup, or the actors, there will be something you can not only like, but appreciate about this movies. The stories are interconnected more through concept than through actual relation to each other in their worlds. Each exhibits themes of freedom, interdependence, discovery, achievement, and love. The stories, while all different, share these themes together throughout the movies. I won't spoil any but my personal favorite was the one about the aspiring composer. Probably the most breathtaking part about the movie is the actors and their costumes. Each of the main actors plays at least one role in each section of the movie, if not more. Some have subtle changes, like altering a hair style or type of clothing. Others are incredible changes, crossing the boundaries of ethnicity, race, and even gender. At the end, the credits show which characters each cast member plays. If you can identify half of them throughout the movie, you've got keener eyes than me. I would love to go on and on, but again, you need to see this for yourself. Please don't give up on it due to the length. I know it may seem confusing, but don't try to rack your brains too much. Again, the stories are not intertwined as much as you may think. Focus on the concepts, not how one story has an effect on the others.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I felt that the stories that were in mid-stride during the middle of the movie asked the viewers to think, relate and hold onto the concept of belief in a cause, even if you might not know the future implications of that cause.But then at the end, to tie together the cause and effect, and the realization to believe, after those choices, that you have made the best decision of your life, and you would forever be content to choose the same outcome, again and again.... Makes me stop and take stock of the choice I continue to make.Even though my choices are accompanied by pain and sorry...

The quantum narrative,"The Wachowskis are nothing if not ambitious.The film is in the form of a cloud of narratives, fragments of mini- films. These are threaded together in several simple ways; objects carry over, characters or their offspring, on a more fundamental level, the same struggle through the ages. You might think of this as in the vein of DW Griffith's 1916 film Intolerance (similarly: a layered film with a humanistic message, shuffling between eras, vast in scope), substituting the struggle for love with one for freedom.The recurring notion in each segment is that of a narrator who is trapped in someone else's (a gnostic demigod's)storyworld, and looking to apprehend liberating truths behind the prisonmatrix of illusion. Here's how it plays out:1) in the High Seas story (Herman Melville is referenced in a later segment) the narrator is at the mercy of ship captain and doctor, 2) the young gay composer is trapped by his old and famous mentor, 3) the Vietnam-era journalist stumbles across a conspiracy in the energy world, 4) the aging editor is locked up by his brother in a nursing home (a cuckoo's nest), 5) a replicant in the future of the Bladerunner world experiences a Matrix-like awakening and joins the revolution against the totalitarian machine, 6) in the Waterworld segment, a superstitious villager breaks the spell of fear and prophecy (and so, indoctrinated tradition), and this reunites him with lost humanity.It helps to know that the core philosophy that connects these is what the Buddhist have been saying for millenia: we are trapped in self-perpetuating illusion that alters or distorts reality, have fashioned artificial realities to that effect which we inhabit daily (social structures, hierarchies, self), and every step we take within those, for good or bad, has far-reaching imports that karmically propagate through the world (karma meaning 'action'. In Buddha's time, Die Hard would be a 'karma' film, rightfully so).That's all fine.The decision to use the same actors in different roles is in line with this proposed malleability of self and causal interconnectedness of energy. They are not all of them great, but Hanks stands out. Hugh Grant as warpainted cannibal? Count me in.Each of the stories culminates in a spiritual breakthrough of sorts, in that inspirational way I personally find trite. That's not the main issue with the film. It sporadically entertains, but that's not the reason to watch it either.Like Inception, it is an essay on structures of consciousness done with Hollywood money and sensibility. The author of the book wrote it with explicit reincarnation in mind, which only clouds his premise—lo, confused viewers are trying to figure out who is reincarnated as who. Doesn't matter one bit.Here's the core idea of the essay: Hanks as a nuclear scientist explains about the quantum unpredictability of arising phenomena, the science of it probably needs more fleshing out at this point, but the idea that the same should apply to matters of mind is exciting and one I've been investigating myself in the context of meditation.Thought (dreams, memory) really work that way, in a stream of quantum phenomena that arise and disappear, and these phenomena are in the form of fragmented mini-films like we have here. The paradoxical trick? It's not the self that forms these internal films, but the other way round— the images over time acquire a narrator who begins to shape a story. (Zen Buddhists meditate to kill that narrating self)From the perspective of the filmmakers, the point is suggesting that each subsequent event is in mysterious ways only possible because of unpredictable actions that precede it—my favorite bit is an actual mini-film (a public broadcast) whose message 'awakens' humanity in the stars.But simply, I don't think you can sufficiently illustrate any of that in the context of 'hero's journey' mythadventure. Because in that mode you have to have the rousing battles, lessons of wisdom and archetypal grapple with destiny, all of which cloud clear focus away from life as we know it.It doesn't help that Jungians and a score of literary scholars have further ruined that with metaphor. It's why the Dune movie failed. Why Lynch—who has been meditating since the 1970's—abandoned this external, costume-y mode for internal shuffling of phenomena.That is because it is not metaphor to graft from the outside. It has actual mechanism, a pretty puzzling one at that—what is turbulence to classic physicists. I am talking of the illusory matrix-space where consciousness comes into being, where films are first sparked into life.This space of waking consciousness is an imperfection of mind, is a prison, hence our-selves as the narrator who is trapped in it, spending our entire lives looking for transcendence, in sex, in movies, in some shared experience with something other than self.I propose a quantum cinematic narrative that is possible to be conceived on and mirror that level. This is not it. Moreover, this is why it fails to work on the scope it aspires to. It is all from the outside, more Frank Herbert than Dogen.Each story-particle that forms the film is about a grand leap against oppression, and in so much noise the film misses the small steps. On top of that they have jumbled the chronology, but each story has ordinary progression and logic. And whereas Buddhism thrives in the illogicality of spontaneously arising life, that life has been bulldozed here in favor of clean reincarnation.I am only raising these issues, because the film strikes me as more ambitious than anything we have seen in some time. Someone (I think Time) has already proclaimed this the worst of the year, which is just a small view.If you want to see a film that successfully does this quantum narrative, watch Tarkovsky's Zerkalo.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great technical achievement, great fun, but little essence","I won't bother to mention the positive sides of this movie, since they are well presented in most reviews. I agree that it takes the art of cinematography to its best. Technically, it is almost a perfect film. But that is not the reason I go to the cinema -to see only technical achievements- and that is why I will insist on some negative sides.The film had great possibilities to touch some important issues, like what is important in life and what is not, what are the consequences of one's actions, and the chance of the existence of some evolution through the circle of lives and deaths. I was a bit disappointed to see that this great idea of reincarnation was only addressed superficially, as a series of make up and costumes on the same actors, who seemed to live their lives without experiencing the results of their own actions, but only those of others. The notion of reincarnation is connected to the notion of 'karma', which means that one should experience the result of one's own actions sooner or later. This movie missed a great chance (in my opinion) to deal with this important issue.I guess the directors avoided to put much philosophy in the film, because they had their eyes on addressing a bigger audience, and I can understand that, given the huge budget of the film. It's just a bit sad that there is so much junk on cinemas, just to please the lazy 'average viewer' and there is not bigger effort in trying to educate him/her. That's why i appreciate the 'Tree of Life' a bit more than this one.(of course, its always easy to judge somebody else's work, but I haven't made a better film myself, just saying...)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Visually Stunning, but Falls Short of Its Grand Expectations","Despite the massive undertaking of trying to encapsulate the immensity of the novel, no one could have done it better than the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer - the film, in it's very simplest representation, is beautiful. The Costume Design & Makeup team deserve an Oscar for their work as the actors are, at times, so heavily disguised that even the most astute audience member will be surprised to learn who played who.Sadly, the film and its several plot lines lack the cohesion that only the novel could cultivate. With nearly three hours (172 minutes) run time, it still seems not enough time is given to develop the characters and their relationship, and thus, limiting the viewers' emotional investment. The performances are amazing, settings and CGI handled very well, but when it's all over, you're simply left with fragments of each story.My rating of 7/10 is due, in part, to my belief that no one could have produced a better adaptation. Visually stunning, Cloud Atlas is worth seeing, but does not live up to the gargantuan expectations held before it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An enigmatic tale for the curious,"I'm not one to write reviews unless I feel that the movie is deserving of it. After stumbling across Cloud Atlas while on a search for something worth watching, I must say that it is simply put, an enigmatic tale for the critical thinkers and the self-aware. It took me 2 days, yes, 2 days to watch the entire movie due to the amount of movie breaks I took. Each scene was an orgasm of mind blowing dialogue and mystery which had me pondering on some of life's greatest questions. The what ifs. What if we really had the answers to most of the rhetorical questions we often ask ourselves like..""What is the meaning of life? Why am I here? Where do I go after I die? Is there even such a thing as a past life? and if there were, what could I do to make sure I don't repeat the same past life mistakes? Of course to the logical left brain thinker this could only mean one thing..there is no such thing. You might even be considered crazy. However, If you're a dominant right brain thinker, like me, one who considers themselves a think outside of the box individual, a wanderer, a free spirit, or even philosophically speaking, a mystic, then this movie is for you. Beware though, because you might have even more questions after watching than you did prior to watching and then just consider yourself one of the lucky ones, or rather the ""blessed"" to have experienced such a tale in this age of the enlightened.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A visually beautiful insight on Dharma and Karma,"Do yourselves a favour: watch this movie.It deserves a slot in a collection. Not an all-time masterpiece, let me say, but in this time of dull stories at least a serious attempt of telling one.It's a long, intricate crochet. A thin thread intertwining different people and times in a subtle attempt to explain time and life. A whole cosmogony through Dharma and Karma.All in all a good story, although a slightly dumbed down moral cliché appears here and there. Awesome looking film, effective direction, good acting and fantastic photography. Almost 3hrs and yet I was calling for more.One of those movies you will have to go back to, now and again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Best Picture To Not Win Best Picture This Year,"How does one describe Cloud Atlas? Indescribable is a good place to start. Here we have the most ambitious film of the year, probably of the decade (yes, I'm including you Avatar) and there is simply no way to describe it. What I can tell you is that the film explores 6 different stories spanning a vast amount of time and space. Connected to each story is the soul, love, death and life that encompasses us all. Cloud Atlas isn't here to obey narrative structure, classically filmmaking nor does it try to please the masses. It's simply an experience, a dream like experience that will stay with you long after you witness it.The Wachowski Siblings and Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) embark on a journey and ask us, the viewer to go on that journey with them. This journey isn't supposed to make some kind of logical sense, or have a sense of familiarity. From womb to tomb we are bound to others, past and present. Our lives in this world are small in nature, big in scope. If you want to witness something fresh, exciting that pushes the boundaries and makes you think, then see Cloud Atlas.Prometheus was suppose to be the film of the year that made us ponder about our existence and what lies beyond our own world. It failed. Where that film fails, Cloud Atlas succeeds. Abandon the idea that the film is 6 stories and accept that it is one. Each segment blends itself into the next. Some people will try and fail, to see literal connections between each one. We are connected by love, life and death, wanting to see more of a connection between each segment will have you hating everything. This film is not a typical film. We are not given ten minutes of each segment before going onto the next. The film is not told that way, instead it is brilliantly edited to the beat of a heart, the notes on a music sheet, the breaths we take. It's flawless in its presentation.Can a killer in one story, be a hero in another? Played by the same actor, is this the same soul? There is without a doubt, one image that connects every segment. It's a birthmark in the shape of a shooting star/comet. Is this the same person, reincarnated in the next life? The film won't answer your questions, it doesn't want to, or even need to.Having those actors play several roles is an inspired choice. Half the joy of the film is discover who is playing which character. By the credits, all is revealed and some are a shock to see. The make-up effects are astounding. Well recognizable actors disappear behind the make- up, changing sex or race. One hiccup, if I may say, is that we still cannot age our actors correctly. Hugh Grant looks like he is wearing a mask, instead of playing Jim Broadbent's brother.Clocking in at just under 3 hours, the film may seem like a chore to get through, especially considering the amount of stories and characters is has to cover, but not once did I ever think the film was too long. Some stories do drag more than others, but never once did I think it was boring. We are too busy interweaving through time to be bored. If you are looking at this movie in terms of acting, writing, directing, you are looking at it wrong.Will there be another film like Cloud Atlas? Maybe. But the general movie going public isn't ready for a film like this. This is a polarizing film, it has to be, it needs to be, otherwise it doesn't work.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An interesting message lost in too much resources,"It is a movie with an intricate structure. This may result confusing and tiring in the beginning. But as the film goes on, it is easier to follow it. I think it was like an assay for what the directors are doing in Sense 8.They are talking about revolutions, as they did in The Matrix. But more in a sense of the objectives and how much you can get if you decide to go into a revolution. Also, they talk about the world being a big cycle, with the good and the bad being eternal. And how our decisions can not be ultimate, but they only form a part in a long chain of causes and consequences.The philosophy they are based on is very interesting. But the quantity of resources they use is exaggerated. And it makes obvious and repetitive the message they want to tell. They get to share their message, but not in an organic way, not a satisfying one.The cast is interesting. Tom Hanks is surprising, getting a lot of reactions for him for a single movie (still, not my favorite).The make up is very obvious. May be this was intentional, to distinguish which actor made which character. The production design is impressive, as it is expected from the Wachowski. Guessing which director it did what scene can be fun.So, intentions were great, results were not that good. But still, it is a good film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A bunch of mediocre storylines cobbled together,"Cloud Atlas is a bunch of mediocre storylines cobbled together in a way that makes it seem like it's something clever. It's not.

A delightful visual retelling of a kick-ass novel,"It's delightful watching the visual story of David Mitchell's novel ""Cloud Atlas."" While the screen cannot capture all of Mitchell's beautifully worded phrases, interesting word selections, and piercing observations; the film is an enjoyable rendition of a complex novel.Mitchell creates an ascending and descending ladder of stories that travel though time from the 19th century to far future. It's six stories in one, each with a distinctive style and voice. The stories are successively more engaging coming to a head with ""Sloosha's Crossin' An Ev'rythin' After,"" a delightful, fearless romp of language and sound.The movie offers a satisfying treatment of ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish,"" a darkly humorous tale, with Jim Broadbent well-cast as Timothy. It falls flat, however, on its portrayal of ""An Orison of Sonmi."" Mitchell's futuristic world takes digs at consumer culture, corporate entitlement, and the treatment of a labor class. On screen, it looks a lot like Blade Runner and devolves into stereotypical sf and tiresome running and shooting. Doona Bae is perfectly Sonmi-451, however.The novel addresses slavery, exploitation, classism, status, societal structure, and utopian theory and offers the reader lots of room to interpret and explore. The movie distills all this down into a repeated theme, ""from womb to tomb we are all connected."" It's pat, but retains beauty.The movie well-displays the interconnections between the characters, their various incarnations, and the karmic outcomes of their actions — good and evil. The film technique of fading in and out on visually similar themes works perfectly for this. It's particularly pleasing to watch with the novel fresh in mind. The movie also uses quite a few lines directly from the novel. Quite satisfying.The choice to cast the same actors in multiple roles is interesting and certainly appropriate to the theme and style of the story, but it's also weirdly distracting. Tom Hanks is most enjoyable as the outraged author of ""Knuckle Sandwich,"" Dermot Hoggins, but seems a little older than the novel's Zachry, while Hugo Weaving is delightfully villainous in any costume.For a great double-feature: Watch and read Kazuo Ishiguro's ""Never Let Me Go"" (2010).",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Epic Masterpiece,"It seems normal nowadays to watch a sensational movie trailer and assume the movie will be great, based on what you had seen -- until you go see it in theatres and suddenly the trailer contained 85% of what little goodness such a movie managed to muster up. This is becoming all too common.But this is not the case with Cloud Atlas.The trailer alone screamed 'Perpetual, epic, and sensational'... and the film absolutely blew the preview away.The movie takes us on a journey between six story lines from mid 1800s to our post apocalyptic earth, jumping in an intuitive flow-of-consciousness manner from story to story in a completely unlinear way. It takes about 40 minutes of this nearly 3 hour movie for the entire stage to be firmly set in the viewer's mind -- but once it is, you fall in love with each character and embark with them on their journeys through space and time. The story lines, the screenplay, the ensemble cast, the visuals, and the heart of the story that seems so intuitively inspired work together so flawlessly that you may forget you've been shifting nervously in a butt-numbing theatre chair for three hours. Prepare to laugh, cry, twist your face in ways you never expected to (the movie has a very... visual nature to it), and to fidget dramatically with your thumbs.Though there are a few minor gripes.Watching the cast jump gender gaps, races etc can be hilarious... simply because the makeup doesn't always work out. The makeup use is very extreme, and it is usually implemented well, but sometimes shouts through the story ""Hey, I'm definitely Hugo Weaving, though I clearly shouldn't be.""But the movie is guaranteed to polarize audiences into groups of 'that was awesome!' And 'that was a waste of time'. Simply put: if the extended trailer speaks to you in some profound way, or elicits a desire to watch it, this movie is for you. Some people just don't appreciate the way the story is told... its a right brained thing. And right brained people will get the most out of this movie because of our ability to transcend sequential narratives. Left brained people will be left trying to deeply analyze a single, monural instrument and instead miss the intricate orchestral work in the stereo field.In short: if you like the preview, this movie will deliver way beyond expectations. For what it's worth, I guarantee it will leave you knowing you've witnessed the cinematic experience of the century.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Do you want to experience exciting time travel? Watch this.,"Before I write this review, I want to apologize for being doubtful about this movie after watching the trailer thinking ""Oh this is another one of those movies where well-known cast boast their presence with stunning visual effects and abysmal plot."" when it is based on the novel that got numerous receptions and awards. The Cloud Atlas is about various people from different centuries experience incidents that simultaneously and magically get connected through a series of cut scenes.The most amazing thing about this movie is the way they edited to help us catch up the multidimensional scenes. Chronologically, it contains 6 different stories that take us from the remote South Pacific in 19th century to a further post-apocalyptic future, the importance of editing and various roles from multicultural characters is blatantly crucial. This movie can be considered as gambling because of a giant blockbuster cast, the complicated theme that often perplexes audiences. Fortunately, the directors and crews manage to nail it.The number of characters appear in the movie make me deeply think how challenging it must be for everyone to execute different roles to fit their assigned characters. The most memorable character for me is Sonmi-451 played by Doona Bae, the Korean actress whose native language is neither Spanish nor English which are used in this film. Sonmi-451 is basically a genetically engineered clone that is designed to forcefully serve at restaurant owned by the notorious organization called ""Papa song""(Gotta love the name!)in 2144 Seoul, South Korea.As much as I love imagining the future, being able to experience the futuristic environment that consists of majestic skyscrapers that are connected by the transparent bridges where spiffy hybrid cars zipping around is really impressive. One drawback is the lack of originality because it reminds me of ""Tron legacy"" and the street of Midgar in Final Fantasy 7 in terms of looks and the fact that there are destitute citizens that include drug addicts, prostitutes, and bohemians who are under control of an autocrat.No movies motivate me to write this much. There are still many things I would like to add but I better end it here before this review puts you into sleep. And last but not least, please let me share a few tips to those who are planning to watch this.1. Try to pay close attention to the very beginning of the movie. The more you concentrate in the beginning, the easier for you to understand the entire plot.2. Since each actor/actress in this movie is in charge of various roles, it will be difficult to figure it out everyone's identity. If you want to feel how much efforts they put in makeup, I suggest you to know the roles for each character ahead before watching it. The funny thing is even if you do, it will still be extremely hard to tell who they are.3. This method might not work on others as there are different stories that often propel each other from time to time, try to grasp the flow of the movie by feeling instead of trying to scrutinizing each story by connecting them piece by piece.Enjoy the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Magnificent performances in a unique cinematic event.,"This is a remarkable movie that is completely actor driven. This movie showcases the talents of all the principal performers. Each one plays multiple roles, some cross-racial, others cross-gender. Their performances are uniformly great. This has to be Tom Hanks' best movie in years, and the same goes for Halle Berry. The story itself is unique and complex, which is both good and not so good. Good because it tries to show the interconnectedness of human beings that transcends time; not so good because in trying to tell such a story, it seems to bite off more than it can chew, meaning that the story after awhile becomes a little mushy. Nevertheless, that's a minor drawback that does not in any way detract from the magnificent performances of the actors throughout the film. To me, a story should have a tight structure; in this movie the producers have opted for a broader approach, which though impressive never quite achieves the level of spectacular. The reason for that is not because of the story itself but because of the structure of the film which is rife with parallel editing which does not quite succeed in keeping the story on track. Hence the storyline unravels. But with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry each doing six rolls, one still leaves the theatre with a feeling that this movie is a unique cinematic event.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ho-Hum Ideas Made Almost Interesting,"David Mitchell's bloated novel of thin ideas was told in a nesting doll manner, with five chronological stories interrupted while climbing to a complete sixth story and then stepping back to complete the remaining stories, ending at the first. The odd but appealing combination of writer-directors Tom Tykwer and the Wachowskis prefer to tell the stories through cross-cutting--and turn in a more satisfying experience than the book ever was. It's a good, not great, film, primarily because Mitchell's concept--that we are connected, even by such tenuous connections as a birthmark, making us a sea of change--is hardly impressive enough to sustain a film running close to three hours; and there are also glaring plot holes in the script borne by the Wachowskis' insistence on stuffing in action sequences which didn't exist in Mitchell's narrative. But the stories are told with grace and the fact that the majority of the cast (which includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent and the Wachowskis' go-to for bad guys, Hugo Weaving) play multiple roles--many of them performed in drag--does more to advance MItchell's ho-hum concepts than he ever could.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"EXcellent Cast, Great Story, Crap Presentaton","Cloud Atlas was difficult to follow and very confusing. The story is good - IF - you can follow it without getting lost. I had trouble with it but got the gist of most of it. You watch part of a story then you get someone else's story set in a different era and it keeps jumping around like that the whole movie. I really wouldn't recommend it, unfortunately.

It has a truly epic plot, and it really makes you think about the universal connection between seemingly unrelated things.The acting is top notch. One of the other great things about this film is that it is not like some super-overdone Michael-Bay-special-effects-crap- cgi extravaganza. The special effects and cinematography are tastefully done, realistic, and add to the overall awesomeness of the film.People complain about the complexity and layers of the plot.

One extraordinary film,"Never have I ever left the cinema more profoundly touched and moved by a movies message than with Cloud Atlas. What starts as a seemingly innocent premise at the start of the film, evolves into an opus of story telling surpassing the connected events driven story of the film Crash. The film follows several seemingly disconnected strangers, who's lives, actions, and motives shape the course of history over immense gaps in time. This masterpiece of cinema is largely driven by the message of life, through the consequences, actions, and events of many. A message so beautiful in its execution, I sincerely believe those who criticize the film miss the purpose of its storytelling entirely. Throughout each story arch, you can't help but connect the dots, and see the similar concourse each story follows. From the early days of 1800's exploration to the science fiction dystopian society of Neo Seoul, each story interweaves in such a magnificent fashion, you can see just how each character discovers their interconnected lives. No, this isn't the sequel to Looper, there is no time traveling involved here. The concept of Karma is a major player here, shaping the decisions of each of the characters throughout their stories. Realizing what you do affects others in this life or the next? Now that is one powerful message. Whether you believe in Heaven or Hell, the film conveys a very real sense that when one door closes, another opens in its place. Where one person dies, another life begins. I know some will look at this film, and not get the broader message. That is quite fine with me, and I know they will dismiss its importance and impact on cinema. The expert precision, in which the actors played several characters with such creative artistry, was amazing to be frank. At the end of the film you will never believe some of the characters were even played by the same people. I truly applaud the actors in this move for going the extra mile in this, and the makeup artist for their expert transformations they created with the actor's characters. In this day of remakes and stories ripped from books, comics, and the analogues of history, the creativity of this movie can't be ignored. Look past the special effects, the almost indecipherable native speak of the islanders, and the speed dial, furious changing of one stories scene to the others. This is one film I will cherish and hope that others do too. As Tom Hank's character looks to the sky at the end of the film, pointing out Earth to his kin, I can't help but wonder what the universe holds for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"An amazing, astounding and astonishing Atlas","The Wachowskis have once again come out with a mystical masterpiece, co-written and co-directed by Tom Tykwer. Cloud Atlas interweaves several stories set in different times and locations, but which turn out to be linked. It is a breathtaking experience to watch what starts out as unrelated narratives being introduced one after the other, and their respective plots then taking turns being unveiled layer by layer. This device has been employed on film before, but Cloud Atlas' intricate editing really takes the cake. Adding to the fun are the actors playing very diverse characters in the different stories. The movie is a visual delight and despite its three-hour running time, one feels the length is justified.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A strange, difficult and yet entrancing movie","Don't listen to the naysayers. Although it is difficult to put together all of the segments of he movie, the segments of this movie are so interesting and inspiring in themselves that the movie is fascinating even if you can't form a mental synthesis of all the stories. I particularly liked the future world represented by Seoul, Korea. Without giving away the plot, suffice it to say that the combination of spectacular special effects and the ultimate underdog versus establishment storyline make for an exciting and enthralling viewer experience. The Korean actress Doona Bae as a ""fabricant"" is so convincing and likable that she steals the show. The interplay between this story and the story with Tom Hanks and Halle Berre in the ""valley"" in the post apocalyptic world is shocking yet totally plausible. This is not an ""easy"" movie to figure out and definitely not formulaic. Perhaps reading the novel, which I have not done yet, would clarify a lot. But the fact that I want to read the novel is indicative of the movie's strange and gripping hold on the viewer.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Flawed but entertaining,"This is a very ambitious film, lasting three hours and telling six different stories from different eras and places, all still supposedly connected to each other.Casting is good. Each main actor plays multiple parts. Make-up and CGI are not always as good as one would expect from a high budget film, but they don't make or break this film. All the stories are constantly interlaced, and this editing choice makes the film interesting by itself.The biggest problem is that none of the individual stories are neither very original nor very interesting. Their connection to each other is also extremely vague and superficial. The grand idea is apparently the continuity of souls, but the film really fails to consummate this, apart from using the same actors in all the stories and an occasional reference to something created by or about the characters from the past.Regardless of its shortcomings, I was moderately entertained by the kaleidoscopic journey that Cloud Atlas offered for its entire length.

Admirable Effort From the Creative Team,"There's plenty to say about Cloud Atlas, lots of positives and lots of negatives but I want to preface this with a tip of my cap to Twyker and the Wachowskis for trying to capture these stories. This was a hugely ambitious effort, spanning several different time periods, characters and trying to deliver a message about fate I don't think every story worked equally well, a couple of them almost didn't work at all but both themselves and their team deserve credit for the attempt regardless of it being completely successful or not. Watching this movie is an experience, whether its good or bad is up to you and creating a memorable product is an accomplishment.Breaking down the individual performances is going to be tough because each member of the cast is playing many characters instead of just one but I'll do my best. It was weird watching Tom Hanks play several slimy and shady characters, there's a certain amount of reverence to his presence in a movie but it's cool to see him attempt something different. I didn't think this was his best work across the board, he's appropriately scummy but he's pretty broad so his characters get diluted. Halle Berry is fine, she's more affecting in some of the stories than others. Her scenes with Hanks in the dystopic timeline are the most memorable but her story with the corrupt nuclear plan officials was where she did her best work. Jim Broadbent is the hero in some stories and the villain in others. He's a great character actor, I think he does his best work in supporting parts and the movie's better for having him in it. It was fun to see Hugh Grant attempt so many different parts, he's a good actor but he gets put into the same part over and over again. Seeing him play a native assassin was a little much but it was interesting casting. Ben Whishaw was pretty affecting as Robert Frobisher specifically, he's good across the board but that was the highlight of his work. I was kind of embarrassed for Hugo Weaving, its not necessarily his fault but he plays some ridiculous characters and while he does the best he can, he's awful at points. The worst performance is from Bae Doona as Sonmi, she's so wooden, to be fair, that was probably how she was directed but it still removed the stakes from Sonmi's story and I wish it hadn't.Getting to the plot, some of the stories work better than others, my personal favourites was the doomed saga of Robert Frobisher and Luisa Rey's mission to expose the corruption around the nuclear power facility in San Francisco. I was interested in those throughout and when the movie would cut away, I was disappointed. My least favourites were Sonmi's adventures in New Seoul in 2144 and the post-apocalyptic scramble on The Big Island. This was surprising to me because I love sci-fi and yet those were the two weakest. The other two (Cavendish's surprise visit to the nursing home in present day and the journey from the Pacific Islands in 1849) fell somewhere in the middle, they both had their enjoyable moments but weren't enthralling overall. With anthology movies (whether this is a true anthology or not, you can decide) it's just natural some are going to be more interesting than others. The only thing I can add is that the stories I liked were interesting enough to keep me watching through the less impressive ones.Cloud Atlas is a movie for the romantics, the dreamers in us all that want to believe that everything happens for a reason and that we're meant for greater things. Using that idea as a backdrop can be dangerous (see Winter's Tale for an example of a misfire). It invites a sense of grandeur and it raises audience expectations. I did get swept up in Cloud Atlas but with the uneven execution, shifty editing and bloated length, It limits the effectiveness and can't justify its almost 3 hour run time.I appreciated the effort that was put into Cloud Atlas but even a truly exceptional movie can barely warrant 3 hours of your attention. Even with the best intentions, Cloud Atlas alternates between diverting to a patience trying slog. It wasn't easy to get through but I did If you're into the book or the experimental kind of film making going on here, be prepared of what you're getting yourself in to. There's some good stuff here but it's all up to you because you have to sift through the rest.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

wow... a modern masterpiece out of Hollywood with impeccable writing / directing from the Wachowski brothers,"wow what a film... so glad i finally locked in this modern feat proving an instant masterpiece... the Wachowski brothers are back with their best effort since the original Matrix film, possibly even surpassing it's predecessor with it's ambitious overlapping narrative form, yet somehow stringing together different time periods, a juxtaposition of characters or a common bond / theme rolls throughout each part... it's like watching 5 different films at once, with their stories unwinding in a similar way... stating that there is life after death & we keep making the same mistakes until there's an urgent call for change, for revolution, for love, for all eternity...this is not an easy watch with a running time of 172 mins, but i urge yourself like i did to pick a time that you are prepared for a ride like no other... a brilliant screenplay impeccably delivered to the screen by these 2 brothers, proving there is still hope for greatness out of Hollywood & original stories / concepts...the film reminds me of are Wong Kar Wai's ""2046"" and Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" in narrative structure, but taken to new heights with the way the stories transition and interweave... yes it's a long film but i couldn't see this cut any shorter from an editor's perspective, it was perfect in it's delivery by close that left me with chills... it's a film you'll get a lot more from with repeated viewings, like the Wachowski brothers ""The Matrix"" did all those years ago... but this time upping the anti with this feat of writing / directing that is extremely rare nowadayshowever reading figures of opening weekend and sales since then makes me think this $100M+ film may not break even, so do your part to check this film out, hire it or buy it... even if u refuse to pay for media nowadays, d/l & watch it then decide weather it's worth owning... cause if u have an intense experience like i did, ull be hanging to watch it again on Blu Ray -9/10 and added to my ""Masterpiece Collection"" list",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Astounding Beauty of A Film,"What can you write about a film that makes you laugh, keeps you guessing, puts you on that edge of your seat, and riles your soul with the gracious magnificence that is usually only captured in such literary epics as this film is based. Let me first start with the soundtrack, for this, upon everything else, is certainly a grander type of music, epic in its scale, and moving by itself. The music that underlies this film is as powerful and amazing as each segment.Let us look at the lives of these men and women, drawn to and from each other time and time again, some as tragedies, some as victories, some as beautiful and gorgeous renditions of purpose and grandness, all in life, all in the recurring pebble thrown into the pond causing ripples, time and time again, through time and history.What grace and beauty... oh what wonder and power lives in these stories that make a film that is as beautiful as beautiful as a Cloud Atlas might be.You have the story of Adam Ewing who wants to get home to his wife, while dying upon a ship, and making a friend. The story of a musician determined to create something beautiful writing to his love of this journey. There's the story of a reporter drawn into a story she never intended to discover. There's the story of an old man whose forced into a retirement home that seems to be right out of the psych-ward of One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. There's Sonmi whose story is one of revolution. And there's a final story for which is difficult to describe as nothing more than a futuristic Apocolyptica.I know of no movie with such gall and no movie with such a wallop of suspense and perfected editing that you are never jolted, but, easily moved from laughing to sitting at the edge of your seat to crying to smiling to feeling an overwhelming sense of wonderment and life.I will be seeing this movie again. I will be buying this movie when it comes out. I loved this film completely. It was top notch. A+++ You will enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Universality of Mankind,"What you might feel after watching thiz movie? You may be confused, you may be disappointed or if you watch closely enough, you may find a hidden philosophy inside. Thiz movie has six stories with six different time periods, from little island in South Pacific to the post-apocalyptic Hawaiian Islands, from the primitive year 1849 to far in the future 2321. The stories come from any direction and finally meet at one point. The story is meant to be connected to one another, however, don't be surprised if you eventually find that the connection is very minor. In point of fact, you may miss the connection if you're not careful. ""Cloud Atlas"" is the latest project from Tom Tykwer and The Wachowskis, starring Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Jim Broadbent, Ben Winshaw, James D'Arcy, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant, Doona Bae and Xun Zhou. All Actors have more than one role during different time periods. As a matter of fact, some Actors are so buried underneath their makeup that we could hardly recognize them. To make things even worse, some of them are seemingly drawn into comical performances such as Hugo Weaving, James D'Arcy, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant. The better performances come from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Ben Winshaw. And the scene stealer is definitely Doona Bae who depicts a genetically-engineered clone named Sonmi-451. Doona Bae delivers a complex and inspiring character. On the directorial side, Tom Tykwer carries out 1936's, 1973's and 2012's segment. On the other side, Andi and Lana (used to be Larry) Wachowski handle 1849's, 2144's and 2321's segment. Personally, I prefer Wachowskis' direction. They can keep up the pace of their stories and prevent it from being boring. It reminds us of how good The Wachowskis really are when depicting futuristic tales, just like what they did in ""The Matrix"" (1999). On the other hand, even though I love the previous Tom Tykwer's works such as ""Run Lola Run"" (1998), but thiz time, he seems to have put anything one-dimensional. In other words, Tom Tykwer's direction is boring. If it's not because of the intriguing futuristic tale of Sonmi-451 which is directed by The Wachowskis, thiz movie will undoubtedly become an unnecessary B-Class movie. In the end, thiz is something bigger than you think. It's all about a belief in the universality of mankind. Basically, there is no difference between countries, races and even genders, where white can become black, black can become white and white can become Asian. We are all one, we are all the same, learning and strive for a better condition.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A True Cinematic Masterpiece & Ideological Achievement,"Cloud Atlas is a cinematic, story-telling masterpiece with an incredibly deep, meaningful, and thought-provoking philosophy woven into its six interconnected stories about how our choices and external phenomena have life-altering effects not only on ourselves, but also create a ripple effect throughout time and space and affect those around us and even those in the distant future. Cloud Atlas is a bold, passionate, and ambitious movement not to be taken lightly and not for the faint of heart. Completely immerse yourself throughout this three-hour epic. Don't struggle to get comfortable with it. Let it master you, and you will be immensely rewarded with the grand emotional culmination. Yet even still, it demands multiple viewings. Its sophisticated ideology and philosophy will cause one to introvert and reflect on what influences their lives and the expansively possible consequences of their choices, as well as the differences they can make. The Cloud Atlas universe is one full of mystery and wonder, and it takes viewers on a spectacular journey as the plot evolves. There is so much depth here that it appeals to a broad audience as each subplot emphasizes its own genres. The film's cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and the Academy Award has already been won by the makeup department for their astonishing transformations of the actors, who embody roles of differing race, sex, and ethnicity. Cloud Atlas is a true work of art, a moving, profoundly entertaining cinematic accomplishment, and a standout movie of the decade. It has the power to deeply, psychologically affect its viewers, and its ideas and notions could reverberate for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

story,"I'm a plot man myself. You know, A story, B story. even C story, but this film tried to have A - Z stories, which in my mind didn't quite work. Like a fabric, often a film layers multiple yarns to reach a stitched cloth. On first viewing, discounting the extraordinary poly-charactered performances, this cloth did not sew the pieces together enough for me, to make it a yarn worth spinning.There are brilliantly disparate performances by this ensemble, notably from Doona Bae, whose androgenous sexuality is hard to dismiss (50 shades of Lena Wachowski?). Wonderful make-up, scenery and CG components that are capturing, but this film for me lacked an arc; and that may be because this film has no central heart.We are asked by the film makers to suspend disbelief, without serious character analysis and journey.We are instead asked to suspend a story arc in favour of a possible link in lineage, time and face. Face, because while we see the same characters play such disentangled roles, there's not a lot of structure to link one character, plot or emotion to another.So what am I to think? I sure do need to watch this film again - to which I might write a completely different critique, but on first viewing this is, as was the Matrix 2 & 3, far too high a hurdle to jump, and far too wide a chasm of story for me to hold this film up as archetypal or game changing.I fear I just want to say wtf?I shall watch it again, and leave you to disseminate a film far in scope but potentially short in answers.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overrated and Pretentious Mess,"""Cloud Atlas"" is one of the most overrated and pretentious movies that I have ever seen. With the available budget, the producers should have chosen a great screenplay but it seems that they prefer to invest in marketing insteadGreat cast, make-up and special effects are the best this flick can offer. Unfortunately the story is confused and the awful screenplay is a complete mess, maybe based on an acid trip. But many viewers write telling that they like it (there are reviews telling that this mess is a masterpiece – I am not sure whether they are ironic) and the money certainly returned to the pocket of the producers. Last but not the least, I loved the review that says ""It's like Dune if it was directed by George Lucas not David Lynch"".

"Has something to offer, just can't put a finger on it","When I finished watching this film, my first thought was that it is beyond me. Maybe only a handful of movies you watch in your lifetime give you this feeling. You feel that it was beautiful, you want to call it a masterpiece, but you can't name what it was exactly that made you feel this way. In terms of direction, production, and acting, it's a 10/10 all around. The wachowskis and twyker deliver amazingly. The only flaws lie within the plot, which like the beauty, it is hard to determine where they lie. You could say it has its problems in it's being confusing or complicated at sometimes, but you can't discredit it for that. Maybe it's the message, but no, you can't discredit it for that either. This film is another example of why certain films receive split critical reception on both ends of the spectrum. Some say it's garbage, some say it's near perfect. I believe this is because people are conflicted on their feelings about it. Half of them feels one way, half feels the other. They just end up leaning towards one and end up convincing themselves that that is their final input on the film. It will be debated and discussed and dissected for decades, and that is the beauty of it. I will love to see what people draw from this. I've come to the conclusion that this film is something I don't know if I love or dislike, and that brings me to my rating. I give this a 10/10 because like I said in the beginning, it feels beyond me. Anything that gives me that feeling is a 10/10. It has some element to it that makes it feel perfect, even though you cannot name it. Even if I disliked it, I rate films based on how good they are, not fully based on my enjoyment, which in saying I must add that I did enjoy it. There is something this film has to offer to us, and it is up to us to find out what.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Go See This Movie! -No Spoilers-,"There's been a lot of gripes about the film so far and it's only the opening weekend. I for one enjoyed it even more than I thought I would. Going in having a vague idea of what to expect wasn't idea as I think if I had no idea what to expect I would have enjoyed it even more.The idea that a feature length movie would have six interlocking stories all with multiple themes that come together into a resounding theme is awesome. I can't think of any movies other than this one that's done it at all and if there are others I doubt they would accomplish it in such a cool way. Each character begins in the movie and then their story is taken into the next character and the next until the end story. In this way it manages to climax all of the stories and close them one by one until we are back at the beginning of the end. It was admittedly slower at first because they are building all story lines but by the end of the movie I was just so pleased with the outcome I didn't mind the very minor short comings. Of which I can only find two. The makeup on the main characters can be decidedly reaaallly odd sometimes but when you think about it there's not really a way they could have interlocked these characters together in a simplistic way. Something that needs to be done for North American audiences, as reading other reviews they are clearly missing the overall scope and theme as well as the minor ones that pop up that resound into the other stories. The second short coming was what I had said before, just that it is slower to build but does a nice job of tugging you along as you're trying to figure out how all these people are woven together exactly.The main point is just that it's really nothing I've seen in film as yet and it does a great job doing what it set out to do. All the stories would be enjoyable in their own right. But I really like how they have tied them all together and explored a lot more then just the main theme. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shallow characters and cumbersome stories,"The idea of soul mates reincarnating together and interacting through time is explored in Cloud Atlas, a thought-provoking film directed by Tom Twkyer with Andy and Lana Wachowski. Based on the novel of the same name by David Mitchell, the title refers to a musical composition whose notes suggest the movement of clouds across the open skies. In the film version, six connecting stories are interwoven over a span of five centuries, with the same six characters playing different age, gender, and personality roles. Most stories involve a decision a character has to make as to whether to rebel against a powerful oppressor and risk their life, or submit to authority and accept the consequences.The stories do not always unfold in a linear manner and there is often quick movement back and forth across time which may create an obstacle to some viewer's emotional investment. In the first episode set in 1849, Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess), a lawyer involved in the slave trade, has his life changed when he saves a Moriori man Autua (David Gyasi) from certain death at the hands of Maori's and European conquerors and allows him to become a stowaway aboard the ship. The native man in turn saves Ewing's life when he is poisoned by Dr. Henry Goose (Tom Hanks). In the 1930's, English composer Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw), in love with a Cambridge student, Rufus Sixmith (James D'Arcy), is working on a piece called the Cloud Atlas Sextet, when he becomes an assistant to a prominent Belgian composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent). Egotism and greed lead to unwanted consequences for both men.In San Francisco in 1973, reporter Luisa Ray's (Halle Berry) life is endangered when she becomes involved with the cover-up of a flawed nuclear reactor being proposed by a powerful conglomerate. She must decide if she wants to proceed with the inquiry and risk her life to expose the corruption. In the film's simplest and most entertaining section taking place in present day London, publisher Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) in money trouble hides out at a hotel suggested to him by his brother. The hotel, however, turns out to be a nursing home run by a tyrannical Nurse Noakes (Hugo Weaving in drag) where he is kept prisoner and formulates a plot to escape with his elderly companions.The film continues in 2144 in Korea, now named Neo Seoul. A clone, Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae), serving fast food for twelve years for the Papa Song corporation discovers her true identity aided by Hae-Joo Im and begins to question authority leading to a confrontation and an interrogation. In the final episode set at an unnamed date in the future after ""the Fall,"" Zachry (Tom Hanks) a member of a primitive community who speaks in a new language, must fight off a tribe with painted faces bent on destruction. He is asked for help by Meronym (Halle Berry), a member of a group known as the Prescients, so that she is able to communicate with survivors.In all of these sections, Cloud Atlas strives to capture the middle ground between an artistic ""message film"" and a popular entertainment that has broad-based appeal. In straddling the fence, however, it does not truly succeed in either genre and the result has little life. While the film has strong ideas about freedom, love, reincarnation, and the inter-connectedness of all people and lets you know about them – often, its ideas, particularly those of reincarnation and karma, are never fully explored and the characters have no inner life. Didactic pronouncements about the way it is are buried beneath shallow characters and cumbersome stories saturated with excessive comic book violence, murders, suicides, betrayals, and enslavement, none of which fit into a film that explores how love endures throughout time.The film is not, as Tom Hanks futuristic character put it, the ""true true"" but the ""true false,"" a film that means to be inspiring but isn't, one that has a spiritual theme but with more special effects and technical wizardry than real spiritual feeling. The truth is not simply a good idea that can be explained, it must be lived in. It is only in the mystery of life and the experience of not knowing that we become aware of the truth, however dimly. According to the Zen saying in Mumonkan 18, ""You do not define the truth - you simply enter into it."" Cloud Atlas talks about it but stands outside.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cloud Atlas is a movie that is able to pull six story lines together and make them play off each other in a way that actually reveals a greater story about mankind,"The Wachowskis have built a career on highly ambitious films such as The Matrix and V for Vendetta, and Cloud Atlas looks to be their biggest undertaking yet as they partner with director Tom Tykwer to tell a story that cover six story lines taking place over thousands of years and working with an ensemble cast filled with more than twelve cast members. Suddenly the task in front of the three writers seems far bigger in scope than any movie in the last quarter of a century at the least.

"Impressively ambitious, but noticeably flawed.","How can so many stories be told in one movie and be connected across so many different landscapes? The answer: with great (and often noticeable) effort.Positives: First and foremost, I was impressed by each actor's ability to portray similar or completely different characters; Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent especially, they were the characters I liked the most. No weak performances as a whole.The writers also did a good job making nearly all the main characters in the story distinct; many of them using archetypes that are satisfying to see on screen (though I guarantee you will root for some and be bored by others).The visual and editing styles of the movie are an art form in and of themselves. It deserves to be commended how they blended a historical movie, a fantasy movie, a sci-fi, a comedy, and detective movie all in the same film. The transitions are expertly done- going from one world to another often feels natural or unnoticed- it undoubtedly took great planning and great work.The Negative: I didn't like two of the stories told here: I'll just refer to one as the ""sci-fi"" story and the other as the ""fantasy."" My complaints: First, not enough exposition or character development. When the world you're telling your story in is weird and alien, you have to include a lot more information for the audience to suspend their disbelief. Or barring that, at least give us characters we love and can relate to. This is a fundamental rule of sci-fi movies and I'm surprised the Wachowski brothers messed it up here. Both of these worlds are given to us at face value, with little or no explanation of when/where they are or how they got to be. And the ""plots"" of these segments are the weakest and most clichéd in the movie- stuff we've seen done better in dozens of other sci-fi movies.Second, both of these stories suffer greatly from a very forced ""new language"" element. It takes a lot of effort to understand what the characters are trying to say in these worlds- one of them uses a devolved English dialect (which I found cheap and inconsistent), and in the other people talk like over-articulate robots- like the architect scene in the matrix movies (remember how *great* that dialogue was?). This made it incredibly difficult to care about these characters- we can't understand them when they talk. Beyond that, their actions are all basic ""survival"" stuff, none of which reveals any unique character (though there was one very cool element used to show one of the character's inner turmoil, it was nonetheless a trick we've seen before and didn't add to what we know about him).Third, and I hate to say this after only seeing the movie once, but I fail to see how these stories are interconnected in any meaningful way. Maybe that's just me, but I was expecting a very clear indication of how and why these stories interrelate. Nope. It's all vague and analogous. Also unclear- are we seeing the same character through different lifetimes or not? One viewing wasn't enough to convince me that Tom Hanks in story A was the same character he played in story B. It *could* be that way, (I'm sure the book makes it more clear), but like I said, I wasn't convinced.Fourth- Odd attempts to change actor's races with make-up. I have no problem with an Englishman being married to an Asian woman in 1843, but trying to make her look white is at best a ""nice try"" and at worst offensive. I'd rather they leave the actors faces alone or just use different actors- it's an impressive display of make-up and effects, but it calls attention to itself and takes us out of the movie.Fifth- what was the message of the movie? No, really, what was it? Was it the line from the trailer? Was it something about love surviving between lifetimes? Was it anti-government? Was it that evil will always exist? I just saw the movie, and I can't tell you what the point of it was. Some of the stories involve broad statements about the human condition, and others focus on the humor in modern life. And unfortunately, no message here is strong, clear, or unique. It's all vague new age philosophy with symbolic (rather than relatable) justification.So in the end, this movie deserves credit for being a genre-blending prototype. A film that does successfully show 6 different stories in one movie- but unfortunately, the quality of those 6 varies greatly, and connections between the them are only loosely if not superficially available.Maybe save this one for netflix with your intro to psychology class.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The Ambitious Experiment of ""Cloud Atlas"" - A Tapestry of Time","So I just finished watching Cloud Atlas for the first time and it was definitely an experience, you guys. This movie is not your typical three-hour blockbuster - it's more like six movies in one with the same actors playing totally different roles across different eras.The way it connects all these stories from the 1800s to a post-apocalyptic future through the theme of how our actions impact the future was really thought-provoking. But it also made the plot super complex to follow. I felt like I needed a diagram and a flowchart to keep track of who was who in each timeline lol.The cast was incredible though - you have legends like Tom Hanks and Halle Berry transforming completely into their roles. The makeup and costumes were insane too. Props to the design team for pulling off such different looks.While the movie definitely makes you think on a deeper level about society and freedom, it's a lot to take in over its long runtime. I could see how some people might find it boring or lose the thread of the story. It challenges you as a viewer for sure.In the end, Cloud Atlas is one of those films that really divides audiences. Some will love how ambitious and creative it is, while others might feel overwhelmed by its complexity. It definitely leaves you with a lot to discuss! I can see myself rewatching just to catch all the details I missed. Overall, it gets 7 stars from me for taking risks and making me think, even if it was a brain workout.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"To and fro, back and forth...","""Cloud Atlas"" is an epic film that left me breathless, speechless, and wanting more. The films' virtuoso craftmanship beckons, nay, returns to an era long gone where the writers and the directors, not the studios, were given complete creative control over how their movies should look, feel and be. The fact that this film is nearly 3 hours in length shows the film's brilliant refusal to compromise itself for the sake of marketability.As the films' six main story lines strongly weave together like a cane basket, we progress from a number of different genres, from period adventure, to forbidden period romance, to conspiracy thriller, to slapstick black comedy, to futuristic/post-apocalyptic science fiction. Many characters weave to and fro, some will meet again in the next timeline in the most unexpected of waves. So is life. How ponderous.Such extraordinary and introspective screen writing is handled perfectly along with top-notch filmmaking skills by Lana and Andy Wachowski, and Tom Tykwer. Yes, three filmmakers. Lana and Andy, responsible for ""The Matrix"" trilogy, and Tykwer, famous for ""Run Lola Run"" and ""Perfume"" have triumphed with supremely ambitious, visionary and focused filmmaking. ""Cloud Atlas"", the trio's labour of love, is as good as any film they have made, perhaps far more better. This film is Terrence Malick mixed with Ridley Scott. Probably.This is the work of great artists who have collaborated artistically and professionally to create this one-of-a-kind movie. Supreme visual effects and good cinematography interweave with great variable performances from the impressive ensemble (Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Doona Bae, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant), flawless production design, interesting make-up effects and terrific music by Tykwer, Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek (Pale 3, a favourite of mine). A lot of hard work and effort went into this film and it pays off, with Tykwer and the Wachowskis transforming David Mitchell's novel into a daring, complex, intelligent and intriguing Grade-A work of cinematic modern art.Good movies are ones that leave you satisfied and memorable. Great movies will leave you wondering long after the movie is over. Excellent movies are the ones which leaves you speechless and makes you want to discuss its philosophies with almost everyone you see on the street. Are we all connected by the fabric of time? Do we remember each other in previous lives? Are we all indirectly connected to each other, this life of the next? And so on.I truly cannot say more for this extraordinary film. This film is a work of genius(es), and I cannot wait to see it again. 3 hours have never gone by so fast. May this film be rewarded richly in the coming years.Overall: 95%",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"An Unwatchable, arrogant, confusing mess of a movie.","Grossly over-acted, impossible-to-follow plot lines, absurd accents and the most jumbled editing ever. Boo! We had high expectations for Cloud Atlas. Unfortunately, our group of four smart and frequent movie-goers, walked out on Cloud Atlas after the first two confusing hours of painful cinematic failure. The storyline is complex, the accents are absurd and flawed. The six bizarre and pretentious plot lines jump around so poorly that you are dazed and confused. It's visually compelling, but nearly impossible to follow. Halle Berry, Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant ""chew the scenery"" with horribly bad accents. The Wachowski's reached to make a complex book into an epic drama and they got terribly lost along the way. I read a lot of great reviews calling this an ""epic,"" but it's a failure. There are aspects of the six stories that are interesting and the actors work hard, but this film is a mess. It's pretentious, long, arrogant and confusing for no good reason. It has been many years since we walked out on a film. About 20 others in the theater left too. We asked a manager as we left what he had heard from people... he said the film was very ""divisive"" among attendees, some liked it--some hated it, and both groups felt strongly. He indicated the film had a very large number of walkouts by unhappy film goers. I wish I had better things to say about this film... The effort was ambitious and expensive (over $100 Million to make.) It grossed $9 million opening weekend and was described widely as a ""bomb.""

You don't have to walk out completely understanding it to truly appreciate it.,"I walked into the cinema having pretty much no clue what I was about to see. All I really knew about ""Cloud Atlas"" was that it was co-directed by what used to be the Wachowski Brothers but is now the Wachowski Siblings (the team responsible for the Matrix trilogy and ""Speed Racer"" before Larry Wachowski became Lana Wachowski) along with Tom Tykwer (""Perfume: The Story of a Murder""). Oh, and that it was apparently a singular story that spanned centuries with numerous big-name actors playing a multitude of parts in a multitude of eras. And it had a running time of just under three hours.Ouf.Alas, with murmuring of Oscar possibilities and the talk of incredible visuals, my cinematic obligation superseded my hesitation. And I have no regrets.In reality, ""Cloud Atlas"" is a myriad of interlocked stories unfolding through half a dozen eras spanning from the late 1800s to the distant future through almost seventy characters played by just a dozen actors and extraordinary visual effects that must be seen on the IMAX screen.Tom Hanks and Halle Berry lead the charge, playing a dozen completely dissimilar characters, some with similar traits, each creating their personas with such pronounced detail, from the selfish, conniving doctor to the almost-worshipped ""alien"" visitor, accents ranging from British to Queens to ""Nell""-like mumbo-jumbo, but never leaving you batting an eye while you think about scratching your head. British heavyweights Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, James D'arcy and Hugh Grant with UK lightweight Ben Wishaw all bring such incredible life to nearly three dozen characters of all ages, sex and sexual proclivity. Susan Sarandon? Always a pleasure.And then there is relative newcomer Doona Bae who also slips into a half dozen characters, yet all but steals the show as Fabricant Sonmi-451. If there was a first possibility of a Best Supporting Actress nomination, it goes to Bae for playing a non-human who finds humanity within, portrayed through exquisite physical control and expression. The visual execution of the film is one of the most extraordinary to hit the big screen in some time, jumping from London in the 1800s to California in the 70s to a distant-future Seoul and a post-apocalyptic wasteland that bridges the past to the future. And the directors and editor, Alexander Berner, manage to jump from one to the other almost seamlessly, despite the polarizing images of environment and segues of triumph, love, passion, tenderness, disaster and unforgiving violence.So, all this leads to the question ""What is 'Cloud Atlas' about?""To tell you the truth, I have no idea where to even begin. And if I tried, it could ruin the experience for anyone who chooses to undertake the task. Even Roger Ebert wrote ""I gave up any attempt to work out the logical connections between the segments, stories and characters."" Indeed, they are connected, but to try to figure out how they truly overlap is another story. This is a film that one needs to see a few times and will still probably not figure it out. But unlike last year's ""Tree of Life,"" which not only made no sense, was suicide-inducingly boring and pointless, the viewer walked away angry that they wasted two hours of their lives on crap-posing-as-art, ""Cloud Atlas"" will leave you elated, satisfied and hopeful, even if you walk on not quite being able to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. It all culminates into an extremely emotional crescendo regardless of whether you find yourself lost or not.What I can say is that it is about Truth. And what one will do to cover Truth, discover Truth, run from the Truth, embrace the Truth, repent from the Truth and how heroes are willing to die to expose the Truth.And love. Love between a man and a woman, love between two men, love between parent and child, love between human and non-human. That love is love and it should never, ever be considered ""forbidden.""And that, my friends, is the Truth.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The weaving is better than the threads,"This movie was very unusual. The individual stories, of which there were 6, had very little of interest between them. Somehow, however, it managed to keep my interest for 3 hours with the smooth and rapid transitions, the wonderful visuals, and the excellent music. I even empathized with some of the characters, despite the simplicity and clichéd nature of their stories.I think it a shame that the individual stories were not better crafted, although I understand that drawing from a book brings about limitations. The weaving was very well done, and if the stories being woven had been of high rather than middling quality, this could have been truly incredible.As it stands, nothing about the components of this film are complex or new, but together I found it to be quite the spectacle.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No. No. No.,"Elaborate trash. Stylish arrogance. A film for people who have attention deficit disorder, at best. The nonsense of this film begins with a strangely cast Tom hanks mumbling in an incomprehensible accent about who can figure out what? While all of the many pointless events of this film are supposed to be connected, the only connection I can see in this film is how otherwise gifted actors, directors and producers can be tricked into working on this incomprehensible film. There used to be an art in complex films called ""continuity""...and that is the first sacrifice of this film. It jumps from past to future to present, between actors and accents, between scenes and dialogue with such confusion that really the effort can only be described as absurd. Are people afraid to tell the truth now? That this film has such a high rating is very suspicious. Are the ratings made by the actors and their friends? Are the ratings here honest? I do not see how they could be, as this is a confusing, disjointed and really pathetic attempt at something that in itself makes no sense. There is not one character accompanied by a history or a sense of why we should care about them, where they come from or what they are doing. I can only imagine that people have allowed themselves to rate this film so highly rather than admit they were tricked out of their money into enduring what can only be described as torture. Hanks in particular is just horrible in this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Amazing Movie,"I took my siblings with me to watch the movie, the 12.30am show. During the drive they kept saying that they would sleep throughout the movie because it was too late and the running time was too long. However, I took them along with me, hoping that they wouldn't sleep through it. The movie started and I must say that the first 20 minutes it feels quite slow. However, things begin to speed up after that and that's when the fun starts. The Sonmi-451 segment is fast-paced and visually amazing. The whole city is stunning to look at and the story progresses quite fast.'The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing' is a bit slow. However, many will find it interesting. If you are looking for comedy, then 'The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish' is for you. The directors give everything to the audience in this movie. You have your mystery, your period drama, sci-fi and comedy, all in one movie. You will find some of the stories boring, while some you will enjoy. This depends upon the kind of genre you like watching.Owing to the fact that the cast is amazing, the performances are awesome. Every actor delivers and you will feel that they really got the concept of the movie. The makeup is the 'fun' part of the film and you will enjoy trying to figure out the actors playing different characters while donning various get-ups.Is this movie for everyone? Well, I would say that it isn't. Many people won't like the way the directors shift from one story to the next and so on. Many people won't even be able to find the 'connections' in the six stories. However, I would say that such people will enjoy the film if they stop thinking of finding connections. Just think of this film as six independent stories regarding the struggle that six individuals have to go through. If you don't want to think too much then don't. The film is enjoyable even if you can't figure out what the story wants to convey.Should the directors have done something that could have connected to a wider audience? The answer lies in whether or not they wanted to make this film into a blockbuster or if they wanted to do something completely out of the box. The directors have displayed their skills and the actors have conveyed that they are able to tackle an array of different characters without breaking a sweat.I'm just happy that my siblings didn't sleep through the movie. They watched the whole thing. Yes, they didn't quite understand what the actors were saying, especially in the 'Sloosha's Crossin' story. However, they were still able to understand the film.Cloud Atlas is a spectacle when it comes to the visuals and the acting. Every actor has so much to deliver in as each character. Give this movie a chance. Watch it with an open mind. The film is able to deliver a lot for the amount you have paid for the ticket. I don't know if it will be able to attract any Oscar buzz. However, I feel it will be considered, in the years to come, as a movie in which the directors tried to bring something different to the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Wachowski's do it again - Masterfull,"I'm not sure where to even begin with this.Profoundly intelligent, masterful film comes to mind .Even at almost 3 hours long, it clips along at an easy rate and I never felt bored at any point.Wildly ambitious films like this rarely find their mark, but like ""The Matrix"" it shrugs off that mantle and comes through in spades.The storyline is a intricate multidimensional one of human struggle, psyche, systems of belief, love and fear and how everything is interlinked in a complex web of mind body and soul.I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since Inception, though this one jacked the whole concept up to a new level.The Wachowski's have really created a master piece with this one.Not a film I'm going to be content to watch once, which is something I'm usually happy to do.An incredible, cinematic and thought provoking experience that shouldn't be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A perspective in understanding the message of the movie,"For all those who are a bit confused with the story or the message of the movie, I offer a perspective that may be helpful.I think it is important to first and foremost understand that the movie is an allegory. The characters and plot are used to show us how interconnectedness works in all of our lives. The characters are only analogies in trying to explain the director's view. That is the underlying foundation that holds everything together. Don't get lost in plot, because plot alone cannot explain what the director's are trying to share.The theme of the movie is that we are influenced by and influence everything.The resolution of conflict takes place between those who are consumed by ego, ""They want more"", (i.e. greedy corporations, slave drivers, crazy face painted tribesman) versus a letting go of ego (understanding another's point of view, not fearing standing up for others, feeling connected).An example of the forces of extreme ego fighting with truth is when the slave and the lawyer trusted and believed in each other only because they saw the truth in each other. Throughout the remainder of the movie we see how this initial trust in each other, help them throughout their journey. Can anyone argue that they are not kindred spirits? Their positions in life would never allow them to connect. And their positions in life are a direct result of how our collective ego's (greed) allow for one man to enslave another. However, in their case, they connected on a deeper level and their relationship was beautiful because of it.Then there was the scene when the slave showed everyone that he is the Michael Jordan of sailing. The Captain was ruled by his ego's ideas of the world (slaves are only good for one thing). He had to see the TRUTH in order for him to accept the slave as a sailor. He had to suspend his ego (I know what is best) in order to allow the truth to come in (I was wrong, don't shoot that man). That is a powerful message.And there was one more somewhat subtle example of how something from the ""past"" can change our lives. When the Korean girl's friend is killed, she is killed because she stands up for herself. Her only reference of doing so is watching a clip from a movie based on a period of time when freedom was a given (the old man stating that he would not stand for the injustice). Her death had an affect on the main girl (the director made sure to make this clear for us), and it was the beginning of her emancipation. Events like these happen all the time in our lives, we aren't necessarily aware of them all the time. And her standing up for her rights was extremely serious but the origin of that was actually very comical.The whole movie is jam packed with these things and more. And seeing between the lines is where this movie is at.From a general Western perspective, this movie does not work. I think that's what killed it for a lot of people,. That and not knowing the philosophy behind the movie. Most of the West isn't aware of the concept of we are all one. And so, I think that this requires some open mindedness in not seeing the movie through a hard line Western perspective. It may also require getting acquainted with other world views.I hope this gave some clarity for some.",,Anonymous,Mystery
6 movies in 1,"This film presents us with 6 stories in different ages (19th century, the 30s, the 70s, the present, 2100s and 2300s), linked together apparently by some sort of spiritual humanistic plot.Cloud Atlas is like a mixture of Magnolia, The Hours and even Baccano! I wouldn't be surprise if they found ""inspiration"" in those or other sources, since certain directors/writers siblings like to take from other works. Anyway, it's one of those strange cases in which my expectations matched almost perfectly what I witnessed. No more, no less. I don't picture this movie as pretentious, although I see how pretentious people may love it. In any case, it's not for everybody.Each of the 6 stories is somehow valuable (plot wise) on its own, and I found them interesting enough. Nothing mind-blowing, nothing boring. The toll of so many movies interlaced in one is the running time, close to 3 hours. It's bearable though. And you will find a bit of historical film, a lot of drama and mystery, some fantasy and nice scifi. Mind you, the fantastic and futuristic elements are there for the purpose of the plot only, not to show off. That doesn't rest importance to the nicely done special effects.It's also curious to note how the same actors play different roles in all different ages.The bottom line is that this film is yet another story that tries to inject spiritualism (non-religious) into our brains, in the again common current of seen humans through the eyes of humanism, and aiming for something bigger that the simple fact of us being just a sac of flesh.OK to see if you like drama and human related spirituality. This movie won't probably say much to a person with a true purpose in his/her life (no wow effect/change of life after watching it). I suspect that, if you are trying to find something to fill a void, you'll like it more.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Melody or Malady. The True True,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ambitious and mesmerizing. Those are the two words that best describe my reaction to this stunning film based on the David Mitchell novel. Hopefully, you have not come here for answers to the many mysteries offered up by this most unique film experience. If you are the type that loves to think, analyze and discuss complex movies, you will be challenged and satisfied. If you prefer your stories clean, straightforward and gift-wrapped, you will be like some of those in my audience who walked out of the theatre at various stages -not to return.While there are no easy explanations for what we see on screen, this is undoubtedly one of the more complex and multi-faceted and challenging movies to watch. There are six stories that span approximately 500 years (beginning in 1849 and going through 2346 or so). We see many actors playing multiple characters of various ages, crossing racial and gender lines depending on the specific story. We track the progression/regression of their souls through time. This will prove more challenging to you than it sounds on paper, as the make-up work is some of the most extreme ever seen on screen.The six stories are co-written and directed by Tom Twyker (Run Lola Run) and The Wachowski's (Lana and Andy, The Matrix trilogy). These six segments are split evenly between the two director groups, yet then blend seamlessly thanks to the truly expert editing of Alexander Berner. You will recognize the influence and similarities of such films as Master and Commander, Cocoon, Silkwood and Blade Runner, as well as many others.Filling the clothing, donning the make-up and spouting the dialogue in manners that you often won't recognize are such actors as Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Donna Bae, Ben Whishaw, Keith David, James D'Arcy, Xun Zhou, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant. Especially entertaining are Hugo Weaving as a sadistic female nurse and Hugh Grant as a violent tribesman. The best laughs in the film are courtesy of the great Mr. Broadbent whose facial expressions are near clown-like in elasticity.As for the themes and points of the film, that is a topic for debate. A couple of lines of dialogue offer some clues. Hanks' nasty ship doctor spouts ""The weak are meat the strong do eat"", and we notice the recurring theme of the strong dominating the weak across all story lines. There is another line: ""One can transcend any convention so long as one can conceive of doing so"", that provides the glimmer of hope in each story. Love and oppression are always present, but it's clear to me that the human spirit remains strong and is capable of overcoming oppression in the past, present and future. You may disagree but our debates will be colorful ... and may change after a second viewing!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Ponderous, missed opportunity by the Wachowski's","Nearly Thirty years ago, Sergio Leone virtually wrote the book on flashback/forward movies with ""Once Upon a Time in America"". Only some unfortunate casting (Elizabeth Perkins) and under-exposition in the second half prevented it from becoming a bonafide masterpiece. Over ten years ago, David Lynch demonstrated its full potential in the near perfect ""Mulholland Drive"". Only an overly extended ""magician's act"" and graphic ""love scenes"" in the final act diminished its impact. Nearly fifteen years ago, Paul Thomas Anderson demonstrated how such a monumental task could be accomplished with a huge ensemble cast with ""Magnolia"". Only a silly (though historically plausible) deus ex machina marred this fine effort. On the other hand, Cameron Crowe and Steven Soderbergh cautioned us by example of the horrid results of the consequences of how difficult and unsatisfying a flashback/forward movie can be in the wrong hands. Yet, none of these films are nearly as ambitious as ""Cloud Atlas"" and the only film that comes close is Josef Rusnak's largely ignored and nearly forgotten ""The Thirteenth Floor"".""Cloud Atlas"" spans at least five hundred years between distant past and possible near future, with multiple story lines,styles alternating between farce, melodrama and turgid drama. Worse, ""Cloud Atlas"" buries competent, if sometimes uninspiring stars under tons of makeup. Worse, the narrative is so choppy, one hardly has time to know WHERE and WHEN he is, before jumping off to the next time and locale. This makes empathy for the characters nearly impossible. Fortunately, Halle Berry, Ben Whishaw, Jim Sturges,Hugo Weaving and Doona Bae manage to pull it off. Unfortunately, Tom Hanks did not, and herein lies the crux of the problem. Hanks can be a fine actor, but his range is limited; Robert Downey Jr., Russell Crowe or Guy Pearce probably could, though even they would have struggled with that horrible ""pigeon"" dialect in the ""after the fall"" segment. Hanks alternates between either hammy or unintelligible, effective only when relying on his expressions to tell the story. On the other hand,Halle Berry makes it look easy; of course, Berry is so darned gorgeous that even watching her on screen is a feast for the senses. Bae, on the other hand, is an acquired taste, with her ""porcelain doll"" features, though her picture-perfect body is quite a treat. Bae hits all the right notes as Somni-351; unfortunately, this means automatonic mannerisms which undercut hers,and, by extension, the film's message. Fortunately, her chemistry in scenes with both Jim Sturges and Ben Whishaw is tantalizing and this young lady has quite a future in Western cinema if she chooses it.As for the narrative, I could have completely done without the silly ""Timothy Cavendish"" segment. A great deal of time is spent on his misadventures, only to be wasted by its overly abrupt insertion into the ""Somni-351"" segment. Likewise, I was so distracted by Hank's, Weaving's and Berry's ""pigeon,"" in the ""after the fall"" segment, I barely understood, let alone cared, about the key points being made.Since reincarnation and spiritual development are so foreign to Western audiences, I am somewhat surprised ""Cloud Atlas"" was even made. I can only imagine what brilliant Chinese director Yimou Zhang (""Hero,"" ""House of Flying Daggers,"" ""Curse of the Golden Flower,"")could have done with it.Unfortunately,as it stands, ""Cloud Atlas"" is little more than a curiosity and a missed opportunity.I give ""Cloud Atlas"" a ""6"".",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Cloud Atlas is a timeless rare, unique, beautiful, epic masterpiece!!","Cloud Atlas is structured like a Russian nesting doll, with six interconnected narratives - spanning from the 1800's through the 1930's, the 1970's, the present 2012, the future 2144 of Seoul, and after the fall of the civilization in 2321, that invert and converge like a palindrome. Each story is so unique with its own rising action/climax/conclusion, yet they all connect through different themes.These six stories have amazing connections that appear to be individually based, but grow in momentum to form one giant philosophical idea. Cloud Atlas explores the idea of an eternal soul that reincarnates through time and space in different parts of the world - no matter of race and gender - but based on the past actions, reborn and rejoins with lost loves, and remedy wrongs from the past. Everything is connected in Cloud Atlas, every line and detail - in one way or another. It's an exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future.People worry that the movie is confusing. It's not if you just get the concept: the same actor playing one soul in multiple parts, in different time periods. Because the concept is that what you do in a past life, is connected to consequences that might happen in your future life. (Many people who have seen the film didn't know the actors played multiple parts. That's definitely a proof of outstanding, brilliant makeup!) When you know all characters the same actor is playing, it will be easier to understand why the soul has been reincarnated into this person. It's not race-mixing, transsexual for fun. There's an important reason. The more times you see Cloud Atlas the more details and hidden messages you'll notice/discover and realize how all the stories and everything are connected to each other.But I would also say it's a brainy movie for already open-minded human beings with a heart and some kind of depth in their bodies. It's definitely nothing for dumb, ignorant, narrow-minded people who can't think for themselves. It's a rare, unique, epic, beautiful, piece of art - in which you must be able to pay attention to details. The others better be sure to get the next Fast and Furious or Transformers movie, or just stick to their Twilight collection.Cloud Atlas is a movie that lets you reflect about your own actions, life, existence. It is an epic story of humankind in which the actions and consequences of our lives impact one another - throughout the past, present and future.Regarding the Oscars 2013: I am so angry, disappointed and sad. Where the h*ll are all the Oscar nominations for Cloud Atlas?! It should at least have been nominated for Best film, Best directors, Best adapted screenplay, Best actors, Best actress, Best editing, Best cinematography, Best sound, Best visual effects and definitely Best original score and Best makeup! This is bullshit. That dumb, narrow minded, ignorant, shall...ow, senile academy jury is a joke.The academy really had the chance to prove that they appreciate and reward good film making. Bringing something giant like Cloud Atlas to the big screen was bold, ambitious and not easy, but they succeeded on all levels. Cloud Atlas is a groundbreaking, rare, unique, beautiful, epic piece of art, and a film like this hasn't been made before and won't for many years to come. Cloud Atlas deserves so much more recognition and love.Snubbing Cloud Atlas - one of the most bold, challenging and imaginative films of the 21st century is scandalous and awfully embarrassing. Shame on you academy! This is a joke. The end.Cloud Atlas has a blockbuster budget but is an independent film. That's why the marketing has been very lame and almost non-existent. Many people in America and around the world haven't even heard of this film! In my opinion the film opened in theaters to early after the trailer was released. A film like this needs time. If Cloud Atlas had premiered now - 6 months after the trailer was released in July last year. More people would have heard about this film, seen the trailer and go see it! Anyhow, even though it has gotten some negatives reviews by narrow minded critics, it has also gotten many incredible reviews. There are so many people who love Cloud Atlas, and it's a film that has touched so many people around the world in a way like no other film has done before - even changed people's lives. That's one of the best rewards a movie can get.One more thing: Even though Cloud Atlas didn't get the Awards or Nominations it deserves, it will be that one film that I will forever hold dear to my heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Falls victim to its own ambition, but the effort is more than commendable.","Cloud Atlas reeks of the type of film destined to receive polarising reviews upon its release, earn a cult following in the next few years and ultimately, in tentwentyfifty years time, be revered as an indisputable classic of the sci-fi genre. But that is then, and this is now. And right now, it feels too much like a mish-mash of abundant creativity let down by flawed execution, further hurt by a punishing runtime that threatens to isolate its audience.The film, co-directed by Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, Perfume) and the Wachowskis (The Matrix trilogy) weaves together six different tales showing how people's actions, both good and evil, reverberate through time and place.The stories follow a weary shipmate who is unwittingly poisoned by the vessel's malevolent doctor; a naïve youngster who becomes a protégé to the world's greatest composer; a feisty journalist keen to blow the lid off a corrupt plant; a lovable kook trying to break out of a nursing home; a cloned waitress who rejects slavery in favour of a normal life; and an uneasy pilgrimage shared between a Neanderthal and a futuristic visitor.The plot shifts constantly between stories, and while the semantics of each story are simplified to ensure the attentive viewer doesn't get lost, much emotion disappears as well. Much in the same way that a coach must give equal playing time to every member of his Under 8s soccer team, so to does the overall performance of the film falter in an attempt to give each outcome equal polish.Pleasingly, each story feels like it would make for compelling viewing in its own vacuum. From the romantic tragedy of ""Letters from Zedelghem"" to the prison break comedy of ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" and the neo-noir subtext of ""An Orison of Sonmi-451"", there is much enjoyment to be had from the galore of genre mashing here, but one fable's relevance to its brothers does often feel contrived.The directorial trio is further pushed between a rock and a hard place when one realises this depth in storytelling goes hand-in-hand with a near 3-hour runtime, which forces demanding viewers to simply go through the motions for much of the last act, heavily stymieing what tries to be an emotional power-punch of an ending, but one that feels more like a desperate flail.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.

Such movies need to be tight, engaging, compelling, and not a weary yawnfest.Ultimately, making this rambling assembly of disjointed half-baked ideas at this huge length was a total indulgence by its directors.

Staggering achievement!,"First of all, let it be made clear that any attempt to effectively summarise 'Cloud Atlas' is futile. It is a film that is grand in vision & scope. It is a film that tells 6 stories spanning the years 1846 to 2346, with the same actors taking on different roles across the 6 segments. The actors play different ages, different nationalities & in some cases, different sexes! If there are any overt connections between the roles being enacted by a particular actor, they are definitely not apparent on first viewing. Perhaps repeat viewings may help in deciphering if there are, in fact, any connections at all! The first 20 odd minutes of the movie are often confusing as the various stories gradually unfold. Once past that initial hurdle, however, the film hits its stride magnificently. The 2 sets of directors - the Wachowskis & Tom Tykwer - deserve accolades for successfully conceptualising & executing what must have certainly been a logistical nightmare to shoot & edit. Despite its inordinate length, 'Cloud Atlas' is almost always absorbing. Special mention must be made of the immaculate art direction & breathtaking cinematography, which make every frame of the film come alive in impossibly beautiful ways.

Cloud Atlas -- A Review by Venkat Subramaniam,"With ""babbits bawlin and the wind bitin t' bone"" , the gruesomely emaciated Zachry , with a furrowed lineament yarns the exordium of what would seem to be an interminably woven sextet of figments. The film though droning on eternally its disjointed segments is a commendable endeavour of blending six stories into one.The prolixity is indebted to the crowding of multitudinous tales which are spurred on by the audacity of ambition. There might even be an emotional tinge in the story of Sonmi-451, a fabricant server at a fast- food restaurant.In a sense , Cloud Atlas might be perceived as a grandiose mess , yet the novelty of the vacillatory mode of shifting amidst six different worlds makes it a successful blend of multiple tales.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Six Amazing Stories Thrown into One Film,"I'd heard about Cloud Atlas a few months ago and I love thought provoking films so I watched the trailer and I was hooked already. I watched the film today and it completely exceeded my expectations! Everything about it was amazing; the acting, the stories, the visuals, the art direction, everything was perfect to a tee.This film will tick every emotional box, it will make you laugh, cry, fear, hate, love and will have you on the edge of your seat. The complex, slow burning story is pulled off very intricately with pure excellence. Also to add the excellent musical score which adds more to this atmospheric epic. This film can pretty much interest all genres as the time periods vary from colonial times to post apocalyptic futuristic metropolis.I definitely recommend anyone who loves something unique and with a star-studded cast.

Complicated but good theme,"The theme of this movie is very good however the movie is a little complicated to follow and it takes a while to bring it all together. The concept of meeting up with different characters over and over in our lifetimes is one that an interesting aspect as well as the idea of our karma also affecting us over lifetimes.Hugh Grant has difficulty keeping his accent in one of his characters which is annoying. And the biggest annoyance is the language spoken by Tom Hanks and Halle Barry in the future characters - it's hard to follow what they are saying and it sounds ridiculous and almost ruins the film. But aside from that, it's worth seeing and I will watch it again to see what I may have missed the first time round.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
misery echoes through time,"One of the most impressive movies ever looks at the ripple effects of different actions throughout history and into the future. The main cast members play multiple roles of people trying to right the wrongs and bring about positive change. I liked how they edited the movie to have the numerous plot lines coincide with each other, ensuring a better understanding of the characters' motivations. Like ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Cloud Atlas"" poses the question of humanity's origins and where we're headed. While the visuals are overwhelming in some scenes, the movie is all about the characters: Jim Sturgess's lawyer, Ben Whishaw's composer, Halle Berry's journalist, Jim Broadbent's publisher, Doona Bae's slave, Tom Hanks's tribesman, and the other characters played by each of these people plus Susan Sarandon's and Hugh Grant's characters add up to a most amazing movie. I really recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Connections Are Us,"We follow 6-stories that seem to reflect reincarnated people with the same birthmark and this is supposed to be proof of that. The main theme is: ""our lives are not our own, we belong to each other, past and present"" as stated by Doona Bae's character Sonmi 451. This is to say we are all connected.We see slices of life within these stories and it takes a while to make some sense of things we can relate to. We go on an ocean voyage where a doctor is trying to get the key to a strong box full of gold; a gay composer writes letters to his friend and contemplates suicide; a murder at a nuclear power plant; a publisher as a prisoner in a nursing home put there by his brother; a Korean rebel – Sonmi 451 - in the future, who may be the key to saving the world; and we see Zachry (Tom Hanks) a Polynesian tribesman who has contact with Meronym (Halle Berry) who is from another planet.Many of the stars in here play a character in all six stories. You can make a game of it trying to decide which stars you recognize with all the makeup, prosthetics, wigs and costumes. Here are some of the other names: Jim Broadbent, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, James D'Arcy, Hugh Grant, David Keith.The acting and visuals and CGI are most impressive. What was annoying was the pidgin English dialogue when in the tribesman Zachry stories. Oh, they sounded good, almost poetic, but we came away with: Whadee say? Whashe say? See? When Zachry needed to know the truth about something, he would say: Tell me the true true. Okay we got that, but that was the easiest of all the pidgin English we heard.The only story I found most interesting was with Doona Bae's rebel character Sonmi 451 who was protected by Hae-Joo Chang (Jim Sturgess) who behaved like James Bond in his efforts. He knew Sonmi 451 was the only one who could save the world, a world gone mad with oppression. Later when she was captured and her Interrogator says to her that she must have known she could not win and why persist? Sonmi 451 agrees but says the truth must not be hidden. The Interrogator then says suppose no one knows and she replies: someone will come along and know. She knows she will be killed and she is not afraid because ""death is just another door opening.""As far as I was concerned the other 5-stories were okay, but not as important as Sonmi 451's story. Why the title Cloud Atlas? The theme here is that we are all connected as are clouds we see and sometimes we see images, and stories within these clouds.This movie is about 3-hours long and we don't get bored, but we wished some stories were shorter than they were. In those stories the birthmark was the only thing connecting all to reincarnation, but there was no apparent connection to the story of Sonmi 451. Unless one could take a giant leap and say that oppression was in their future. Maybe I missed the birthmark on Sonmi 451. Hmmm.The movie starts out with Zachry and we think this is the beginning like he is in the BC time-frame era, but he is not. Zachry is in a post- apocalyptic world and oppression was not in his future, as he went to that other planet with Meronym. See? A happy ending for him. What about the rest of us? Woe is us. Hey, we are left behind. Any help out there? Anyone.? (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, 3-instances, all hetero. Nudity: Yes, 2-instances, and a male backside. Gays in bed: Yes.

An excellent drawn out plot that will make you feel all feelings possible.,"I write to you as a new critic who fell in love with 'Cloud Atlas.' The movie, so elegantly put together, only fools would think this is truly something to bash upon.The scenes, actors, and costumes put together beautifully. The plot, so unforgivably beautiful that I myself was stricken with anger, hate, happiness and sadness moments from each feeling.The Wachowski brothers, directors of the Matrix have done it again and directed one of the greatest movies of 2012.Two notable actors that I have picked out from the movie would be Tom Hanks and Zhou Xun who passionately played their roles as if they were truly those people from that time.Though my 10/10 rating, the movie did have some comedic laughs and was confusing at times. But all was pieced together with and excellent ending.I highly recommend for everyone to see this movie.I'll tell anyone who doesn't like this movie: ""It's not for the stupid.﻿ And by stupid, I mean its not for the people who take it literally.""

Somehow despite all the excellent VFX, make-up, acting and poetry-like dialogue it fails to connect emotionally. It is however commendable that they at least try to engage the audience with a more complex story than say robots and screaming teenagers, but the utter failure of this movie at the box office doesn't bode well for the more intellectual type of scifi entertainment -even if it doesn't fire on all cylinders like this one.

Inspired and Inspiring,"I honestly don't know if ""Cloud Atlas"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, but it's easily one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.There's not much more for me to write here, because it either speaks to you or it doesn't. Most critics and several viewers have lambasted it (Ebert excluded - it was one of the last movies he gave 4 stars before his passing, and his review is spot on, IMHO). It tanked at the box office, it was nominated for no Oscars (not even Visual Effects or Music!) and it generally made barely a blip on the cinema landscape. It is a challenging movie - intellectually, structurally, and emotionally. You might be up to the challenge, and you might not. Maybe a dull action machine like one of the ""Man"" movies is more up your alley. Or a turgid melodrama period piece, or a cheesy Rom-Com that holds your hand and tells you what to feel. Maybe a film that almost demands repeat viewings to fully appreciate doesn't appeal to you. And that's fine, I suppose.But if you like to think, and to feel, and are generally capable of appreciating a work of art, watch ""Cloud Atlas"".

Watch it if you believe (or tend to believe) in reincarnation,"I usually like epic 3-4 hours movies. Cloud Atlas is like watching several mini-movies with independent plots. Each actor is playing a different character in each plot, and time to time one of them says ""oh, I remember this"" for something he supposedly remembered from one of his past lives and these moments are the only connection between the plots.Yes, the old guy repeating ""I know, I know"" is funny. Sure, we all love Tom Hanks, And noticing in the credits who played each character may be surprising. But those wouldn't keep you entertained for 172 minutes.I noticed there are multiple directors, this may be why the movie loses its focus throughout the stories.I think the whole point of this movie seems ""to convince you that reincarnation is real"". If it is so, well, it didn't work for me, unfortunately I still don't believe in reincarnation.So I think Cloud Atlas may be interesting for people who believe in reincarnation, for the rest of us non-believer souls, it is nothing more than a bunch of fancy pictures. I believe this is a highly overrated movie, and suffers similar issues with another overrated movie ""Crash"", which also had unnecessary effort to connect the stories with extraordinary coincidences.

Redefines entirely what a film can be.,"The first time I saw the trailer for the film, I was interested. I could tell it was going to be a risky film, and now having seen it, I believe it to be the most ambitious film ever made. This film would have been very easy to mess up, with how complex everything is within the film, however, it is pull off in a masterful fashion. The Wachowski's and Tom Tykwer craft of the film was brilliant and have created a one of a kind masterpiece.The film has so much too offer and has so much going on, that it is very hard to explain what the film is about. There isn't one central protagonist, however don't shy away from the film under that basis. All of the stories are very engaging and reflect on one another through a unique story-telling structure. Other a few other films have embraced this story structure,(Magnolia, the Fountain, and Pulp Fiction) this one, however, spanning between 6 different time frames. Of which makes it massively epic and has the biggest scope I've ever seen in a film.The film will not be for everybody, unfortunately, as it very complex and you have to be paying attention throughout the whole film. The film seems to start a little slow, and as a possible result I did see the couple in front of me walk out. Yet, if you are up for the challenge, and willing to try something different, this film will blow you away. Not only does the film have stunning visuals, but also rich stories that are all connected in some way.Cloud Atlas will always be remember and will go down as a classic that will stand the test of time.

Complex and Interesting,"Cloud Atlas runs almost three hours, and it could have used some editing. Although it has some beautiful moments, the constant abrupt jump from story to story in different time periods, is somewhat confusing. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are both very good in multiple roles. Hugh Grant and Hugo Weaving round out an excellent cast throughout. The main problem is the mix between serious drama and science fiction action elements which are loud as hell compared with the subtle scenes with interesting dialogue. I understand that we are all connected as human beings in a struggle to survive, and that all of our actions have consequences, some large and others small. The Wachowski's have done it much better before, especially with V for Vendetta, one of my favorite films of all time; they have deep and profound thoughts.

I won't go into the story because I find it too deep to simply describe, you just have to see it for yourself.

"Crowded But Inspired, This Will Surely Befuddle First-Time Viewers","Like six movies muscled into one, Cloud Atlas is a raw, dense, ambitious mash of tangled wires and blinking lights. Needless to say, the film must be seen more than once to fully comprehend, and even then it's a nut that demands a viewer's complete concentration to crack. It's a mosaic, stitching vastly different subjects, atmospheres, landscapes and circumstances into the same cloth with mixed results. Things are so breakneck that, even at three unusually long hours, I felt like I was missing large swaths of story, merely scratching the surface of what was actually going on. The editing is partly to blame for that, with its dizzying leaps across generations (which, in some instances, occur several times in a single scene), and the heavy makeup effects - employed to cast the same actors in several roles, genders, ages and nationalities - are often a major distraction. For a film as loaded as this one, even a momentary pause to identify a vaguely-familiar face can tangle the feet, leaving us helplessly adrift in a sea of themes and imagery. It alternates between stunning and baffling in the blink of an eye, an experience that's both confounding and mesmerizing to behold. Kudos to the filmmakers for daring to try something so thoroughly different from the norm. It's magical on the rare occasions it all comes together and works as a single, monumental behemoth, but is also plagued by a swarm of ticks and shortcomings. I wonder if the time and effort necessary to actually access its thematic riches might be a steeper cost than many viewers are willing to pay. A complicated picture, both to ingest and to rate. Today's score may be subject to change.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant,"""No matter what you do it will never amount to anything more than a single drop in a limitless ocean.""
""What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?""I consider David Mitchell's book that this film is based on a masterpiece, and the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer did him proud. It consists of six stories, spaced in time from the 19th century to the future, with links between them revealed in subtle ways. There are hints of reincarnation here, which depending on your views may come across as a little new-agey, but to me the more profound bits were the connectedness of all of our lives, and the need for good to find the courage to stand up and combat evil, which will always exist. While the scenarios change, how the powerful are cruel to the powerless, and how they use differences like race to fuel hatred remain the same, across all ages.There is so much to love about the stories themselves as well, reminding me of other great authors but spun in ways unique to this work. ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing"" channels Melville, ""Letters From Zedelghem"" is witty, sad, and reminiscent of Wilde, and ""An Orison of Sonmi-451"" a bit like Huxley. It's nothing if not ambitious, going for the full spectrum of the human experience. ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" is hilarious, ""The First Luisa Rey Mystery"" (the title an homage to Thornton Wilder) works as drama, and ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Evrythin' After"" as post-apocalyptic horror. I loved all of it. Heck, part of the fun was just watching the actors in this star-studded cast get used across all of the stories, even if some of the race makeup was a little jarring.Mitchell chose to break the first five stories into two parts, and then revisit them in reverse order after the sixth, which was effective in threading them together and leading to a crescendo at the end. The filmmakers chose to interweave the stories on a much finer basis, which can be a little disorienting especially over 172 minutes, but I found it no less effective. The sacrifices, heartbreaks, and triumphs were wonderful and touching, and I thought the closing messages were as profound as they were uplifting.

Very Important Movie About Evolving Ideas,"I just watched Cloud Atlas again and now consider it my favorite movie from last year. It's truly a great adaptation of a great novel, turning what is a quite dense and demanding literary work into a supremely entertaining and sprawling movie. The intelligence of the novel is undiminished and its ideas are now so much more accessible.What is the movie about to me? It is a rhapsody on how the most important job anyone can have is that of a ""writer."" Great writers, pretty good writers, terrible writers, insightful writers, insanely wrongheaded writers, really anyone who writes is a creator of the new genetic material (memes) that have been directing the evolution of the human species for thousands of years. We evolve very slowly, if at all, biologically. But we evolve at lightning speed, especially now with the Internet, by way of ideas. I placed writer in quotes because the novel/movie considers it quite broadly to encompass oral traditions, musical composers, and even filmmakers along with traditional writers as creators of ideas.Everything good and everything bad that has come of humanity on Earth so far has been the result of ""writers"" adding ideas to the great conversation and having those ideas propagate from person to person and generation to generation, sometimes taking on meaning far removed from the author's original intentions. If we wish the future of this great conversation to take more good turns than bad, it is up to all of us to become ""good"" ""writers"" in our own ways.The movie tag-line is: Past. Present. Future. Everything is connected.But, what is it that connects everything? Richard Dawkins wrote of ""bio- morph space"" (how all the species connect together and change through time) in his book The Blind Watchmaker. Dawkins had previously written about human evolution now occurring primarily through memes (ideas that survive and reproduce) rather than genes. What Cloud Atlas maps and shows as relating all humans throughout history and into the future is idea-morph space, or how all ideas connect together and change through time.It especially makes two points about the evolution of ideas: 1. That religions evolve from ideas that become texts that become sacred texts, sometimes severed from the very intent and purpose of the earlier texts and ideas (very similar to the movie Zardoz where the sacred religious text of a future society turns out to be a tattered copy of (The Wi)zard (of) Oz.) 2. That the changes in matters of human rights are a perfect example of the evolution of ideas through time with Black History in America and Women's Rights taking center stage. Curiously, LGBT rights are a key element of an early story, but are left unresolved, curious because Lana (formerly Larry) Wachowski is one of the key writer/directors of the movie. (Identity is toyed with and questioned continuously throughout the movie though by way of using makeup to have actors play a variety of characters of different ages, races, and even genders.)You know how it's often said there are no new stories and no new ideas? I think that is largely true. The same ideas recur throughout human history, sometimes coinciding with the zeitgeist and becoming popular, sometimes not. The truly new ideas are like random gene mutations, total accidents maybe, or something out of dreams that just happened to occur at the right place and point in time to survive and spread from person to person and down through the generations instead of being laughed at and forgotten--or crushed because it is a totally inconvenient idea for its time and place.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The opportunity to change in another life.,"The premise of the book is wonderful and its ideology is perfect for the film. A screen version of the same level was needed. The Wachowski brothers once had the idea to film the book, but it was embodied for a long time, a good friend of Lana (once Larry) Wachowski Tom Tykwer was invited to work on the script, also well-known to connoisseurs of cinema, his ""Run, Lola, Run"" and ""Perfumer left a mark on the cinema of this century. Let the film have three directors, but each had an equal degree of influence on the production process and each shot their own plot pieces. Time periods of the future were given to the Wachowskis (with the exception of the Adam Ewing story, it refers to incarnations from the past) and the present and the events of 1931 were filmed by Tykwer.The first thing I would like to note is the stylistic unity based on different shooting techniques, this difference in approaches eventually gave a whole picture. Visually, the film looks great, every freeze frame just asks for a desktop or frame, every detail of the environment is in place, the music well emphasizes the atmosphere of the film, different in each story segment, but in the end bringing them together, the melody from the end credits pleasantly impressed , especially the sublimation of notes that the composer Robert Frobisher produced.It still seems to me that the film is not only about the reincarnation of one life in different historical periods, it is a story about the fact that the soul can and must evolve. If once you were bad, then in your next life you must become good, if you can say about the characters of Weaving and Grant that they experience several versions of themselves, while remaining villains, then Tom Hanks in one of his incarnations appears in an antagonizing role, he does a great job with all their characters, everyone is sympathetic. All the actors are great, because everyone embodied different characters, accents on the acting of Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Ben Whishaw and Hugo Weaving, who changed sex in one of his lives. The make-up artists made good Asians out of Jim Sturgess and Weaving, and they tried, but Ewing was still better than the others, but it's more a matter of taste and preferences.Verdicting: ""Cloud Atlas"" is that rare film that you can like and dislike, but the ambition, fascination and beauty of this film cannot be taken away. Made with skill and love. The film will give food for thought and make you think about inner freedom. Over time, it will be sorted into quotes and they will look for ""non-existent advantages and dubious shortcomings"" and five years is not enough for this.

But for those of us who have seen Cloud Atlas, it is everything!Cloud Atlas, based on the book(which I have not read, but will soon)by David Mitchell, is a film about humanity and all that unites us to one another. Through six stories, that are stand alone stories, but all feature links to each other, themes of love, greed, courage, destiny, free will,faith, and reincarnation(!!!) are explored to amazing lengths, that, although the film is three hours long, never bores! In fact, this reviewer was reinvigorated when the credits rolled!This film has it all:great acting(particularly from Tom Hanks, Jim Sturgess, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, and newcomer Doona Bae), great drama, great action, a terrific score, great costumes, great visuals, and a larger -than-life feel that rivals anything I have ever seen on screen before!The segments are very strong, in particular the ones about the composer(called Letters from Zedelghem), the one about the man stuck in a retirement home(called The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish) and An Orison of Somni-451, which is the about the clone. The remaining three are The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing(which is the one about the man and the slave), Half-Lives: The First Mystery of Luisa Ray(the mystery about the nuclear reactor), and Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rything After(the last one about the hunter and alien). They are all strong stories, and I was amazed by how they all came together and how they all worked on screen.A lot of this has to do with the editing. The film cuts back between the stories, sometimes before you expect it to. It is takes a little bit to get used to(for me, it only took about five minutes), but you get quickly caught up and become entranced by what is on screen.It is funny, it is emotional, it is action-packed,it is spiritual:it is all of these. If someone asked me what this film was about, I would just tell them this:it is about life, and what it means to truly live.Whether this ends up becoming huge to word of mouth, or whether it remain a modern day cult classic, I don't know. But what I do know, for me at least, is that Cloud Atlas is one of my favorite films, and I can't wait to see it again and again!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shallow insight into karmic intertwines,"Not so much impressed. Money invested into production are apparent on visuals and casting, on the other side if someone uses karmic inspiration to intertwine individuals and their life times, he/she should know a person is not locked all the time in one role whether oppressor or the victim. It changes as well, or else it is very narrow view of experience gathering on this planet Earth. Also overcoming fear or being reconciled with own death is one of many possible outcomes individual can get - sort of shallow offer from the writers of this movie.On the other side it is also true, current Western civilization is not consisting much of philosophers or thinkers, mainstream is swimming its way through the life and so just only a couple of incentives play major role in decision making - e.g. fear, sex or manipulation,.. It would be more inspiring though to include intertwines with Eastern cultures or indigenous people which are also part of this planet. Insight into pollution of environment and disconnection with the Nature can serve additional feedback on moral stands and picking choices, just to name a few. Well, writers tried to impress by sort of complexity, but from my point of view the opposite happened and movie is pretty much straightforward and predictable.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
this is why I love films,"A wonderful piece, even better than ""the Matrix"" series in terms of humanity and complexity. It's not easy to tell such a long story (actually a few stories) in three hours, at least I found it hard to get everything straight during my first watch. I was deeply impressed by the extraordinary acting ensemble and touched by the story though when I stepped out of the cinema. It's a much better experience when I recently watched it again: some lines truly resonated with a reverberating roar in my heart, like the following one I understand now the boundaries between noise and sound are conventions. All boundaries are conventions, waiting for the truth in it. One may transcend any convention, if only one can first conceive doing so. Moments like this, I can feel your heart beating as clearly as my own, and I know that separation is an illusion. My life extends far beyond the limitations of me.This film is worth watching over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Epic visually appealing scenes, but totally messy boring movie","My title says it all.....I tried following the multiple generational, multi century story line that involved about a dozen people, but I ended up getting bored and stopped the movie about halfway through. This movie takes TOO long to come together. Maybe if I would of stayed till the end, I would of got it, but it was too boring for me. Romance that wasn't appearing, action that wasn't happening, story lines that weren't giving any indication where they were going and I was half way through the movie already....I wouldn't recommend this movie, to boring and complicated and completely a mess. That's my two cents anyway.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A likable film not without its flaws.,"Cloud Atlas's disjointed story, though jarring at first, is a still a fairly watchable film. The stories interweave and twist and turn through the ages; as we meet each of the main characters and learn of their connections. I would have liked to have spent more time exploring each of the different character's stories, but alas it was more like brief glimpses at half imagined worlds that flicker off when the writer runs out of ideas, only to be briefly returned to once the ideas strike hot again. The idea is grand in scale: how different lives intertwine and how different people through different ages become the same person they were all along. The ultimate ending sees a far flung future and ties up the story to a satisfying conclusion. This does not compensate, however, for the fact that the movie falls short in the sense that it doesn't really deliver a whole story. It delivers pieces of stories that are loosely interwoven and then forgotten to make way for the next piece. The performances are fine, and the set-pieces often grand; there's definitely a lot to be admired, it's just such a shame that more could not have been done with the story. The source material doesn't really lend itself well to adaptation, however; and so, this slight annoyance can be overlooked. It is, after all, quite an enjoyable film and one that should be returned to and savoured, if only to figure out who is who throughout the film and where their individual stories connect. Overall, I give the film a 7/10. Definitely one to watch once, if not twice.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Cloud Atlas movie review- Ambitious, brilliant, epic!","No movie in 2012 will split audience opinion as diametrically as Cloud Atlas. Some will find it ambitious, exhilarating, brilliant cinema, other will find it a ponderous mismatch of form and substance. Either case, it is a movie that is guaranteed to remain unforgettable, and if you, like me, belong to the former club, it will warrant multiple viewings.Great source material is an essential ingredient to great movies- Cloud Atlas is based upon @David Mitchell's heady 2005 novel that chronicles six stories in different time-lines spanning over 600 years blending genres and tones to show the human soul moving from century to century, and explore how our actions in one life affect the next. While the stories in the book are linear, with one story ending leading to the next, the movie adaption takes liberties in narrative continuity, weaving the different story lines together adroitly to illustrate the interconnectivity of life in a way that may be confusing to start with, but rises to dizzying heights of creativity pretty quickly.Chronologically, the tales start from mid 19th century where a would be slave trader has a life changing experience, to a distant post apocalyptic future where a cowardly tribesman guides a researcher, and segments in between times that include a gay musician trying to make a name for himself, a crooked publisher who gets served, a journalist investigates a nuclear power plant, a clone who seeks self actualization and in effect sparking a revolution in a dystopian Seoul in 2144 (my personal favorite). Not all the stories are outstanding, but all ARE involving in their own way. And what makes the movie more demanding than the book is that the same set of actors plays different characters in different stories as a result of which we see the faces we know so well going through the universal themes of greed, oppression, hatred, and redemption, and personifying that regardless of the time, the core human values of love, courage and freedom remain the same.Much of the movie's genius is due to the actors, and with an A-list ensemble star cast comprising of Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Susan Sarandon among others, you really cannot go wrong. Sometimes almost unrecognizable due to their excellent make-up, these titans do an excellent job in making the audience feel the range of emotions they go through, and believing in their predicament and the choices they face. My personal favorite here again was Hanks as the evil Dr. Henry Goose and cockney author Dermot Hoggins.The Wachowski brothers, oops, can't say that any more as one of them has had a sex change, - Lana and Andy Wachowski are no strangers to futuristic cinema, but this movie is not just that genre- this is an epic adventure drama played across a canvas spanning many centuries and the sheer orchestration of this scale and characters is a wonder. The Wachowskis paired on this one with Tom Tykwer who gave us the classic Run Lola Run, and this time traveling, globe hopping extravaganza is not only a feast for the eyes, but also has moments of tenderness, humor, and suspense. Bottom-line- Cloud Atlas is surely easier to watch than to explain, so do not feel bad if you walk out of the nearly 3 hour long Cloud Atlas with more questions than answers- this is the kind of cinema that makes you think and ask questions now, and also 10 years down the line. Go on, enjoy some extraordinary quality cinema- 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Cloud atlas, simply a must see...","The novel by David Mitchell was in itself, amazing. Handling all the time lines portrayed in that story would be a near-impossible task just because of the sheer complexity. But that is where we must praise the trio of Tom Tykwer and the Wachowskis for making one of the richest epic movies seen recently, spanning a lot of centuries. Cloud atlas is in my opinion, one of the best movies of the year, or probably the whole decade.Though the story does revolve a bit around the concept of chaos theory and the butterfly effect, each segment/time line in itself was very well- made and even their combination was a perfect fusion. I mean, the screenplay was nothing short of amazing, though it felt a bit like a Kubrick movie sometimes for the incredible care for detail the directors took. The movie might take more than one viewing to understand it better. In the three hours of its runtime, there was not even a single second that was wasted or was passive.The actors had done an amazing role in the movie. All of them, Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Ben Whishaw, and others too. However, a special mention goes to Hugo Weaving, who appears in multiple roles in the film and every time he appears, he manages to make a powerful character portrayal. He was in this movie, as yet another reviewer has pointed out, a genuine show-stopper. The soundtrack was another character altogether. It was just right for the movie and was very well made.Part of the movie's perfection, apart from the fact that it was made based on the novel was the fact that the adaptation was carried out indeed very efficiently. By the end of the movie, when(or if, for the first time viewers) you see the connection between the happenings across the centuries, you will understand the effectiveness of the movie and how well it portrays our world for what it was, what it is and what it could be.Cloud atlas is a must-watch for everyone who loves intelligent movies that really make you think and have a long running time (near three hours). I shall even go as far as saying that the movie presents a rare opportunity of making us see how our actions are not as trivial as they seem and everything in this world is, after all, connected.An incredible movie. And, oh did someone just say 'Oscar'?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Captivating and unusual adapted from a hard book,"(2012) Cloud Atlas
SCIENCE-FICTION HISTORICAL DRAMAAdapted from the David Mitchell novel of the same name which is not bad with several different stories from different time periods all broken up throughout, which centers on several different characters and their actions through to the next life. At least the first hour was all introduction but once viewers able to get a grip on it's characters should be able to tolerate it the rest of the way. One thing they all have in common is the movie title ""Cloud Atlas"" whether it's the song or the area which can be a metaphor for things to come as a result of someone else's actions. There may be two stories I didn't enjoy particularly the futuristic story, because in this instance I prefer all the stories to have superficial endings. My favorite story is the escape African stowaway onto the ship which consists of a quick transition of a young ambitious Caucasian lawyer.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unique,"I love movies with a twist, movies like Memento, Tenet, the Sixt Sense, the Usual Suspects or Fight Club are rewarding on a second viewing because only then you realize how masterly the twist has been there all along, hidden in plain view. However there are only a handful of films that are still that rewarding after a 3rd, 4th or 5th viewing.Cloud Atlas is unique in that it's the only film I know that gets better the more you see it. The first time I watched it, I thought it was beautiful but flawed, and incomprehensible. However, every time you watch this movie, you understand and appreciate it better. No other movie I know of (certainly not blockbusters with A-list stars) is so ambitious, so deep. It is truly a gift that keeps giving. Watch this every year.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Moments of amazement and moments of ""just why.""","This movie... has both very well and horribly written scripts. I know it wasn't supposed to have a obvious and clear storyline to it, but I feel as if the film focused more having bold scenery rather than trying to pull all the pieces together.The bold scenes were certainly successful in grabbing a hold of the audience and extracting powerful emotions, but frankly, some other scenes were just outright stupid (or should I say, tacky) and/or very predictable. Some 'lives' portrayed in the film (as well as some other scenes) were unnecessary and felt like fillers, as if the director tried to add more content to just for the sake of adding more content. You know, when some movies throw only so much information to stimulate the viewer, but it's to the point that you can only pick out what's actually important and what's not?The script is of the same comparison; it has some memorable conversations and quotes, but at the same, some decisions were of very poor judgement. Like changing English to an altered and a more broken language. For example, at one point of the film, the word ""truth"" is actually ""true-true"" (If you want to know what I mean just watch or ask someone who has ...). This creates confusing gibberish that forces the viewer to rely pretty much only on the visuals to understand what's going on. And might I add that some phrases (spoken in true English) that were said seemed too hackneyed for it to be in such a complex and potentially great film.I have very mixed feelings about Cloud Atlas, both good and bad but frankly, I was pretty disappointed overall. My more accurate number review is about a 6.5, but 6 seemed a bit too low of a review as it wasn't THAT bad, but it certainly doesn't really earn the rating of a 7 either.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Probably best movie of 2012 and got robbed of the Acadamy Award,"Awesome movie!! Tom Hanks was brilliant. Haley Berry did a very good job. I was shocked that it didn't win an Academy for best picture, but I'm sure it's because it wasn't violent enough to interest the public in that way. I haven't read the book but I will now that I know there is one. The story is amazing and I loved how it showed our human relationships and how they are such a binding force in the way we live our lives. The acting was phenomenal, you have to be pretty well rounded to pull off multiple characters and succeed in doing so, and not get stagnant. Sometimes the movie was very hard to follow but it was so engaging that is was not hard to stay interested. There were moments when I felt lost but all of the questions were answered by the end. Definitely a must see for people who like movies that have substance and aren't just about killing other humans. A must own and watch over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Bold and Ambitious,"Based on what was a considered an unfilmmable novel Cloud Atlas is a large, ambitious film that took both the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer to adapt and direct. Cloud Atlas tells six different stories, set from the past to the distant future, all linked by universal themes of truth, justice, life and events from the past effect the future. The framing device is that all the characters are reading about the previous events, whether it's a diary, letters or a recording. A particular strong ideas was how the main character from the Seoul Dystopia is worshipped by a primate tribe as a God in a post-apocalyptic future. There are many links to the different time periods, from the cast, the music and small things like characters having birth marks, showing the contentions between the characters. The Wachowskis' theme of racism shows it head in their stories.Cloud Atlas is bold film, running for 2 hours 45 minutes and is visually stunning. The scenes of the various stories were perfectly edited together as different characters had to go through similar events. But some of the stories worked better then others and I personally thought the strongest stories were the 1973 nuclear thriller in San Francisco, the futuristic dystopia of Neo Seoul and the post-apocalyptical future. But the story starring Jim Broadbent as a man hiring in an old people's home felt out of place, being too humorous and just a mix of a Guy Ritchie gangster film and The One Flew the Cuckoo's Nest.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film for the ages (*****),"Is it rational to think that right now, writing this review, I have been influenced by a decision made three hundred years ago? Is it rational to think that my praise of this film may, somehow, effect an individual hundreds of years from now? Of course not, but Cloud Atlas is not about rational, logical thought, nor is it a standard film. If I have interpreted the film accurately, it is about possibility, dreams, risk, chance, fate, our connection to each other, and the inherent responsibility of our choices. It is about how our actions, small as they may be, can have a ripple effect on people, places, and things. Rarely does a film come along that actually makes the connection between ethereal, spiritual thought and precision film making, yet Cloud Atlas, with its' sublime color pallet, rousing score, and honest delivery, now exists as the supreme triumph of both in my eyes.When a work of art speaks to you on a deep, personal and emotional level, I think it becomes increasingly difficult to argue its' merit. Cloud Atlas is the prime example of that conundrum for me. It may just be the greatest film I've ever seen, but I don't believe for a moment that I can sway a regular moviegoer to my way of thinking. What I can say is that three directors collaborated to create a deeply soulful, spiritual film, spanning all genres, inspiring all emotions, and touching on all of the things I love about seeing a movie. It is perhaps the most unusual film of our time- it seemingly came from nowhere, had an extended trailer, opened wide in both 2-D and 3-D, defied convention, bombed at the domestic box office, and practically begged viewers to see it as multiple copies collected shelf dust.Cloud Atlas could have been an expensive disaster, making no sense and cementing (in my head) that the films of the Wachowski siblings (The Matrix trilogy) and Tom Tykwer (of Run Lola Run and The International) are no longer appointment viewings. Instead, this beautiful and occasionally brutal film exceeded my expectations, in both tone and execution. The broad story spans roughly 600 years, from the days of seafaring clippers to a possible post-apocalyptic future. From a sick lawyer that tries to overcome his inherent racism to a grandfather finally able to find ease with his tumultuous life, we're treated to a multitude of relationships, past, present, and future. A journalist strikes up a relationship with a scientist, and in the process uncovers a massive threat. An understudy to a great musician puts music to his words, creating the timeless title sound. A genetically engineered waitress breaks code and inspires the world as a result of the kindness of a rebellious stranger. A post-apocalyptic forager must overcome his hallucinations and simple upbringing to get humanity to connect again. How the directors were able to weave this plethora of story lines and characters together and still have it make narrative sense, I'll never know. What I do know is that it works, just like a random collection of notes strings together to form a symphony. What this symphony wants to tell us is that the evil of then is the evil of now, and in the future. The love of then, now, and in the future is the same. It is simply up to us to find our common threads, learn from them, and decide which true fate we want for ourselves and humanity.I would ask the skeptical to allow for the possibility that what happens in this film could be a reality. If you can separate the rigidity of our regular lives and the realities that we're ingrained with in this world, Cloud Atlas can stir that sense of hope and purpose within you. I feel it gives a voice and a narrative for what I believe is missing in many of our lives- a connection to the universe, and some meaning to what we do. In other words, it does for me what organized religion maybe should do. Interestingly enough, I've found myself not standing alone with my love for the film, and my thoughts for it. Those that like this film appear to share a kindred spirit, and an optimistic outlook on what we as a species could do. I say this being fully aware that I'm placing these opinions and feelings on the film, and it is altogether plausible that the original author and the directors had no intention of speaking to us as I've interpreted. I'm not buying that for a moment, however.Cloud Atlas is too soulful, too all-encompassing an emotional tale to simply be meant as a popcorn film. Consider the fictional ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"", as it has been wonderfully imagined in the film by composers Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and Tykwer himself. Imagine it as a tangible, audible thing that we can hear, a real thread of sound that permeates time and space. Think of what a thing of beauty it would be, how that shared connection can link all of us together, our decisions, or triumphs and failures, our ups and downs, and how it would mirror the greatest of symphonies, the most resonant of sounds. It is a timeless piece, something I would never tire of hearing, as if the memories of a thousand souls were wrapped up in the single stroke of a piano key or the bow of a violin. I love this film, for everything it says to me, and for what I hope it will say to others once they see it. If nothing else, my hope is that viewers allow the film to wash over them, and not give in to the pessimism and preconceived notions of what a 'Wachowski' film might be. You may be pleasantly surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Distinguishable, with fine performances, but uneven episodes and long run","The movie in question is a long and hectic narration (at times seems unceasing), with some elements of interlock, continuity and era-wise approaches. There are 6 different places/years, but not all of them are equally intriguing; my favorites are UK 2012 (with the funniest moments) and San Fransisco 1973 (most crime thriller), distant past and particularly distant future episodes used known turns and depiction too much. Joining elements are not always clear, same actors play different roles (with occasionally crude make-up), thus one has to stare the screen all the time, which becomes physically difficult as the movie lasts ca 2 hours 45 minutes. As for the cast, the finest performances are carried out by Oscar-winners Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Jim Broadbent, the others were just average or spent too little time on screen (e.g. Susan Sarandon).All in all, a kind of challenging watching: rather unusual script, but too sophisticated episodes and weak connection did not make tracking events easy. I would have preferred less time periods and more inter-generational links when deeds or ideas of older generations have direct impact on their descendants.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A decent attempt but would have made a better TV series...,"As I have recently read the novel before watching the movie I feel that I can only critique the adaptation of the story rather that as a separate film. Before viewing I was intrigued by how a scriptwriter would fit the intricacies of the many narratives into one movie. I would not say I was disappointed. Each tale is told in snippets linked by similarities in plot while the writer has adapted more than a few details to work better as a film. (Which is something that should be admired. A movie is not an exact copy of a book. It is instead an adaptation of the story - a fact critics should remember!) The film is also beautifully shot with each time period portrayed in a visually wonderful way. Each actor is also very good although Berry and Hanks do not, I feel, have the scope to act in the differing ways required. This did not, however, have a negative affect on the film. Jim Broadbent Shows them up. However, there are some negatives to this movie. The first is unfortunately the prosthetics. Some are very well done but many could have been done better and somewhat ruins the visual experience of the film. In addition, the characters' stories have been largely condensed. I do not know how this stands as a movie independent from the novel as I have read it, however I think it may have translated better as a television series. I would have loved to see each character's story played out in similar detail to the book. It could have been very successful. Finally, be aware of the fact that the film has been 'Americanised'. In other words its plot has been smothered in unnecessary cheese. It is definitely a journey and the time flies by unnoticed. I would recommend the novel for the character and plot development. I think that the directors have done well with this movie but series would have excelled.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A true masterpiece philosophically, artistically & experientially.","It's a universal battle between the head and the heart which plays out across time and space. Sometimes you need to experience what you are not to know what you are. Sometimes you need to look beyond the surface to get to the core of the story. Essentially, it's expressions of the same story told concurrently across the ages.What's the strongest force in the universe? What's the highest governing principle on all planes of existence? Is it survival of the fittest no matter the consequences or is there a hunger of the heart that no matter can satisfy? The life force of the heart that hungers for love. The love of freedom, the love of expression, love of life, love of connection & the love of virtue.A true masterpiece philosophically, artistically & experientially. The pace, the transitions, the dialogue, the character development, the 6 concurrent story lines somehow flowed effortlessly due to the interconnected theme.It's a movie about the fundamental drives of existence. I'd say the human condition, but Sonmi-451 a clone known as a ""fabricant"" alludes to the sort of universal force needed in order to override your programming. The sort of drive needed to override the will to live.One of the greatest love stories ever expressed, in the way it depicted the power of the spectrum of love in such seemingly different settings forcing you to look beyond the material.If you view this from the surface, have a short attention span or come in with too many expectations as to how a movie should be, you won't be able to appreciate the genius & heart of this movie. It's more than a movie. It's a timeless piece of art. A philosophical expression. A feat in film making. A metaphor for the interconnection of all life.Especially given that Natalie Portman gave a copy of the original novel to Lana Wachowski, who became deeply interested in it. A year later, both Wachowskis wrote the first draft of the screenplay. The book's style was inspired by Italo Calvino's If on a winter's night a traveller, which contains several incomplete, interrupted narratives. Mitchell said that the book's title was inspired by the music of the same name by Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi: ""I bought the CD just because of that track's beautiful title.""His previous novel, number9dream, was inspired by music by John Lennon. Both Ichiyanagi and Lennon were husbands of Yoko Ono.There is a method to this tale of the madness of all life.

Better Than Average Soap - Cloud Atlas,"As a person who is sometimes characterized as egocentric, pretentious, and overblown, I can commiserate with the producer and actors of this film. Cloud Atlas is all these things and more. It is a courageous attempt at something different, but in the end, it all about people and their difficulties in life. Six disparate stories that have some similar parallels , but not the mystic parallels desired by the writers.In reality, these are six stories that could not hold up for the necessary 90 minutes individually for a screenplay, so the concept of putting them in an ensemble with talented actors was actually a brilliant stroke of creativity. Of the six stories, the Korean woman in the future is, by far, the most interesting of the lot. The Halle Berry reporter story just doesn't seem to connect (although I love her, personally). Seeing Tom Hanks in red hair was amusing, however. He reminded me of a virile Red Skelton. The slave story was mildly interesting, but not as interesting as 12 Years a Slave. The old man trying to escape the old folk's home was amusing as well, but only strong enough for a 30 minute sitcom episode. The gay musician episode was quite well done in the early going, but unfortunately gradually went downhill after a false climax. And the sixth component was so unmemorable, that I cannot remember it at all. All in all, a good college try by the cast and the director and advice to the writers to stick to 30 minute formats for their screenplays. Doona Bae steals this film.

An Unforgettable Experience,"We have all heard that our actions in the present will impact the actions others will make hundreds, thousands of years in the future.

Everything hinges on how well the plot hangs together, how the lines create conflict and chemistry and make these essentials go together seamlessly. The authors of ""Cloud Atlas"", who also directed the piece, had a blueprint in David Mitchell's book, but still had to adapt a Star Wars-like future and an early 1900's English countryside into the same film without the plot falling apart. The Wachowski's and Tom Twyker have done exactly so, which is reason enough for this film to succeed.The actors, including Oscar winners Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, and Susan Sarandon along with Hugh Grant, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw and the underrated Keith David, all perform with downright majesty considering the complexity of the as many as six characters each play. It takes true talent not just to eloquently read lines but also to understand the director's vision, and each performance fits like a glove into the world each of the six stories has created. ""Cloud Atlas"" is the top of the list of ensemble films.The best line of the film comes near the end; ""From womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime, and every kindness, we birth out future."" We would all be well to remember this.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"not bad, but not great either","movie kept me engaged (at least attention-wise) during the whole length, which is pretty good. i didn't even noticed it's 3 hour long.but... at the end, all wrapped up together... to me at least, it didn't made a point. OK, love will save the world, or whatever, that is nice... but all in all - for me the end of a movie was somehow a letdown.i was watching all those stories develop and then the climax... well, there was none.having few actors play many characters was interesting thing in a way... but on the other side, it prevented me from believing in characters: i kept recognizing actors and it was like fun game for me, fun thing to do with friends that went to the cinema with me... which somewhat disengaged me from the movie emotionally.that aside, i still think that they didn't wrap it up in a meaningful way... at the end i was: hmmmm... that's it? all those stories were leading to...? where?6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others.","I have Cloud Atlas a couple of times since it's release, and recently gave it another viewing. Cloud Atlas really is a film like no other, a sweeping epic all about people's lives are all connected throughout time. There are many talented actors/actresses in this film, all who play multiple characters across multiple story lines. Each storyline takes place in a different time, from the mid 1800s, all the way to a post apocalyptic Hawaii dated as ""106 Winters After The Fall"". The film explores a lot of themes of life such as love, loss, conflict, conspiracy, greed, and what it means to be truly free. All of the actors give truly excellent performances in the film, and are believable in every one of their roles.The only storyline that might prove difficult in the viewing is the post apocalyptic storyline, in which the locals use this ""valley speak"" which can be a challenge to comprehend without subtitles, but other than that the stories are all very well done. While all mostly serious drama, there is one storyline which provides the film's comic relief, known as ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"", with Jim Broadbent at it's center, and Hugo Weaving as the tyrannical (and female) Nurse Noakes, and it involves four elderly folk in a daring escape of a nursing home. My other personal favourite storyline is one which takes place in a dystopian Korean city known as ""Neo Seoul"", and involves a rebellion against a totalitarian government. Not to say that the other stories are any worse by any means, of course.Simply put, without giving too much away, Cloud Atlas is an amazing film. It can make you laugh, make you cry, and make you cheer in excitement. I rate this film a solid 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tom Hanks is as always awesome...,"but the negroid woman, as usual, was terrible. The six different stories it told were interesting, but as always Berry ruined every second she was on screen. She is so disgusting looking that she takes away from every moment of every film her kind is in. She is horrific and makes movie goers gag. When I saw this in, the theaters, several people gagged and threw-up when she first came on screen. Hanks is always great, but his performance was ruined by that negroid. Hanks was great. We all loved his character despite his flaws. It is a thought provoking film despite the horror of Berry that she adds which makes us puke.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Breathtaking Epic,"The Short: Critics be darned, Cloud Atlas is incredible. Ambitious, insanely well told, brilliantly crafted and incredibly complex, Cloud Atlas is truly a sight to behold. It's a rough diamond a film, but for those who invest in it will find the payoff extremely rewarding like no other movie before it.Review - When is the last time a movie gave you a headache? Not because of the shaky cam, terrible acting, etc. etc. When was the last time a movie gave you a headache because you actually had to think?As I sit down to write this review, I simply can't express it any other way but this: Cloud Atlas is incredible. It reminds me of the first time I saw The Matrix. It's intriguing world and complex conundrums wowed me and thrilled me long after seeing it. It's the same with Cloud Atlas. I didn't think that the Wachowski's could pull off yet again another sprawling spider web of complexity, but they have.Cloud Atlas features an incredible plot, all of which I believe is well told. It's not until the final few minutes that everything comes together in incredibly clever ways. It all makes sense in the end, but you can't go on autopilot and simply ""enjoy"" Cloud Atlas (which is it's major downfall). Cloud Atlas is best described as a puzzle, and it's presented that way too. You'll be piecing everything together until those last moments, making Cloud Atlas's finale a huge payoff.Cloud Atlas also shines due to its incredible casting. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, and more play multiple characters in multiple time periods. The acting is (save for a few roles) surprisingly serviceable. Since these actors play multiple roles, it's interesting how they synthesize and bring together elements from the plot and character archetypes so well. And it's great to see Hugo Weaving as an oppressive and gigantic German female nurse.Everything else is icing on the cake. The cinematography is indeed epic, the presentation is phenomenal, the special effects are amazing, and the sheer scope of some of the scenery is truly incredible. Segways into new scenes are very well thought out, which are one of the best things of the film.Now while Cloud Atlas's story, characters, and sheer ambition shine brightly, it's not without its hiccups. Cloud Atlas comes together in the end very well, but the whole movie is freaking complex they barely give you any breathing room to process connections and ideas. Cloud Atlas is an exhausting film, but I mean that positively. The comedy sections do give you a chance to breathe, but only until the next scene. They also could've done without some of the stronger innuendo, and the beginning of Adam's story is, lets just say, there for a political agenda of which I don't approve of. Oh, and Hugo Weaving looks very creepy as an Asian person.Rounding it all out is the star of the show: The Cloud Atlas Sextet. The soundtrack is beautiful, but this original symphonic piece is unlike anything in a soundtrack I've ever heard that was part of a movie soundtrack. It's sweeping, beautiful, and each movement tells a story: that very same story you are watching on screen.In the end, what is Cloud Atlas? An ambitious, incredibly thorough and complex epic piece of filmmaking that will have you glued to your seat the whole 2 hour and 43 minute run time. Granted, some may be overly bored in Cloud Atlas, which is a shame. Cloud Atlas respects the movie goer, making them think and giving just enough payoff to keep you begging for more.4.5/5 stars - high recommendation",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
nice but weird,"CLOUD ATLASWow this is a confusing movie.Visually it is a beautiful film. There are so many gorgeous scenes. Lovely colours and great effects. The only thing is, there are so many different stories in this movie and it goes on for so long that I just could not understand it all fully. I am not the only one I watched this film with 3 other people and all of us were the same. I recently watched an interview with the cast from the film, and they were asked if they could explain the movie to everyone, and all of them said that they couldn't explain it.Speaking of the cast, it is very impressive. Tom Hanks is one of the main cast members Tom is one of my top 5 favourite actors. He has made so many great films, and this is good, but not up there with his best. Halle Berry is also in it. She does a great job. I find Halle to be a bit hit and miss. She is a great actress, but she has not got the best judgment in choosing movies. It also has Jim Broadbent in it. I know Jim from various TV shows and a couple of movies and I have to admit, this is his best role to date. Susan Sarandon also makes a couple of appearances. But he big surprise of the film has to be Hugh Grant I am not a big fan of his. He has made some good movies, but I don't really rate him as an actor. He has been typecast as a romcom actor and all of his films are very wet. But not in this film. He does a great job and it shows he can do other things other than romantic comedies. I know he was in Extreme Measures which was not a comedy, but he struggled through that. He looked so uncomfortable and out of his zone, but in Cloud Atlas he is awesome.The film is on for nearly 3 hours another long movie. Why are all the films these days so long? What happened to the days where a film could be on for 80-90 minutes and that was good films do not need to be dragged out to 3 hours. This film does feel long too sometimes when I go and see a movie and it is a 3 hours epic, it doesn't feel that long and the time flies but not here. It felt very long. That is not necessarily a bad thing, I did enjoy the movie, I just didn't understand it. I could not explain the story to you sorry.I will give this film a 6 out of 10...Too long, very confusing but visually very nice and some great performances.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Nutshell Review: Cloud Atlas,"The Wachowskis, with help from director Tom Tykwer, are back with a vengeance after their previous film Speed Racer underwhelmed at the box office. This time, they adapt from David Mitchell's award winning book Cloud Atlas, which tells of six inter-related tales spanning different eras from the 19th century to a post-apocalyptic future that brings humans back to the primitive times. It's almost three hours long, and a sprawling epic from start to finish, with a star-studded cast roped in to assist in the creation of the film's philosophy of how life interconnects through seemingly disparate events.But perhaps the best way to enjoy this film is to treat them as separate short stories and nothing more. The original stories in the novel had the various segments lead in to one another through texts found by various characters in their individual story arcs, with a built in cliffhanger each, before delivering the respective payload in reverse chronological order they were introduced to the reader, and rounding it all off. It could work as a structure for the film as well, but that meant having to wait for some time for the later arcs to appear, and make this really look like a series of short stories being artificially stitched together.So while the directors helmed different segments, the decision to sequence through all the six stories into one linear narrative was perhaps the right one, and through this fashion ring home the point of the inter-connectivity between the lives of characters in various story arcs more effectively, since scenes which were thematically similar at a point were edited to blend into one another rather seamlessly, rather than to get the audience to hold on to that thought for a later time application. Lines of dialogues also became memorable quotes across different story arcs, as do the character element of a comet-like birthmark that some of them would possess.However, don't get too caught up in trying to link the stories together through gestures like the ones mentioned, or to even consider whether the characters the various actors play, are connected or have links when they appear in the different stories. Forget about how the stories serve to link up beyond what got produced on the surface, because it is stuff of required, repeated viewings. Instead, what you can choose to appreciate, is how the actors gamely took on various roles in the different stories, where in some they would anchor as the lead, and in the others they would lend support, or cameos even. Make up and special effects were top notch to disguise the actors to play different characters, and part of the fun is to do a double take when you discover just who is hiding behind heaving prosthetics, makeup, or even something as simple as a moustache. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry took on no less than six roles, while the rest chipped in with five or less multiple characters, allowing an exercise of their individual acting chops.Technical brilliance made this film, with makeup as mentioned, costuming, art direction providing the canvas of the different eras, and special effects piled on as and when required, especially the futuristic segments, to make the worlds as separate and different from one another. Direction, despite being handled by different directors, was seamlessly integrated and consistent that you won't be able to tell them apart unless you sneak a peek at the production notes. The score also became a highlight, rendered by Reinhod Heil, Johnny Kilmek and Tom Tykwer, since it served as a centerpiece element for one of the story arcs.It's pretty fun watching the actors in their various roles, and those who particularly stood out were Hanks as Zachry, the man who had to defer to Hugo Weaving's devilish character before suffering the pangs of karma, and Doona Bae who may seem to have walked through yet another Air Doll role as Sonmi-351. It was surprising to see Zhou Xun involved in this film too, as was Hugh Grant being the most unrecognizable of the lot. Cloud Atlas is a mammoth of a film, that will demand you rewatch it again, not only to continue in your spot-the-star moment, but to give connecting all the dots another go, after you've come to savour the stories individually at first.

A mind-blowing masterpiece,"If the fact that I have registered and written my only review just because of this movie doesn't tell you anything about it, let me elaborate.There is a high possibility you will not like this movie. There is a big chance you won't understand what's it about.This is not a movie for an everyday simple Joe, this is not a movie for everyone.But if you belong to the 20% that is intellectually and mentally above the general population, you will absolutely adore this piece and all it represents. If you have heard something about Jung, if you were interested in psychology, brainwashing, virtual reality, or if you were thinking about the nature of the ""true truth"", be prepared for such a mental blow to your head it will spin many minutes after the credits roll.What the Matrix ultimately failed to deliver, that idea about not living a life we think we are is present and it's masterfully done. Other questions arise as well - what are deja vus? What if they aren't a malfunction of your brain? How do you explain that feeling you know someone you've just met?Is it possible to cram 6 different genres into one epic movie with brilliant acting and music? If you'd asked me before watching Cloud Atlas, I would say NO FREAKING CHANCE. I was wrong.If you haven't watched this movie yet, drop anything you're doing right now and go see it. Your brain will thank you for the workout and for the mental orgasm you'll give it (Forget what some critics are saying, critics aren't known for their open-mindedness).Did I mention an amazing music score?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A patchwork pastiche or an omlet du homage,"Filled with accomplished acting, but like everything else about it, uneven. The multiple roles played by the principle actors seem to have been given varying attention, and the mediocre makeup does not conceal the poor casting for some of the roles. Sadly, Tom Hanks never vanished into any of his roles. He remains the American Everyman whether playing the post apocalyptic Hawaiian tribesman with the Beyond Thunderdome dialect, or the despicable physician with the Austen Powers teeth. Then there's a bewildering mashup of Fu Manchu makeup, Bert the chimney sweep accent, and Caponean efficacy (where's the baseball bat?). Hanks remains. Hugo Weaving essentially reprises his Matrix Agent twice, once with heavy makeup and once without. He does a campy turn as a Cuckoos Nest nurse, and a mesmerizing and convincingly diabolical job as an Elm Streetesque phantom, marred not by his acting, but by some of his lines, seemingly lifted from the recent Exocist Begins (or is it Xorcist Origins?) film. Still a stunningly creepy performance. Hugh Grant does a fair James Caan for a Brit, vanishes into exotic tribesman makeup, but then the olderizing makeup fails poolside - wierdly, he didn't even appear British in that scene... I am not a Halle Berry fan, but her work in this film is refined, maybe the understatement makes her stand out alongside the Tarantino- infused characters. I believed her characters, despite the transforming makeup. The rest of the film is just good. There is some real emotional poignancy to the Do Androids Dream of Logan's Run segment and the closet melodrama about the music (I swear I've seen that before, but I can't place it). Cloud Atlas is not an original, but an assemblage of homages to other films, unfortunately of several genres, ranking from camp to high art. The uneven application of talent - script, acting, makeup - is not an achievement worthy of praise. Nevertheless, the good pieces shine through, and are worth watching. If one wasn't constantly distracted trying to remember where one had seen each scene in another film, it would rank somewhere above Waterworld and on a par with Fifth Element, somewhat below 12 Monkeys, and half an order of magnitude below Inception.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great music, overrated film.","This is a smokescreen movie, like Donnie Darko. Like Donnie Darko, it involves different time periods, and the events in each build a complex plot. Or, do they? Donnie Darko actually didn't make sense at all, and the connections between the stories in Cloud Atlas are actually, in the main, irrelevant. The leaping from story to story, time to time, may be considered clever and challenging, but it serves to further add unwarranted complexity to the five or six strands of the whole. Yes, some characters in some parts are relatives of those in other parts,but this doesn't really have any influence on the story. This conceit is illustrated in the episode on the sailing ship in which our protagonist is reading a book, half of which he can't find because its propping up a table leg. The book was written by the central character of a different story - so what? The only effective use of the vehicle is in the futuristic episodes, where the 'manufactured' serving girl turns out to be the god worshipped by a later generation. I've read the book as well, and my disappointment extended to it too. The film looks good though, and the acting is fine. For me, the theme music is the outstanding aspect of this overrated movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An outstanding masterpiece (unfortunately under-appreciated),"I know all the pedantic writers and proofreaders will be criticising me for my terrible grammar when I say ""outstanding masterpiece"" because the word masterpiece already implies that the film is outstanding, but that is how highly I feel about this film. It truly is one of the best films ever to hit the screen. Having seen some of the reviews of Cloud Atlas, I feel sorry for those who fail to appreciate the ideas and complexities of Cloud Atlas, as their complaints are usually dripping with dogma and ignorance.How this film was not nominated for a single Oscar is the most outrageous scandal to plague the film industry. When compared to the likes of The Life of Pi and Zero Dark Thirty, there is now at these films stand up to Cloud Atlas - it makes anyone wonder whether the nominations were rigged. Beautifully shot, outstanding score, and completely original, Cloud Atlas really should have been up contending (and winning) the Best Director, Best Original Score and Best Picture. I truly am lost for words how this film came to be so grossly unappreciated by critics and viewers alike. It is shameful that Cloud Atlas has seemed to have flown under the radar unrecognised and unloved by a thankless audience. This film is both artfully enigmatic and simple at the same time. It feels as if I understand the film inside-out, but also as though I will never be able to fully comprehend it. That is the true beauty of Cloud Atlas, and yet this is the element that goes unappreciated or misinterpreted by the many critics of this film.One of the most original films to hit the screen, Cloud Atlas recounts six stories encompassing a range of characters through six different timelines. From the bowels of an American slave ship in 1849 to the struggling descendants of a post-apocalyptic Hawaii, this three-hour epic evokes deep ideas and issues that you can be sure to be thinking about for weeks to come. Watching this film with family or friends is highly recommended as I know personally it was one of the rare films that incited deep discussion between viewers of the concepts and ideas portrayed in the film. The beauty of Cloud Atlas is that there is enough subtlety that every individual interprets the film differently, and there is no right or wrong.All six stories are delicately interwoven by a common theme - the concept of freedom. Whether they are a journalist in possession of a potent secret being doggedly pursued by a deadly hit-man, or an elderly publisher tricked into a care home and terrorised by a tyrannical nurse (played by Hugo Weaving(!) - this particular story was very funny), all were in some way trapped: physically, mentally or otherwise.The cleverest aspect is that various actors/actresses play multiple characters thought the eras - the idea of them being different reincarnations of themselves generation by generation. Each actor plays a definitive role throughout the film that is their persona, and this only enhances the relationship displayed between each story. The stellar cast of well known names (Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Halle Berry to name a few) pull out faultless performances, fitting seamlessly into each role they are given.Each story performs a unique function of its own: one makes us cry, one makes us laugh, one has us gripping onto the very edges of our seats; a comedy, action, tragedy, romance, sci-fi all combined beautifully and masterfully into one dazzling film.An exceptional and unique jewel of a film, this movie is seemingly incredibly under- appreciated at the 7.6 rating it currently holds. This film mysteriously missed out on a lot of awards and deserved, and does deserve far better. Those who fell in love with the film as I did will look back on it as a truly unparalleled classic for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A decent movie that blends many elements into one...,"This is a ballsy film by the Wachowski's and others. It's a good movie but isn't something that would reach out to mainstream audiences. It has multiple different stories and scenarios and time periods incorporated into this one visceral film. But isn't done in a way that is all that engaging or intriguing. In fact just about all of the stories in this movie has been done before and better. It tries to blend love, time, karma, sacrifice, rebirth, freedom and hope into this one film. The wachowski's are visionary directors but there just didn't seem to have all that amazing of a imagination for this one. This movie is almost 3 hours but felt like a 3 hour movie and just didn't find it all that entertaining. It might be one of those movies that take multiple watches to get completely but I just didn't find this whole experience all that clever. The stories aren't told one by one but show a bit of one of the story then move onto another story then come back to another story. It has some good editing but the switching of the stories seemed to quick to the point it got kinda irritating to watch. All the actors and actresses in this is alright but mostly forgettable. Tom Hanks seemed to really want to try all the different accent and dialects he shows in this movie. Anyways when it tries to blend all the stories together to a certain point I found it weak. The most interesting story out of all of them for me is the Neo Seoul story set in the future. It's dark and yet gripping and captivating. All in all this is a watchable movie that blends many different elements into one and has some good or even great visuals.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Yet despite all that, I really admire this film for trying to tell a narrative spanning thousands of years through 6 different timelines and an array of characters playing different parts in each one. It's not a perfect film, by any means, but it is some of the Wachaoski's best works outside of the matrix in terms of trying to craft something wholely original.

I have been minimised to a stupid consumer. In essence the whole movie is a simple demonstration, or, to be precise, an illustration of certain ideas which are imposed to you. I had no space to breathe. It was decided for me what I had to think. Brilliant directing and acting of some nice stories was lost in the whole material. All six parts do not hold together and do not form the whole in spite some narrative connections. They try to say so much that at the end they say very little. There are no discoveries. All you need to do is open your mouth, they will chew it for you and place it directly in your stomach.

Such a beautiful film,"Such a beautiful, moving tribute to the concept of reincarnation and what we reap in future lifetimes, sometimes referred to as ""cosmic justice"". Anybody who approaches this film with an open mind and heart will be highly rewarded with a thought provoking and moving tale of how our decisions echo across time and may sometimes even intercept our reincarnated future selves. Even better, it achieves this without being preachy, condescending, or even without relying on what I refer to as new-age frou-frou.It is a very deep tragedy that this film went flying over the heads of so many at the academy. Not only that this film SHOULD have won best picture in a landslide, but how it didn't win best cinematography is a real head scratcher. It didn't require a deep love of this film or a deep understanding of it's complicated subject matter to objectively notice how breathtakingly the DP's artistry is displayed in scene after scene. I personally found it to have the finest cinematography of any film I had seen since Schindler's List. I'm further befuddled by the lack of recognition that Tom Hanks gave in what I view as a superior performance even to those he gave in Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan. I view this as the second finest performance of his career after his groundbreaking role in Philadelphia. I find even more perplexing the lack of Oscar (not even a nomination, as with the others) for Jim Broadbent and Doona Bae's equally stunning performances. The exquisite subtlety Doona Bae gave is exactly the sort of thing that the Academy usually likes to reward. Again, head scratching.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The movie seems complex because of its interwoven or ""nested"" narrative structure, but it's simplicity itself because each story strand is simply allowed to be a story and to do what good stories do: show us convincing characters fighting for something they believe in to give meaning to their existence, without the heavy handed preachy tones of so much ""serious"" movie making. The acting, editing, cinematography are superb. The various ""genre"" pieces woven together seamlessly, and among a brilliant ensemble cast, Ms Berry and Ms Doona absolutely shine. The meta elements, the nature of storytelling, are also done simply and without excess self-consciousness; they emerge organically from the narrative and character development.

An ambitious novel generally well realised on the screen,"The 2004 novel by British writer David Mitchell was a hugely ambitious work which I enjoyed and admired. It is six stories with subtle inter-relationships between them: each one written in a different format, each constituting a different genre, each set in a different time. This was always going to be a formidably challenging piece of clever writing to bring to the big screen in a manner accessible to the viewer but true to the spirit of the original work. The film was written, produced and directed by the Americans Lana (formerly Larry) and Andy Wachowski and the German Tom Tykwer and, against all the odds, it works very well.The first challenge was finding the money to make a movie which is so demanding of its viewers. During the four years of development, the project met difficulties securing financial support and it was eventually produced with a $102 million budget provided by independent sources, which makes it one of the most expensive independent films of all time. The risk paid off since the takings more than covered the costs, but critical and audience reaction has been variable. The next challenge was how to structure the work. The novel consists of 11 sections with only the sixth story in unified form and the other five split in two, set symmetrically around the core, so that the reader finishes with the second section of the story with which he started. The film adopts a totally different structure; the pre-title sequence immediately introduces the lead characters of the six tales and then the film itself constantly jumps between the different narratives. At first, this is really confusing for the viewer, but gradually one gets a mental grip on the inter-locking stories. One advantage of this approach is that all six tales come to a climax towards the end of the movie.Another challenge was how to realise the many connections that the author created between the different stories. Some were easy, such as the reoccurring comet-shaped birthmark and the use of the word six as in the character Sixsmith and the musical octet. In fact, the inter-connections are done more obviously in the film than in the book. The main device for achieving this is to have the same actors playing multiple roles, although it is often not easy to pick this out since the make-up is very professional. The eight leading actors play no less than 46 roles between them. Tom Hanks is especially impressive in his six roles, but other stars are Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Hugh Grant and Susan Sarandon. Another device for making cross connections is clever cutting between similar scenes or situations.The final challenge was how to do all this in a manageable length. The novel is over 500 pages and the film comes in at little under three hours. To require so much concentration for so long is a big ask and not all movie-goers will have the stamina or inclination. But I found it a genuinely bold and original work that I enjoyed and will want to revisit before too long to savour the full richness of this unusually complex but thoughtful work.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A good cinematization of an okay book,"It was only weeks before seeing this film that I had read the book it is based on, so I suppose this might have taken away some of the excitement I might have felt had I watched it ""unspoiled"". Since I was already familiar with the central premise of 6 narratives intertwined and interleaved across time and space, its ingenuity might have dulled on me somewhat, so I will attempt to combine my impression of the plot from reading the book with its cinematic realization.Although I found the theme of interconnectedness appealing, I never felt that it had been developed to its full potential. I continuously had the feeling that we were building up to some great revelation or insight, which would give meaning to the connections. That is, not an explanation in a metaphysical sense, but a purpose for them in the narrative. We were promised, to quote the IMDb synopsis, ""an exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future"", but instead the film offers only loose links and similarities, save perhaps for the implication that the same ""souls"" keep finding each other in different lives.Some have praised this absence of a message as a strength. They argue that David Mitchell and the Wachowski siblings have done well to leave the story's themes open to interpretation. However, just as a painting needs colours and contours, so does a story require decisions from the narrator to give it definition. In this particular case, I believe, the picture has been left too blurry.That said, but for a few minor flaws the film is a graphically stunning recreation of the book, especially in the more futuristic segments, which does much to enhance the cosmic scale on which we are meant to see it. The same can be said of the way the different stories are cut together, which is a well-chosen departure from novel. I do confess I would rather have been spared Tom Hanks' attempt at a non-specific English/Scottish/Irish accent (which at times even has hints of pirate- speak in it), as well as the cross-dressing and cross-racial make up of some of the leading actors, all of which seem to have been done in the interest of the connectedness theme, but ends up feeling somewhat forced and more than a little toe-curling. But these are minor complaints which I am happy to overlook when calling this film a remarkable effort, somewhat limited by the story it had to work with.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"We know they're great actors, now they're going to really show it","For years, it was said that David Mitchell's famous novel Cloud Atlas was ""unfilmable."" A story of such profound, epic-proportions that encapsulating all the beauty, charm, angst, heroism, and complexity of it would be an extraordinarily impossible feat. The Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana, and Tom Tykwer have done it; they've successfully created a visionary tale of impeccable beauty. A polarizing epic filled with untold ambition and high-flying possibilities, for the most part, all of which extenuated with stunning beauty, Cloud Atlas manages to soar past any expectations to be one of the most puzzling and enjoyable pictures of the last decade.The film takes six drastically different story and manages to use mostly the same actors in each one of them, making them up to look like completely different people, playing different character-types, different races, and sometimes, different sexes. We all knew going into this that headliners Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, and Susan Sarandon are immensely talented people, always capable of providing their audience with a memorable show, but I can imagine how challenged and pressured they felt to embody themselves in characters light years away from anything they've ever played before.I will explain the six stories ambiguously and quickly, so your experience may not be compromised. The first story, titled ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing,"" takes place on an enormous ship sailing the Pacific, circa 1849, exploring relations between an optimistic crewmember and an African-American slave. The second story, ""Letters from Zedelghem,"" is set in 1931 Belgium and dives into the complex relationship between a young music transcriber and the aging composer he must work for. The third, ""Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery,"" set in the 1970's, shows how a young journalist uncovers a huge nuclear conspiracy run by an oil company mogul. The fourth, ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish,"" one of my favorites, centers on a British publisher who is trapped in an eccentric nursing home, shunned from his children and confined to the quirky treatment of the people working there. The fifth, ""An Orison of Sonmi~451,"" shows a grim, plastic future, set in the 22nd century, where corporations have thrived at the expense of the population and clones have been made to run society, unless one of them can see the corruption and fight back (this is how that futuristic mess Branded should've been). Finally, the sixth story, ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After,"" (by this time, we're around the year 2346) focuses on a tribesman and his close friendship with a woman with more technological aptitude than him and how their togetherness may be star-crossed or simply meant to be.Have I left you in the fog? After writing that, I feel I've greatly distanced myself from reality. Cloud Atlas is a film where one can go in with the mindset to completely absorb themselves in the movie, where they will never stop thinking, question everything, and extract multiple meanings from every little piece of it. Another could go in with the mindset to be entertained, but also treated with respect as a viewer, rewarded with their 164 minutes of patience by being given some deeper moral or life-realization. And finally, the most casual viewer can just walk in and expect a fine experience for which they will be marveled and left to cherish. No one is wrong here, but I do believe walking in with the mindset that you will question every little piece leaves little to no enjoyment on your behalf. I walked in with a willingness to pay attention, listen closely, and to be taken with the world the Wachowski's and Tykwer have brought to me, and not forget that I want to be entertained in the process. I wasn't let down in the slightest.My experience is greatly reminiscent of Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life (ironically, the ""Sloosha's Crossin'"" story's cinematography looks very similar to the kind utilized in Malick's New World - about John Smith and Pocahontas). The first act was hard to get into, mainly because you're adapting to this world brought to you out of the blue. The second act is when you're beginning to like what you've been through and you're patiently awaiting more. The third act is when you've become so in touch with this world, that walking out of the multiplex is like leaving a place you feel you haven't spent enough time at. Let me just say, it was hard to go back in the car.That's as complicated as I'll go in trying to fathom the moral and the underlying theme(s) of Cloud Atlas. I feel continuing, painstaking research will cause nothing but frustration and exhaustion to the point of me never even wanting to look at the film again. And that is definitely not how a film like this should be treated. The film is one of the most lavish theater experiences I've come to have in my short years as a functioning internet critic, and between the incredible cinematography, subversive tonality, elegant performances, non-linear narrative, and the impact left on the viewer worth two or three epics, it'll be difficult to judge another dystopian film again. Now if only there was that emotional impact would Cloud Atlas have truly come full circle.Starring: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Bae Doona, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Zhou Xun, Keith David, David Gyasi, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant.

My favourite movie of all time,"Holy cow. It took three tries over the past 3 years for me to finally watch and finish it and god damn it was worth all 3 hours. It genuinely is a masterpiece of a movie and it is so beautifully brought to life. It takes a lot of concentration to understand it at first but once you do, everything within the movie just comes together and it's beautiful - the context also explains why a lot of people dislike it for the mixing of races for different actors. Regardless of this controversy it's such a thought provoking and life changing movie. Definitely near the end with certain events... I sobbed so hard! Definitely one of my most favourite movies for a long long while and if you're reasonably mature so at least 16 or at the same maturity, you should definitely watch it. Try to see past any controversy within the makeup etc etc... focus on the movie and how each actor is reincarnated in different lives regardless of race religion or gender.Also side note I've been listening to the cloud atlas sextet for over a year now! Absolutely beautiful piece of music, and if you have school work or you're studying, the whole soundtrack is PERFECT.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A spectacle that entertains while simultaneously numbing the brain.,"Cloud Atlas is the latest event in the Wachowski brothers' adventure in cinema. Depending on which stage of their career path you look at, their name on the credits either excites or sinks the stomach. Beginning with the superb high of Bound, shot rapidly and cheaply to 'prove' they could be trusted with a mega budget for The Matrix, their career trajectory has been downwards ever since, bottoming out (hopefully) with the ill-judged, stodgy mess that was Speed Racer. Four years on and they're back with, well, what is it? Cloud Atlas is a spectacle. It's beautiful. The cinematography and effects edge towards astounding, are mostly satisfying and make for a very attractive, no, a stunning film. Visually, that is. Much (most?) is shot against green screens, which has allowed them to sculpt worlds that present to us that which swirls around in their minds. It's a trip most will enjoy looking at immensely.For me, the visuals are the principal selling point. The contrasts between the closed sets of a study and ship compared with the expansive realms of forests and cityscapes are expressed wonderfully; the costumes and make-up are vivid, imaginative and prompt silent games of Guess Who as the star names play multiple characters, Halle Berry and Jim Sturgess leading the pack with seven characters apiece.On the subject of stars, Cloud Atlas is packed with them: Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Ben Wishaw, James D'Arcy, Susan Sarandon It's no mean feat watching each of them bounce between roles, so it must have been one heck of a task for each of them playing them. Each, without exception, manages to differentiate between characters suitably but, man, it's hard to keep up sometimes.Cloud Atlas is so chock-a-block full of worlds, times, characters and story lines that it becomes cluttered and confused early on and doesn't ever let up. Perhaps the best advice to heed when viewing Cloud Atlas is to approach it like Shakespeare: Don't attempt to understand every syllable of every word (or even every soliloquy, for that matter), just sit back, go with it and then assess what you've absorbed as the credits roll.I've said it before (most recently with American Mary) it's not a good sign when a film requires two directors. But three? Really? This is a classic case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Maybe the Wachowskis were so concerned about their rapid descent through Hollywood's hierarchy they felt they needed to bring in Tom Tykwer (Perfume: The Story of a Murderer) to save them. Perhaps they should have employed him and left him to it.Instead, despite/because three men shared the megaphone (as well as writing and producing duties), we have a three-hour head spin that entertains while simultaneously numbing the brain. Brevity is not in the directors' vocabulary; hell, you can even watch the 'extended' trailer, which is a full 5 minutes & 42 seconds, the length of some short films! So what is it actually about? Cloud Atlas is summed up perfectly in the final few minutes when Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) states, ""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb we are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future."" It's a beautiful sentiment that allows our thoughts and imaginations to journey across worlds, times and planes of existence and it's not the slightest issue that the journey Tykwer and the Wachowskis take us on is eight minutes shy of three hours. The issue is that feels like three hours! There is a more succinct explanation courtesy of Stephen King in his Dark Tower epic: ""Go, then, there are other worlds than these.""For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Something you never forget.,"Like ""Matrix"", ""Cloud Atlas"" is pretty good at disturbing our borderline between real and imagination. Watching this movie might make you think ""Wow, maybe THIS is how reincarnation works"". It's easy to say ""No"", of course, but who knows? Maybe we are living under the strict control of gigantic artificial intelligence and there maybe another world beyond our reach. Maybe we are given birth to this world again and again experiencing our own lives.And I think that's the best thing of this movie. It's not just somebody's imagination. It can reach OUR imagination and make us think even if you are not a fan of sci-fi stories.It's not a simple entertainment, I admit.

Jigsaw Cinema,"How do you review a film like ""Cloud Atlas""? Well, I could start by saying that it is an example of ""hyperlink cinema"", a style of film-making which has become popular in recent decades, especially since the turn of the millennium. Such films involve multiple story lines which are intercut with each other instead of being told sequentially. With most films of this nature, however, there is some obvious connection between the various plot lines. Altman's ""Short Cuts"", for example, was based upon various short stories by Raymond Carver. All the plot lines in ""Traffic"" were related to the illegal drugs trade, those in ""Syriana"" to Middle-Eastern politics and those in ""The Hours"" to Virginia Woolf's novel ""Mrs Dalloway"".""Cloud Atlas"" is different. The film with which it has most in common is ""Babel"", which also featured apparently unrelated stories, but ""Babel"" only had three plot lines, all set in the present day, whereas ""Cloud Atlas"" has six, set in six different historical periods:-In 1849 Adam Ewing, an American lawyer travelling between the Pacific Islands and San Francisco, tries to help Autua, a runaway slave who has stowed away on his ship.In 1936 a young English musician named Robert Frobisher becomes amanuensis to Vyvyan Ayrs, an elderly and eccentric composer, after being expelled from Cambridge for homosexuality.In 1973 Luisa Rey, a San Francisco journalist, finds that her life is in danger when she investigates the suspicious death of a scientist named Rufus Sixsmith.In London in 2012 a writer murders a critic who has given his book a negative review, thus setting in motion a series of events which culminate in his publisher, Timothy Cavendish, being interned in a sinister old people's home.In a dystopian Korea in the year 2144 Sonmi-451, a member of a despised underclass of genetically-modified humans, joins a rebellion against the corrupt society to which she belongs.In a post-apocalyptic Hawaii in the year 2321, Zachary Bailey, a member of a primitive tribe known as the ""Valleymen"", encounters a more technically advanced people known as the ""Prescients"".Not only do these stories appear to have little in common, they are also made in quite different styles. The first two are costume dramas, and the 1973 story is a ""paranoid"" thriller reminiscent of ""The Pelican Brief"" or ""Chain Reaction"". (Like those films it deals with skulduggery by high-ups in the oil industry). The 2012 story is essentially a black comedy and the last two plot lines are dealt with in a science-fiction style. The Korean one shows the strong influence of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner""; even the name of the cloned underclass, ""fabricants"", recalls the similar term (""replicants"") used in Scott's film. The Hawaiian story seems to have been influenced by Kevin Costner's ""The Postman"".So how are these disparate strands connected? To a limited extent, by the use of recurring characters and places; Sixsmith, for example, appears as a young man in the 1936 segment- he is Frobisher's lover- and as an older one in 1973, and Ayrs' mansion later becomes the nursing home in which Cavendish stays. Another device used is that of casting the same actors in different roles in different stories, although often so well disguised as to be unrecognisable. It was pretty obvious that Jim Broadbent was playing not only Cavendish but also Ayrs and the 1849 ship's captain, and that Halle Berry was both Luisa and the Prescient woman with whom Zachary falls in love, but I didn't spot her as Ayrs' wife, probably because she was made up to look white in this section. (Several actors play characters of a different race to their own, and in one case, of a different sex). I failed to recognise Hugh Grant, normally a distinctive actor, in any of his six roles.With so many actors playing multiple roles, there would not be room here to single out every good performance, but I think that special mention should go to Broadbent as the confused, bumbling Cavendish and the irascible old Ayrs, to Tom Hanks as Zachary and to the South Korean actress Doona Bae as the initially servile Sonmi, who gradually comes to recognise her own humanity and the criminal nature of a society which fails to respect that humanity.Watching the film is a bit like trying to do a jigsaw puzzle. At first we are confronted with what looks like a mass of confused fragments and then, as we start to put them together, a bigger picture starts to emerge and we realise that there are indeed links between all six segments. I won't set out what all those links are, but the most important one is the thematic link of revolt against, or liberation from, some form of slavery, imprisonment or oppression. Autua and Sonmi are enslaved in the most literal sense. Cavendish and Frobisher are both held against their will in the same building, the former by physical restraint and the latter by blackmail. Zachary and his people are oppressed by an aggressive race known as the Kona. Luisa fights against the tyranny of corrupt people in high places. As the film reaches its end we realise how people in one era have inspired those in the next when faced with similar problems and we eventually see the complete picture. The film has divided critical opinion, but from my point of view it succeeds beautifully. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A 3 hour epic of 6 interesting stories.,"I first watched this movie around the time it came out. I was a high school student who enjoyed fun movies, but I have since developed a deeper appreciation for film as an artform. When I first watched the movie, I disliked it. I found it very long, boring, and confusing. I decided to revisit the film to see if, 10 years later, if I had a different opinion. Yes, it is long. But now I understand it, and even enjoy it.First of all, the cast - Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Ben Whishaw, James D'arcy, Jim Sturgess, Bae Doona, Hugo Weaving, and many others. Of course Tom Hanks stole the show. Several different characters, several different sets of prosthetics, several different voices and accents - Tom Hanks fans, watch this movie. He is such a pleasure to watch. Also, Hugo Weaving was basically unrecognizable in some parts. And I mean to say, he played a couple characters and I didn't realize it was him until I looked at the cast. Highly disappointed nobody was even considered for an Oscar nomination here.What I appreciate the most is the concept. It's a very unique form of nonlinear storytelling in that it grapples with the idea of reincarnation. All 6 stories take place in 6 different time periods, including 2 fictional future dystopians. Each story utilizes the same actors, thus it being an anthology of sorts. Yet there was a different main character in each. Like Tom Hanks was only the main character in the very very far future arc while Halle Berry played the main character in the 70s arc. And each story had it's own theme and and moral message to tell. On top of it all, the music was quite amazing.I definitely think it would've done better as a 6-part mini anthology series, but I must say they did a good job telling 6 self-contained yet intertwined stories at once in this movie format. Of course it has its flaws, and not everyone will enjoy it, but it could've been worse. But because it was a movie and not a mini series, the film plays around with different story parallels within the 6 arcs. There were several scenes where a line or event in one story would transition perfectly to a scene from another story. Some characters or objects form a past story would show up with relevance in a future story. There were also several sequences when two or three arcs would be at a climax at the same time, so we kept going back and forth, adding to the intensity of whatever action was going on.This isn't for a casual viewer at all. I could probably watch this a couple times more to fully analyze it. It would be a fun project, but I'm not gonna do it. Though I'd probably get something new every viewing if I did. I also heard this was a book, which could be an intriguing read.

The environment and great camera work really puts you inside the characters lives. Also, the characters are very likable. They each have their own back story that connects with others lives. The story can get quite emotional at times, too. For those who don't like Cloud Atlas, or think the ideas are too confusing, this is a movie that requires a lot of thought. It should not be thought of as a drama or romance story, but rather a movie about freedom and how each one of our decisions directly and indirectly effect others.

A mix of stories,"Six stories in different eras are told, presenting different lives of reincarnated people who tried to do something different or relived the same mistakes over and over again.

They are interesting by themselves but the way they were presented in the long length of the movie is a drawback from my point of view.A two part movie would have been more understandable and more entertaining, rather than mixing them up in an almost randomly fashion, hoping for audience to understand what they were trying to transmit. Their respective worlds, each of them with its own crisis, some of them post-apocalyptic, caught my attention, together with their spectacular visual effects, but the action, sometimes thrilling, was too hard to follow and link to its previous part. The connections between the stories are not there for everyone to see. You really have to focus and try to find them (if they exist), again, something not everyone is willing to do, especially on a three hour film.I say it one more time, it would have been almost a spectacular movie if they had found some other way of presenting each event, exposing their connections and message for everyone to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"past, present, future","'Cloud Atlas' is one of those films that challenges critics and movie lovers by refusing categorizations. Historical fresco? Philosophical film? Science fiction? Art movie? Mega-production with mega-stars in distribution? 'Cloud Atlas', made in 2012 by The Wachowskis and the formidable German director Tom Tykwer, can be considered as having elements of all these genres, and at the same time belonging to a separate category. It is a spectacular and sophisticated film, which leaves many elements of the story and interpretation in the hands and minds of the spectators, and a captivating movie because of the way it is made, realized and interpreted. At the end of the viewing I was left with the feeling that many details and meanings remained open or unexplored, but at the same time I did not go through any boredom moments, on the contrary, I was permanently captivated, despite the duration of almost three hours. It's one of the few movies I'd like to see again. It happens very rarely to me, even with the films that I really loved.
'Cloud Atlas' is the screen adaptation of a novel by the same name written by David Mitchell, built as a succession of six stories, which take place over different periods of time, and which are linked by a similar theme and by the fact that in each of them there are references to the previous story. The structure of the novel is pyramidal, the stories unfold in the first part of the book chronologically, the final one in the middle, and then the narratives come back in time in reverse sequence. The filmmakers chose to present the six plots in parallel and interleaved. The film permanently alternates scenes in which the narrative threads intersect: from the story of a ship sailing the ocean in the 19th century during the slave trade period, passing through the 1930s story of the young genius composer of the symphonic piece 'Cloud Atlas', the one of the brave reporter involved in a political investigation in the 1970s, of the publisher pursued by literate gangsters in the contemporaneity, until the two episodes in the future, involving a revolt of humanoid robots and a story of contact between civilizations. There are some shared ideas - especially the uniqueness of truth and its supreme moral value, but the style of each episode is distinct, from the historical film, via political thrillers, to sci-fi. Three of the episodes are directed by The Wachowskis, the other three by Tykwer. Their combining is superb, creating a sense of continuity and sublimating the idea of temporal relativity and fluidity. One door closes in one time period and opens in another. The paces of the stories accelerate or stop simultaneously, the moments of maximum tension are reached in simultaneity. As in a wonderful mosaic where you step back a few steps and you see the whole, same in 'Cloud Atlas' the sensations of continuity and consistency are perfect.
The unity of ideas and style of the film is strengthened by the casting in different episodes of a remarkable team of actors, many of whom play multiple role roles that transcend not only time, but also ages, sex, skin color. The exceptional makeup also contributes to the melting of actors with such well-known faces as Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, or Susan Sarandon in their characters. Also appearing in the film is Doona Bae, a famous South Korean actress (I had seen her in 'A Girl at My Door') but little known outside her country. Another special component of connection and expression is the film's soundtrack. I believe that for those who are not afraid of cinematic experiences other than the routine ones, and who do not necessarily look for a particular genre in its purest state, 'Cloud Atlas' is a film that offers many reasons for satisfaction. It is also a film that I think by its very structure is destined to withstand time, and to be increasingly appreciated in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unnecessarily Added Complexity To An Already Complex Plot.,"Presented in large numbers of fragments which viewers are left to connect all by themselves, Cloud Atlas is without a doubt a very thoughtful, highly ambitious & deeply philosophical project from Tom Tykwer (director of Run Lola Run) & Wachowski Brothers (the creators of The Matrix Trilogy) but there's also no denying that it is way too overlong, very complex & not as immersive as was expected from it.The movie features a complex, non-chronological plot structure that is narrated in fragmented segments, is supported by terrific visuals, dazzling cinematography, good performances, stunning make-up & amazing soundtrack and also covers many themes n elements of love, loss, betrayal, trust & spirituality throughout its runtime. But on an overall scale, this flick is a thought-provoking work that is destined to polarise its viewers.As for me, Cloud Atlas had the scope to be one of the finest sci-fi films of recent years but it simply fails to hold up due to its sheer size & unnecessarily added complications to an already complex plot. Maybe another viewing in the future might change my opinion about it by some degree but for now, this sci-fi drama remains a major disappointment. Multiple viewings advised.",,Anonymous,Mystery
My Review,"This is not a short movie. In essence, it could very well have been several movies. It tells an epic, interconnected and weaving story about love, trust and the fleeting value of human life. As such, it starts out as a very VERY confusing series of flashbacks, flashforwards and possibly flash-to-the-sides. If you give it, say, 30 minutes all those threads connect.Normally I have no time or patience for a movie this long. Other things to see, distractions aplenty. This one gripped me till the end. It is WELL worth your time, even if to spot which of the very few actors plays which man or woman (yes really) in which timeline. While doing that you will also see an epic tale, expertly told.Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Really good...but some flaws.,"My rating for this film would be a B+. It was definitely an ambitious film to make. And even more impressive since it was independently funded. Here's what I loved. I especially loved the Timothy Cavendish storyline. Jim Broadbent stole the show. If anyone out of this film should get an acting nod, it should be him. The story was hilarious and charming. You couldn't help but root for them. I also thought Doona Bae and Jim Sturgess had really great chemistry. The Sonmi-451 storyline was my second favourite. And I loved the special effects they used. Should definitely see some awards nods. Perhaps even some wins. My third favourite was the Robert Frobisher storyline. So heartfelt and moving, and I loved the 1930s setting. Ben Whishaw has a future ahead of him, that's for sure. I also liked how all the story lines intertwined with another. And I loved the score. OH MY GOD, it's so good. So hauntingly beautiful, and I hope it gets recognized come awards season. I also thought it was neat that Hugo Weaving and Hugh Grant always played ""The villain"" in every story line.However, the ""Slooshas Crossin"" storyline was the weakest for me. Not only was it hard to understand them half the time, but it was boring for 90% of that storyline. I didn't see much chemistry between Halle Berry and Tom Hanks. The other thing that kept me from giving this film a higher grade, would be the dialogue. Sometimes they just said completely cheesy things.Overall, I did enjoy it. And I think it currently sits in my top 10 of 2012 list....but we'll see just how long that lasts.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The run time killed it a little.,"I would of given it a higher score if the run time wasn't as tedious. The Wachowski's do what they do best. Tackle hard Sci-Fi concepts, and aren't afraid to make something original and daring. And this movie was a good attempt on that part.I enjoyed the set pieces, acting, and script. The plot can get muddled, but once the one hour and thirty minute mark kicks in(yes, a long movie) that other hour and thirty minutes is what makes up for the dragging pace. It's use of editing for the jump in timelines is well shot. As well as the CGI(which the Wachowskis are known for)I recommend this movie if you are or not a fan of the Wachowskis. Just be ready for a lengthy film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A domino effect canvas disguised as a visual achievement,"I was never a fan of the Wachowski siblings growing up, never saw the Matrix or Jupiter Ascending(also known as the movie that killed their collaborative creative). I'm a huge fan of their produced film, V for Vendetta, which before it was released, Natalie Portman gave Lana a copy of the book to read during film, which resulted in them making this magnificent multi story masterpiece. Now I don't like movies or stories that focus on more than one person but this one was different and extremely unique. It's based on the novel and touches upon reincarnation.. You got four to five different story lines going on during the three hour run time of the film, varying in acting, historical times, and even in genre. The actors do magnificent jobs in their multi roles, the make up effects and costumes are breathtaking and mind blowing and the whole ""everything is connected"" will change your whole outlook on life once the credits roll! Without spoiling it, this movie is extremely worth the watch more than once! So if you like Blade Runner or the Matrix, then I highly recommend this lovely piece to you!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"CLOUD ATLAS is a multi-layered mosaic with mixed results but overall, A for Effort","CLOUD ATLAS is a multi-layered mosaic,sometimes plodding, sometimes frenetic, spanning various centuries, with top-drawer names in multiple roles. If you get past the sometimes unintelligible dialog of Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Susan Sarandon (others speak more clearly), and the yawn-inducing slow pace of the film's first half, much can be enjoyed from the directorial trio of Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowksy (helmers of the MATRIX films) and Tom Tykwer, as an experimentally ambitious project. We are given a kaledeiscopic ride of history, romance, villainy and intrigue, and lends us ponderous insight into the workings and vagaries of the human soul (and human mind). The story arcs overlap and intersect, some with bittersweet endings, others with catharsis and hope. The sci-fi subplot (with medieval Hanks and alien-like Berry) goes on a bit too long, but the other stories fare better. Comic relief comes deliciously from Jim Broadbent, as is villainy from Hanks and MATRIX costar Hugo Weaving. The sets are fantastically designed and the music, throbbing, is excellent",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disjointed Mess,"I decided to watch this because it had such a high rating. After half an hour I changed the channel. It is supposed to be a link through generations but jumps from 200 years in the future to 2,000 years in the past. There is no sequential logic to it. If they did it in some kind of chronological order you could follow it. Instead they disguise the characters so much between generations it is difficult to recognise which one a scene is dealing with. It has some really big name actors but in spite of that the way the story is put together has turned it into a piece of nonsense. It could have been interesting but sadly it isn't.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Mentally provocative, it's one of the most underrated movies I've seen.","This film addresses a subject rarely addressed in the cinema: how individual actions can, over the time, influence the course of future events. It mixes six different stories passed in the past, present and future. It's directed by Tom Tykwer, who also wrote the script along with Lana and Lilly Wachowski. In his several roles, it includes Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Halle Berry and Doona Bae, among other artists.This movie is one of the most complex and difficult to follow I've seen in cinema. We need to view it carefully in order to understand it and savor it, and that complexity is a motive why some people will probably dislike it. By mixing six stories situated in six moments in space and time, but united by so subtle connection elements such as a song, a book or a birthmark, this film looks like a tangle of stories without head or tail, but it's not true. That happens because the topic addressed is also complex, so as David Mitchell's novel. The script is flawless, superb and deserves congratulations but the cast deserves even more applause. They literally had to unfold to make this film and none of the main actors made less than three different characters, which is an achievement and a challenge for any actor. And perhaps it was the pleasure of the challenge that led so many big names from Hollywood to risk entering in an openly indie film, far from the financial support of the big corporations of the industry. The technical offices are beyond reproach, thought of every detail and made an exceptional work: the costumes are exquisite and the makeup and visual and special effects are gradually surprising more and more. Reinhold Heil signs the soundtrack, which was also excellent.There are certain films that, as good as can be, end up being marginalized due to issues that have nothing to do with the quality or beauty. This film is one of those. Despite the depth and complexity of the script doesn't allow it to be massively understood or appreciated, is an exceptionally good movie that the fact of not having a film company behind left almost out of the critics attention or the major industry awards. Surprising, exciting, this film is mentally provocative and it's sad that hasn't even been nominated for more categories at the Oscars and Golden Globes.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Truly an Epic movie,Its not often a movie comes along that breaks the mold and this movie really does. You can watch it now or wait until it is recognised and awarded and watch it then - either way you will not be disappointed.The movie seemed 1.5 hours long - the acting was superb. In truth the re- use of actors in different roles was a bit trying at times but it added to the vive difference.This movie does not assault you like apocalypse now or saving private ryan but the quality of the storyline and the actors is very impactfulIf you do not like this movie after 10 minutes then stop watching - otherwise enjoy a modern great,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's a good idea.,"It's a good idea. Unfortunately, due to the length of the film, the transition is rigid. The relationship between the six characters in the story is based on memory and guess.

I was more than rewarded for an amazing story about life and time and mortality. Itis a film that has the ability to touch everyone of all ages yet it isn't childish or banal. It is a film that looks into the eyes of human existence and tries to give an answer that ties us all together with a sense of our lives beyond our lives.Not as a exercise of a form of spirituality but as casual events of how our lives move forward based upon those we have known and those we will know.This film should have a much greater profile as I would even put it ahead of the first Matrix movie for originality and depth.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Revolutionary Filmmaking!,"The film, Cloud Atlas, was a bold undertaking and it delivered. It succeeded in the areas that count the most and it did so without comprising the underlying philosophical message driving this insightful work. The film is not responsible for the task of changing our view of the power of love, nor adding value to cerebral expressions, nor the promotion of compassionate thinking , nor the importance of selfless deeds, nor personal sacrifice. In addition, your average garden-variety film critic, who specializes in defining what will meet the current criterion of popular entertainment and not what satisfies the timeless criterion of what stands to make a positive difference in the world around us, will most likely underrate this thought-provoking call-to- action to live life with a higher awareness of our individual impact on each other now and in the future. As a sidebar, the 102 million dollars invested, which is only an objective representation of employed human talents, in this film is testament to what the film promotes which is, the cost of our actions may seem incredibly high in the here and now but over time will yield immeasurable profits in the world around us in ways that cannot be measured.

"Epic Movie, Just short of Masterpiece","Cloud Atlas. It takes a lot for me to get inspired about a film and to write a review. You've accomplished that much and I thank you. Forget everything you've heard about this film from critics or whoever.All their lives are connected as ours. After the movie let out, we went to a restaurant in our home town 20 miles from the theater and met a middle aged couple who were at that same restaurant, who had just gotten out of the movie. Crazy Stuff and proves this movies relates to all of our lives.Cloud Atlas is a modern day epic, that ties in the lives individuals reincarnated in different time periods. We follow the lives of an sick American who boards a ship to get cured of a disease and befriends a stowaway slave as they journey back to the US, A gay composer who works writing music for an old composer unable to write anymore. We follow a news reporter on a breakthrough discovery about corruption in energy, and a writer who must go into hiding in an retirement home to escape debtors after him. Finally this film takes us to a Korean future, where we follow a waitress who falls in love and could change life forever, in a Blade Runner esque utopia. Finally after the fall of civilization, something out of the dark ages, we follow the lives of a goat herder as he encounters other beings that change his world. And yes I am still talking about the same movie lol, The cinematography was beautiful on this film. The world the Wachowski brothers have made is a rich deep world, that you feel entrenched in and fall in love with it. The story was well written though if the film was a little longer and connected the stories better this would be a 10/10 for me. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry's acting was good in this film. With so many roles its hard to pick apart their acting. Ben Wishaw's and Jim Brodbent's highlighted the film with the best performances. The music was top notch, some of it composed by Tom Tyker and special effects were some of the best I've see ever. The themes of reincarnation, karma and so many other themes beautiful tie this film to our lives.This movie is not something you can see once. To fully take in the symbolism, plot and characters you'll need a second viewing experience. And I'm OK with that. Because I believe years from now people will look at this film and remember it like a blade runner, or whatever movie it is.Slightly flawed but overall amazing movie.

Atlas,"There are 6 in this movie! Plot lines, each of which is intertwined with the other, influencing the future of people and nations, according to the author's plan. The director managed to clearly show the impact of our actions on the future, but the film lasts so long that you will want to sleep, and there is so little action in the film that it cannot keep the viewer near the screen.The director introduces us to the main idea of the film in 9600 seconds - everything we do reflects on our ancestors or even on the whole of humanity. However, such a thought could be conveyed in a shorter period of time. And the obvious consequences of the actions of some heroes cannot be observed, the consequence is an extra storyline that bores viewers.This movie may appeal, but not to those who expect colorful scenes or explosions from the film, who like short films. The director needs to learn how to introduce the audience to his idea in a shorter period of time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Oh My, This Is Just Not a Very Good Film","""Cloud Atlas"" the novel struck me when I read it as the kind of book that would be pretty much unfilmable, and seeing this hot mess of an adaptation has not changed my mind.How to explain ""Cloud Atlas?"" Several stories set over different time periods -- the oldest set in the mid-19th century, the latest set in an apocalyptic future -- are connected through works of art, mostly of the written word, created in each that are then consumed by characters in the other stories. For those of you who remember freshman English, the plot is much more important than the story. This is a book about big themes, not individual characters. It's a grand thing to read, and one of the best books I've read in recent memory.The movie boldly tries to be faithful to the book, which is an admirable ambition but also is its failing. There's simply too much to get through, and the film spends more time on telling the stories than developing the themes. It makes a valiant effort to include all the connections the book does, and I actually quite liked the end, which does bring everything together rather nicely, but I'd given up on the movie by then, which comes at you like a never-ending assortment of random scenes.A conceit the movie explores which wasn't available as an option for the book is having the same actors play various characters throughout the film. It's a good way to literally link the stories to one another. However, it just doesn't work. It's like a variation on ""Around the World in 80 Days,"" where you're so distracted by trying to identify the actors that you forget to pay attention to the movie. It doesn't help that the makeup is rather awful, and actors like Tom Hanks, Hugh Grant and Halle Berry look noticeably uncomfortable under the heaps of prosthetics they're asked to wear. Some of Hanks' makeup looks as outrageous as that to be found in the ""Austin Powers"" movies, with the major difference being that the makeup in those films was played for gags, whereas we're supposed to take the ""Cloud Atlas"" makeup straight.I'm fairly curmudgeonly when it comes to giving movies kudos for ambition alone. If you're going to take on something as exceptional as ""Cloud Atlas,"" do it right or all you've succeeded in doing is ruining it.Grade: C",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just walk through the door,"Let me start by saying I truly enjoyed The Matrix films, and was for this reason super excited by Cloud Atlas. As for the movie itself, before seeing it I watched trailers and read articles, none of it prepared me for the movie. It is not perfect, but i will not even talk about those points. This movie is what happens when big Hollywood money is put to good use. This movie is so much greater than the sum of its parts. Do not examine the run time, or make up, or violence, or story as things to pick a part or study. I cannot stress this enough; walk through the door and let this movie consume you, and I believe it will effect each person in a unique way if you let it. This movie made me remember why I love films, and directors who do not try to make perfect films, but try to make an experience, and the three directors of Cloud Atlas have made one hell of an emotional experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I Know I Know the True True,"Movies like this don't come around very often. In the same vein as such movies as The Fountain and Tree of Life, Cloud Atlas explores themes of death, life, and the universe. This is pretty heavy stuff that a lot of people may feel iffy about seeing. However, if you were on the fence, or planning to see it, or planning not to see it, you should go see this movie.The basic plot is this: There are six different stories the movie follows, each taking place in different points in history (two in the future). The multitude of characters are played only by a handful of actors, in order to portray how we are following the same set of souls through many different lifetimes. The film cuts back and forth between the stories as they make their way to an emotional climax. All of the segments are connected in one way or another, be it through ideas that characters have, music, or the belief in something more.Some of the segments are a little dull, most notably the one that takes place in the earliest time period about a slave trader who ends up befriending a slave on the ship ride back to the States. For some reason this one just doesn't seem to have the emotional connectedness as the rest of them do. The great stories are the tale of two gay lovers in the 1930s, the story of a Chosen One in the future, and the story of a villager in a post apocalyptic distant future. The other two stories are one of a woman reporter in the 70s and a washed up publisher in the year 2012.The film is directed by three people, the Wachowskis who directed the Okay Matrix Trilogy and Tom Tykwer who directed Run Lola Run. The Wachowskis directed the story about the slave trader and the two set in the future, while Tykwer directed the stories of the lovers, the reporter, and the publisher. They all come together quite nicely and each time the film cuts back and forth the parallel stories compliment and heighten the meaning of the others.The acting is fantastic from the main cast. Tom Hanks is best as the role of the tribesman in the far distant future, but also shines as an extremely angry writer in the 2012 storyline and as the sketchy doctor in the slave trader's story. Halle Barry's main role comes as Luisa Rey in the 70s story about a cover-up involving alternate energy. She is also great as one of the last remnants of a highly advanced society in the post apocalyptic story. Jim Broadbent plays the down and out publisher in the 2012 story, but he really shines as the old and cruel composer in the 1930s story who forces his amanuensis to either publish the Cloud Atlas suite under the old composer's name or risk being found out as a homosexual.Which brings me to the music, composed by director Tykwer, John Klimek, and Reinhold Heil. Instead of trying to come up with something that is catchy and simplistic for the Cloud Atlas music that links the stories together, the piece is a grandiose classical movement, and the rest of the score is as interesting and beautiful.Despite what you may have heard Cloud Atlas is quite clear cut, assuming that you pay attention. In fact sometimes it becomes a little too heavy handed, and the dialogue is sometimes extremely clunky, but that doesn't distract from the beauty and majesty of the movie too much. My only wish is that they would have spent more time on the two stories set in the future, as these proved to be the most fantastical, exciting, and important. This is a movie that needs to be seen by anyone who enjoys intelligent, heartfelt and mesmerizing art.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A great achievement in filmmaking,"In all the years I've loved and enjoyed movies, one thing that has become consistent with the current trend of filmmaking is the lack of passion. We see tons of movies all the time that simply wish to make money and bore us with their product tie-ins in tow. But Cloud Atlas, thankfully, bucks that trend.It is only fitting that a wonderful group of talented individuals congregated to make this film, beginning with the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer. Despite their two different viewpoints of filmmaking, combined to make a consistently beautiful piece of film that flows as perfectly as time itself. Never once did this film feel like a three-hour epic, much in the same way one can watch Magnolia and never feel like your time has been intruded upon. While the whole idea of connectivity beckons like any edict from a far eastern religion, it is done so in a way that allows us to see the obvious connections without noticing the lesser ones (staying for the credits certainly helped with that, though I wished they hadn't revealed those connections). Some might think the $100 million price tag is a bit much for a rather dangerous ""art"" film, I think the crew managed it quite well considering so many big movies need $150+ just to pay for the sound and visual effects. It comes as no surprise to me that X Filme was the primary production company, for the European filmmaking mindset (which isn't totally concerned with money) was far more suited for this production. I'm sure many will call it a failure due to the many years it will take to recoup the money, but sometimes, art needs to appreciate in order to make its money.Cloud Atlas wasn't perfect, but the problems were purely nominal. I'm talking about the make-up, which was a no win situation from the beginning. You just can't make someone Caucasian look like a real Asian, and vice versa. I don't know, perhaps it would have been better to not change their appearance at all, possibly adding another layer of connectivity that is only obvious to the audience, a bit of dramatic irony so to speak. Either way, I was more than happy with the end product.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Powerful,"I'm not sure what I expected from Cloud Atlas except for its lengthy running time but whatever they were they were excelled. Cloud Atlas is a truly moving and unique experience. The film follows several different story lines over a very long time period that are somehow connected and affect each other.Like many films of a similar nature some story lines work more than others depending on how they engage you and how they are executed. The most powerful and emotionally resonant for me were the Sonmi 451 storyline which just blew me away and the one concerning the closeted gay composer. All had great moments and were impressive for different reasons in their own rights. As for the performances Tom Hanks is well enough but his multiple roles and extreme differences are a lot to pull off and he does well enough with them. More impressive is Halle Berry who has less to do in the film but reminds you why she won that academy award by giving a solid variety of different performances. My favorite performance of the movie was from Doona Bae an extremely talented actress most powerful as Sonmi 451 , I also really liked the sexy and talented Jim Sturgess in that storyline as well as well as the one in which he plays an ill writer. Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Jim Broadbent and Hugh Grant, yes Hugh Grant are rather good as well. The only performance I wasn't huge on was that of Hugo Weaving. He's been way better in other films but never very good in my opinion. But at this point he's more of a staple of The Wachowskis. And speaking of them and the films direction the Wachowskis started off really solidly with the noirish thriller Bound and followed that up with the first accomplished Matrix film but ever since than it's been a mixed bag. This is without a doubt the grandest and most ambitious film they've ever done and thats saying something and it's also their most solid feature since the first Matrix but it's far from flawless the bits directed by them are mostly good but their are a few questionable choices here and there which make you feel the films length. The same goes for Tom Twyker who had an amazing debut with Run Lola Run but hasn't followed it up with much his bits are good here as well and he does fare a bit better in some aspects but the film does need a bit of fine tuning. The spfx are amazing as expected especially considering the films smallish budget for something of this magnitude and I have to give extra credit to the films different age and character make ups they are truly incredible. All in all it's a really solid experience some moments are better than others but the films underlying message is inspired and unforgettable. it's without a doubt the bravest, most ambitious film I've seen this year and one of the best. 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Cloud Atlas set the bar far too high,"A mind-numbing, philosophically-challenging movie that wants to achieve too much with its complex, erratic plot-line. Intertwining five different stories, Cloud Atlas ponders many intriguing topics, such as reincarnation, determinism, faith, metamorphosis, and the way people's lives in different eras combine and form history as we know it. While though-provoking and engaging, the film doesn't necessarily arrive at a conclusion that is satisfactory enough for the audiences.Even though - through its most Hollywood-like ending - Cloud Atlas tries to answer all the question stated in its over-complicated mash-up of interconnected tales, the manner in which it philosophizes might sound too superficial at times. It's safe to say that the movie purposefully wants to drag the viewers into its prodigious, unfathomable universe with an especially incoherent storyline (still, connecting all the dots by oneself gives great amount of pleasure). Furthermore, it's a rather weighty mixture of genres, all wrapped up in a neat package of astounding visual effects and eye-popping landscapes.Surprisingly, the same actors play unevenly in various segments, and the blame is on the directors' side (there is a distinction between the way all the parts are directed and it's significant to note that there is a visible difference in the filmmakers' styles). Cloud Atlas is an epic film, but in that case it's not a strong and authentic compliment. Its premise is undeniably enormous and smashing, but the substance calls for some sure rewrites.In defense of the whole movie it's crucial to say that the book of the same name was named one of the most 'unfilmable' of all. By trying to play subconsciously on people's imagination, the picture invites us to an unknown world filled with artificial characters with too many plastic surgeries, and to a place where some stories seem too redundant and insignificant in the final evaluation. While ambitious, Cloud Atlas evaluates its themes briefly and arrives at a conclusion that's not to be grasped wholeheartedly.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Complexity walking sideways down a linear path that leads to where you were always never headed.

The pieces fit together and the picture is complete, but the image in front of you doesn't matter anymore, watching it all unfold is the joy.For me, great movies leave me feeling different afterwards. Somehow they touch my life and I am no longer who I was, even if this feeling dissolves after a few hours I can't go back to the world I was in before. I didn't feel like this after Cloud Atlas, I felt it most the way through.The film is just shy of 3 hours but you won't notice thanks to the perfect tempo and structure. You will not rest, you will not desire rest, you will saviour every scene as if it's the last. The characters are brilliant and the dialogue is varied and important. The score.

Nothing complex but leaves you wanting more,"Saw this in the cinema when it first came out 8 years ago with very high expectations and I thought it was great because it had loads of things I enjoyed in movies at the time. But in the back of my mind I knew I didn't fully understand it so I always wanted to watch it again someday. So upon finishing the movie, gathering my thoughts around it, reading some of the other interviews and forums, I realized that there is no incredibly deep meaning or an indecipherable plot. It's just six separate short stories from different times and places that have small connections in various ways. You watch each of them as they come and enjoy a 3-hour-adventure. All the stories are engaging with nice character developments and thought-provoking plots. One thing I really enjoyed about this movie is that, it leaves you wanting more somehow even though its 3 hours.6 short stories stretching from 1800s to 2100s.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Timeless Masterpiece...,"A a modern cult classic & masterpiece of a film that depicts the endurance of the human spirit throughout several points in time (past, present & future), spanning hundreds (maybe even thousands) of years, focusing on several different characters who have been shaped by the lives of one another in some way.
Cloud Atlas is one of the most moving, impactful films I've ever seen - genuinely helping me out of a depression at one of the deepest, darkest times in my life - with a message of hope & reassurance.
No matter how insignificant you may feel you are, even if it is simply a drop in an ocean, Cloud Atlas reminds you of one thing: ""what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?"" so together, we can shape our destiny.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A compilation of separate moments within various people's lives intertwined by reincarnation and most importantly the viewer's own interpretation and imagination.,"Let's start with something important namely respecting people's opinions. I know most people on- or offline despise this movie, mostly because it was too long or it was too convoluted. If you are one of these people I would like to say that I respect your opinion and I would like to ask you to respect mine. In the end movie reviews, good or bad, are just people sharing their opinions within a network of movie lovers.Cloud Atlas is a movie that is focused on various peoples within the past, present and distant future. These peoples are reincarnations of themselves experiencing events that are mostly different with slight recurring themes. As aforementioned this movie can be compared to a compilation of stories written by a writer that is using certain custom themes to reflect his own personality. Personally I think that this aspect of the movie should have been explained better or at least emphasized at the start of the movie. The lack of this explanation made this movie look like a plot driven story creating expectations for a big revelation at the end. Even though there is a plot, like most movies, it isn't the focus of the story. I perceived the story as a character study focusing on different events throughout time and space. Where past events are recurring in the future and how different characters, but the same person, make certain decisions.The acting is good as expected from Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving and Jim Broadbent; however I do have to admit that it felt a bit strange seeing the same actors wearing masks to change their appearances. The idea is interesting but the execution wasn't done right, to see Hugo weaving in drag or as an Asian really pushed the limits of my suspense of disbelieve. But apart from that the actors did a good job in portraying the world and their emotions.Music wasn't that special it was okay and it succeeded in creating the right atmosphere.Atmosphere is essential in all movies and I personally think that the Wachowski brothers have made a movie that oozed atmosphere. Every moment had its own color and feel that complimented the stories. The worlds were beautiful with a rich culture and much detail. I especially liked the language that was used in the future.In my honest opinion Hollywood is making a lot of movies these days that is following a fixed overused pattern. A pattern that has been considered the standard and when you deviate from this standard you'll be either loved or hated. So if you want to watch this movie please forget the standard and consider this movie as an art movie with many symbolisms and openness for you to interpret as a viewer (much like the movies Mister Nobody or Holy Motors). Please have an open mind, no expectations, and try to be invested in all the stories, not just one, because then you'll see how good this movie truly is.Most people are not going to like this, but I'm giving this movie a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Most Underrated Movie of All Time,"This movie's only flaw is that it far overestimated the general movie-going public's intelligence to figure out a complex plot, and not be spoon-fed a generic rehashed plot. Unfortunately, the dim and ADD-ridden masses just saw six separate movies in one long 3 hour movie, completely missing the overarching story. The fact that this movie was not nominated for Best Picture is a crime. In a world of bottom-line-driven cinematic-safe-bets, this should have been heralded for it's bold foray into the unknown! Instead of congratulating the lesser films for their bland and easily forgotten contributions to cinema history, they should have drawn attention to such a bold and refreshingly creative movie, rewarding it for defying the mind-numbing pixarification of American movies.It's so sad to see such a beautiful film, that moved me to verge of tears twice, disappear into time without the recognition it deserves or rewarding it's contributors.Disgustingly, this is the fast food, Michael Bay world we live in.

At Last.......2012's Most Ambitious Film!,"Before delving into my review of the film, I must say there need to be more movies made like Cloud Atlas. There need to be more intelligent and thought-provoking films being made. That being said, this is a film that's hardly seen on-screen, and the box office failure is evident of that. But one can respect the grand, ambitious project the Wachowski's siblings made. Despite losing what exactly was going on at times, I kept on getting more and more involved in the film. I loved the scope and style of it as well as the themes being conveyed.The Wachowski Siblings directed a film that has many things going on. It's essentially a story that weaves together the past, present, and future and how each event is somehow connected with each other. That being said, there is no use trying to describe the plot. But there are religious themes at play here, especially when it comes to reincarnation.The acting in this film is brilliant and everyone is on top of their game. Tom Hanks did a wonderful job and shows off a wide range of acting skills. Halle Berry, who I generally dislike, managed to impress me. Jim Broadbent is amazing and pulled off some extraordinary skills. Hugo Weaving is just good at being a bad guy. Jim Sturgess was very good as well. Everyone pulled off a great feat of playing multiple characters very well in this film.Overall, this is probably the most ambitious film ever made. I'm sad to see how it failed at the box office. But this one story that is told very well on the big screen and it's backed up by a grand scope, impressive visuals, superb acting, and impressive directing. I can see why this film would be so decisive, but it shouldn't be. An amazing film with open-minded concepts. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An exercise in indulgence.,"It feels like an extended episode of The League of Gentlemen. Watch ann episode of thatafterwards (or before) for reference. To say the siblings were experimenting with everything would be an understatement but how they got these people in this film is still a mystery (as much as is the ""plot""). It's been over a decade so I thought I'd give it another try. Tom Hanks' performance is bizarre. He is a comedian but the joke is on the makeup department; his melted looking face is clown horror pantomime; and we, the audience, are waiting for the sketch to end. It does, but then starts again in some other parallel, Harry Potter esque universe, we wish we could awaken from. That being said, watch it, but not as a fictional movie, but as a chapter in the Warchowski siblings pocketbook/diary, one that toys with our sympathies as much as our patience. The budget was obviously Matrix esque, but like those sequels, it falls short if it's original premise. Stream it somewhere, they need that budget back.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Flawed grand-scale story telling.,"Six separate stories taking place in six vastly different time periods and six varying locations, yet thematically and spiritually linked; a group of actors playing a bunch of different characters regardless of age, race or sex; genres covered include futuristic sci-fi, journalistic thriller, slapstick comedy, period drama, apocalyptic adventure and poetic melodrama; 172 minutes long. It's safe to say that Cloud Atlas is not your usual mainstream epic. Adapted from David Mitchell's acclaimed novel by the Wachowski siblings (The Matrix) and Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) - all three of whom also direct - this is an ambitious, intriguing and commendable motion picture that is undoubtedly best to experience on the big screen. Visually sumptuous - whether stuck on a boat in the mid 1800's or flying around in Neo Seoul in the 22nd century - and boasting an amazing sound mix, a home viewing won't be able to do it justice. It's a shame then, that there are also glaring faults that are hard to shake off. Most notable is the choice to push the boundaries of which actors play which characters; whether it's purely because of bad make-up (Hugo Weaving and Hugh Grant portraying Asians just doesn't fly) or due to serious miscasting (Tom Hanks as a cockney thug), it's often distracting and a huge miscalculation on behalf of the creative team. The lack of a powerful ending also diminishes the overall oomph of Cloud Atlas, yet it remains a recommendable piece of grand-scale story telling that is rarely seen in cinemas today.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Ambitious, If Complex","Cloud Atlas is a visually stunning and audacious film that definitely delivers on many fronts. The movie's ambitious narrative, weaving together multiple timelines and characters, is both daring and impressive. The cinematography is breathtaking, with each story thread meticulously crafted to stand out while contributing to the overall mosaic of the film. The performances are uniformly strong, with a talented ensemble cast bringing depth and nuance to their roles, making the interconnected stories feel vibrant and engaging.However, the film isn't without its flaws. The complex plot can be genuinely confusing at times, and keeping track of the various storylines requires a lot of attention and patience. The length of the film also becomes a bit of a hurdle, with its nearly three-hour runtime feeling somewhat drawn out. At times, the narrative seems to struggle with pacing, causing some segments to drag and losing momentum in the process.Despite these challenges, Cloud Atlas is worth the watch for its bold storytelling and striking visuals. It may not be an easy film to follow or digest in one sitting, but for those who appreciate a cinematic experience that pushes boundaries, it offers a rewarding journey. The film's ambition and artistry make it a compelling watch, even if it occasionally gets tangled in its own complexity.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hate it or Love it, this movie bounds to get some reaction out of its viewer.This is not popcorn cinema where you watch a film along with other tasks you may perform.

Good visualisation of a great book.,"Yesterday I finally got around to see Cloud Atlas. I was with my girlfriend who hadn't read the book.Visually speaking the cinematographers did a great job: camera, photography, VFX and especially acting is top notch. And discovering which actor is which under such heavy (and finely done) make up in the different stories adds to the enjoyment of the movie.But unfortunately this isn't enough to make the movie great and enjoyable as the book. The main problem lies in the fact that the stories, in the book, are secondary. The main aspect is the literary virtuosism with which of the story is narrated and written: the plot, the language and the style of each one is what really shines in the book: the birthmark the intertweening stories are just expedients to a refined display of literary power.The fact that what makes the book inerhently great couldn't be translated as a movie, was my big worry when I heard about a film to be made. The writers and directors had to fall back on the stories as the underlying glue. And the result falls short: the different stories are compressed, and the continuity links between them are sometimes just one unfocused short line of dialogue, likely to be missed (and the fast editing doesn't help if you're trying to follow). The filmmakers, because of the limitations of the medium, have decided to tell and not really show the message of the film, which unfortunately makes it preachy and new-age flavoured.Given the starting material probably this is the best possible film adaptation of the book, unfortunately it isn't enough to make a great film. My advice is to read the book and watch the movie afterwards so you are able to fill in the (many) blanks while enjoying the great visual side of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Magnificent,"Cloud Atlas is possibly one of the trickiest movies to review. Here is a case of either you ""get it"" or not. It is by no means a typical drama. Here is a movie that encompasses so much of the emotional spectrum, transcending the very genre of what a movie is meant to be like.The Wachowskis (creators of the Matrix Trilogy) deliver yet another thinking man's mind bomb via this narratively faithful but structurally different adaptation of David Mitchell's award winning novel. In the novel, each of the 6 interconnected stories are presented as a tale within a tale; the first story taking place in 18th century is presented as a lost diary that the protagonist of the second story finds. Likewise the second story is presented as a series of letters read by a supporting character in the 3rd story. What the Wachowski siblings do instead is present the stories as running parallel to each other, joined by thematic similarities within their narrative. Themes of love, loss, hope, despair, revelation, rebellion, defeat and triumph connect the scenes from each story which in themselves influence on another.Yes, those initiated to non-sequential storytelling would be left lost. Each story follows a set genre style too. At one moment we follow a 19th century lawyer named Adam Ewing on his journey home to england from America, his fateful choice involving a stowaway slave.. The next we hop to 1936 as Robert Frobisher, a bisexual aspiring musician starts working on his masterpiece, the ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"" while his mentor seeks to claim credit for it. Then we get a great tribute to pulp spy thrillers in 70s and see the exploits of reporter Luisa Rey as she tries to uncover a conspiracy involving nuclear research and runs into some people seeking to silence her. Punctuating these more serious stories is the present day comedic ordeal of elderly Michael Cavendish as he is tricked into ""incarceration"" at a spartan nursing home and how he continually tries to find a way to escape.From the present to the far future, a clone slave named Somni bears witness to untold horrors in a so called Utopian world, thus fueling a rebel movement through the power of the media. And finally, during earth's last days, an era where cannibals rule the land, one unlikely couple seeks to escape their fate.For fans of the Wachowskis' work, there are many similarities with this and the Matrix. In all those stories, the central theme involves an imposed restriction and how an individual tries to break out from that restriction. Their act of defying the status quo would echo in the years to come and live on to inspire other such acts. Similar scenes are thus thematically juxtaposed and infused with bits of philosophy, not unlike The Matrix trilogy. Slavery, a desire for the truth, breaking free, futile rebellion, defeat but ultimately vindication. That similarity is most apparent in the Somni story, which could just as well be ""The Matrix ver 2.0"". With startling special effects, tremendous amount of thought which went into replicating the environments, tone, clothing and designs of each unique time period.The all star cast brings their ""A"" game to screen delivering award winning performances. Even though we have so many characters to follow, the emotional connection is formed almost immediately. Adding an element of fun to this movie is the ongoing game of ""guess that face"", as the actors play multiple roles across the various time periods. Sometimes they even play against type and against gender. Accompanying this time spanning epic is a emotionally powerful music score by Tom Tykwer, Johnny Kilmek and Reinold Heil. It is a simple melody which, like the movie, is performed in a variety of styles that matches the tone and time period of the scene.Cloud Atlas will draw you in and thrill you as much as baffle you. One can only hope that the DVD or blu-ray release comes with both this ingeniously structured theatrical cut and ""regular cut"" which places the stories in chronological order (for those who can't follow flashback/flashforwards). With all the spectacle of a big budget blockbuster and the overall feel of a complex artsy film, Cloud Atlas is ambitious in challenging the norms of filmaking. Hopefully, its success will inspire generations to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Unique, special and simply wonderful!","There are so many elements to this movie that could have steered it off course, so many story lines that could have gone wrong. In fact, they blend together so beautifully that I felt I was a part of something so special and so unique. I think that in years to come, this will be praised as the seminal movie on which many others would be judged. It is so special it cannot really have a genre. From the evil Dr Goose, to the touching love story between Robert Frobisher and Rufus Sixsmith, to the realisation of Somni-451 on seeing how her 'sisters' are used as protein after being killed with a smile. The sacrifice made by Sumni is almost a futuristic crucifixion and Doona Rae played this part so beautifully, so tenderly, it really was heart wrenching. There are so many outstanding performances it's hard to pick one that truly stands out as all the characters were so outstanding, but I suppose I should say that Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent and Doona Rae really glued to movie together, but in saying that, Halle Berry was also outstanding, as was Hugo Weaving, Ben Whishaw and James D'Arcy.

Excellent film that surprised me by its quality and shocked me with its intelligence.,"I had no knowledge of Cloud Atlas until the winter of 2013 when I read a story in The New Yorker magazine about the film. The article piqued my interest but since it was an older issue I had already missed the release date and the movie was no longer playing in theaters. While at the beach this summer and with nothing else to do on a rainy day, I watched it out of boredom. Words that described how I felt when it was over included amazement,joy,and utter fascination. I can't remember when I last saw such a compelling and thought-provoking movie. I was mesmerized for the near 3 hour running time and watched it again the next day just to hear the incredible lines and experience again the flow of the stories. This is movie-making at its best and will transport you to other times and places. Great story (ies), superb acting, wonderful music, amazing make-up and sets, etc., etc. Cloud Atlas has it all. The mark of a good film, in my humble opinion, is its ability to stick with the viewer when it's over and make them think about the story. However, a great film induces thoughts that go beyond the story. Great films will motivate the viewer to extrapolate themes and characterizations embedded in the film to other aspects of their life. They'll make you apply those themes to your own existence. Cloud Atlas did that for me. I'll never forget it!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I think this directly correlates with the problems in tone. The movie tells multiple stories, ones that span across centuries. The movie just has a hard time, keeping a solid tone. From one second you will go from a gunfight or an ax battle, then to a a character ascending to some kind of spiritual order. Honestly though the biggest problem in the messages the movie wants to give are of many, but the main point simply does not carry too much weight. There will also be times when you wonder if there are any reasons why certain scenes will be taking place, and if they have a a deeper meaning, few times with no answer.

A Magical Film & brilliantly edited,"'Cloud Atlas' - watched the DVD this weekend and was just stunned by the incredibly beautiful theme, the outstanding acting and sets, and the profound passion and scope of the story. A Truly unique and challenging and amazing film. Just gave it the first 10 I ever ranked a film on IMDb. 'The Matrix' is being used to teach philosophy in some colleges now - is this just a trick to catch young students attention? Or is using the media to posit philosophical points to large audiences a new idea? No, this is not the first time that has been done - but Cloud Atlas certainly puts the philosophy out front, and extremely well done visually and thematically. After watching 'Cloud Atlas' for the second time this week, the overwhelming core philosophy is karma and the Golden Rule, and very close to ‪Buddhist‬ ‪philosophy‬. ""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future."" ""Fear, belief, love; phenomena that determine the course of our lives. These forces begin long before we are born and continue after we perish."" And Tom Hanks, once again, shows the incredible range of his skills. A Magical Film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"excellent, but not a masterpiece","Cloud Atlas is one of the movies that is almost on par with its literary template. Unfortunately, due to six loosely connected stories, there were cuts to be made in order to bring them to the screen. This is felt during the movie, even if you haven't read the book.Overall, Cloud Atlas is a great experience, both visually and as a story which is rather complicated to be retold. I was not able to sense the broader philosophical context which has been mentioned by the authors during the movie's promotion.What i appreciated is a happy ending, despite the fact that it is not in line with the original story.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why is Tom Hanks talking like a toddler?,"Yeah, why are people of the future talking like cave-men? I mean, first you just want to laugh at it, but over time it gets REALLY annoying. It feels like they are just improvising toddler-talk. My 2 year-old talks better English than that, and he's Norwegian. Other than the horrible dialogue which will no doubt make you cry of agony, this movie made no sense. The idea is good, but the execution is just.. wow.. so bad. Lots of effects, a-list celebrities, but really, half way through the movie you start thinking ""hm, I wonder how they'll wrap all this up.."", then the movie suddenly ends, and you're like ""oh, they didn't.. well that's just great, 2.5 hours wasted with toddler-talking and face-painted old people"". At least if you went to work in a kindergarten, you'd get paid.This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've seen Sharknado, which was more plausible. Really, just such a waste of funds. So bad. I don't know how else to put it. It's just, horrible, bad, awful, the worst piece of crap ever filmed. I hate it.And to all people who says this is the best movie of the century, I mean, we're all allowed to have different opinions, but I'd really go get a health-check. Yeah..

Easily the most amazing piece of film-making in recent times,"Was searching for ""psychological science fiction"" movies in google, when I stumbled upon this gem by the Wachowskis. The first 10 minutes got my attention and I immediately realized (at the 11th minute) that this is one of those movies which I will see again and again. It is difficult for me to say that I understood the film completely, but you do not always have to understand a movie to admire it (this is not a math test), sometimes the emotions that you go through and how the film makes you feel can make you a crazy and ardent fan. I respect and adore films which present a new thought process especially about the 'dharma', 'karma' and 're-incarnation' that spans centuries. This is one such film.As you might have seen the character names listed in IMDb, the same actors are re-casted as different characters in 6 different periods of time (whether or not the same person re-incarnates again repeatedly is entirely upto the viewers perspective). It is impossible to identify some of the actors in their characters, till the credits roll in the end. As for the performances in the film, everyone has given their heart and soul - that much I can say Tom Hanks, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving and the lot. The complexity, length, multitude of story lines and dynamic editing are stupendous and is one of the best movie watching experiences in the last couple of decades. (Try to watch with headphones if possible to enjoy the nuances in background score).I do not wish to reveal much but this movie has got everything (science fiction, drama, history, spirituality, romance (straight and gay), revolution, soul, god, battle, humour, satire. I've already seen the film 3 times and each time it was a totally different experience and each time I discovered something new about the film (and about myself). I will definitely see it more number of times.You will not regret seeing this film, even if you don't understand it.Cheers",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wonderful movie.,"This is an absolutely beautiful movie. If at the beginning it can be a bit confusing, mainly because there are several stories with different time-lines and with different characters yet the same actors, soon it becomes easy to follow and feel each story and main characters.One of my favourite features of this story about how one soul lives so different lives, is that as stories change the same actor would be a character of a different gender, different race and absolutely different personality yet these stories and characters would be so united.Another excellent feature (among many others) of this movie in music. Brilliant work!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cloud Atlas transcends linearity to present an ambitious alignment of souls.,"A raindrop. Manifesting its elliptical shape at the edge of its existence. Building up water, the stream of life to which fauna and flora live by. Its heavy weight causing the drop to depart from the material that transpired it. Some drops smash onto the dry ground, absorbing its essence. Forgotten. Others collide with bodies of water, producing a profound rippling effect that contributes to the volumetric space of its whole. ""No matter what you do it will never amount to anything but a single drop in a limitless ocean"", highlighting the insignificance of one mere contribution to a greater action. ""What is an ocean but a multitude of drops"". Mitchell's original novel, complexities and all, describes it himself as a ""pointillist mosaic"". Carefully arranged dots or fragments orchestrated to comprise a monumental piece.Cloud Atlas is the same conceptual thinking through a literary method. Minuscule lives can impact one another across time itself. Past, present and future. An antagonistic killer moulded into a heroic saviour through reincarnation, where one single action can ripple across infinity to inspire a revolution for the masses. An American lawyer documenting his parasitical journey across the Pacific in 1849, only to be read by an aspiring English composer in 1936 whom composes his own masterpiece, that is then tracked down in 1973 by a journalist whom exposes a conspiracy to create a nuclear catastrophe during an energy crisis, to which is then written into a manuscript and read by an ageing publisher whom accidentally commits himself to a nursing home and attempts to flee in 2012, a scenario that is produced as a film and quoted by human clones in 2144 which inspires a revolution against a dystopian authority, cementing a ""fabricant"" as a deity in 2321 in which her recorded testimony now acts as sacred text for tribespeople. And, breathe...!The Wachowskis and Tykwer attempt to adapt, what many consider is, an ""unfilmable"" book. A novel so rich in thematic depth, narrative complexity and imaginative tonalities that it could not possibly function as a cohesive feature. Yet, here we are. Independently funded, four years of development and arguably the most ambitious sci-fi extravaganza ever committed to celluloid. It's an impossibly astonishing product that is equally flawed as it is beautiful. An orchestration of meticulous narrative manipulation that just cannot be comprehended in an initial or subsequent viewing. Its composition consists of six short stories, harnessing differing tones, characters and worlds. Each piece works as a functional strand of dramatic storytelling. But, insert Berner's near-impossible task of editing these stories to create one three-hour behemoth of totality, and Cloud Atlas becomes a mesmerising beast entirely. It categorically should not work.'The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish' and 'An Orison of Sonmi-451' tonally are undeniably different, more often than not clashing with each other to create an inconsistent pace. A light comedy escapade interwoven with a sci-fi revolutionary blockbuster, sprinkled with a blaxploitation plot and a period drama across the sea. For the initial thirty minutes, these changes in style and genres fail to resonate, as The Wachowskis attempt to introduce each story whilst interlinking then together. However, Berner somehow manages to join the narrative beats of each story and merge them as one feature. The more thrilling aspects of the various stories, including Sonmi-451 escaping her fast food imprisonment and a stow away Moriori slave proving his worth as a potential crew member, are associated together. Indicating that each tale, more often than not, follow the same narrative beats and can therefore be connected together to produce an overarching feature that does not juxtapose its own tones. It's sheer lunacy! To comprehend such a task, finalise its contents and create a cohesive product, well, it's masterful. It really is! The Wachowskis' solid direction throughout, even if some stories had far more screen time than others, meant that the thematic presence of reincarnation was maintained constantly.What assisted with this, was the recasting of the same actors in various characters. Grant started off as a reverend and finished his timeline as a savage cannibal. Hanks from a parasitical doctor to a conflicted tribesman, wobbly Irish-pirate accents and all. Berry, Weaving, Sturgess and Whishaw, to name a few, all undergoing substantial transformations to materialise the continuity of souls. Undergoing astounding makeup and costume design, forcing viewers to double take when a man would portray a female character and vice versa. The only questionable decision, was the application of eye makeup during the Neo Seoul segment, transforming white actors to become Korean characters. Personally wasn't needed, as the Unionists could've been multicultural and then devoid the controversy immediately. The decision was understandable and integral to the story, yet exerts an ethnical question mark. The other qualm, despite the overbearing tonal changes, was the dialogue in the 'Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'ryrhin' After' chapter. Extremely difficult to translate given the almost Shakespearean style and muffled grumbling, so activating subtitles is advised.Regardless, Cloud Atlas is a film with plenty of film. Six if you want to be precise. An intricate orchestration of various compositions that symbolise the impact of even the most insignificant of actions, rippling across time and space to produce something greater. It's an anomaly. An impossible feature that is just as compelling as it is tonally flawed. Yet, in an age where franchises control Hollywood, isn't it about time we supported a film with as much ambition as Cloud Atlas? For that reason alone, it gets my full support. Much like the ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"", beautifully composed like the rest of the score, it eternally haunts me. Pushing me into performing small acts of kindness that can affect the lives of others in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Refreshingly Inventive Film that Spans Generations,"Aw man, I wish I hadn't missed this film during its theatrical run. We're at a point when movie studios spend the majority of their efforts on bombastic summer blockbusters that appeal to the masses (of which, I admit, I'm a member), and it's not often we get a movie where the filmmakers really get a chance to go all out in bringing their vision to life. In my opinion, CLOUD ATLAS never really stood a chance in mainstream theaters and it's a shame to see that it grossed so low in the United States. From what I can determine, your average Joe theatergoer isn't going to invest a lot of energy into following nonlinear storytelling, especially when there are six separate stories spanning five hundred years blended together into a mosaic about reincarnation of the soul and the cyclical nature of life with themes of opposing oppression and achieving one's fate. At least, that's what I took away from this movie. I believe CLOUD ATLAS is one of those films that are open to interpretation from each member of its audience. Over the course of the film, we watch as souls move from one generation to the next and observe how the actions of one generation can drastically affect generations of the future:In 1849, an American lawyer falls ill as he crosses the Pacific Ocean and befriends a stowaway slave while under the questionable care of a doctor. In 1936, an aspiring composer accepts a position as an aid to world famous musician and quietly composes his own greatest masterpiece. In 1973, a small-time journalist discovers evidence that an oil magnate might be organizing sabotage of the nuclear energy industry and endangering innocent lives. In 2012, a publisher on the run from hoodlums believes his brother has found him sanctuary in a quaint hotel in the countryside but discovers its true sinister nature. In 2144, a fabricant (clone) used for menial work in the fast food industry of Neo-Seoul escapes from her life of servitude and is shown the horrifying truth regarding the life of fabricants. And in 2321, a man of a primitive culture in the aftermath of catastrophic global events journeys to the top of a mountain where he risks facing the Devil itself to aid a friend.The first aspect of CLOUD ATLAS one is bound to notice would be that every major actor in the film plays multiple roles. The filmmakers took this angle a step further and each actor portrays characters of various races and genders. This is where things can become a bit distracting at first. The makeup effects in the film are impressive and generally seamless, but Hugo Weaving in drag is still Hugo Weaving in drag. Hard as you might try, it's hard to ignore. Thankfully, this particular instance occurs in the only real comedic story in the bunch (""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"") so it doesn't hamper the story. Other cases don't necessarily fare as well. The 2144 tale is set in a futuristic Seoul, Korea so the characters are naturally Koreanexcept a good portion of the cast is not. I'll be honestit mostly works. It doesn't sit well for a little while but you become accustomed to it and future revisits to the movie become easier to settle in with. Some might also believe the language of the primitive islanders in the 2321 tale to be a problem. It sounds a little childish at first and it's weird hearing it spoken so earnestly by people like Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, but just like Jim Sturgess disguised as a Korean, you get used to it.Don't misunderstand me, though: these are not to be construed as problems with the film. If anything, they add flavor and I love it. And once you get past some of the oddities, this is just a really, really good movie. I love how each of the stories has their own feel and each of them ties into one another in some fashion, whether directly or indirectly. Everything here is connected, and they all share the common themes found scattered throughout the movie of rising up against the powerful and oppressive. The movie is made even more effective with some amazing casting. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, and many, many more populate the film. CLOUD ATLAS is a unique experience and you have to give each cast and crew member involved for coming together to create something so different from 99% of the rest of the movies released each year. My concern is that CLOUD ATLAS did so poorly in theaters that it might discourage directors from taking chances and providing us with content more creative than your average summer explosion-fest or screwball comedies. So, in an effort to bring about more films as inventive as CLOUD ATLAS, I encourage everyone to give it a chance. It's one of those films that are perfect for a post- viewing discussion.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Our loves are not our own, from womb to tomb...","By far my favorite book and movie combo. My favorite scene was with Robert Frobisher meets Vyvyn Ayrs, the greatest composer of all time to convince him he is worthy of becoming his amanuensis. From the beginning of that scene to the end, there was a great deal of foreshadowing what to come of this storyline. We also meet Jacosta Ayers in this scene. Beautiful movie all around.I also enjoyed Luisa Ray's story and how she transformed from the beginning to end and also Sonmi's story. Sonmi's story is one that reminds us to be bold ans take risks as you never know who your actions will impact in the future. It also reminds me of the Bible a little. Those who were there told stories of their encounter with Sonmi and the Oldens who followed Sonmi use those stories to guide their interactions, connections and thoughts thousands of years later.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

However I did watch at midnight and by a weaker movie I would have fallen asleep halfway. I wanted to see more and if an extended cut comes out I will buy it. I can't promise you will enjoy it, but a movie like Cloud Atlas should be viewed if you see film as an art form or want something unique.The movie has great cinematography and an awesome score.

"Hard to sell, hard to describe, because it's hard to reduce.","""Remarkable,"" ""Convoluted,"" ""Entertaining,"" ""Sprawling,"" ""Masterful,"" ""Transcendant,"" and ""Guaranteed to divide."" Those are the words the critics have been using about Cloud Atlas. I prefer what was said by the film's three directors, Tom Tykwer, Lana Wachoswki, and Andy Wachowski, when they premiered the six-minute first trailer: ""It's hard to sell, hard to describe, because it's hard to reduce.""Based on the highly-acclaimed (and highly-recommended) novel by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas is not one 3-hour movie much like the novel is not one 500-page book. It is actually a collection of six 30-minute movies spread across time, space, and genre. These short films have been chopped up and spliced together with interruptions and mid-sentence stops, with voice-overs carrying across multiple stories, and with connections both explicit and implicit. It is an ambitious and unusual film, but unlike other attempts to create grand scope and provoke philosophical debate, Cloud Atlas is also wonderfully fun and entertaining. Tree of Life is an attempt to interweave different eras and themes, but for all its artistic quality it is still a cure for insomnia. But Cloud Atlas' directors (creators of The Matrix and Run Lola Run) are eager to entertain, and for all the ambition driving the film it never forgets to tell a good narrative.The ambition of the project is only clearer when the cast is considered. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant are among the main cast, and every one plays at least three parts. Several of the actors, including Tom Hanks, actually play six parts; one role for each section of Cloud Atlas, playing different personalities, different races, and even different genders.In these six sections the film covers all the major genres and time periods: a dying doctor on a pacific voyage in 1849, letters from a composer to his lover in pre-war Europe, a conspiracy thriller in the 1970s, a modern-day comedy of a publisher committed to a nursing home, the future rebellion of a clone in Korea, and the post-apocalyptic survival story of a tribe living on Hawaii. Taken alone, any of these stories would be worthy films, but taken together they become part of a larger work that is offered up to the audience for their interpretation.Unlike in the book, one of my favourite sections is the earliest, the 1849 travel of Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) as he is being cared for by Dr. Henry Goose. The eccentric doctor is brought to life by Tom Hanks, and is one of the best examples in the film of how the casting adds new levels of enjoyment to the stories. Like a blockbuster adaptation of ""Where's Waldo?"" it is a lot of fun trying to spot all the famous faces hidden under the make-up. At the end of the film the credits include the answer-key with all the actors' characters showing up alongside their name, and its likely that a few will come as a surprise.Cloud Atlas is a film like The Avengers in that the people who like it and the people who don't like it will probably be saying the same thing; ""So massive,"" and ""Too massive,"" are reviews from personal taste. I've met people who hate Casablanca or The Fighter, but praise Valentine's Day for its originality, and I think those people are idiots. But that's my personal opinion. It's impossible to make a film that everyone likes, and Cloud Atlas is not for everyone. It is 3- hours, after all, and there is violence and romance alongside foul language and futuristic slang. Fans of Hugh Grant may find it difficult to see the rom-com leading man in the same light after seeing him play the warrior chief of a tribe of cannibals. But, for the other side of the audience, this film includes Hugh Grant playing the warrior chief of a tribe of cannibals! Depending on how you approach that line (exclamation point or period) might tell you if Cloud Atlas is a film you will enjoy.The best I can say is that I enjoyed it. When I wasn't enjoying the characters and their stories, I enjoyed the filmmaking. When I wasn't enjoying the filmmaking, I enjoyed the music. There was never a moment where I felt the film was dragging too long, skipping over something important, or failing to hold my attention. It is a sprawling epic in the best way, and I highly recommend giving it the opportunity to surprise you.http://charlieposts.blogspot.ca/2012/11/published-in-navigator.html",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classic Movie Experieince,"I have not read the book, but the film is utterly amazing. This is one of the few truly epic movie experiences.Cloud Atlas is bloody and visceral to the point of excess. There are a few graphic sexual scenes. I count this as a point against the film, because it was not needed and seems like pandering to the masses.Still, the theme and philosophy are incredible and motivating. I cried for about five minutes straight at one point. I've never seen a movie capture my emotions like Cloud Atlas did.The Kabuki style of gender and race roles can be weird at times, but I think the directors executed it well and plays into Cloud Atlas' theme.The separate plots don't come together all that well in showing what effect each timeline had on another, which is odd considering what a great job the script writers did at illustrating that this 'Cloud Atlas effect' is a real force in our lives.All-in-all, this movie was a tremendous philosophical success. This is the type of thing that changes lives and it needed to be made. There are few movies which operate on this scale. Its mildly disturbing, but it teaches just as much as it disturbs. I feel like I should read the book, as perhaps the movie was good only because the book was excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Life moves in infinite circles,"Many might find Cloud Atlas a daunting movie to consume. It's probably one of the most complex narratives in movie history. But it is also the movie that keeps on giving. There is so much going on, I swear it has everything. Ev-er-y-thing.Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, James D'Arcy, James Broadbent, Susan Sarandon, and Doona Bae play a variety of characters, and their descendants in a sprawling mega-story spanning many centuries. The South Pacific in 1849, Edinburgh in 1936 and 2012, San Francisco 1973, London in 2012, Neo-Seoul in 2144, and an island 106 years after an unspecified cataclysm feel the ripples of love, tragedy, hope, and imagination as souls are reincarnated with the teasing latent memories of their ancestors written in their DNA.Across their chain-linked lives Hugo Weaving plays a menacing figure representing injustice determined to maintain the status quo and prevent human transcendence. But, as Dr. Ian Malcolm once said, 'life finds a way'. Humans cannot be contained, not by governments, rules, or any kind of oppression. The drive to push our species forward will always trump all kinds of evil.The expansive story and lengthy running time will alienate casual movie-goers, and the unusual dialect in the far future timeline will either make the rest hopelessly confused or laugh childishly. I personally had no trouble understanding it. Language, like any other entity, develops or disintegrates over the years, and will especially become twisted and guttural in a world without mass media. Perhaps the haters just couldn't grasp this and decided that laughing at it was the way to endure until the credits rolled.If you like challenging movies, if you are willing to apply yourself to a rich universe and an ingenious idea I have to admit that Cloud Atlas pays you back a thousand times. Tom Twyker's score is utterly mesmerizing. Not only is it a fascinating movie to look at but it sounds heavenly. It's the music of your dreams, and the movie it threads through is filled with magical moments that will steal your heart away and stay with you forever. I just cannot recommend Cloud Atlas enough.Many have called it a failure, but I say it's a huge accomplishment. Few directors could have pulled it off, but the Wachowski's and Tom Twyker have delivered a profound epic of human life. Even the haters should admit that.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Did people see the movie and figure it must have been good but that maybe they were too stupid to understand it or something and didn't want to admit it to themselves? Guess what? Maybe they were not stupid at all. Maybe it was the movie that was stupid. I know. It occurred to me. Maybe I'm stupid. There is that possibility. Then again the mega-score is 55. Not 84.Still.

Cloud Atlas is not a normal movie.,"Cloud Atlas is by no means a normal movie. IMDb has this blurb: ""An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution."" (Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371111/) which is vaguely accurate. The story itself is more both complex and less deep at first glance than this.It's more like a collection of stories across history that feature strange interactions between them. Each story and time period has the same actors / actresses playing either complete different or characters that are somehow related to their other time period characters in some way. The decision as to which is which appears random, sometimes feeling unnecessary and not all appear in all eras / stories. The drastic changes of say, Hugo Weaving's appearance between two periods is amazing and nearly a reason to watch the movie on it's own.So, having read this so far, you might be thinking, ""But I've already seen The Fountain, why do I need to watch this?"" Well, The Fountain is an amazing movie, but it's different than this. The themes explored in this movie are nowhere near present in The Fountain, because despite the ""intertwined characters across time"" aspect, it takes a different approach. The Fountain is much more evident in it's time-spanning interactions, but perhaps Cloud Atlas takes multiple viewings to achieve this?But that doesn't mean that this isn't a great story. It very much is. There's adventure, love, humor, passion and some amazing writing, all set to spectacular scenery and a probable Academy Award for costume design. It explores multiple themes, has you caring on multiple levels, and encourages multiple viewings.The Good This movie is: 4/10 The Fountain 2/10 The Hyperion Cantos (seriously!) 1/10 Blade Runner 1/10 Mad Max 1/10 British Comedy 1/10 A bunch of other things If this doesn't sound good, I have some Jason Statham movies to recommend to you.The Bad It takes a long time to get going, you're very confused at the start. I mean a long time, more than half an hour. Some of the dialects used are difficult to understand.Overall It's rare that someone can call a movie ""beautiful"", but this is indeed just that. I will watch this movie several times throughout my life, and I suspect that over time, it will gather appreciation it deserves. 9/10 stars here.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Cloud Atlas Is Like Something You've Never Seen Before!,"This ambitious film is based off of David Michelle's best-selling novel. I cannot compare the two because I have not read the book, but from what readers of the book claim, it is really awesome. Cloud Atlas has almost every genre imaginable in it with action, adventure, mystery, romance, drama, and science fiction all incorporated. Cloud Atlas also has an amazing cast, three directors, Oscar worthy special effects, and a story like no other. I would need three more pages to explain what the movie is about, so here's what it is essentially about. Taking place in five different periods, various actors play multiple characters (one from each period) and each characters life impacts that of another character in the past, present, and or future. All of these characters act of impact trigger some sort of rebellion whether it's big or small. This sounds like it would be a lot coming at you at once, but for a 2 hour and 45 minute film it is somewhat tame. The only parts of complication are the switches from one time period to the next. However, this is necessary for the film as a whole. It is a little confusing for one minute focusing on a dying lawyer writing in his diary in 1849 and the next being in the 1970's. This is what makes the movie interesting though! The music is terrific and actor Tom Hanks and actress Halle Berry are as good as ever. This is without a doubt the most ambitious movie of the year. Cloud Atlas's ending left me speechless for a good two hours and is definitely a top 10 movie of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The main thing is this movie IS entertaining,"I believe art is an emotional argument about what is important. This time the Wachowskis set out to make my point with a wonderfully inventive mix of stories that basically have little but the emotions they elicit in common, that and the actors in them. You won't be bored, but there isn't much enlightenment here either though I can't disagree with their main two points as I saw them, that there is more to life than living and we are all interconnected such that we make our own future with every misstep or triumph.It's as if the Wachowskis were attempting to make those points with story. I'm not sure that they did but then I pretty much believed something very similar before seeing the movie. So I was left a bit disappointed. Also I'm not sure I was as comfortable with their choice of lead actors as they were, or with their choice of characters, in particular the devil-like character didn't work very well, I thought. But this is such a sprawling vehicle, nothing was all that much of a put off and I can't remember the last time I sat this long without squirming.The art work in the futuristic scenes was effective, I thought, though often somewhat derivative of sci-fi classics like Tron, Blade Runner and Soylent Green. On the other hand the scenes of tribal life seemed oddly unconvincing. But I can't really complain. In general all of the parallel stories seemed interesting and were fun to watch.

It was an excellent but complicated film,"So I can only say that I enjoyed this movie very much. I mean, it is a good movie. But I have to say that I read the book and even the book was a hard one. So, I truly liked the film because I understood everything. Though I think it would be pretty hard for someone who hasn't read the book since this movie in a good sense: is a mess. What good sense? It tells like 6 different stories at the same time and manages to do it very well. The thing is that many will feel a bit frustrated by the fact that most of the first half of the film because of the ton of information dropped directly on your head. But it is supposed to be like that, at least at the beginning but then you should to be able to get the connections and meaning of every life portrayed.As I said already, I didn't feel that much confused 'cause I read the book. Still, I was confused and it is normal. I guess people aren't really prepared to a movie this ambitious. So as far as I'm concerned there are two choices: you love it or you hate it. Still, it's a pretty great effort for an independent film and I think that, however you choose to feel about it, it's a film everyone should see and finish it.

the best movie of the year,"this movie is the best ""popular culture"" insight into the law of cause and effect I've ever seen. it not only explains that there is a connection between all sentient beings, between everything we do and how we experience world then, but also make viewer feel this connection. the movie lasts 3 hours and its not boring at all thanks to virtuous switching between different yet the same story lines. music, which is also not bad unfortunately is not clearly presented in the movie so I would recommend to listen to soundtrack then -) after first watching I was sitting silent for some hours and thinking)) would definitely advice to see this movie at least twice",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""What is any ocean but a multitude of drops?""","I haven't seen a movie that inspired me to write a comment on it for a very long time. Finally Cloud Atlas has arrived which succeeded in balancing commercial goals, technology, make-up artistry and a good/complex story with the urge to have something done with a great deal of endeavor. It's an adoption by Wachowskis based on an idea about how mistakes repeat over time and the battle between good and evil emphasizing on basic kindnesses or cruelties across lifetimes.People may criticize that there were too many messages poking the blind eye like- we are human, we are not alone, everything we do has an impact on others and on future, death is a door, we are all the same and at same value, how we live in circles, the fight between people in power and slaves etc. And yet they can find them all very simple and trivial but in fact, in the chaos that we call life makes us forget these things. In the end what movies are for if they don't move us and pinch us to remember something that is already with us. It is so funny that we think that in our time, in our ordinary lives, slavery is not a subject anymore. But every one of us is the ring of the chain as we live in a capitalist/colonialist system. So they may find this message simple but it is the naked truth.Technically, It was hard to keep track of the sequence of the story since it tells six stories in six different time periods, using a handful of actors who often play a different role, sometimes across race, age, or gender lines—in each segment. But even separate stories in it was enough to move me. Maybe a second round could help to grasp it thoroughly. Though I left the theater with light-heartedly, ruminating the movie in my head. Maybe overwhelmed of the thought what to take away from it. And the music. I wish we could hear it more.It's not an instant classic or you may not count it in top movies but it definitely has a character that does not allow you to see and forget right away.A good break amid all rom-coms and action movies. I recommend not to set the bar too high and do not wait for it makes sense and reconciles every story in it. Just watch carefully and I'm sure you will find something to take away with you.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The most Underrated film of 2012(no spoilers),"I usually don't write movie reviews. In fact this is my first on IMDb. Seeing how this movie was ignored by both critics and general public I felt I had to write something.First of all, the story was superb. And all the directors did an amazing job with the screenplay and overall editing. You will get so absorbed in the movie that the difference between time and place will come almost naturally to you.Secondly, the overall acting of the casts was nothing less than excellent. Tom hanks has probably worked his ass off portraying all the characters thrown at him. One so different from the other yet somehow similar to the core. The same goes for Halle Berry,Jim Broadbent and Hugo Weaving too.Last but not least, the music. The music was maybe not in the same class of LOTR or Titanic. Still, it was classy enough to go well with the rest of the movie.Overall, I was surprised(and somewhat disappointed) not to see any nomination in Academy Awards. It was a proper Oscar material and deserved a lot more recognition than it actually got.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Chix Chat on Film Review: Reincarnation hyper experience.,"The trailer for Cloud Atlas gave me the impression that this film was an eternal love story played out through reincarnation. Since my favorite reincarnation love story is Dead Again, I was curious to see if this story would be similar and if it would measure up to my expectations. With Tom Hanks and Halle Berry in the lead roles my expectations were high since they typically play in movies that I consider to be remarkable. I was not disappointed. This was not simply a recurring tragic or fulfilled love story, this film was nothing less than remarkable. I mentally segmented the film into three parts. The first part of the film was almost dizzying with the meandering from different points in the past, then to the future and then back to the past. During this first segment we see a menagerie of characters most of which are played by Mr. Hanks and Ms. Berry. A number of times I had to do a double take to be sure of who was playing a specific role, it was much more difficult to recognize Ms. Berry especially in her role as a medical practitioner, Mr. Hanks was always recognizable, but the makeup in all instances was transformative. I have seen characters in films that have been made up as older than they actually are but to see actors made up and actually look authentic as a different race is again remarkable. I would be remiss not to mention the special effects so I will say that the appearance of Neo Seoul was impressive, saying it makes me think of music, I digress. The action and the realization of who everyone truly is in the grand scale of good versus evil is revealed in the second hour, this segment is where most of the aforementioned special effects are delivered. The final hour of the film is where all things culminate and then understanding takes hold. I could talk about all the fine actors who have recurring roles of importance throughout time in this film, but I would spend all my time identifying who they are as portrayed by the actors, which does nothing to underscore how powerful this story is. I believe that any experience that allows for anyone to think in a different way presents growth. That is what Cloud Atlas represents, the very possibility that some causes are so monumental and so significant that they require more than one lifetime to resolve is just remarkable. I give a green light.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pleasing,"What the film does so brilliantly is that it gets its central message out there: a unique and contemporary alternate definition of life. This movie really takes a chance with people's ideas and beliefs about our existence, which is one of the most ambitious questions of all. To do this, and entertain the audience, is a masterpiece.Although the movie ends up biting more than it can chew (referring to the novel), I'm glad it was made to interest people in the novel, and the central idea of the story itself: a very powerful examination of the meaning of our lives.I think any movie that attempts to put out a revolutionary look at life cannot be pretentious, but courageous.p.s.

I gave it a 9 music is good and the main theme is really something. The stories in themselves could be stand alone episodes if someone wanted to edit them but they shine when they are all jumbled up.

You're in for a treat.,"Cloud Atlas is a movie based on the novel by the same name written by David Mitchell. It's a story of stories spanning across different eras of time involving various characters that intertwine with each all having one common theme;""Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime; and every kindness we birth our future."" Somni-451In the spirit of The Matrix, the Wachowskis direct yet again another compelling and thought-provoking film this time teamed with up with Tom Tykwer creating a well executed film.Cloud Atlas features six stories that unfold through the lives of six within each later converging and affecting each other through time. Each plot progresses slowly at first, then goes back and forth seamlessly between each character.The underlying themes of truth and freedom are played out in a plethora of bold and visceral human nature sprinkled with some humor, action, and adventure.I never believed in reincarnation but this movie really puts it into perspective of how it could be. For as one dies, a door opens.From a production perspective the cast put on an excellent performance between a notary, bisexual composer, journalist, publisher, clone, and tribesman as the leading roles and even a lot of the supporting ones as well. The pacing was spot on, and the make up was superior that many familiar faces were unrecognizable or done up extremely well respective to the time period.In essence, Cloud Atlas is a film worth viewing a few times as it may be a lot to take in on one sitting. Be warned as it has earned its solid R rating. Even so, everything is presented in good taste and good timing from a little nudity, sexual situations, and some graphic violence at times.As a fellow filmmaker and human being, Cloud Atlas gives me great inspiration and if you know nothing else about this film before viewing, you're in for a treat.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Relax this is to remove your collar""","The movie starts with a series of events that seem to span the past and future in history. There is a slight relationship. As the movie progresses the relationship becomes more obvious in the stories become soundbites.This may be a fun experiment in storytelling and the book may be exceptional. However, I have not read the book and do not have time for this gobbledygook. If you persist in watching it, it becomes easier but never as clear as each story could have been by itself, so all this trickery is a waste of time. Looking closely, you will see that they borrowed from many other movies including Soylent green.One positive item is the ending credits where we see the cameos of the actors next to their names instead of an endless scroll of names of which we might know some and might not know others.In the end, the film is full of positive clichés such as ""Love can outlive death"" whatever that is supposed to mean.

"Very Good, ""Thinking"" picture.","This is not a fantastic movie, but it's a very very good one. If you go into it expecting another ""Matrix"", you'll be disappointed. Like ""The Matrix"", it's a thinking picture -- you'll likely leave it with friends talking about what it says and what it means -- but unlike The Matrix, it's a lot less of an action picture. There's one segment which does have a fair amount of action, but most of the story isn't filled with very much of things like that. It's a lot more ""characterization"" based.The trailers are slightly deceptive, too. They make it look as though it goes from the distant past into the far future, but in reality, it spans about 500 years starting in around 1830 or so.The theme is the connectedness of all humanity, and of how what goes around comes around... Karma, in the classic sense. Even if you don't believe in Karma, it's still the kind of picture that engenders discussion about why you, or those around you, believe or disbelieve.I'd suggest its cinematography does make good use of the large screen, and will suffer on the small one... so it should be seen in a theater and not just in the home cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the most ambitious and fantastic story lines  yet,"In all honesty this is the first time I have felt the obligation of writing a review about a movie, and that alone says quite a bit.It is a lengthy piece, but it is by no means tedious. From the beginning of the film it shows clear intent of suggesting that one must be paying close attention at all times. If this is not accomplished, then the viewer will find him or herself lost throughout the whole movie, and therefore will miss out on one of the most ambitious and fantastic story lines I have encountered.The make up, setting, music, and editing are pure genius. I loved the cast and praise the versatility of each and every one of its members.I have not read the novel, but I commend David Mitchell for being able to create and intertwine so many different and amazing story lines into the masterpiece of a story that became Cloud Atlas.Just as Andy Wachowski said, many critics and viewers hate what they do not understand, and hence tend to detract works and art of worth. It is not a film intended for superficial viewing. Beyond it's fantastic presentation it transcends into a beautiful message, a message better left for each to feel in awe and amazement in their hearts.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Originally Superb,"The concept of Cloud Atlas is a special one. When I read that this movie would be 6 stories mixed into one movie I thought about movies such as Pulp Fiction and Inception. Pulp Fiction being a movie where different stories collide and Inception being a movie where events occurring in one stage have an effect on other stages, like Cloud Atlas. I love Inception and Pulp Fiction for these concepts so I was keen to see what Cloud Atlas would bring.6 story lines in one movie seemed very confusing and I was worried that the movie might be very hard to follow. These worries seemed unfit. I never got confused during this almost 3-hour running movie. Instead I was amazed at how well all the stories are displayed. There is no superior story or story that's let down by focusing too much on another which is remarkable and a admirable achievement by the directors.I knew I had to see this movie when I saw the directors and the cast.I loved the Matrix Trilogy and V for Vendetta from the Wachowski siblings and Run Lola Run from Tom Tykwer so I was anxious to see this movie. My favorite actor is Tom Hanks so naturally I was happy to see a new movie with him. What I found admirable is his use of different accents in this movie. Next to strong acting his voice is very powerful and diverse in this movie. I have seen Jim Sturgess in the movie ""21"", a movie in which I found his acting quite strong. I was curious to see what he would bring this time. He didn't let me down, he put down a few very good role. I liked Ben Whishaw in Skyfall and was surprised to see him in another movie already. Although I liked him in Skyfall I wasn't sure he would be able to complete a task as big as this one, but he managed to stand his ground and put down multiple strong characters. I have always liked Hugo Weaving and I loved his roles in this movie. It was hilarious to see him as Nurse Noakes, fun to see him as Bill Smoke, which made me think about his role in The Matrix Trilogy and I thought he did a splendid job at performing Old Georgie. Jim Broadbents roles were very good too, I especially liked his portrayal of Timothy Cavendish. In the movies I have seen with Halle Berry and Keith David I thought they were okay, but not outstanding. They have proved to be worthy actors to me now with strong acting in this movie. Halle Berry for her portrayals of Luisa Rey and Meronym and Keith David for Joe Napier. I had not seen Donna Bae in any movie before but I think she did a very good job in this movie playing Sonmi-451.The landscapes and sets are beautiful. When you see the voyage of Mr. Ewing the grand ship makes it very realistic and interesting and during the scenes in the Valley with Tom Hanks the forests and mountains are magnificent.This movie looks very realistic. The ships from the future civilizations look very nice and the make-up work on certain characters is beautifully done, it was so good that only during the credits I realized by which actors some characters were played, which gave me a pleasant surprise. Everything used in this movie to make people look more fitting for their era sometimes makes them look very different and along with that more entertaining.Overall I would say the concept is revolutionary and fascinating, the acting is fantastic (kudos to the casting team) and the quality is extremely high. Definitely a recommendation, it's something special that has never been seen before.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Monumentally Enthralling,"This movie is a total gem - I feel exhilarated by the happenstance that crossed our paths. I had no knowledge of the book...just saw the trailer a few years ago. Walmart had this DVD in a bin for $3.47. What a price for such a film! One of the best movies of my adulthood. I have to say most movies in my top 10 of all time come from indescribable moments of wonder, mystique, and amusement of genius emanating from the collaboration of forces to produce the work.This movie is a masterpiece in every way. I love everything about this movie. From the variety of tone, genre, time, and even the underlying theme of reincarnation...which to note, I do not accept as truth. However, this movie delivered this ideal from the book in a way that captivated me to view a completely contradicting concept to my own beliefs.Something in my soul was given life from this film - It engaged a marriage between left/right brain...emotional yet logical cerebral experience. How to summarize the impact on this film almost emulates the creative complexity of the film itself.For a book-based film, I am almost afraid to read the book. Do I dare to recreate the imagery and interpretation I received from the film?...because oh, how I love it so! Totally catapulted to Top 5 favorite movies of all time. And for$3.47!!

It was very interesting to see Tom Hanks get involved in so many variations of character and Halle Berry cracked every role she was given.I'm certainly not going to leave out the rest of the cast as the 2 Jim's (Broadbent and Sturgess) were amazing and Doona Bae was simply captivating.Ben Whisshaw and James D'Arcy played their love story sublimely and Susan Sarandon looked absolutely gorgeous whilst delivering some unforgettable moments.An amazing collection of stories melded together to make a veritable work of cinema art, it's not often that true gem's like this are committed to film.

Reincarnation at it's best,"I am going to start off by saying that I was very excited to see this film. The trailer made it look so interesting and engaging. I think that there is a certain fascination with reincarnation that will draw folks in to see this film, whether you believe in it or not. I expected the film to flow seamlessly from one life to another; that was not the case. I recommend that you drink a red bull and wear something comfortable before you purchase that ticket. There are two main points that I want to make.. One is that the film is a hodgepodge of mini stories that keeps hopping around (hence the red bull). The second point is that this film is long; really long (hence the comfortable clothes). By the time this film was over I was more than ready to get out of there. With all that being said, the film did have some beautiful scenery, but I spent most of the time trying to relate the cast of characters from one life to the next life. Normally in these reviews I would write about the actors and their characters, but that will be difficult to do in this case since all the main actors play so many different roles, so I will just write about what I felt like were the main ones. Plus, I don't want to ruin the fun for the rest of you. The film begins and ends with Zackry (Tom Hanks). When first introduced you are not quite sure if he is from the past or from the future, but all is revealed in the end. Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) is an investigative reporter (among other roles) who is trying to follow in her father's footsteps by uncovering a major injustice in the oil industry. Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) is the most endearing character. I was rooting for her all the way throughout the film, although when she showed up again in the 1700s, I was a little bit surprised. There are a whole lot of actors that I can mention, but it would be too exhausting. I will say this. This film is an excellent test of acting skills and stretches the actors in all kinds of directions. The question is whether or not this film is worth getting butt blister to see. I am teetering between amber and green, but I am going to go with a green light just because the subject matter is so engaging.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hit and Miss but very Ambitious,"Some compelling, some amazing, some confounding, some forgotable, some annoying, it's all this and more. Above it all, this is ambitious. There's a couple of themes going. Basically the good and bad we do affect the future. It's a movie where actors play multiple roles in multiple timelines where they face challenges.Not every story is equal. Some stories are more compelling. Quite frankly, parts of some stories are more compelling than others. The slave whipping scene is certainly the most compelling. The most interesting story is the future Seoul. However it is a hit and miss kind of viewing experience. Jim Broadbent in the retirement home has problems. If he can call his brother, why couldn't he call the cops? In fact, where are the cops in that whole story?I have to be honest that I couldn't remember and keep up with some of these stories. Some become just a mishmash of different stories. It doesn't help that the same actors are in different stories. To me, that concept is more of a hindrance. All the fake makeup create an aura of artificiality to everything. The idea of connected souls is admirable, but they may as well not use the makeup. That would be something interesting. This feels like Eddie Murphy.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I have seen what I consider to be the very best and worst of all cinematic history and, having just witnessed this film, have decided to leave my very first review ever.This movie is, as my title states, not merely a film, but an enthralling EXPERIENCE which transcends and encompasses all genres, beliefs and boundaries. It is truly a 'once in a generation' creation, akin to films such as Blade Runner, The Godfather and Citizen Kane in it's EPIC and definitive magnitude! The scripting, performances and storyline throughout are of such quality that it comes-across like one enormous sonnet or poem without a second of cliché or unimportance. Furthermore, though a little confusing to begin with, the juxtaposition and intertwinement of the various plot-lines, messages, cinematography and time-lines is sublime and almost revolutionary in its scope. To add to this, the 'special effects', makeup and musical score are just as exceptional and serve to only deepen and bolster my positive feelings toward it.In short, I believe this to be one of the best, if not THE best, film of its kind (though no other films are really similar) ever created, and not a single person with even an inkling of enjoyment for movies should miss this! I intend to watch this film many more times and will keep the Blu-Ray on my shelves forever, once it is released.

Genre Bender: we are all connected -- and that is OK,"Lana, David and Tom did a wonderfully masterful job collaborating on this effort,which they all must consider the most important work that they have achieved so far and may have resonance on the global zeitgeist. The karmic theme with the nuance of a Bodhisattva(remember Buddha was originally a Hindu too)is appreciated, such as in the form of Sunmi 451, but in an understated way that actually helps to further the argument with touching poignancy. This quixotic collage of stories between 19th and 24th centuries all serve to further the argument that we just might deserve to have arrived beyond our solar system with our good human stuff intact a few of my old head hunter colleagues included). We perhaps collectively forget how much we have sacrificed to arrive where we are today or in the future worlds of Sunmi 451 and beyond. For future Bodhisattvas of our collective imagination, let us not ignore the ""tru-tru"" (reminds me of Talk Pigeon in Papua New Guinea) in front of our noses, lest we be compelled to repeat the fallacies of dystopian futures hopefully less traveled.

"An incredibly great movie, based on an amazing book.","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - In a rather fortuitous string of events, I finished reading the novel 'Cloud Atlas' (by David Mitchell) in the lobby of the cinema, a mere 5 minutes before seeing the movie 'Cloud Atlas' in a sneak preview, a whole week before its release date. This put me in a wonderful position to reflect upon the book and the movie simultaneously. And I can tell you right now, both are incredible pieces of storytelling.The Cloud Atlas novel is very unique. At first glance it seems to be a collection of six separate short-stories. The first chapter consists of pages out of the diary of Adam Ewing, a notary from San Francisco. It is the nineteenth century, and Mr. Ewing is sailing the South Pacific on a ship called the 'Prophetess'. After reading about his adventures for about 40 pages, the narrative abruptly stops mid-sentence, and the next chapter begins. Here, we are reading letters that one Robert Frobisher sends to a friend. Frobisher is an aspiring musician who has escaped creditors by finding refuge in Belgium and is working as a musical aide in the 1930's. The next chapter follows Luisa Rey as she uncovers a conspiracy surrounding a nuclear power plant in the 1970s. Skip to 2012, London, where Timothy Cavendish, a publisher, finds himself in a ghastly ordeal. Next we jump to the year 2144, a dystopian future reminiscent of Aldous Huxley's classic 'Brave New World'. A fabricant named Somni~451 is recording her recollections for the oppressive state's archives, before being executed. Lastly we listen to the tale of Zachry, a simple goat-herder living on one of the smaller islands of what was once known as Hawaii. At this point civilisation has collapsed, to such a degree that even the year is no longer known.Each of these stories, except for Zachry's, has been interrupted halfway through. Now each story collapses back into the previous, rolling back the narrative in opposite order. We learn what happens to Sonmi~451, and we learn how things end for Timothy Cavendish, Luisa, Frobisher and lastly Adam Ewing.All along this journey we see call-backs and foreshadowing of stories that came before, or are yet to come. The reader experiences an ever increasing sense that things are connected in more ways than one. Similarities to the characters in each of the stories are revealed. Similarities to their faults, their plights, and their actions. An overarching theme is revealed bit by bit, and before you reach the final page you know that this are not six random short-stories, they are one amazing journey, which transcends time, transcends space, and transcends lives.""Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies"" – David MitchellTry translating that to a movieEnter the Wachowski siblings, together with Tom Twyker. They take on the challenge, and bring us 'Cloud Atlas', the movie. Immediately there is a major difference from the book. The stories don't start out chronological, but seem to switch around every other scene, in seemingly random order. I start out confused Why would they do this? It makes the whole experience rather confusing for someone not familiar with the book. But soon the realization hits, that not the individual stories are show here, but rather the overarching storyline, the themes that bind all these adventures together. Scenes follow each other in the most logical order, running parallel to showcase their similarities. This creates a whole new experience. The movie starts out as this cacophony of mismatched stories, characters and scenes, then slowly but surely blends into a crescendo of epic proportions. Much like the titular 'Cloud Atlas Sextet for Orchestra' (OST).""Lifetime's music, arriving all at once. Boundaries between noise and sound are conventions, I see now. All boundaries are conventions, national ones too. One may transcend any convention, if only one can first conceive of doing so."" – David Mitchell (p. 479)This is my favorite quote from the book, and, to my great pleasure, is used ad verbatim in the movie.Cloud Atlas is a rare movie that is both viscerally and intellectually engaging. There are awesome action sequences here, but this is no brainless action-flick. I fear Cloud Atlas will not stay in cinemas long, as it is too complex for the average movie-goer. My gauging of the audience with which I saw Cloud Atlas was infuriating. Some of them left after a mere 15 minutes. Some walked off 1,5 hours or more into the movie. I heard after the movie was over, that so many people still did not see any correlations between the six stories, and I was saddened by their close-mindedness. It is not that it is incredibly difficult to comprehend; it is just that the average movie-goer wants to be entertained without having to think too much. That certainly does not work with Cloud Atlas.Please go see this movie, and prove to the entire movie-making business that there still is a market for movies such as this. Movies with more substance than ""Expendables 3"". I will certainly do my part by going to see this movie a second time. I am sure I missed so much the first time around.A multitude of tiny details within the film enriched the experience of the story. I loved these little nods to the connectedness of everything. The way Luisa Rey's apartment number was 451 (as in Somni~451), or the way the violinist in the Nea So Corpos' slum played Frobisher's Cloud Atlas Sextet. And the way the waistcoat-button from Adam Ewing, is used as an ornamental feature on the necklace that Zachry wears. It is small things like this that I want to explore on a more thorough viewing of Cloud Atlas.I can not stress enough how incredibly great this movie truly is. Go see it now! - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Transitioning from the 19th century to the distant future in an instant has to be an insurmountable feat, and the filmmakers did a marvelous job of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Masterclass in story telling, art directing, editing, and acting.","Cloud Atlas is an ambitious work of art unlike anything before it in terms of scope and diversity. Spanning three hundred years and locations around the globe, it weaves a perfect tapestry of interconnected stories that build upon the simple themes of choice and change. This would be impressive enough if Cloud Atlas took a straightforward approach to telling this story and told it in several chronological chunks. But the controversial editing of Cloud Atlas reveals the directors and editors understand the strengths of what film can do best. The edits are linked by one specific thing, focusing on an actor, an action, a point in the story, and the film weaves a web of interconnected moments or ideas that make for a beautiful tapestry of a film that washes over you in a way that takes effort to follow, but never is artless or obscure. The other masterstroke of Cloud Atlas that plays perfectly into filmmaking is the way the production uses its actors. In each story, the same actors are put into different roles, sometimes being heroes, sometimes villains, sometimes main roles and some are mere cameos. But the brilliance behind this is that it keeps the film canny and easy to stay invested in. As the shifts in character are mesmerizing, and the film leads to several 'Aha!' moments when you recognize an actor who has completely transformed from one role to the next. The film is also brilliantly paced. While you may think a three-hour run time is excessive, the strength of having six intertwined stories, is that they can have concurrent climaxes, battle scenes, or escape scenes, leaving you fully invested in stories that constantly thrill and will make you want to re-watch the film again and again to see if you missed anything. A film as brilliant, as complex, and as well-made as Cloud Atlas is a rarity, and it's excellence will need time and a great deal of effort to be surpassed. Is the film flawless? No. There are little nitpicks to the film that can be addressed. The mystery section is perhaps the least interesting and most formulaic, and some of the philosophy of the film around spirituality and love may be wearisome for some people. But you would be hard pressed to find a better cinematic experience than Cloud Atlas, it is quite simply, one of the best films out there.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Challenging Movie to Watch -- and I'm Going to Put it in My Library for Reference,"I gave this the highest rating for a reason. This is a film that is a reference for any actor, director, or writer (which I am) especially of speculative fiction. As someone writing in speculative fiction who has had recall of other lifetimes since 1986, this movie make so much sense to me. Is it hard to follow? Yes. Bear with it.This may be one of the most difficult movies to watch you've ever encountered. If you're a writer, an actor, a director...and like me, also a person who remembers other lifetimes, this is a must see. You may not be able to watch it in one sitting. It's that complex.The cast is phenomenal, and that's a big reason to watch it -- because great actors get to portray multiple characters in a single movie. For all of them, it's a tour de force which they can hold close to their hearts (I hope they do) as a reminder of what exceptional work they can do.The Wachowskis? I've got no words (and I'm a writer, of sci fi to boot, based on past life recall, so I should have words). What they did, despite the pans, I truly think will stand as a classic (the same happened to Blade Runner).Who are we and how did we get here? What are we doing, what do we need to do, and why? Most of all, who do we trust? It's the people we love. The people we've always loved. For hundreds if not thousands of years. That's at the bottom of this complex film.Some reviewers questioned yellow face (by the way, there's an Asian actress in white face) however if you pay attention, the Wachowskis bent over backward to create a sort of continuity of personae through the casting of the multiple characters brought together in different time streams.Tom Hanks as the storyteller who begins and ends the movie is incredible with his scope of acting through many different characters. Kudos to him, the Wachowskis and all the other actors who came to this game. The film world is richer for it.Isabeau Vollhardt, author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey e-book series",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Epically pretentious drivel,"Seeing as most people seem to adore this film and have the opinion it's real high-brow stuff I'm sure most of these clever geniuses will claim that I never really ""got the movie"". Because surely that would be the explanation for not liking this epic feat of artistical splendor, right?No, I ""got the movie"" just fine. I could understand the connections between the segments and could follow the narrative stream just fine. I got that it was about the various struggles and hardships of being human and what that means. I just plain out didn't like most part of it. To me the movie, apart from being ridiculously owerblown and pretentious in this statement, seemed void and lacking of any cinematic quality in any way. The director clearly hasn't an artistic bone in his body and the result is a tediously outstretched and really very confused hodgepodge of terrible science fiction on the one hand and pretentious uninspired period drama on the other and with a more or less comedy piece set in present day thrown in the middle of it all for good measure. With such a magnificent chaos of directing the 3 hours of the movie seem to go on for almost as long as the 1000 years of the plot. Now the present day segment (the one with the cockney Tom Hanks and the nursery home bit) I actually found to be quite entertaining and it is the sole reason for me not trashing the movie completely. A good nod should go to Jim Broadbent who really shone in all of his roles throughout the film, but especially here in this segment. However one brilliant actor can't redeem a movie that's so severely lacking elsewhere.So to sum things up (as I really don't want to spend an entire night writing a review for a movie I didn't even like): One of the segments was fairly amusing, yes. However the rest of it was just awful pretentious drivel either as a tediously lacklustre pretentious period drama or otherwise a flat out B quality science fiction flick. Grade: 2 whatevers out of 10.Now if you really wish to see a ""philosophical epic"" currently in theaters, go see ""Life of Pi"" instead, it's a great film.

Cloud Atlas,"Cloud Atlas is ambitious, sprawling, frustrating and confusing. It has vision, scope and actors who wanted to stretch themselves and do something different.Andy and Lana Wachowski of the Matrix movies and German filmmaker Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) have brought to the screen David Mitchell's unfilmable novel.It is six different stories in different writing styles and different time periods but it has interconnected themes. It has ideas of fighting oppression pursuing freedom that transcends time.The directors take a non linear approach as the different stories all mingle and bounce around. Many of the same actors reappear, even as different races and gender. This reflects that Lana Wachowski had transitioned when this movie was made.The stories range from a young lawyer Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) on a boat journey in 1849. He has helped a runaway slave (David Gyasi.) Ewing falls ill and then treated by the ship's doctor (Tom Hanks) who plans to murder him for his gold.A talented young composer Ben Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) in 1936 abandons his lover Rufus Sixsmith (James D'Arcy.) He becomes a musical collaborator with the renowned Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent). However it is the older composer who is using Frobisher and want to take credit for his composition, The Cloud Atlas Sextet.A clone servant Sonmi (Doona Bae) wants to escape from the nightmarish dystopia of Neo-Seoul in 2141. She is having independent thoughts and is helped by a freedom fighter (Jim Sturgess.)In London 2012, publisher Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) could make a small fortune when one of his authors (Tom Hanks) gains notoriety. He is a small time gangster who threw a critic over a balcony after a fit of rage. Cavendish is later tricked by his brother (Hugh Grant) and ends up locked away in a nursing home where he plans his escape.There is some new age mysticism in the stories, there are ideas that were explored in the Matrix movies. Some of the actors cause confusion, a few look similar under heavy makeup. Hanks plays a baddie and goodie in some of the characters he portrays. Whereas Hugo Weaving and Hugh Grant are always villains.Cloud Atlas is a divisive film. I found it enjoyable and epic on my first viewing. Even though there are flaws, you have to admire the scale of the filmmakers.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Literally Redefines Biblical,"Mind you as I write this review in my present incarnation I have a pair of family jewels hanging between my legs. That being said this work of art had some many climaxes delicately and smoothly weaved together it had me multiple-ing with the best of women. To actually meet and even exceed my expectations given the collaboration between the Wachowski's (makers of the immortals The Matrix and V for Vendetta) and Twyker (birthed the gem that is Run Lola Run) is almost unreal. Even the casual movie goer can appreciate it (similar to the aforementioned films) given its exoteric satisfiers of top-notch action, effects, sex but in the vain of the Wachowski's and Twyker's earlier works it eludes to some more esoteric issues and vibrations in this case being: walls of illusion created by the powers that be, geriatric care, alternative energy sabotage, religious fundamentals killing their idols, non-dual, soul mates, reincarnation, wisdom of youth and a score that is perfectly subtle when need be and explosively crescendos often.

"Very entertaining, Surprisingly Comprehensible","I'm sure Cloud Atlas has some Deep Meaning, but I never picked up on what it was. However, as a piece of entertainment it was excellent. The movie is composed of six stories, intercut very tightly, and some of the stories are very involving, although others didn't do much for me.Of the six, I liked the comedic publisher's story and the Matrix-like futuristic dystopia best, but also quite enjoyed the '70s investigative thriller and the sci-fi-tribal piece. I found it harder to connect with the two set earliest in the chronology, which had less narrative momentum, but I still admired the way each story had a very distinct style.I am rather amazed at how easily I followed what was going on, as at times the movie would cut from one story to another to another in a matter of seconds. However, the film starts with relatively long sequences that familiarize you with each story, and because they are all so different you always instantly know where you are. (At least I did; I'm not sure what the response would be of a friend who said she couldn't for the life of her figure out what was going on in Memento.)The acting is all quite effective, with the same actors playing different characters in different stories. I was most surprised by Tom Hanks, because I generally don't like him (his noble, ""regular guy"" shtick just doesn't work for me), but here I liked him in all of his six roles.Because the movie was stylishly filmed, and the individual episodes had compelling stories, I really enjoyed the movie. But I am completely unclear as to what point it's trying to make. It appear to be saying we are all connected throughout the centuries, but how we are connected and how these connections are significant eludes me. I think I'm going to have to read the book to see if I can figure that out.But forget the Greater Meaning; just enjoy the ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I love it!,"Running for almost three hours, ""Cloud Atlas"" manages to keep the audience captivated throughout its runtime by seamlessly weaving together six different stories from vastly different genres and eras into an exhilarating experience. The film offers a unique blend of science fiction, historical drama, romantic tales, and comedy that could have gone wrong but instead forms a coherent and enthralling narrative.The film takes us through various timelines and locations, with one story unfolding on a ship in the 1800s, another depicting the life of a young composer in the 1930s, and a reporter caught up in a web of murder and intrigue in 1973. The plot also involves a comedic tale of a publisher on the run from a gang of thugs in the present day, a dystopian vision of Seoul, South Korea, set in the future, and a primitive post-apocalyptic Hawaii.The common themes of love, compassion, and a love for liberty weave through each story. The portrayal of Robert Frobisher and Sixsmith's relationship touchingly and sensitively highlights the beauty of love. Even the comedic segment with Jim Broadbent as the publisher conveys a deep passion for freedom and human dignity.The film's ensemble cast delivers an outstanding performance in their respective multiple roles, making the audience care for them in one moment and revile them in the next. In particular, Doona Bae and Jim Broadbent's performances stand out. Bae plays a ""fabricant"" - a clone designed to serve humanity - and her gradual awakening to her self-worth and the subjugation of herself and her people is conveyed beautifully. Broadbent infuses his character with a sense of sorrow and weariness at key moments while still maintaining his comic touch.Overall, ""Cloud Atlas"" is a highly entertaining film that blends various genres and timelines into a cohesive narrative that will keep the audience engaged. It's a thought-provoking and unique cinematic experience worth watching and highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I should have walked out,"I stayed. Others left early. They were right. I think the film was mostly an over-the-top personality feature for the leading actors, how versatile they -still- are. And the make-up artistry they did on them was notable.But the rest and the overall was shallow and confusing, and ultimately: boring. One waits for a message, and waits for hours, but when something like a message comes at the end, it's unbelievably sugary and trivial. The final scene made me really cringe with shame.I give three points because some of the acting was really good, notably Tom Hanks.P.S. I was so upset about the film, and curious, I got me the book. And I like that better. I think the film has unnecessarily disrupted the longer story lines of the book, and thus has made the film quite incomprehensible for all who have not read the book before. And one other thing: I saw the film in the German language version, and that version is a complete disaster. It even fails to convey the political point of the ""Sonmi 451"" storyline, that she lives under a ""Corpocracy"" and that the only opposition to that is the ""Union"" aka ""Trade Union"". The German version does not realise the Trade Union angle, and so fails to make this story comprehensible and relevant.I realise some films are made even worse through some of their different language versions.

One of the Most Ambitious and Life-changing Movies Ever Made!,"'Cloud Atlas' is one of the most ambitious and life-changing movies ever made; a Cinematic Masterpiece! And it's no wonder when the creative minds of Wachowski siblings ('The Matrix', 'V for Vendetta') and Tom Tykwer ('Run Lola Run') collaborate to adapt David Mitchell's considered-to-be-unfilmable novel. Wachowskis' expertise in science fiction and human interest stories, and Tykwer's expertise in modern-day fairy tales, really work in the favour of the movie. It covers the six stories with such finesse that, at times, it becomes maddeningly epic.With six stories intertwined, it might seem difficult to follow. But the flow is unique and interesting, and not at all difficult to follow. It shifts from 18th century Pacific Islands to futuristic Neo-Seoul to post-apocalyptic earth with such soulful elegance.It captivatingly and artistically deals with themes of Love and Freedom. Anyone who hates society and conventions, and loves human interest stories dealing with dire situations of different times with a dab of fantasy, is bound to fall in love with the movie. For me, after a certain point, it stopped being a movie, and became something much larger than Life itself.""All boundaries are conventions waiting to be transcended. One may transcend any convention, if only one can first conceive of doing so."" The movie's cinematography (Frank Griebe, John Toll) is enthralling. It gives each timeline its own unique setting, which adds more depth to the story. The movie has so many unforgettable scenes and quotable dialogues, it is almost impossible to side out a few.""To be is to be perceived and so to know thyself is only possible through the eyes of the other."" - ""Our lives are not our own.

Epic,"There is some cool science fiction, action and adventure in this movie. The stories told are interesting and beautiful. Even if you don't care about the movie's message, I think you could also just go and enjoy it for the entertainment value.But this is actually an epic movie, a movie with a message, an intelligent movie with profound themes. The main point is that everything is an interconnected rich tapestry, a truth that has profound implications relating to human dignity, liberty, art, spirituality, and so on.The movie gives us this message not just in the content, but in its form, technique and even its acting. The movie is composed of six individual stories set in different times and different places. They are completely different stories and different genres.Each story itself is a complex mini-movie about 30 minutes long. Most of them are set in beautiful locations. Each story can stand independently, having its own characters, plot and finale and depending heavily on its particular genre, but still dealing with the primary themes. The various stories are not subtle: each has clear heroes and villains. This is a world of good guys and bad guys.The movie weaves these stories together, showing us occasionally the ways that they are interrelated. Sometimes the interrelationship is obvious and forced: the director cuts from one scene to the next to make that point. Sometimes the interrelationship is not obvious or glaring, but subtle and mysterious. The movie goer is invited to figure it out.The characters and actors are also interconnected, in the sense that each actor plays a handful of roles. This was so well done that I was shocked when I checked out the cast on IMDb after I got home. I could tell that some actors were playing double roles, but I missed three quarters of it.The actors play different sides (from hero to villain, and vice versa), different genders and even different races. Some of it was obvious and I can see why some might think it inept. On the other hand, I accepted the movie's message that the distinction between races and genders is unimportant.Philosophical statements on the theme of interconnection and other similar themes are made throughout the movie. These statements often seemed rather profound, but were delivered in a context that made it difficult to absorb in just a few seconds. I need to see this movie again to focus on that. (Or of course I could read the book.) It was a little frustrating not being able to follow it all closely. The movie I saw was (thankfully) subtitled in Dutch, so I was able to follow most of the dialogue.The start of the movie is confusing. It takes a few minutes to understand the structure and the fact that the director wants you to pay attention. It soon fell into place though. There were also a few times when I felt I was being lurched from one story to the next.The didacticism and philosophising of this movie had a downside. Yes, the stories are entertaining, but it's quite clear that grand truths are being preached to the movie goer.But that's what epics do. I'd go see this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Parallel portray of all stories prolongs carrying concept of afterlife and human journey to eternity for justifying the vision--""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others."" Wachowski Broz, along with Tom Tykwer, cast an stunning direction by using the outstanding novel to set a visionary and philosophical plot. Each dialogue made me ponder its depth, its connotation. Complex and mind-groping script plays with thoughts regarding basic human instincts---love, greed, treason, fear, bravery, salvation. Marvelous cinematography with whimsical score surpasses all dark complexions and complexities. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Hugh Grant and so forth--exquisitely adapt multiple (positive/negative) roles in various timescales in variant genders. Their epic makeups and costumes will undoubtedly claim accomplishment in Oscar. I've already watched 3 times at a stretch and each time my wonder becomes an abyss more and more ;))) Surely this year's best essence to me :DD___",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the most ridiculous films ever made!,"I really tried to like this movie. I mean, good actors, some interesting scenarios. The problem really is that the people who put this together failed to create an engaging storyline that one could follow comfortably. Throwing out a bunch of detached vignettes for the consumer to assemble demonstrates a lack of ability to write a good storyline. Not all of us like to treat a story like a crossword puzzle. An, the theme of interconnectedness of events that would be obvious in a film with a logical sequence is something 'new' that the consumer has to discover. Using the actors for different characters in time and space, often in surreal, out of context places, is confusing also. It is just impossible to identify with these people with such poor character development. A few minutes into the film, I didn't care what happened to the characters. Later on, it was worse. Summary: A real waste of time here. But it appears that some people can find reason for a film like this. Maybe it's politically correct for the critics, with all the right actors?",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A ride of several lifetimes,"This is my first review so far, so bear with me.When i went to watch Cloud Atlas i must say my expectations were high. They had been raised through reviews, trailers and word of mouth, so i was expecting to have that special feeling at the end of the movie. And oh boy did it relieve my expectations!I must say it has been the first film this year to hold my attention and deliver in a way that Cloud Atlas does (and yes I've watched Batman: DKR). The story (stories) is compelling and the acting is superb. The movie reaches so wide an audience that you never thought possible, there are histories from the past, present and future. Sci-fi, action, comedy, drama and romance. So no matter the taste, the audience will be pleased.But what really makes this film special is the acting. The actors do a superb job, Tom Hanks and Halle Berry delivers as usual. But what really surprised me was the (for me) unknown actors; Jim Sturgess and Ben Whishaw who did an astonishing job, holding a grip of me for every minute of screen time. Especially the story about the young, Robert Frobisher and his struggle to write his masterpiece and echo in eternity, said without revealing too much.I would recommend you go and see this film, since it is some of the best if not the best, movie I've watched this year. BUT! If you decide to watch this movie, be prepared to stay focused for all 172 minutes, because if you do not stay concentrated, you will miss out, due to the jumps in times and stories. But in the end, you will exit the theater with that special feeling in your stomach that lets you know, you just witnessed a great piece of art.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Please at least watch it once,"Watching this film is an indescribable experience, and I am at a loss of words because I just don't know what to write right now,my apologies.Similar to a caricature of life, you experienced it but at the very end you can suffice by muttering a simple ""wow"" or start composing eulogies about it for days until the end of dawn.Either way works.Regarding the film,ignore what everyone else is saying,watch it for yourself and come to a conclusion whether its good or bad.Start reflecting and you can literally feel the invisible fabrics of this grand game and illusion we call reality or life.When I look at the film, I see both my previous reincarnations and the present life I am living. I get why this film can be polarizing, from me, this gets a 9 out of 10 , and thats about as high as I am gonna give to any other films.500 years later, somebody is gonna look at this art with a deja vu and say ""I know it"" ""But thats not possible,there are only handful a remaining copies in North America after the Third World War,the only remaining ones were put into archives"" ""I don't know,I just know it.""",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
