"Dark Humor and Non-Stop Action, Fun Summer Film","I know there is a lot of hate going around for this movie (though it oddly manages to maintain a decent rating despite the nay-saying...) but I would really urge people to watch this movie before letting the opinions of others affect their views on it. Sure, the movie takes some liberties with plot and, obviously, physics, but it makes for a fun action/popcorn movie. It is, after all, just a movie. After seeing this film, I would say it was one of the most fun action films of 2008. It's got plenty of violence and stylized action with a dose of sexuality and a decent plot...Wesley Gibson is a miserable account manager with a dead-end life until he is approached by the beautiful Fox, who informs him that his father was a master assassin who had been murdered days before. Gibson is recruited into an assassin's guild known as the Fraternity to hunt down and kill his father's murderer.The quirk with the Fraternity is that it's assassin's have the special ability to raise their heart rate above 400 bpm, pumping incredible amounts of adrenaline into their system and giving them superhuman reaction speed...basically ""bullet-time"". So you can expect a lot of over-the-top stunts, including the ability to curve bullet paths. Why there has been a lot of complaints about this aspect of the movie, I don't know. It's not really over-used and it adds a cool element to the movie. The film has PLENTY of action throughout, though most of my favorite scenes were during the course of Wesley's training with the Fraternity. The film also has a ""twist"" ending, though it isn't difficult to see the truth coming.For a popcorn flick, the film boasts a great cast. Morgan Freeman is Sloan, the overseer of the Fraternity, and it's the first time I've seen him in such a role. He did seem a little awkward with some of the rougher dialogue towards the end of the film (though I guess it's to be expected...I never expected to hear Freeman spouting ""Kill THIS motherf***a"" in a film). Angelina Jolie is wonderfully sexy as Fox, though I'm biased to the point where I'd love Jolie in just about ANY role. Rounding out the primary cast is James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson; I had not seen any of McAvoy's previous work but I loved his work in this movie. He is perfectly suited to play both the meek, anxiety-ridden account manager and the elite killer he becomes. He does a great job inducing the element of dark humor into the film with his great delivery.While I've read quite a few complaints about this film, I can't understand why. It's a guilty-pleasure action film and it's not to meant to be taken completely seriously. It's just a MOVIE and a fun one to boot. When you watch this film, just sit back, disengage your brain, and enjoy the non-stop action and fun characters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Not a bit of substance...but, who cares?","Putting it bluntly, 'WANTED' was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly, office shut-in with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination, a world of flipping cars, extreme gun fights, and mind-altering stunts, thus shedding every bit of his shy, weak self. This we've all seen before.Where 'WANTED' stands apart from any other action film I've seen is in its style. The director has upped the ante on how the action is portrayed. Gone are any sort of boundaries. This is a world where people can flawlessly flip cars over others and land perfectly upright on the other side, where people can shoot from miles away hitting nothing but their target, where people can put such a curve on bullets that they hit multiple targets standing on different planes all with one shot. If people can really do this, perhaps I'm living the same existence as Wesley, and I'm missing out. The film's major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for that.The A-List cast delivers solid performances, but the script they are given - with the exception of the last line uttered in the film - is mostly generic. James McAvoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesn't know how to change it - something many people understand. His transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing. Angelina Jolie is Fox - a name quite fitting as Jolie looks fantastic; however, we've seen this character on her before. Still, she does it well. Freeman, as usual, injects intelligence into his role, playing the solemn leader of The Fraternity.However, for all the edgy extreme events the film contains, the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained. For one, The Fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by The Loom of Fate. Sounding like something from a Monty Python sketch, it is never revealed who - if anyone - controls the loom or where it derives its powers. Names are simply revealed through code and the members of The Fraternity don't ask questions. The members of The Fraternity are fully human, but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly. It's the film's easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the high-octane action they desire. Lastly, the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles away.When the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75% of the time, but you won't care. The film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mind-bending stunts, unique filmography, and breathtaking visuals - yes, Ms. Jolie is one of them. It will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story, but in the execution of its stunts and action. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
What's wrong with those comments?!,"I guess this is my first moment I want to comment on the movie. The reason for that is all those negative comments.People don't like the idea of a man making a giant leap across buildings, about the ""plot of the world"" and the ridicule in the movie.But at the same time I guess they DID like Trinity's jump in Matrix, destiny (sadame) in any Japanese movie or comedy of Mr and Mrs Smith.COME ON PEOPLE! This is NOT James Bond, Bourne or Die Hard. This is exactly the opposite. This movie in my opinion simply tries to make fun of all those movies. It's all a sarcastic view of today's action movies. Just like the bullets - bent to the fullest. For me it's more of an action comedy. The ideas are so stupid that it's funny. Why? Because it was fit in the action movie. I mean come on - the loom, the bullets, the healing stearine, the rats... How can you ever compare it to any action movie that tries to be serious? This is not trying to do that.That's why I liked this movie - for its intelligent sarcasm and probably because of all the negative comments from people that expected a ""mature action movie"" and didn't understand the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Gleefully fun and thoroughly entertaining.,"'Wanted' is a film that's having too much fun not to like. Who cares about the impossibility of bullet bending when most audiences accept superheroes with inhuman powers and strengths based on comic book characters. As with those comic book films, it's just a work of fiction and fantasy, and since 'Wanted' doesn't take itself at all seriously, then you can suspend utter disbelief. The casting and performances are all spot on, above all James McAvoy who delivers one of his best performances in his career so far, even if the might not be the best film he's been in. Stylish, funny, competently directed and paced, this is a great action flick with an ordinary story that is more than the sum of its parts due to slick a execution.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted dead and alive,"Right first things first this is an extremely enjoyable action movie, but for it to work for you must suspend your sense of disbelief. With this done there is much to be enjoyed here. The premise of an agent order of assassin weavers is lets face it pretty ropey, and I am not sure how true it is to the comic source material (which I will probably dig out at some point), and Morgan Freeman is really playing it by numbers here. But we have some amazing and original action sequences that really do move the movie on at a frenetic pace. Yes we can see the massive influence of 'The Matrix' and 'Fight Club' and lets just hope if there are sequels they do not go the way of the shoddy follow ups to the Matrix. I like the fact that some of the characters are played by different actors than your normal action movie types, though to be honest I am not sure about McAvoy's American accent, though he handles everything else well. Still much better than your average action movie and worth repeat viewings if you are a fan of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted left me wanting.,"For the first half hour Wanted felt like a trailer.Adapted from a graphic novel the film never seems to settle,the actors seem ill at ease with the material and the impatience on the directors part leaves us with a messy hackneyed film of action set pieces and sci fi mumbo jumbo inbetween. The film tries far too hard to be cool which is a shame because im sure it could have been a better film if things would have just been done with a little less haste.James McAvoy,so convincing in Last King Of Scotland is hard to like in this role.Morgan Freeman seems totally non interested but to be fair hes given virtually nothing to do and just serves as filler between action scenes.Angelina Jolie is the real star of this film,she has astounding presence as an actress and suits the action genre,its just a shame we cant find a truly memorable action film for her to star in.In summary Wanted is a fast paced but legless action film that promises much but delivers very little.It leaves you wanting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Top  Easy  Watching  Action Movie,"This is a very easy to watch action packed movie. It delved into your imagination and as long as you are not expecting a true to life action drama you should love it. I am not normally struck on the matrix style movies but I really liked this film. The story is not be taken too seriously, just go with the flow of the film and watch the stunts and special effects. Putting Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman in the movie had to be a good move with the box office bucks. But the ace card for this movie in my opinion is James McAvoy who plays the geeky guy who turns into a top assassin. At first I did not recognize James McAvoy from his previous roles like "" The last King of Scotland "" and ' Wimbledon "". When I did realize it was the same actor I understood what a fab actor he truly is. He portrays his character with absolute ease. His transition in his role from the start of the movie to his ending character is class. James I am a true fan !! The movie is a good watch if you are into this type of movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

To The Extreme,"I just got back from an advanced screening of Wanted. I have to admit not being a fan of the Director, Tim Bekmambetov. Somewhat disappointed in his Russian Films Nightwatch and Daywatch. However, in his American directorial he delivers!! An abundance of profanities and over the top action sequences that are beyond xtreme fill the screen in a dizzying array of visual adrenaline. Holding you in a tight breathtaking grip with its interesting visual techniques, humor and acting. James McAvoy (the sweet faun from the Chronicles of Narnia) plays the loser we all know, Wesley Gibbon. The guy, who just trudges through life allowing himself to be walked upon, humiliated and has no desire to escape it, except in a bottle of anti-anxiety meds. Enter a beautiful Woman, Fox (Angelie Jolie), a mysterious wise man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and his life instantly changes from Billing Reports to Gratuitous Violence, Mastering Weaponry Skills, and Assassination. Believe me when I say what the Matrix introduced, Wanted has mastered. The director is a skilled artist at using the camera in conveying visual emotions of Wesley like I have never seen before, wait I take that back, seen it in NightWatch. I definitely recommend this deliberately humorous, action packed, violent, profane, to-the-extreme film to be seen on the big screen - check this one out!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Do yourself a favour.  Read the book!,"So a friend told me how the book was very different from the movie, and made me read the book... and boy was he right. But more about that later...I recall seeing one of the producers say in an interview that due to all the superhero movies out, they intentionally went for a more ""realistic"" approach. I kept this in mind as I watched this movie. That said, I can only say that it's good, not great.James McAvoy, who I've been a fan of since ""Rory O'Shea Was Here"", does an acceptable job as the movie's main character. However, I couldn't help but notice his accent seem to be just a little off here and there, which was a little distracting for me. Morgan Freeman and Angelina put in some reliable, albeit unremarkable, roles. And Common, a guy who has more on screen gravitas than most actors, is sadly underused.The action scenes, which are vital for a film like this are very good. There are plenty of ""okay, that was pretty cool"" moments for adrenaline junkies out there. (Fyi: McAvoy actually did the ""on the car hood"" stunt with no CG. Nice job.) The story is good, but considering the original story, it would have been really hard to make a horrible movie. The special effects do a good job of making you believe in the unbelievable and some interesting camera-work and slow-mo also do well to enhance the experience.All in all, above average, but not outstanding. 6 out of 10 BONUS COMMENTARY: The real tragedy about this movie is what it COULD have been. The original comic book wasn't about him being an assassin, you see, it was about him training to be a supervillian! That's right, in a superhero world, he's the Green Goblin, or Lex Luthor, or even the Joker! Now imagine what that movie would have been like! Additionally, they had to train him to be a cold-hearted, homicidal, remorseless bad guy. The book, which is definitely not for kids, is chock full with so much f-you, in-your-face, unapologetic violence this version of the movie would have been looking at an R rating for sure. Anyway, if you get a chance, track down the book and have a read. You can thank me later.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Fun, but you've seen it all before","Slick but over-stylised action flick from the Russian director behind the NIGHT WATCH movies. Plot-wise, WANTED borrows heavily from both LEON and THE MATRIX in the story of a young, slightly nerdy man working in a dead end office job who finds himself being indoctrinated into a world of assassins and massive, CGI-heavy action sequences. What follows is extremely fast paced, never for a moment realistic, and full of the kinds of unbelievable OTT scenarios that will give even the most hyperactive child a headache. We've got cars rolling through the air, trains dropping through the sky and, in the film's neatest concept, bullets that can actually bend around obstacles.WANTED is given some decent credibility thanks to the actors who populate the parts. James McAvoy is fine for the most part, apart from a single car chase in which he screams and whines like a girl for the entire duration. Morgan Freeman sleepwalks through his role and Angelina Jolie is given little to do other than pout and snarl on occasion, but other, minor parts are given to effective performers like Thomas Kretschmann and Terence Stamp. The action comes thick and fast and with it a great deal of heavy violence, and on a superficial level the film admittedly works. But the biggest drawback is Bekmambetov, whose excessive style makes the likes of CRANK and GAMER look like sedate Merchant Ivory productions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Garb Age,"Can you combine Matrix, Elektra and Equilibrium into a completely pointless exercise that looks good but makes no sense? That was the question asked by some money makers to the director of the movie. Yes, siree, I can!The film starts with a Matrix like scene, continues with the average man learning he is extraordinary, then switches to the group of highly trained assassins that only take ""good"" missions assigned to them by ""fate"" and continues to ridiculous gun scenes, one in which a bullet has a circular trajectory and kills everyone including the shooter.

There are plenty of jaw-dropping moments in this movie.Chances are that most of the stunts are highly unlikely, but you're watching a movie, purpose to entertain.

a morally confused lifestyle flick with bullets as bling,"What did you do today? Just watching a movie, going to high school, or working at McDonalds or a generic version of Office Space? Are you an impossibly pathetic character whose movie-pretty girlfriend accepts your crappy apartment by the train tracks yet hates you enough to constantly cheat with one of your co-workers? Are you buying condoms for the best chum at work you know is doing your girlfriend? Well don't worry because all the skills of an assassin are biologically determined! A few punches in the face and some exercise and you will be James Bond perfect because your absentee father was and we all know DNA is much more important than practice or discipline.This movie gets all of its charm from the conceit that we know it is all part of the Matrix era bullet time slickness of action and the understanding that it all comes from a comic book anyway so if you have to pick someone up all you have to do is skid sideways right into the person at high speed with the door open and scoop 'em up. No danger of breaking his legs at all. And there can never be too many times two evenly matched assassins demonstrate the fact by their bullets crashing into each other harmlessly in mid flight.Angelina Jolie has said that sure she is carrying guns in this movie but she condones what happens to the characters so she could get behind the movie. However it resolves, though, most of the movie is a loser's fantasy of having an exciting life. That might very well suit the video game audience under 25 years old. But if you can't get past the improbable efficiency of the team and the improbable stupidity of the protagonist from scene to scene, the big twist that pats itself on the head for its brilliance will seem to belong in another movie. Had the action not been so cartoonish, maybe we could believe what it purports to say. It still exists in a vacuum-sealed circle of geek-hood one expects from Agent Cody Banks. The only difference is that he is twenty-something.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Male Version of ""Nikita"" With Gore and Special Effects","The anxious, clumsy and abused office clerk Wesley Allan Gibson (James McAvoy) has a hell and boring routine life: his obese boss humiliates him all the time and his girlfriend betrays him with his colleague and best friend during working period. When he meets the sexy Fox (Angeline Jolie), Wesley is informed that his father was a professional killer that belonged to an ancient organization called Fraternity and killed by the skilled and powerful Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), a hit-man that has betrayed the Fraternity. Wesley learns that his anxiety actually is a manifestation of his latent abilities and he joins the society under the command of Sloan (Morgan Freeman). Trained by Fox, he changes his personality and attitude, being prepared to face the dangerous Cross and find a hidden secret.""Wanted"" uses the storyline of ""La Femme Nikita"" blended with lots of gore, revenge and special effects à la ""Equilibrium"". The story has a good cast, with names like Terence Stamp, Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie; a very high-budget; and is full of action. Viewers that like ""Blockbuster Movies"" probably may like this movie much more than I did. I still prefer movies based on intelligent screenplays and acting rather than in explosions and special effects.

I Wanted a Little More,"(Synopsis) Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a neurotic accounts manager who works in a small cubical filling out billing reports day end and day out. He allows his boss and his girlfriend to walk all over him. To cope with his life, he takes anti-anxiety pills by the bottle full. Wesley has no desire to change his humdrum life, but one day while getting more pills at the drug store, he meets a beautiful woman in black, Fox (Angelina Jolie) who changes his life forever. Fox was sent to protect Wesley from the man who had just killed his father. Wesley thought his father had died soon after he was born. Fox tells Wesley, ""that your father died yesterday on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building and you are next"". Wesley is recruited into the ""Fraternity,"" a secret society of assassins that his father was a member. Fox must train Wesley to bring out his special powers that he was born with in order to avenge his father's death.(My Comment) This is one of those movies that cubical workers can relate to. The audience can imagine that they don't have to take it anymore, especially, if you have special powers. Wesley changes from this meek nobody going through life just putting in his time into a person with confidence and strength and the ability to change his own destiny. James McAvoy did an outstanding job in playing the roll of Wesley. Angelina Jolie didn't have many lines in the movie, but her presence was more for having an intimidating and dangerous killer with good looks. The visual effects of slowing down the speed of curving bullets and bullets crashing into each other are very well done. The movie is entertaining with lots of action and moves at a fast pace. By the end, you see that Wesley has truly become his own man. (Universal Pictures, Run Time 1:50, Rated R)(10/10)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Ridiculous...and good.,"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.comI detested the trailers and I'm not a fan of gene-pool lottery winner Angelina Jolie, so one movie I never thought I'd sit down to watch was Timur Bekmambetov's action orgy Wanted. Problem was, I kept coming across reviews that wrote about this film being a pleasant surprise. Considering all I had to lose was an hour and a half, I thought I'd give it a shot. Surprise, surprise...Wanted actually is a pleasant surprise.This surprise didn't come easy and it most definitely didn't come early. The first fifteen minutes or so was nothing less than a flip imitation of Fight Club, so lame that my finger hovered over the ""stop"" button on my computer. But patience prevailed and once Wesley Gibson's (James McAvoy) fate was altered, there truly was no turning back. When Wanted shifts into second gear, it does so with a resounding thump of unbridled torque. Once Wanted screams aloud that its a thrill ride, it does something few action films ever have the smarts to do - it winks at the audience.This wink let's us know this isn't the real world, but that this is a movie...and a very silly movie at that. The remainder of Wanted is crammed full of implausibly over-the-top, yet very slick and expertly choreographed action sequences, each one upping the ante of ridiculousness. Wanted reminds us being silly and ridiculous is not the exclusive realm of the Farrelly Brothers, and not since John Woo made an art form out of corny, over-the-top action films has there been something with so much adrenaline and laugh-out-loud silliness as Wanted.Within this realm of excessive camp, Angelina Jolie fits as snug as silk stockings (not that I would actually know). The more serious she plays her character Fox (even the name is a groan inducing pun), the more you can't hate her freakishly abnormal ""good"" looks and constant mugging for the camera. If she does take herself this seriously in real life, then she must be excruciating company, but if she has the sense of humor to understand her role here, then props to her. Her cheesy performance is destined to be parodied, yet few parodies will ever come close to besting her own efforts. She delivers every line of dialogue as if it were her last and every cat-like motion she slinks across the screen with is deliberately bon3r baiting.Beyond Jolie, the cast in Wanted is first rate. McAvoy does the fish-out-of-water routine with ease and Morgan Freeman is, well...Morgan Freeman. The pleasant bonus appearance is Terence Stamp who is, in my mind, one of the most underused actors around. I can't believe I'm saying it, but I had a laugh out loud riot watching Wanted. Never having met John Woo or Timur Bekmambetov, I can't say for sure if they take this junk seriously, but if taking the pi$$ out of a tired genre is their thing, then they're experts at this craft. If, on the other hand, they're not in on the joke...well, at least they're getting rich getting laughed at.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Mind-Blowing Ride of Bullet Curves and Thrilling Suspense.,"Wanted offers a wild ride with incredible CGI, especially the iconic bullet-curving scenes, making it a visual spectacle. The story is suspenseful and full of unexpected twists, keeping you hooked till the end. James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie deliver strong performances, adding depth to the action. However, the film's reliance on style over substance can be a flaw, as some character motivations feel underdeveloped. Despite this, the mind-blowing action, tense story, and stunning visuals make Wanted an unforgettable experience. The film dives into themes of fate, revenge, and control, with action sequences that are both stylish and intense. It's a fun, if sometimes shallow, cinematic adventure that leaves you questioning the limits of reality. Overall, Wanted delivers what it promises: excitement and spectacle.Rating: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

killing is OK?,"After Mama Mia seeing Wanted was a sort of antidote. From over the top confectionery frolics to some thriller that was trying for a new twist. A sort of X-Men with smaller mutations appeared: bullets that curve, bullets hit one another, heart rates at 400 per minute in order to achieve this effect. First their was the cod- history lesson about assassins who for a thousand years have executed people to some rather dodgy moral code. The film opens with a spectacular shootout. Cut to about (James McAvoy), an office worker whose life is falling apart under a tyrannical boss and feeling sorry for himself. His life is turned around when Angelina Jolie invites him to join the assassins and reveals his special powers example 400 heart beat etc. Jolie having made the big time has finally returned to acting like big star and is the best thing on th film. Despite having not much to do. A big chase sequence follows with some amazing train special effects, except that's what we expect from films these days. Much of this is script-by-numbers but there are a couple of nice twists which make this worth seeing.

Flashy visuals but flimsy script ultimately leave one wanting,"The steep competition in the realm of summer action romps more often than not creates the necessity for any new efforts to make an instant attempt to stand out as something new and innovative while still conforming to the tried and true conventions making such films so shamelessly enjoyable. One would be hard pressed to find a more vivid example than Wanted, appearing almost gimmicky in its flaunting of its standout selling points (bullet bending! corporate satire! Morgan Freeman AND Angelina Jolie!) crafting the image of one of the summer's most fresh bouts of carnage. And while Wanted does not disappoint on the exhilaration front, it falls considerably short of the astonishing action epic it seemingly wants to be.Despite being marketed as a fresh foray into the world of action mayhem, Wanted takes very direct influences from numerous sources, making many of its supposed innovations seem worn out and overly familiar. Apart from director Timur Bekmambetov's similarly hyperkinetic Nightwatch series, the film plunders from works as diverse as Fight Club's satirical critique of the soulless corporate world, complete with a nihilistic Norton style voice-over, to The Matrix's immersion into a new world (Jolie and Freeman's characters scream parallels to Trinity and Morpheus) and hyper-stylized, adrenaline pumping action sequences. However, where the winning combination should have clicked and resulted in one of the year's most flat out exhilarating action thrillers, instead it fizzles, its unoriginal solemnity coming across as almost pretentious and far in intent from the big, loud and very silly action movie its gleefully over the top action and laughably stilted script make it fated to remain. The main criticism of Wanted lies in its excesses: while all the elements on display appeared favourable, all are pushed too far over the top, as if attempting to up the ante on all similar action films while descending disappointingly into mediocrity as a result.The screenplay delves into a slew of enormously familiar situations as if attempting to identify and exemplify every existing action movie cliché, from the initial training montages to the ""why do we kill"" assassin soul searching to double crosses, ethical responsibility, parental fixation and countless others. But where this peppering of familiarity could have made for a bombastically enjoyable time, the film is treated with such hushed reverence and solemnity that all the normally excusable cliché and lapses in credibility become all the more glaringly frustrating. What Wanted sorely lacks is the sense of light-hearted fun which would help its selling point of eye-popping action sequences fly instead of coming across as pent up and contrived.Plot frustrations aside, there can remain no doubt that Wanted's primary selling point remained the gleefully overblown shootouts, chases and bone crunching fights, and here the film flexes its cinematic muscles more confidently, providing many of the more memorable action setpieces in recent cinema (the car chases and final shootout are highlights). From the first moments of the initial shootout it becomes clear that not only has realism left the building, but taken a running dash through the top floor windows of it, foreshadowing the film's tendency to careen over the top in almost every possible fashion, to thrilling but often chaotically overwhelming effect. However, even those normally sated by flashy gunplay and lots of it may find themselves frowning in disbelief at many of the film's more ambiguous creative choices. The recurring theme of the emasculated man ""finding himself"" through violence veers into uncertain ethical territory even for an unabashed action film, and the numerous staggering gaps in logic (the exploding rats were just too much), gargantuan plot holes and underdeveloped concepts (a bit of exposition on the assassin cult's mystical abilities, especially the much hyped ""curving bullets"" would have done wonders) strain credibility several shades too far, even where next to none was expected in the first place. All the attitude on display makes the film appear to be trying slightly too hard to be edgy and rebellious, but its lack of originality or confident script make it seem more petulant than daring.The genius unorthodox casting of James McAvoy proves the spark of life which keeps the film afloat, his substantial charisma, perfect comic delivery and entirely credible shift from timid corporate drone to hardboiled action hero making for a supremely engaging lead. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the absurdly capable supporting cast who are almost entirely wasted in paper thin archetypes, their mere presences substituting for credible characters or performances. Nowhere is this more clear than in the case of Angelina Jolie, given almost nothing to do but near wordlessly discharge a series of firearms or flaunt her tattooed backside when called upon, with nothing more complicated to work with. Morgan Freeman is similarly firmly on autopilot in the 'dignified mentor' role he could essay in his sleep, and while a couple of unexpected character moments prove amusing, ultimately his presence is nowhere near as much of a boon as it should be. Terrence Stamp shows potential as a grave ammunition manufacturer with a mysterious backstory, but his character is critically deprived of screen time, giving him little chance to contribute anything in the way of performance. Such is also the case for Thomas Kretschmann, a strong presence as a vague antagonist figure, but given so little to do his talents are almost entirely wasted.While Wanted may frequently dazzle, its flashy visuals and thrilling action cannot mask the ultimate shoddiness underneath, the senseless fun of the action sequences being often dampened by the implausibly imbalanced storyline and downright poor script. While those in search of lots of bullets flying about and little else in the way of complexity may find themselves suitably entertained, considering the competition in the action film market and the vast potential the film had to offer, Wanted ultimately leaves one wanting.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Action Choreography at its best,"If you haven't watched, then you must. It's been a long time seeing so much action in a single movie. From the start till end the action goes on and on and on...Stunts are very,I mean very very far fetched, like in Matrix. In Matrix the story line supports those flying and bullet dodging but the story line and reasoning in 'Wanted' is not so acceptable...But are they good ? YES YES YES.They don't just doge the bullets, they actually swing them..Yes Man! they make a arc with it also they do gymnastics with car, and they are pictured so good you may want see them again and again.As for Actors, James McAvoy fits the role SOO perfectly, u cant imagine anybody else in this role...

Wanted something better,"I had a lot of expectations for this one. The visuals seemed stunning, the action heart-throbbing and the cast remarkable. And those thing were there but I just couldn't shake the feeling of this movie being nothing more than a paycheck.All the memorable dialog, scenes and concepts seemed all TOO familiar. The bullet cam was taken from the video game Max Payne, the keyboard to the face scene from an internet show called PurePwnage, the last line was also taken from a famous Bob Ross parody, the train cart scene was reminiscent of an old children's show based on a popular toy, and I could go on...I can look away and call them a coincidence but the last straw was the story. It was preposterously bad! Nothing made any sense, it seemed like they just pulled it out of a hat to house the action. All the characters the protagonist has to fight have no depth to them, this guy can do this, this guy can do that and in the end the hero has to fight the guys that can do this or that. Pathetic...As I exited the theater trying to keep my mind off the senseless favorable criticism that was going on behind me, I heard someone say ""If I was 13 and saw this movie, it would've been the best movie ever"". And that's what it is, a children's movie that tried to captivate the adult mind through pointless sex scenes and drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wesley before Wick,"For those that love the Matrix and John Wick movies this was 5 years before Wick and several of Wicks moves were similar in Wanted.

Shoots Itself in the Head,"There's a trend in these big budget action moves to try and support the thing with hefty story components: profundity, explorations of fate and power (often via revealed conspiracies). We come to expect this, and I believe have rather clear thresholds about what works.I think when you try to these ambitious story arcs, you have to pay attention to these thresholds. For all its faults, the ""Matrix"" films impose style on a robust enough narrative. You have to have a narrative.Here, we have a story line: young nerd with hidden powers revenges his father, only to discover deceit, then he takes revenge on the deceivers. That could have worked, if it had been supported. It has before, right? There's all sorts of meta-noir possibility here: the ordinary man picked out and placed in a situation long since determined. The idea of death being visited on people, directed from supernatural sources by seemingly supernatural agents. The idea of fate weaving in lives and so on. The cinematic ideas of a man whose vision ""slows things down,"" and as narrator for us in voice and sight.But its all given short shrift here. We cannot rely on this narrative to carry us. Hitchock's wife was in charge of vetting scripts for this property of robustness and I believe that the threshold of what can accept in speculative noir was discovered or defined by her. This fails.Which basically leaves us with some very energetic and brutal stylizations within which we can encounter Angeline. I suppose that because of these roles, she is the most bankable actress in the world. I do think she knows how to do this. In ""Smith"" she drove the story simply with her attitude. In Tomb Raider 1, I think she successfully defined this persona, a confident sexual being who could match any male film presence. That's what this is all about.She actually does support that well enough in the early chase scene where its her movie. But then we have to start relying on the narrative to move us along, and we get stuck with Morgan Freeman's silliness. She simply becomes a watcher with nothing to do. She cannot carry it off because there's nothing to fill, no movement to get behind.And so much of it fights itself. There's a hint of a sexual relationship, but its random. There's a ""training"" session that makes no sense at all and seemingly is inserted only to film brutality. There's much made of curved bullet paths. Is this a supernatural talent, or special bullet designs, or something to do with spin while shooting?But, you know, I could have tolerated the whole thing, all the rats, the predictability, the incoherence. Until the very end where our transformed wimp looks directly at us and challenges us with something so remarkably ""real"" that it subverts the whole fragile fantasy, the implied humor. It was so disturbing, I credit that encounter as all the power of the film. It was dumb, blunt and repellent.Oh, there's a crude use of the redhead type as the petty tyrant of the hero's officeTed's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A 14 Year Old Boy's Wet Dream,"""Wanted"" is basically a sex/violence fantasy for adolescent boys. A nerdy cubicle worker is recruited by ultra sexy Angelina Jolie and becomes a super assassin.Thankfully, this film is saved by doses of humor that make the predictable plot and thin story bearable.James McAvoy is surprisingly good, speaking with a perfect American accent. Angelina is scary sexy as the femme fatale assassin recruiter. Morgan Freeman practically sleepwalks through his role, but is still enjoyable.The story is completely ridiculous. One of the main plot points involves binary code weaved into textiles. Another thing that happens is during shootouts, they prevent themselves from being shot by shooting the bullet that is coming towards them.If you like seeing slow motion close-ups of people being shot in the head, then ""Wanted"" is the movie for you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Perfect.,"I went to a screening of Wanted last night in Toronto. It was more than I hoped for. James McAvoy was the perfect leading man. At the beginning you felt for him being such a loser and then you grow with him through the movie.Angelina Jolie did not have a large part in the movie, she was there but there was not much focus on her. Which suited me just fine.The only gripe I can have with this movie is that near the end there were bits that seemed predictable, not the whole thing ...but little parts here or there.Timur Bekmambetov did an amazing job directing this, and I am looking forward to more product from him in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Kicks-butt,"Wanted is a very sex action movie. First of all Jolie is a very sexy as the mysterious, and troubled Fox. Beyond the fact that Jolie is reason alone to watch the flick, the story-line is decent, not incredible, but entertaining. The visuals of this movie are top notch. At times the images almost seem 3D. The way the action is set up, is fast,exciting, and totally captivating. Movie viewers will be engaged through the whole movie, holding on with their eyes for dear life. But this movie is more than visuals, or fast paced action,it's comedy. This movie is comedy at its finest. The characters of this movie are developed and likable, which only adds to the movie as a whole. Wanted is a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Silly nonsense that just about suffices as post-pub action fodder but nothing more than that,"Wesley Gibson is a simple office worker tired with his life and past the point of hoping for more. Before you can say ""hang on didn't The Matrix do this but better?"" Gibson is approached by a woman claiming he is the son of a famed killer with near-supernatural abilities and that he has them too. It takes a few gun battles to make him believe the story, but Gibson is soon under the wing of the Fraternity, a group of super-assassins under the leadership of the shadowy Sloan, who kill based on the thread patterns sown by a magic loom (no, really). Gibson begins training for his ultimate task  taking down the man who killed his father all those years ago.Wanted was a Friday night rental and I cannot imagine it would work any other time than that. The plot is a mix between The Matrix and a warm turd (guess which side the loom is from) and it just about pulls a basic frame for lots of action, running, shouting, and gun pornography. There is not a point to expecting anything more than this because it offers nothing more, except maybe unintentional laughs at the sheer nonsense of the plot. This was not a particular problem for me in terms of words on paper but the delivery seemed to suggest that I should take it at least a little bit seriously and is a bit po-faced  to the detriment of the film, which really needed to be played for sheer fun.Because the action is reliant on the plot and characters to draw us in, it cannot save the film but it certainly provides a distraction. The excessive abilities of these humans is another turn off in regards ""getting into it"" but on the flipside it does provide some action sequences that are so outrageous that it is hard not to enjoy them for the sheer spectacle. Director Bekmambetov is probably a reasonable choice if this is the only aim as he also made that superficial vampire success the other year, but he cannot draw anything from the talented cast nor draw the audience in. I feel a little sorry for James McAvoy as he has solid roles under his belt and was due his ""big action film"" role, however this shows that when opportunity does knock you should probably answer with the door on the chain just in case. He has a fairly thankless role but throws himself into it well enough within the context of the film. Morgan Freeman dials in his performance but yet it still fits. Jolie has clearly just been told to pout and look sexy as much as possible because that is all she does. Personally I found her skinny frame to be alarmingly unsexy and wondered who she is surrounding herself with that nobody has taken her to side about how bad she looks in this film. The support cast offer little but their familiar faces and are a weird bunch of Stamp, Common, Warren and others.Wanted is a fairly basic film then but one that has enough money thrown at the action to just about make it appeal to the teenage boy in us all. However it is impossible to ignore just how very daft it all is and how none of it really gets the heart going. Instantly forgettable stuff but if you're looking for something noisy and totally undemanding then this would fit that bill.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Over the top and stupid, but still an entertaining action flick","If you go into Wanted expecting life-affirming brilliance, you will be disappointed; but if you go in expecting an adrenaline-fuelled thrill ride, you should come out at least fairly contented. The film is apparently based on some comic book and is directed by Timur Bekmambetov, a name some may recognise as the director behind Russian vampire film Night Watch and its sequel. The film is style over substance in a big way, although it does at least attempt to have some substance by way of the basic idea of a normal man living a boring life being given the chance to fulfil his destiny by way of a much more exciting life as a professional assassin. His boring life is thrown into turmoil one day when he meets the sexy Fox and, after being saved from a hit-man himself, he is recruited into a group of assassins known as The Fraternity. He is taught how to use his hidden super powers; which include the ability to slow things down, shoot bullets in a circular motion and drive rubbish cars really fast. Our hero then learns the reason he was brought in to The Fraternity and the destiny that awaits him.The film takes on a very 'MTv' style and the action is continually paused, overloaded with CGI and/or quickly edited. Things like this usually annoy me, and with this film it does start to grate after a while; but the director actually uses these tricks fairly well (particularly in the first twenty minutes or so) which is a credit to him and the film. Once the plot kicks into action, we basically get treated to one action sequence after another and calling them 'over the top would be a gross understatement. Most of the things that happen in this film are completely ridiculous, but it soon becomes obvious that the film is not meant to be taken seriously and it's better to sit back and enjoy the ride. The plot itself has a number of holes and doesn't make complete sense when you think about it; but again, leaving your brain at the door is highly recommended. There's a couple of twists and turns along the way to keep the story interesting, and although the ending is not completely unexpected; it wraps things up nicely and overall, if you're looking for a film to entertain and not be too taxing; you could do worse than Wanted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Their world. Her rules. His destiny.,"After reading all the hype, watching the teasing trailers, it comes down to one thing. I had to go see it. It seemed unique, action packed and cool effects along with some nice stunts. Was i right? mostly. Nothing real major was disappointing, although some things were a minor. The action was full and non stop. Very cool effects, and some real nice shooting. But not all was so great. The film however started to get predictable (until the unexpected end) and turned out to be a little confusing.The cast was the best idea from the producer. A great familiar cast with one or two legendary actors/actresses (Morgan Freeman,Angelina Jolie) did wonderfully. I too was actually quite impressed with James McAvoy role, he played it perfectly. Moving on to the important bit. In case your still wondering. Yes there is more then enough action. The action scenes were also well panned out and effects of the ""curving bullets"" to the effects of the ""jumping and flips"" were brilliantly executed.The movie kicked off very well. It's always good to have a explosive beginning, and this movie did just that. It automatically gave you an idea of what is too come for the rest of the movie. After the furious beginning the movie started to get a bit slow and then rose back up to the action again. The ending was definitely strong, unexpected and a great bursting with fury shooter scene. But occasionally the film was sped up a bit to much with maybe one or two too many flash backs of sorts, it had you quite puzzled at times. But that doesn't take anything away from such a great film.Maybe all the hype before it came out had people expecting a tad too much, that's where so many are disappointed. But they really shouldn't be. Just forget what you heard and go see it. Plenty of action, cool effects and mind blowing stunts. Also a Witty and clever script.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Worth seeing,"It's really hard to shoot films based on the cartoons and not to repeat some common features. Creators of Wanted have managed it: both storyline and acting look absolutely original. One can compare Wanted with Matrix, and in some case it's true: the movie is as stunning, unexpected and captivating as Wachovsky bros. early work was. Don't try to analyze what you see, while you are in the cinema, just watch and you'll feel yourself inside the constant action.Bekambetov, who has started his shooting career from Russian TV-ads in early 1990-s, loved CGI and camera effects from the very beginning. Now, with a sufficient amount of Hollywood's money he realizes his early dream: CGI in Wanted isn't an addition to the storyline, but the storyline itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Has action, not substance.","I like the idea. Lots of reviewers find this movie unoriginal, but really, what action movie is? People seem to hold The Matrix as the pinnacle of sci-fi, but it has glaring similarities to Star Wars and even the Bible. Originality out the window, this is a decent movie to watch for lots of bullets and car chases. Just don't expect anything too deep.The cast was immensely flawed. The main character McEnvoy is almost... too typical. It seemed like this character was a wimpy tool turned killing machine solely to cater to the 20-something video game crowd (did the office scenes remind anyone else of Office Space?). I started to hate the ""fraternity"" almost as much as I hate real-life frats, as every member had a stupid arrogant smirk on their face like ""I know something you don't"" times 100. I don't think a single assassin changed expressions once, as they went from smug to overly-smug.The special effects are love/hate. I liked the car chases and most of the shootings, except for the bullets colliding mid-air. That was cool the first time, but since its an event that has likely never happened or ever will happen, it grew tired by about the fourth repetition. One thing that absolutely disgusted me was how the main character survived the farthest fall EVER, with no major injuries.If you want to see a quick flick with lots of action, this is a good pick. The stereotypical characters/story elements, however, were VERY questionable at times and just reminded me of those kids in middle school that were always fake-shooting each other and trying to do Matrix moves in gym class.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The one movie of the year that needs to be seen,"Wanted was by far one of the very best action movies this year. It was a very fun wild ride from start to finish. It had many twists, turns, gore, blood, and action. Just strap in and get ready for one hell of a roller coaster ride. It kind of got confusing at some parts in the movie so you have to pay attention very close. You would be surprised how many funny parts and jokes they had in this movie. I was also stunned by all the twists and turns the movie took toward the end. By the end of this movie it will leave you shocked. The acting could not have been any better. Angelina Jolie did an amazing job playing an assassin. James McEvoy was funny but also at the same time very serious when it came down to killing people. Morgan Freeman was very good as usual and brought a lot to this film. The stunts in this movie have no words to describe how good they were. The gun techniques were outstanding. Some of the things they do with the gun though is very fake and far-fetched. I think that the movie was even better because of it getting an R rating. This movie definitely deserved one and you will notice during the movie. If it didn't get the R rating it wouldn't have been a s good as it was. Overall this movie is a must see movie. It is worth every penny to go see it. The one must see movie of the year is WANTED.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A fun movie without logic to back it,"Wanted had a lot going for it but lost track of that by trying to make a more action-packed matrix rip-off. The beginning of the movie is what captures the audience's attention by portraying the life of the main character that we can all relate to (unsatisfactory job, unsatisfactory relationship, and unsatisfactory life). Where the movie really goes wrong is failed logic, too many illogical assumptions that that audience has to buy into in order to follow the story-line. Some examples, there's no logical reason bullets can suddenly curve at the minds will. At least in the matrix there was a solid justification to anything out of the ordinary (i.e. the matrix wasn't the real world).The ending, in my opinion, is a cheap shot... talking to the audience first-hand because they couldn't do it properly in the movie. If the message of movie can't be figured-out by the audience, yelling at them through the main character is only making it worse.In conclusion, there were a lot of great sequences in this movie, and it's always fulfilling when you feel you can relate to the main character... but the absolute irrational physics-defying action- stuff just made me lose touch with the movie...",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Dumb fun,"Based on comics by Mark Millar and JG Jones which I had never heard of, Wanted tells of a put-upon wimp (James McAvoy) who discovers that he is the son of a member of a league of assassins called The Fraternity who can do such amazing things as shooting bullets round corners. In very short order he is trained up by fellow assassin Angelina Jolie, on the instructions of Fraternity head Morgan Freeman, to pursue and kill the man who killed his father. This involves various savage beatings for reasons which are never wholly clear, and some trainee junior level assassinations based on targets identified from binary characters coded into fabric woven by an automatic loom which has been functioning for 1,000 years since The Fraternity was a Guild of Weavers. I think - that bit didn't make a vast amount of sense.Let's be honest, the whole thing didn't make a whole lot of sense. But maybe it wasn't meant to. Maybe it was meant to be a vehicle for the several eye-popping Matrix-style action set pieces. Put brain on hold and accept the improbable elements as they come along, and you'll like it just fine.Morgan Freeman does his elder statesman bit, Angelina Jolie does a variation on Lara Croft, Terence Stamp pops in momentarily as zoned out as usual, and James McAvoy proves that he can hold centre stage in an action movie as convincingly as everything else he does.The action is great, and there are some laughs too. It's not a classic - it's far too dumb for that - but it's a perfectly satisfactory popcorn movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"A thrill ride that is ""Wanted""","In the summer action movie sweepstakes, Wanted is the prize winner. Based on a six-issue comic series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, Wanted provides the appropriate thrills, action and engagement needed for a strong summer movie extravaganza.Wanted focuses on Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), a nobody in a minor, dead-end job with an overbearing boss and a best friend who is getting horizontal with Wesley's girlfriend during lunch breaks. However, when picking up a prescription one day, Wesley is greeted by Fox (Angelina Jolie), who informs him he is the son of a great assassin who was just murdered by another assassin, and is now the killer's target. She takes him on a whirlwind chase, and then introduces him to Sloan (Morgan Freeman), the head of the Fraternity, an order of assassins a thousand years old. Sloan informs Wesley that he has the same potential to be a superb assassin as his father, and thus leads to Wesley standing up to his boss, his girlfriend, his friend and beginning his training to become a member of the Fraternity.Wanted exudes much of the same energy as The Matrix, as well as sharing a similar visual flair, without necessarily ripping off the former film. When the action sequences kick in, they are a rather spectacular sight to behold, featuring a great deal of stylization and visual acrobatics that astonish supremely. Yes, the logic behind many moments in Wanted is completely nonexistent, featuring such elements as ""curving"" bullets and killers so trained that they can manage to shoot a weapon with the exact trajectory to stop another oncoming bullet. But that doesn't really matter, Wanted grabs you when necessary and you just come along for the ride. The film is also helped along by some very strong visual effects that blend rather seamlessly with the surrounding live-action material.Wanted, much like the early summer success Iron Man, also understands that to really get into a story, we have to be involved in the characters, and with Wanted, our entry point is Wesley. He starts out as a character almost all of us can identify with, the downtrodden cog in the machine, coasting through his days with a feeling of inevitability and hopelessness. By letting us feel sympathy for Wesley, we have a rooting interest in what happens later, and therefore are involved in the film's action.James McAvoy gives us a vulnerable character in the form of Wesley at the beginning of Wanted, who then transforms into an assassin, but we never lose our identification with him. Angelina Jolie doesn't have a whole lot of dialogue, but makes an impression as Fox nonetheless. Morgan Freeman fills his character with a mixture of both authority and menace, proving once again what a masterful actor he is.Wanted is nothing tremendous on the plot front, it doesn't offer the audience anything too deep, but that is not necessary. It is a summer thrill ride, and at that, it succeeds exceptionally.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Bog Standard,"Want a gimmick that is obviously nothing but a gimmick? Want a plot about a secret society of assassins that does nothing to differentiate its self from the mediocre likes of I Am Number Four and The Covenant? Want edgy humor that condescends to its audience, but doesn't even bother to break an R Rating? Wanted might just be your kind of movie.Wanted's big claim to fame, besides wasting prime Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman on characters you've seen done better elsewhere, is that certain characters in this film can curve their bullets when firing their guns. Apparently, this is a two step process: you can't just flail your gun around like the characters in this film if you want similar results, you must also belong to a secret race of super assassins and sit around letting Morgan Freeman spoon feed you exposition before your bullet curving powers will work.I have been making fun of how dumb and standard Wanted is, but if the bullet curving gimmick had led to even one fun inventive gunfight, I would probably be talking about how cool that was instead of how lame this movie is. The Bullet curving is wasted. Gunfights play out the way they would in any other pg13 action movie. No one treats cover any differently, main characters walk around with plot armor a mile thick, and the super assassins look as scary firing a gun as an inflatable tube man might. Never before has a gimmick been so blatantly nothing but a gimmick, and no fun to boot.Unfortunately, beyond the wasted gimmick, there isn't really much to talk about with Wanted. By the time you're half an hour in, you'll have the rest of the movie correctly plotted in your head. The movie isn't boring or badly made. It isn't hard to watch or follow.

Angelina Jolie just exudes screen presence and she even admitted she removed lines as she thought the character should shut up and not say much, how many actors would do that? McCavoy was really good in his role, evolving from a geek to a bad ass assassin. Freeman is his usual brilliant self and delivers a killer line near the end. The movie doesn't let you come up for air and had me holding my breath at the sheer spectacle of the special effects. Yes the storyline and action is OTT that's the point of the story, we lead sad, depressing boring lives most of the time and we would kill for a chance to do something amazing, anyone who likes over thought, over talked movies probs should give this a miss, it is a proper popcorn movie which , if you are like me will want to see it all over again. loved it 100% can't wait for DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Screw You Physics!,"This film is like the bastardised love child of Fight Club, The Matrix and Assassins Creed, but not quite as good as any of them individually.The first major downfall of this film, is the obscene lack of realism. This I usually would not normally mind as I do not feel it is a necessity in modern cinema, had they not try to explain it away with something so completely preposterous. Apparently with a little bit of training, a surge of adrenaline will allow you to leap between skyscrapers, effectively put yourself in bullet time, and get some form of natural optical zoom in your eyes. I'm pretty dam sure that even with a massively over active adrenal gland you will not be able to accomplish any of these feats, and I would have much rather seen these things put down to something more realistic, like superpowers or aliens.As my title summary suggests this film also takes the natural laws of physics, ramps a mustang in a barrel roll fashion over it, but fails, landing short and crushing any regard for them whatsoever. Seriously some of this stuff, although entertaining, was completely ridiculous! At one part Fox manages to flip a Dodge Viper, with 2 flat tires, over a barricade of police cars, I know your thinking ""well that's pretty cool and it might happen"" which is fair enough, and that's about where this particular stunt should have stopped, but it doesn't. To land this stretch of automotive acrobatics she plants the car wheels first into the side of what must be a 2-3 ton bus, immediately flipping the public transport vehicle onto its side with a car that must weigh less than half of that, powering it over and she is then able to drive off. Also the whole curving bullets thing, again although cool, was a bit silly and again totally impossible if you just have a little extra adrenaline. Frankly, I found these sections to be stupid and it spoiled the experience a little for me, as it stopped me from immersing myself in the film properly.But even considering the above, this was by no means a bad film. The fight and chase sequences were all exhilarating (if a bit obtuse) and packed with good CGI. I found the plot to be much better than I anticipated with a couple of twists and it never seemed to get boring. The performances are pretty solid, as can be expected from the likes of Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie.Also the beginning sequence reminded me greatly of the Fight Club scenario with the mundane, mild mannered office worker suddenly drawn into a world of violence and weird happenings. The introduction of Wesley Gibson and his life make it very easy to sympathise with the character.In short I'd say that this film is undeniably cool and will not let you relax for one second, but was simply too implausible to enjoy the full experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
If Luke Skywalker Was A Coldblooded Assassin Instead Of A Jedi Knight,"Within every nerd lurks a super-powered killing machine: that's the message of WANTED, the latest movie-cum-video game from Hollywood. Oh, and did I mention Angelina Jolie, she of the pneumatic lips, digs nerds who are super-powered killing machines? With NIGHT WATCH and DAY WATCH, Timur Bekmambetov proved he could direct stylish but incoherent Russian fantasies; with WANTED, he demonstrates he can do the same thing for Tinseltown shoot 'em ups. There are some amusing scenes with bullets whizzing in, around, and through things, but after a while, it all starts to look the same. Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp, A-list actors, are also in this B-picture, looking slightly embarrassed. With more than a few plot points borrowed from the STAR WARS series (""Luke, I am your father!"" ""The Force is strong in this one!""). For those who care, we briefly get to see Jolie's perfect posterior; it almost redeems this otherwise saggy mess.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Great Entertainment, Visually Rich, Full of Surprises","For shear entertainment value, this is one of the best movies of the summer of 2008. Over the top action sequences reminiscent of the Matrix will blow you away with their creativity and tongue-in-cheek excess. It is visually rich with the visceral grit of Fight Club. You HAVE NOT seen anything QUITE like this before. There's plenty of originality here. This is a film I'm looking forward to watching many more times once it comes out on DVD. In fact, I may make this my first Bluray disk. This is a WAY better movie than Batman the Dark Knight--one of the most overrated films of all time. I would gladly pay full price to see this movie again before I'd waste my time watching Batman again for free.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Goofy or Serious?,"Lets think about this, James McAvoy has done many different genres of films and this is his first steps into action films. Looking from the trailer, he also does a good job of acting a believable American character. However, despite this and the intense action sequences of the film, Wanted ended up being a muddled mediocre film that had a lot of potential.The plot runs around a guy named Wesley Gibson. He has a pathetic life: working under a boss that abuses him, girlfriend that is cheating on him with his best friend and so on. One day, Fox, invites him to The Fraternity which is a group of super assassins. He goes through rigorous training to attain skills which his father once had prior to being killed.The one obvious positive point about this movie are the action sequences. It is slick, stylized and bloody. Similar to Shoot em Up, The film crams one crazy stunt after another pumping the adrenaline to the viewer. It is very fun to watch and very well choreographed.Similarly, the film puts a big emphasis on slow motion. However this tends to be a hit or miss making the film look cool or downright silly. Scenes where the viewer see a bullet fly through space a la Matrix are very well done. However, there are also scenes where you hear characters speaking in slow motion that adds nothing but silliness.The biggest problem with the movie is its pacing. It spends the first hour or so showing the introduction of the characters and Gibson's training in the Fraternity. The next hour presents a plot twist and the development to the final showdown. You will notice that this movie tends to focus on the story more than the action. Similarly, after the twist, it explain other aspects of the story even though you spent another chunk of time listening to the development of the characters earlier on. WIth a film that has a two hour runtime, it is rather disappointing.Another mixed aspect of this film is the humor. With over the top action and stunt sequences, the film is riddled with silly dialogues and events. When the film wants you to take the film's story seriously, you can't help but to wonder if the dialogue is intentionally trying to be funny or not.Overall, Wanted can be described as a action flick that contain slick and violent action but suffers from poor pacing and structure. Despite its big potential it felt like it fell down a little bit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
BEST movie I've seen in a LONG time ...,"I am a movie lover. I watch ANY genre of movies including drama, comedy, romance, thriller, horror, action, adventure, fantasy, sci-fi, documentary, and indie movies. I watch at least 1-2 movies per week of course that includes most latest titles out there right now.Anyways, I don't really want to describe in detail about the story or anything ... all I wanna say is that it's DEFINITELY one of the best movies I've watched in a VERY LONG TIME. The last movie I thought was really great was August Rush. Being a fan of Fight Club, The Matrix, and Sin City ... ""Wanted"" is a mixture of these three great movies and HITS AS HARD AS THESE if not more.The movie is thrilling, action-packed, great cinematography, highly interesting and unpredictable story with many twists, great acting, strong message in the end, inspiring ... Somebody said it's like the hybrid of Fight Club and The Matrix ... I totally agree. It is definitely a classic, but unique in its own way.I really recommend ANYONE to check out this movie. Maybe not kids since it's rated R and they probably won't understand the story anyway. But it's definitely one amazing movie!! Get out of your house and watch it NOW!!

Timur takes his style and makes Wanted an exceptional addition to the action genre,"Wanted is very creative in its thought and raw in its expression that even now, it still holds up to be one of the best action films I have yet to see. It's one of those films that contain the perfect idea, with a unique set of characters, and just the right amount of forethought to keep the storyline and action practically timeless. Timur's undeniable respect for the action film and its design to just take it a step further without being grossly overwhelming, was in my opinion perfect. Action films for the most part rely on the ""over the top"" scenario and the almost impossible task of the hero to overcome his or her circumstance(s). Wanted embraced this formula, keeping its hero Wesley likable and real, by placing him in an environment that made us appreciate how ""cool"" this would be and giving us a world where the violence is almost welcoming and keeping us for the moment uncaring whether this could happen or not but just loving the fact that we 'wanted' it to be, and I did.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Wanted's Best Body Parts,"Don't kid yourself. Nobody went to this film to see any of the actors listed before Angelina, and the studios knew it. Are there posters of trailers that feature James McAvoy? Who is he anyway? I saw one site that said they are thinking trilogy; that he is the next Bourne. Give me a break! McAvoy compared to Matt Damon. Unbelievable.What was the best feature of this movie? Hands down, it is Angelina Jolie's lips. Director Timur Bekmambetov made sure that there were plenty of closeups of these luscious parts. Men melted in the aisles as they came to the screen Next, it was her warm green eyes. They just grab you and won't let go. Unfortunately for McAvoy, they can also trap you into doing things that are wrong.Angelina's trigger finger is not to be overlooked. She proves that she is a capable match for any bad guy and Willis or Thurman have nothing on her.McAvoy got a real closeup of Jolie's uterus when she was splayed on the hood. But only Shiloh Jolie-Pittand whoever else is in thereknows what it's really like. Lookie James, but no touchee.Everyone is focuses on Jolie's breast when their eyes stray from the lips. Not on full display in this film, but check out Taking Lives, Original Sin, and, of course, Gia for more information.It is Jolie's heart that captivates many, and she showed a little when she came to McAvoy's aid in shutting up his girlfriend. The World knows that heart well.Despite the 20 minute set up in this movie, we really can't focus on McAvoy. There is likely to be a sequel (please, no trilogy) and it will likely feature Jolie again. We can only hope.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Extravagant, That's For Sure.","The film never really grabbed me from the trailers. It was simply taking the action genre to another level of absurdity. That's exactly what I expected and exactly what I got. I did have fun, but was left unfulfilled by the end of it. It was immature and inane in a lot of parts and the wow factor never really got me. It was all done in the trailers, leaving an empty film for us viewers to watch.It has the beautiful Jolie, who after a handful of serious roles is able to relax and have fun here. She is Laura Croft with a more bad ass attitude and sexy tattoos. James McAvoy tries his best as the leading man, he does a decent job, but fails to have any connection with Jolie. Terence Stamp is hardly in the movie to really comment on him and Morgan Freeman takes a different role here as the baddie. Without a doubt, he has the best line of the film...No, the best line of 2008. His delivery is hilarious and frightening at the same time.I've seen Nightwatch and see the same hyper style here. It's something that I expect to see a lot more of from him, it may get tiring fast for some people.I never heard of the GN before the film and didn't think anything that wasn't popular would be turned into a film.

Mindless mayhem,"This is apparently a screen version of a comic book or a video game, the kind of junk that's turning the minds of young Americans to mush. The plot is that an everyman unhappy with his boring life gets a chance to become an over trained assassin and kill a lot of people, in part to avenge the murder of his father, even though he never knew the old man. That's about all the plot there is here. Charcterization? That's pretty much missing, too. The male star is forgettable because he is almost completely devoid of personality. But he fits right in at the DeCaprio, Toby McGuire school of wimps as heroes.Morgan Freeman non-acts his way through the number three staring role.That leaves the woman upon whom box office success rests ---Angelina Jolie. She flashes a couple of smiles, but mostly just hangs around looking enigmatic. Actually, her part could have been played by almost anyone, but she played it, so she is responsible for fostering this non stop exercise in teaching kids violence.She should be ashamed of herself.

""Wanted"" is, in short, a fantastic action movie that is very entertaining and enjoyable.I like the story in ""Wanted"", as it is a well-written storyline that really has a great twist to it. I remember the first time watching it, and that plot twist just blindsided me once it was revealed. It is a nice twist to the storyline that totally changes everything.""Wanted"" is a movie that is fast-paced and keeps the audience in a tight grip throughout the entire 110 minutes that it runs for.

Angelina Jolie & this film: stylish and visually exciting,"Java Man Reviews ""Wanted"" (Rated R). Directed by Timur Bekmambetov. Written by Michael Brandt, Derek Haas & Chris Morgan based upon the comic books by Mark Millar & J. G. Jones. Starring James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie, Terence Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Common, Mark Warren & David Patrick O'Hara. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com August, 2008.OVERVIEW:The movie opens with a heart-pounding action sequence as Mr. X (O'Hara) tries to avoid assassination by crashing through a plate-glass window and leaping into the Chicago skyline. He lands on a nearby rooftop where he and Cross (Kretschmann) fight a gun battle with bullets that bend around corners. Just as Mr. X meets his end, wimpy office worker Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) vacates his cubicle in a nearby building and heads home to his dreary life. On the way, he runs into the aptly named Fox (Jolie) who tells him that Mr. X was his father and that Cross is a rogue operative of The Fraternity, a 1000-year-old network of assassins who kill ""bad people."" She tells Wesley that he has inherited secret powers and that he is destined to join The Fraternity and help them eliminate Cross.Just when we begin to think that this is too absurd even for a movie based upon a comic book, Cross attacks the two of them and they escape in a car chase so intensely exciting that Wesley and the audience begin to buy into Fox's story... which gets even better. The Fraternity, headed by the brilliant Sloan (Freeman), is located in a textile factory where the fate of its victims is determined by the binary codes hidden in fabric patterns woven by the factory's looms. Wesley agrees to join, but first there is the initiation, conducted by a menacing assemblage with names like Repairman, Butcher and Exterminator.REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java Mugs:There must be an easier way to take out a target than to squeeze out a shot while standing atop a speeding Chicago L-train as it races past the target's office window. But then, it wouldn't be as stylish. It's the same reason Hitchcock staged the attempted killing of Cary Grant with a crop duster in broad daylight instead of a gun in a dark alley... to avoid cliché and to create a memorable scene.Russian director Bekmambetov creates many such scenes and never passes up a chance to add visual spice to a shot. There are slow motion bullets to follow in curving trajectories, reversing action to follow to its source, and Angelina Jolie (a tattooed visual effect unto herself) to follow anywhere. He even creates visual patterns to match the rhythm of Wesley's accelerating metabolism.In addition to Jolie, who was born for this role, other performers operate well within the director's energized universe, especially veterans Freeman and Stamp as the organization's sinister brain trust. McAvoy, who at first seems miscast, convincingly grows into the role of the apprentice assassin.The question remains, is the story credible? Of course not. Yet we are hooked into it just as the unwary victims are hooked into their destinies by the Loom of Fate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Regardless, the acting in this movie is well done, and the comedy is very dark. The story is not to bad, full of plots and twists, and the message of faith is brought up throughout the movie.One thing I liked about the movie is that there is no cheesy romance which many Hollywood movies tend to have. Hancock is a good example of it. Instead the main actor is brought into a world of killings and in doing so reveals some unsettling things that sends him of postal.All in all, this movie is a must see.

"style over substance.  not exactly a triumph, but it's over it","Timur Bekmambetov's first American film isn't that far removed from the kinetic, hyperactive and sometimes just plain f***ing batty movies Night Watch and Day Watch. It's about the ""Fraternity of Assassins"", who get their missions from clues hidden in a giant quilt, I guess, and it's also about Wesley (James McAvoy), a regular white-collar worker, and his strange, dark adventure of self-discovery in this fraternity of who he really is- an instinctual, almost-mutant killing machine, meant for revenge by his mentor Morgan Freeman (who, thankfully, is a villain for once in a great while).What is there to say about this then.... well, it's never boring. At least as far as I could tell I never did nod off. That being said, it makes last year's Shoot em Up look like a documentary in comparison. And this isn't necessarily a good thing; a movie might be totally crazy with the over-the-top manners of killing people (in this one we get bullets that curve, bullets that hit one another, heart rates reaching 400 BPS, and rats who bomb the joint, reminding one of the armed penguins in Batman Returns), but does it make it a really good movie?Not in this case I'm afraid. This is a shame since James McAvoy is a very good actor, one who's very convincing, funny, and believable even when put in the most unbelievable circumstances. He practically carries the first third of the film on his own, this despite him being put in a totally crazy car chase that continues some of the ready-to-break rules set up here by Bekmambetov. And there's even some good star power with Jolie, acting like BIG ACTION STAR Angelina Jolie, and Freeman in a part too easily readable for his own good. But by the end we're given a plot and choice in technical style that knocks off Matrix, Fight Club, La Femme Nikita, a slew of John Woo movies, two turtle doves and a pear tree un-partriaged, and the last quarter of the film is just escalating, laugh-out-loud madness that skids the line between suspenseful and totally ludicrous, and eventually falls over the latter side.Would I recommend Wanted? No, I wouldn't, at least if you're paying for yourself. But if you're invited, go along and take a chance. You'll leave a little shell-shocked, but you might not be totally sorry you went. Well, might.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
As far as action movies go this is defo in the top 10 ever,"Let me start by saying that in my opinion Wanted has raised the bar that every action movie of 2008 must strive to meet.I was very impressed with James McAvoy's transaction from serious dramatic roles (such as the last king of Scotland and Atonment) to excellent action star. To me his disgruntled employee role was very similar to that played by Ed Norton in fight club. I think we be seeing him in a lot more of these roles.The entire cast played there parts well with Morgan freeman giving a role similar to that of his merciless mob boss in lucky number sleven.The Acton scenes were over the top but instead of taking away from the movie this actually made it better by reminding audiences that it was nothing more than an Adrenalin fuelled thrill ride with intense action scene, some twists and a good sense of humour.But with all the action aside i think the best part of this film and the one that will stay with me the longest is McAvoy's final monologue and a last line to rival that of the recent iron man films.If you are not a fan of action films then this wont be your cup of tee but if you want to take your mind of the real world for 2 hours then Wanted is definitely the movie for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Unlike Crank, or Shoot'em up however it can't find a post modern humor to it, it just plays the action too straight and too improbable, and the word that spring to mind is bathos.However, philosophy is great only if really tight and not pop dollops of pseudo meaning - there is not enough explanation, it's all very mysterious, but simply not mystic enough.I would have liked less bullets and knives and more creativity in the action scenes - and finally at the end of the day the film can't cram in all we need to know in the time continuum provided.Good, if violent, entertainment, but a good film... uh huh.....no way.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Overlong but a wild adrenaline ride!,"This is a lot of fun. The film's plot is wildly implausible and it's action explosive, like something out of a comic book. James McAvoy plays a likable guy trapped in a mundane office job, with a cheating girl friend, a boss from a hell and a smarmy best friend. Enter Angelina Jolie and McAvoy's life is changed for ever! There's a clever plot twist towards the end which I didn't guess. It makes McAvoy reassess everything that's been happening to him. Morgan Freeman is solidly dependable while Jolie is enigmatic and deadly. There is too much violence and the film is overlong. Still very much watchable.Overall 7/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Didn't Love it....,"I WANTED to love this film after all the reviews were so positive, but then came the film in Century City, Los Angeles, with a friend, on the 4th of July, and what a disappointment. Act One had too many scenes of developing the male lead, and ONLY when Angelina Jolie hit the screen with her incredible smirk and body, that WANTED became a bit more interesting.Yes, some scenes were bloody, the car chases, well, ""seen one car chase and you've seen them all"", the sets as dark as the characters, but unless Jolie is on the screen, WANTED is nothing more than a frat boy flick, with dialog that is trite and dull. However, WANTED when the action kicks into gear, Jolie in the lead, then the price of seeing this film is worthwhile. Otherwise, skip this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Fast paced, brainless and awesome.","Is this film trying to give an underlying message? Does it leave a lot to the imagination of the audience, letting them infer and deduce along the way? Do you have to listen to key dialogue/ events? Of course the answer to all of the above is NO. This is kick ass from front to back and if you walk in knowing they're not trying to make a groundbreaking, epic movie then you will love it.I adored the over the top action, stupidity and simplicity of this film. The cast works relatively well, the plot about on par with the cast, and all in all it has got to be one to watch even if you never view it again afterwards.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A spectacular action flick,"An ordinary man, with an ordinary job, a backstabbing friend and an infidel girlfriend finds himself one day chased by a couple of people who introduce him to a couple of powers he didn't know he had. After much training, he must obey the orders of the organization and ultimately kill a dangerous man who supposedly killed his father.It's a movie which is designed to wow the viewer through its spectacular CGI, characters' powers and extraordinary events. Unfortunately, as one can expect from this type of film, the plot is left in the background, having almost nothing to sustain the imagery, except for a plot twist which doesn't change much. I was impressed with the special effects, they truly are spectacular, but I have to add that they are way to exaggerated from any point of view. If you can accept this aspect, you're going to have a pretty good time with this one.It's nice to watch and it will be quite entertaining if you don't have high expectations in terms of plot and character development.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Disappointed,"I really enjoy a good assassin or hit-man flick. Really I do.After a recent string of poor to very bad trained gunmen and assassin-type films (Hitman, Shoot 'Em Up, Smokin' Aces, etc.), I had high expectations for ""Wanted"" given the top-rate cast and after seeing the stylistic trailer.Unfortunately, Wanted has way too many flaws to warrant plunking down your $10-$12 to see it in the theater. At best this is a rental. Or if you are patient, wait for it to make it onto HBO or Showtime.While it has an interesting premise, begins with strong set-up and features some great action sequences, the negatives outweigh the positives. The acting is fairly weak, the development of the protagonist (McAvoy) is rushed and unrealistic (even with my disbelief suspended), the overall pacing is way off, and the plot becomes more and more unbelievable as the movie unfolds. By the time you get to the final act you'll be shaking your head as it is just that bad.Overall, given the talented cast involved, I was unimpressed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Loved this!,"I caught this movie on TV and was amazed I hadn't seen it at the cinema. I thought the premise was good, the action scenes exciting and had me on the edge of my seat and the whole thing was intelligently done, McAvoy was believable as boy becomes man and Jolie was suitably understated. Jolie reminded me of Trinity in The Matrix and was a more grown-up role than Tomb Raider. I hadn't noticed McAvoy before and now want to see more that he has done. I didn't think that Morgan Freeman brought much more to the role than anyone would have done -perhaps I'm thinking again of The Matrix and how Morpheous was played.There were enough twists for it not to be too predictable and some nice plants on the narrative that made sense later on. I even rated the background music as being perfectly pitched to the mood and the action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A new low!,"The most surprising aspect of this movie is that Morgan Freeman would lend his talents to such a bomb. Filled with gratuitous violence and based on one of the silliest plots ever devised, this movie somehow manages to be boring and revolting at the same time. The film makers seem to believe that there is some correlation between entertainment and the amount of blood smeared. James McAvoy (a good actor) has his character subjected to numerous beatings any one of which would easily kill a normal human being. He survives by seemly dipping his head in white chocolate and then lying in a cold water bath. Angelina Joli who has a proved record as an actor seems bored through most of the movie even while she is inflicting brutal punishment on McAvoy. Although almost every character in the movie is alternatively a villain and then a hero, the real villains are the producers of this lame excuse for a film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Beautiful garbage.,"I typically never write a review on a film that I've already seen more than once, because I insist on the review reflecting my first (and strongest) impression of the film. But after watching Wanted for what must be the 5th or 6th time now, I suddenly felt like writing something anyway, so here I go.Let me begin by saying, this is one strange film. Strange in the sense that it's literally like a train wreck that you can't keep your eyes off because it's so fascinating to watch. And you almost feel sick with guilt and exhilaration because you're enjoying it so much. Violence never looked so gorgeous before...Wanted is about a guy named Wesley Gibson, who is such a hopeless, pathetic dweeb that even Google won't return any results when he types in his own name. He is ""rescued"" from his pitiful cubicle existence by a gorgeous woman named Fox, who recruits him into an organisation of assassins known as The Fraternity, supposedly because they believe he is the only person who can kill the man who killed his father. Little does he know just how drastically his life will actually change once he agrees to join them.The casting of the film is spot-on. James McAvoy has already proved himself to be a versatile actor and he is very believable as a weak push-over, who finds confidence in the fact that group of trained assassins apparently believe in his abilities. He also makes his character likable and fun to watch, because he delivers it with a sense of humour and you can actually relate to him because his situation is so understandable. Basically, he's just another slave to the wage, looking for a way to break free. This way is initially offered to him by Angelina Jolie, and who could say no to a woman like that... Ms Jolie plays a role that seems like it could only have been written specifically for her. Who else could play a beautiful and deadly assassin who's charismatic and covered in tattoos? She could and would kill you in a heartbeat, and yet you just want to be near her. Morgan Freeman plays Sloan, the leader of the Fraternity, and, well... I hardly need to elaborate on this one, do I? He makes pretty much every film he's in worth watching, and that's all I need to say.Now, I titled this review 'beautiful garbage'. That's not so much because the film itself is garbage, because it's not, but rather because the events portrayed in this film are so brutal and merciless that they could only come from a very dark and rotten place. The 'beautiful' is directed at the visual effects, because everything ranging from camera techniques to production design to action choreography is so beautifully done, so thrillingly eye-popping that it would almost make you forget that you're watching people get slaughtered, beat up and maimed. Tons of blood flow, brains are splattered against the wall and yet you can't take your eyes off that beautifully designed bullet. That awesome tattoo on Angelina Jolie's hand interlacing with the engravings on her gun. Those mind-blowing car chase scenes. That guy jumping through the glass out of a skyscraper just to finish his ""job""... This film is visual effects executed to perfection, elevating said perfection to a whole new level.It's all so pretty to watch that it would almost make you able to forgive the writers the overpowering lack of realism. Almost.The staggering amount of ideas and actions that are 98% of the time either inconsistent, improbable or flat-out impossible would in any other case surely put any screenwriter out of work. With a film like this, it's literally only the wrapper that makes the candy sweet. It just goes to show that sometimes, making something really, really pretty can make it worth watching, just so long as you're willing to suspend every inch of disbelief for the sake of watching pretty pictures. Nature, science, biology and every other form of technical factuality is being put to the test here, which is not to say it's basically just being thrown out the window... But hey, I can promise you you're going to get to see a guy get in a car the way you've never seen before. And a girl get on a train in a fashion that defies every rule of physics... It's all worth it for a totally cool, put-your-brain-in-stand-by-mode kind of action flick.Director Timur Bekmambetov has obviously tried his darnedest to make his mark in Hollywood with his first English spoken, big-budget effort, and may I say, he could've done a lot worse. Not to mention the fact that he has managed to recruit a few very big names to top the bill, this is definitely a Hollywood debut to be proud of. I can only hope he will continue to work with the same excellent crew in the future, because although only the sound department was nominated for an Oscar, camera and visual effects would have definitely deserved a nod from the Academy too.In a nutshell, Wanted is 110 minutes of gorgeous, eye-pleasing nonsense with great action and one very beautiful lady... I for one can't wait for the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Delivers what is promised,"This is a bullet-hell movie with great action scenes. So, sure some of the action is unbelievable when looked at in isolation, but in context it all fits.You don't view Superman and think ""this is stupid, there's no physics that explains why he can fly"", you don't view the Matrix and think ""This is stupid, there's no physics that explains why they can dodge bullets"". You don't go into the theatre for an Avengers movie and think ""that metal suit doesn't obey the laws of physics"" and you don't come out of the theatre for a Star Trek movie complaining that spaceships can't work like the way they do in Star Trek.In much the same way, you can't judge this movie because the characters have a genetic ability to act extra-fast and to cause bullets to bend - that's basically the only suspension of disbelief you have to hold (all the rest of the movie is common hollywood fodder that even the best blockbusters have).Complaining about hollywood-physics in a movie that advertises itself as a bullet-hell action movie is silly. The movie is incredibly well-acted, very well-shot and well-directed and has a plot no more unbelievable than any of the highest-rated action movies on IMDB.The only reason it loses one star (I am giving it a 9/10) is for the 4 or 5 cheesy lines in the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"If you believe real world physics is important, this is not for you!","In classical Greek mythology, three sisters, known as ""The Fates"" were responsible for allotting life spans to humans. One of the sisters spun cloth which represented a human life, whilst the last sister cut the cloth, which ended a human's life at some point in time. ""Wanted"" offers a variation on this story with a millennium old secret society, known as ""The Fraternity"" supposedly reading cryptic writings found from clothe they weave and thus determining who 'fate' has decided to terminate. The Fraternity are assassins with almost super-human capabilities.That is the prelude to this movie. We are then introduced to Wesley Gibson (played by James McAvoy) in the present day. He is a put upon office worker who secretly wishes for a better life. One day it appears that someone is trying to kill him and Fox (played by Angelina Jolie) comes to his rescue and informs him that he is descended from a member of The Fraternity.Eventually Gibson decides he wants to be part of The Fraternity and become an assassin like them. His initiation is very brutal and bloody, so, on that level, this movie isn't really suitable for youngsters as the violence and gore is quite confronting.Stylistically, this movie is a bit like The Matrix...using similar kinds of visual effects. If you like realism in your movies, this popcorn fantasy/action movie wont be your cup of tea. Jolie makes a playful yet deadly assassin-it's an interesting performance.This movie will appeal to people who like to daydream big...here, the central characters are like Greek heroes...demi-gods who dwarf the abilities of ordinary human beings. The Greek connection is also kept up with some plot elements...the story of Wesley Gibson has elements of Greek tragedy to it.You can't honestly say that this movie always makes sense...incredible action scenes will hopefully make you miss all the plot holes of this movie. It's Hollywood style wish-fulfillment. The question is asked of the audience ""What are you doing with your life?"". The script-writers seem to imply that unless you are a highly effective killing machine, your humdrum life is worthless.Presumably writing derivative scripts is a step up from Gibson does for a living.A derivative but enjoyable movie. Very violent though. Not as good as movies it 'borrows' from, like The Matrix etc.69/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Garbage Is Still Garbage, No Matter How Much 'Style'","I tend to give great ""visual movies"" a look, even if there is a 50-50 chance the film might be ""rubbish,"" as the Brits say. Sometimes I am delighted to find a stylish and well-made film or one that is goofy but harmless and fun. Other times, as in this instance, I find just one thing: garbage, as we Americans say.This is pure garbage, sad to say, despite the ""stylish"" action scenes, which are somewhat of a ripoff from the Matrix movies where the film-makers are obsessed over showing slow-motion shots of bullets flying through the air and then smashing into someone's forehead. Hey, a couple of times is fine but non-stop? This is non-stop violence, which tends to get boring fast, especially when it's combined with profane, unlikable characters.I swear, the lead guy, played by James McAvoy, did nothing but scream for at least 10 straight minutes early on. He, and this film, are really abrasive. This isn't a ""good guy"" in the bunch here! At least give us someone to root for, not a bunch of sleazebags. I didn't even finish the film.

Not only is the special effects mindblowing, but the story is also something completely different from what you've seen before. The critics complain about that the movie isn't realistic. Well - if those people want a realistic story, they should watch CNN news instead of a movie. The Lord of The Rings wasn't realistic, but still it's rated as one of the best movies ever made.

Fantastic.,"I quite enjoyed this film. First off I would say that one needs to go into it with the proper expectations. This is an action movie people, not Fellini. But, what I consider the ""new generation"" of action movies. It may be rife with explosions and car chases, but it's still got an intelligent edge to it. There is some wonderful subtle humour which I completely appreciated.James McAvoy (my new favourite actor) plays Wesley Gibson who is feeling very much like a cog in the proverbial machine. Or perhaps even just a bolt on said cog. His job sucks, his girlfriend sucks, his apartment sucks... you get the point. The thing I found refreshing was that McAvoy portrays this role very convincingly and naturally. You don't feel it's contrived or forced at all. He IS Wesley Gibson. Ever since Office Space and Fight Club, Hollywood has caught on to and played off the concept of the anonymous office underdog becoming the hero. It may be something many people can relate to, but those of us who can relate to that feeling of lost identity in the cubicle farms of America also DON'T appreciate being pandered to. This is what makes McAvoy's performance so brilliant in this film - he is utterly natural. He even had me cheering aloud for Wesley's triumphs at a few points! The basic setup is this: Wesley Gibson suddenly finds his droll life flipped upside down when he is told that he is the son of the greatest assassin that ever lived... and now he is being recruited by an order of assassins to join the ranks. Gibson is faced with the classic internal struggle of whether to take a leap of faith and leave the comfort of his current life (which he hates), or take the easy road and stay safe... and miserable.Angelina Jolie plays one of the aforementioned assassins. I am not a big fan of hers. She's not a bad actress per se, but is highly overrated - and frankly not all that versatile either. In this role like most others, she's still very much Angelina rather than her character ""Fox,"" which is her biggest weakness. That being said though, she actually toned things down and managed to not try to steal the show from the leads. There is some nice backstory on Fox which lends to your interest in the character.Morgan Freeman is lovely as always. I don't think this man could turn in a bad performance if he tried. His character is also well written with some good details adding to the depth of his performance. Terrence Stamp also makes an appearance, leading to an all out well-rounded cast.My only gripe about the film is that the end did seem to drag out a tiny bit. There's a bit that I figured was the end... and actually would have totally been fine with it ending there and leading to a sequel (even with a very obvious lead up like that). This happened twice, sadly.Overall though, the action sequences were fairly original in both setup and cinematography, the dialog was realistic with a dash of wit, and the subtext of the internal struggle to both find oneself and push oneself to strive for higher goals was a much appreciated and integral addition to the film.A good time through and through. Go see it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Hard to swallow taking the loom targets on faith alone,"A thousand years ago, a clan of weavers became assassins for good calling themselves the Fraternity. Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a loser office drone. Then Fox (Angelina Jolie) saves him from an assassin. She tells him that he comes from a long line of assassins and somebody is trying to kill him.As much as Wesley finds the world so annoying that he needed to be medicated, that's how I felt about the visual style at first. Director Timur Bekmambetov does a too good of a job portraying Wesley's anxiety. The action is uniquely ADD. It's fun until it's not. McAvoy is playing the runt of the litter. He's a great actor, but his character complains too much. Jolie is the cool killer, and Morgan Freeman is the wise sen-sai. As for the loom idea, it's a tough pill to swallow. At least Dexter investigates his targets before killing them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

It's something you'll have to see at the movies. Unbelievable scenes you have to watch over and over -- either for artistic value or just because they kick ass. Great score. An interesting and thought provoking plot. Excellent special effects, some of which haven't been seen before or have been done in a stylish new way.

"Stupid, gratuitous violence...","that I enjoyed very much. This is definitely a guy movie where your willful suspension of disbelief will be thoroughly tested. If you can get through the movie without saying ""Bogus!"" more than once or twice you're doing very well. However, the main character is fun and appealing, even though he starts out as a wuss. So too is Angelina Joline, although she looks almost as emaciated as a holocaust survivor (Come-on eat a cupcake or something!). She does a good job with her character throughout the film. There are times where the plot or dialog are so outlandish that I found myself smiling at the screen out of amusement. ""The Godfather"" or ""Gone with the Wind"" this film is not. It won't receive any awards, and it doesn't deserve them, but it is a fun movie and a good way to spend a hot humid summer afternoon if you and a couple of your buddies are looking to get out of the house.

You Make The Choice,"Wanted has to be one of the best films of 2008 so far. The action is incredible and remains consistent throughout the movie. Watching this I felt like Angelina was the real deal, I could definitely picture her as an assassin in real life. James McAvoy is a very likable character, definitely a step up from the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Then there's Morgan Freeman. Seeing a gentleman like him wielding a gun might just be why this movie is memorable. While some claim this film to be a reminisce of Matrix, I would have to disagree, because the storyline is truly original. Curving guns and shooting wings off a fly? you can't get more awesome than that. With its comic book essence, twist turning story line, I would think that anyone would hope to be Wanted.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Russian touch, Scottish charisma","This gonzo visionary-pop Russian director ('Day Watch,' 'Night Watch') makes his Hollywood debut with a splashy actioner, unoriginal and even more unbelievable in its far-fetched graphic-novel-based story of a meek man turned super-hero but striking for the craft of its details and featuring a central character who gives things a fast-beating heart and draws you in by seeming as scared by his exploits as you'd be.To fit an American movie mold Bekmambetov throws aside the fantasmagoric Russian vision of his sci-fi vampire spectaculars and focuses on chases and battles, but from scene to scene he maintains an exceptional level of craft. Apart from car and train chase scenes that outdo most others, this is a veritable treatise on superhero ballistics. You've seen the slow-mo magnified bullet thing before but he makes them a little more psychedelic and surreal, his ace shooters so precise their bullets meet in midair and we see them collide and split, even if they're curved to go around obstacles. The Bekmam is evidently still excited by what he's doing and he rises to the bigger challenges like gangbusters.This movie damns all logic. A car jumps up over another car and upside down the driver picks off his victim. In a gorgeous climactic sequence a long train crashes down a mountain ravine caught at the top, undulating like a giant Slinky, while adversaries do battle within and without. Moments like this are satisfying to look at for their color and texture as much as for the cool preposterous way things dovetail and whip around; the movie never falters in maintaining its energy and distinctive look.The film stars Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie as familiar, if elegant, arch villains, but there's a new guy on the block: James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson, the timid, terrified, unwilling débutant killer-trainee they recruit, whose to him unknown father was one of them and who therefore is found to possess genetic peculiarities that make him capable of paranormal feats of mayhem and carnage. His ""panic attacks,"" for which he pops tranquilizer pills daily while trudging back and forth to a demeaning office job as an accountant, are a sign that his heart can go up to 400 beats a minute and his adrenalin can pump so hard he can see and shoot off flies wings. Yeah, well, you had to be there.'Wanted' is full of stretchers, but they are what make possible all the splendid visual tricks. They'd quickly pall, though, were it not for McAvoy's humanness as the meek, trampled-over Wesley, whose overweight, obnoxious female boss Janice (Lorna Scott) makes life at the office miserable, while his best friend (Chris Pratt) is screwing his snippy girlfriend (Kristen Hager). McAvoy, who has played the Scot that he is notably in 'The Last King of Scotland' (a virtuoso role despite being overshadowed by Forest Whitaker) and a wide variety of Brits, including the victim in 'Atonement' and a disabled punker from Dublin, not too surprisingly reincarnates himself completely not just with an American accent, but a whole American young guy's voice, maybe a little like the young Tom Cruise's but sweeter and less needy. It's an act of ventriloquism and rebirth as cool and astounding as any of Bekmambetov's gimmicks and as essential to the movie's success. Hard to praise McAvoy too much or to think of any other actor today who could have brought such vividness to his initially meek character and still take up the physical demands of such a role with comparable energy and verve. This guy is talented. It was obvious he could handle all sorts of emotions and personalities, and now he turns himself into a hyperkenetic hunk. So two gifted foreigners smash into Hollywood blockbusters with a bang here, the Russian director and the Scottish star.And this movie is a lot of fun, even though the rather creaky comic book mythology of the secret order of weaver-assassins who need to recruit a new guy to take out a rogue member just gets hokier as it goes along. The ""Loom of Fate"" that spells out the next victim in a code of warp and weft? You have to take it all on faith, but that's easier when things are flying through the air.We've had convenience-store-pharmacy shootouts so often before they're getting to be a standard scene, but the one early on here that makes Wesley's intro to Fox (Angelina) and the ultra-violence of The Fraternity (the assassins society) is so violent it recalls the over-the-top joke gross-out one in Gregg Araki's underrated 'The Doom Generation.'Morgan Freeman as The Fraternity's boss-man Sloan is typically authoritative but his hectoring, sententious lectures to Wesley quickly grow tiresome; Jolie's Fox however has an offhand panache. Her role has been criticized as underwritten, but she does plenty with the will-timed monosyllable, the cunningly displayed tattoo, the anorexic arm extending an outsize silver pistol, and the pouting lips. Her performance says if you've got it, you can just flash it; you don't have to flaunt it. As an essential foil to Wesley's panics and ebullience, she is dashing and cool, and between them there's a kind of low-burner romance both are too busy to indulge in. To see Fox draped upside down on the front of a speeding Ferrari with guns blazing in both hands is to realize what a long way female, like black actors, have come as American fantasy heroes--leaving reality in the lurch.But while there's a ton of stuff you can learn from comic books, most of that gets lost in the noise of screen adaptations, even though the hokey Walter Mitty platitudes about living life to the full are compensated by some truly wonderful physical feats and ocular trickeries. This is not like every other $75 million action movie (and Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk cost twice as much, by the way).",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A Nutshell Review: Wanted,"A young man stuck in a mundane job suddenly got pulled out of it by a beautiful dominatrix, and into a world where it seemed like he's The One savior to rid the bad guys from the face of it. When the trailer first came out, there was word that hey, it's the Matrix all over again, this time with one of Hollywood's latest ""it"" boy James McAvoy (it rhymes too) in the starring role of an indestructible superhero with a penchant for the gun theatrics. Save to say though the storyline for Wanted is anything like the 1999 Wachowskis movie, for the sole fact that it's many miles away from the various philosophical musings that ploughed deep into the Matrix world.Based upon a comic book series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, Wanted is Russian director Timur Bekmambetov's first foray into the English language Hollywood big-budgeted blockbuster, and if you're looking for a no-brainer summer popcorn movie, then Wanted would be right up your alley. It's noisy and in your face, it's spruced by special effects, it has immense violence and it's littered with so much profanity, I thought Bekmambetov might have felt it was standard English. For those familiar with his Russian science fiction works in Nightwatch and Daywatch, Bekmambetov brings about the same distinct style of his in delivery high octane action, and balletic gunplay that would probably rival John Woo in the business, set against pulsating rock music, and plenty of bullet against bullet, in shots so cool, it deserved to be repeated again, and again, milking the one trick in various screen situations.From the onset, you know you're in for a ride that requires a suspension of belief. Wanted sits right up there with any superhero movie, because the characters all perform superhuman stunts, from leaping out of buildings unscathed, to possessing prowess that can be trained in weeks, to the creation of a Lazarus Pit equivalent to heal all bodily wounds. If any assassin can plough their trade as demonstrated in the story, I guess all of us have got to be afraid, from their 100% accuracy from 10,000 miles, to - wait for it - curving a bullet around the bend via a flick of the wrist. OK, so all these might appeal to even the most jaded action genre fans, as it's honestly something that is refreshing, especially since it combined effortlessly with the visionary visuals of Bekmambetov.But Wanted gets plagued by lazy storytelling, even by standards for no-brainer action movies. The first few intertitles compressed the timeline from 1000 years to just 6 weeks ago, and undoubtedly the ending too reeks of carelessness and the same super summary. All these to tell a story of the transformation of McAvoy's Wesley Gibson from The Narrator to a Tyler Durden equivalent, complete with the account of daily drudge with easter egg visuals filling up the screen, as he channels his energies into the right direction of assassination after being accepted by The Fraternity, undergoing a training regime equivalent in toughness as experienced by Kung Fu Panda. Picking up skills from Gunsmith (Common), The Repairman (Marc Warren), the Butcher (Dato Bakhtadze) and The Exterminator (Konstatin Khabensky) - there you go, the equivalent of Crane, Mantis, Monkey and Viper - he's chief tutor is the ultra-skinny Fox, played by Angelina Jolie.Now we all know Jolie's body comes tattooed, and in her movies they usually get the full makeup treatment to mask them. I'm not sure if those are authentic tattoos on Jolie, but I guess they do provide you a hint at how they adorn her body. While not quite your Trinity type, she thrives on a whole lot of adrenaline that would make a drug junkie blush, and gets assigned the duty to train the rookie in the ways of The Frat, whose motto Kill One, Save A Thousand, she believes in wholeheartedly. I can't remember watching Jolie on screen and quite anorexic looking as well, though her new found uber-svelte figure gets featured in some of the best action sequences in the movie.As mentioned, you've got to leave your logic prowess at the door and leap into fantasy mode so that the action here would be plausible, and sometimes ridiculous to boot, especially when some unfortunate attempts at humor found its way into the mix. And I can't help but to laugh out loud when a crucial plot development sounded like a rip-off/broken record of another famous trilogy that will go unnamed here, which in actual fact can be seen coming from a mile away.But there is a saving grace to its limited intelligence though. It's a timely reminder again of how absolute power over life and death corrupts absolutely, and what's there to stop corruption at the top when they have the means and the firepower to exact changes? And given anything that is prone to human interpretation, you'd come to expect some form of corruption, as folks at the top skew things in their favour, either for self-preservation, or climbing Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It explored this very quickly, mainly because it had to make way for more action, but I thought it was a somewhat good effort to have it included, no matter how small. Oh, and many things in the movie also went unexplained as well, so don't try to spend too much time figuring out how to harness the power of an extreme adrenaline rush.For those who like their screen violence graphic, unadulterated and unflinching in slow motion, reverse motion, and pulling out all tricks in the special effects book, then Wanted is for you. Otherwise it'll just be another routine exercise that is all style and little substance, something which most reviews tend to harp on, and I'll throw my 2 cents worth of contribution at as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

I'm surprised someone was saying something about the writing it's actually well written. Also this is my 890th review which is really cool!

Poor plagiarism,"Like something you would get if you removed half of Tarantino's brain and told him to do a remake of Rocky. An insult to whatever genre it contends it is in.

And the meek office boy eventually stands up to his horrid boss and says, ""Shut the #$$@ up!"" Who woulda thunk? Like finding tires on an automobile.Lots of borrowed special effects that will make you long for radio – unless you are thirteen, in which case you will think them way cool.

Why not?,"First of all I want to say that I enjoyed this movie. It is very different from the usual action flick and very, very imaginative (even if some scenes go a bit far in imagination.Russian director Timur Bekmambetov does quite a good job in the action scenes, and you can notice some of his own style, previously seen on 'Nochnoy Dozor' (Night Watch). He get's to work on a smart and inventive side of the movie and that was the good point of the movie.We have actors with some good names here, Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie and James Mcavoy. I appriceated this last one's performance, as he achieves to deliver a serious character, and run some few gags during the movie, specially in the beginning where the scenes have some humor. Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie were kind of reduced to a secondary role I think, but it is always nice to count with these Academy Award winners and I also wanted to comment on the fact that Angelina Jolie brings up some class, style and of course beauty to this movie.At last but not least, the plot. I thought it could be well improved in some parts of the movie, because I noticed some holes in the story, but I also enjoyed some elements in the movie that were quite interesting, specially the part, when the screenplay gets the final twist.Finishing up, 'Wanted' is a fast, vertiginous, action-packed and inventive movie, that really reminded me of 'Shoot 'Em Up' because of it's crazy action. So before watching this movie, just turn off your brain and watch this movie with a different vision of it. That's what I did, and it worked - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
What have you done lately?,"Greetings again from the darkness. Combine ""Sin City"" and the ""Bourne"" series, toss in some humor and add a significant amount of violence and action and you get director Timur Bekmambetov's film version of Mark Millar's comic book.Suspension of belief is a requirement for enjoying this movie, but if you can do that, it is actually a good bit of fun. James McAvoy in his first action hero role, while Angelina Jolie is utilized to perfection. By that I mean, she smirks a lot and prowls around like a panther flashing that very unique face and body of hers. Think of her in ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" ... not a lot of dialogue, but plenty of fast action. McAvoy proves to be a good mix of ultimate slacker in the beginning and transformed assassin by the mid point.The basis of the story is actually very creative. McAvoy is the lone offspring of the world's deadliest assassin, but he is stuck in a office cubicle being bullied by his fat, female boss at work and humiliated by his not-impressed girlfriend at home. The rest of the film features him trying to find out who he really is. Well, actually he spends the rest of the film learning to unleash the assassin buried inside! The action scenes are stellar and push the envelope. The opening sequence featuring David O'Hare (""The Departed"") is one of the coolest scenes you will find. Also impressive is the longest train wreck ever presented on film. Lending a hand in all of this is Morgan Freeman as the leader of the Fraternity, rapper Common as an assassin, Terence Stamp in a brief, but crucial role, and the under-appreciated Thomas Kretschmann (""King Kong"", ""U-571"") as the rogue assassin everyone is out to kill. All of this is capped off with an excellent Danny Elfman score and some Nine Inch Nails headbanging.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Incredibly hedonistic, Wanted is an adrenaline rush","Wow! Russian director Timur Bekmambetov sure made an impressive Hollywood debut with this wantonly executed action flick. Wanted will blow you away with its unbelievably slick action sequences and satisfactorily unique story loosely based on a Mark Millar comic.James McAvoy (Atonement, Last King of Scotland) pulls it off as Wesley Gibson, an anxiety-ridden cubicle drone with a boring billings job. His life turns 180-degrees when he meets Fox (Angelina Jolie), a hot assassin who clues him in on who he really is. Both are believable in their roles and feed off each other's energy. The supporting cast isn't too shabby either, except maybe for too trite casting choice of Morgan Freeman as the leader of the Fraternity of Assassins, but I'm just nitpicking.Incredibly hedonistic, Wanted is an adrenaline rush. Gory, yes, but violence shouldn't be glamorized anyway, so if you enjoy it, you better put up with it. Look forward to the sequel, which is already in the works. Meanwhile, Bekmambetov's famed vampire series may be worth checking out till then.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Stupid fun,"When I found out they were making Wanted into a film I was slightly intrigued. I had read the comic book (of the same name by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones) several times. Although I am not an all-out fan of the comic, the subject matter was definitely interesting enough to warrant a good movie. I later found that the movie would deviate greatly from the comic; all of the comic's original ideas seemingly replaced by trite and overdone action movie concepts. Thus, I watched the film with low expectations, hoping at least for a mindless action film. The film exceeded my expectations, and, with a little suspension of disbelief, proved to be an interesting and entertaining interpretation of the comic. While I still believe that the original concepts from the comic (supervillains ruling the world) would have made for a more innovative film, a guild of assassins is far more accessible to the general public, an interpretation that may irritate some die-hard fans of the comic but not counterproductive to the film itself. Much of the film follows in this fashion. Concepts are introduced that are more of an exercise in the suspension of disbelief. Some may find the bullet curving antics and concepts of fate distracting, but dwelling on these insane concepts takes away much of the fun of the film. It's a dark comedy along the lines of Fight Club with intense, albeit silly, action. The R-rating is well deserved as the script is riddled with obscenities, both verbal and visual. The acting is nothing special, A-listers Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman offer standard performances. Protagonist James McAvoy does make an impression as a disenfranchised blue collar worker turned assassin. Visually, Wanted follows the pattern of many modern day action films, rife with bullet-time sequences and over the top car chases. Wanted does not offer much in terms of substance, but its fast pace action is sure to entertain those who welcome it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Marketing Team Doesn't Sell True Benefits of This Film,"I initially had reservations about seeing this film, even as a free advance press screening, because of how the trailers portrayed it. Scenes of Angelina (good actress, but isn't she getting ridiculously typecast at this point?) in various states of dress and performing inhuman acts just didn't entice me. I was very pleased as the plot progressed to see that this is merely an initial rush of smoke and mirrors and the real meat of this film doesn't really involve her much.The plot is pretty simple, so I'll spin it quick. Basically Wesley is a doormat and hates his life until an assassin introduces him to a group of assassins known as the fraternity. The reason he is chosen is that he shares a bloodline with another member. They train him and prepare him to be an aggressive assassin instead of a pushover. I like the way this movie transitions Wesley's change, even though it's kinda preachy a la ""Fight Club"" and a little too much too fast. The plot moves with the sleek finesse of the fraternity members and always keeps you interested, especially with twists that are much less predictable than recent films and don't require a stretch of the imagination. The whole film comes together with a satisfying ending that leaves smiling. While the film is a little on the testosterone-induced macho side, I don't see it being all that uninteresting to the typical female viewer.Jolie (who plays as Fox) delivers another good performance, one that is nearly perfected at this point because it's basically recycled. She's beautiful in form and stimulating to watch, but I can't help but thinking that it's Angelina playing Angelina, not a character. Freeman (as Sloan) delivers an intriguing performance that changes the dynamic of his acting as of late. While he still commands the scene like most films, he is playing an interesting new type of role that allows him to be more lighthearted in his later projects. While I enjoyed Freeman's performance, I must still give the golden star to James McAvoy (who plays the lead Wesley) on his stellar jump into a new type of film. He moves the plot with a convincing transition from doormat to bad ass and somehow keeps your eyes focused on his presence even when Jolie is around. As an actor I really know from a random role in ""Swimming Pool"" and as the Faun in ""Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe"" I must say he molds into the action lead role nicely; bully for him. The supporting cast does a good job to back these top three, many character actors you'll recognize from various projects, and it all comes together in a nice neat package.It won't take home any significant awards this year and it will join the many films that are chock full of beautiful babes, hardcore killers, and intriguing setup. The difference is that your film buddy won't be able to predict more than about 1/3 of the twists correctly, which is refreshing with a formula that has been rather overdone. Its a good time and doesn't disappoint for all audiences, especially action junkies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
You seriously must be kiddin' me,"What I have to say won't occupy much space and time, as well as this flick does not occupy many neurons. I realise that most of the viewers will say that this is an action movie and it does not need to pack too much, but seriously now... We have Angelina, who has less lines than that bitchy boss, so that makes me consider she was placed there for her fame and beauty. Then, we have Freeman, a nice voice and character for the all-knowing boss... And, a bunch of thugs, each good at a particular job... Oooookaaay, and there's the plot: your dad was the shiznit, so you must be exactly like him, start taking hits, and throwing bullets like you were born being this science-fiction super shooting hero. The entire movie seems to be exaggerated, and the only thing that made me watch it until the end was the fact that i was really expecting something. But then again... So, you must be seriously kiddin' me with this story line... I'd like to believe that the script was made during that famous script-writer's strike, cause it smells like ""roses"" big time. And oh, yeah, use Jolie and Freeman on a title, and, of course, the audience is guaranteed, but what about the quality?

A hyper-violent thrill ride (in a good way),"Wesley Gibson (played by James McAvoy) has been beat down by life at the ripe old age of 26. He hates his job, he hates his boss and when he catches his girlfriend cheating on him with his best friend, he doesn't even have the nerve to stand up for himself. So imagine his surprise when it turns out that his long lost father is a super-powered member of a secret guild for assassins and Wesley has inherited his powers. Wesley is so adept with weapons that not only can he (literally) shoot the wings off of flies; he can do it on his first attempt.It's at this point that Wesley meets up with Fox (played by Angelina Jolie). She introduces him to a world where the rules no longer apply to him. He's above the law as long as he's a member of this assassin's guild called ""The Fraternity."" Wanted is based on a controversial comic of the same name written by Mark Millar. It will be hard to believe for those that see the movie without having read the comic book, but the film is actually toned down. ""The Fraternity"" has their own code of ethics. They are doing what they feel is right and are unconcerned with and unapologetic for any collateral damage.They train Wesley in the ways of their world: special baths that accelerate healing, the power to slow down their perception of time (thereby increasing their own reaction time) and the ability to bend the trajectory of bullets. And let's be honest, it looks pretty damn cool. Tooling around Chicago in Dodge Viper, killing bad guys and using Angelina Jolie to make your ex-girlfriend jealous makes for a fun Friday night in my book.""The Fraternity"" teaches Wesley an odd mixture of slavish devotion to the group, fate and sense of elitism masquerading as individuality. Think of it as Fight Club meets The Matrix by way of Ayn Rand. Eventually, ""The Fraternity's"" true nature is exposed and Wesley is forced to choose between those three things. He chooses individuality and takes on ""The Fraternity"" single-handedly in a final showdown. I apologize if you consider that a spoiler, but that's pretty much the standard story arc of movies like this, so I don't feel it's to terribly revealing. Wanted, at its core, is an adolescent revenge fantasy. But it's a slickly made one.James McAvoy is an inspired choice as Wesley, a much harder role than it would appear. Wesley needs to be convincing as both a put-upon office drone AND as tough-guy super-assassin. McAvoy deftly handles both ends of that spectrum, and also manages the transition between the two.It would be easy to say that Angelina Jolie is wasted as she has very little dialogue. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Apparently she personally cut many of her own lines in an effort to make the character of Fox more mysterious. Mission accomplished. She conveys so much through her silent reactions that when she does choose to speak (and trust me, when Fox speaks it's because she chooses to) it carries a much a greater weight.Morgan Freeman (in a role clearly intended for Samuel L. Jackson) plays Sloan, leader of ""The Fraternity"". What can you say about Morgan Freeman? He couldn't turn in a bad performance if he wanted to. He was suitably ""Morgan Freeman-y"". (Yeah, that's a word now.) The actions scenes ooze cool but the movie needs a very large suspension of disbelief. If you go into this movie wanting to say things like, ""That could never happen,"" you will have no shortage of opportunities. If you can't allow yourself to get caught up in the movie's universe, it will all just seem silly and vapid.Wanted is a hyper-violent, nihilistic thrill ride that is bound to offend as many as it exhilarates. But it worked for me.On a scale of 1 to 10, with The Matrix being 10 and Johnny Mnemonic being a 1, Wanted gets a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Totally ridiculous movie but still fun,"Wanted is one of the most over the top films I've seen in a good long time. There is no real logic to it, but the director Timur Bekmambetor, who did the Day Watch and Night Watch films, never tries to take his movie seriously. The characters don't either, and seem to be enjoying themselves immensely, so I decided I would watch this movie and not take it seriously either. The three main stars, James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, and Angelina Jolie do well with their roles, but it is McAvoy who really steals the show from the rest. I enjoyed it.Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) is an account manager at an office. He is neurotic and allows his boss, girlfriend, and best friend to walk all over him. His life changes however when he meets Fox (Jolie), and he soon discovers that he has superhuman abilities. It isn't long before he is recruited as an assassin into the ""Fraternity"" which is a secret society led by Sloan (Freeman) and has been around for 1000 years. All the other people in this society have the same abilities as Wesley, and they use their abilities to make life better for normal people. There are also a couple more surprises which I will not reveal.This movie is nonstop action with some snappy dialogue, especially from Wesley. The other's have their time in the sun as well, but like I said earlier, McAvoy, who has never starred in an action movie with such intensity, shines the brightest. The stunts are unbelievable and mostly CGI, but they work well in a movie like this. I was never bored, and really loved the final scene at the end of the movie.If you are stressed at work and have always wanted to get even with co-workers that you don't like and know you never could, watch Wanted and you will feel much better. I must also insist that you do not take this movie seriously. If you do you will most likely hate it. Have fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

So 5 months and one huge Christmas advertising campaign later i picked up the DVD and i was not disappointed.With the amount of comic book movie make-over's occurring on a monthly basis, this adaption of Mark Millar's graphic novel series could well have fallen by the way side, but thanks to some fantastic action sequences and stellar performances by Jolie, McAvoy and Morgan Freeman this summer blockbuster attempt really impressed me. The plot is very Spiderman-esquire and does enough to sustain interest throughout; moreover it leaves a certain degree of suspense at the end so i'm sure we can expect a sequel for 2009/2010.

Wanted is just another ridiculous ACTION & THRILLER movie,"On IMDb this film is tagged as ""Action | Thriller"". Basically, I walked into the theater expecting action packed movie NOT a ridiculous comedy movie.Now, don't get me wrong - i liked several scenes, jokes, but the liner at the end of the movie and the humor + action mix badly. Thats why this movie fails in delivering and please don't dare to compare this piece of garbage to a masterpiece such as ""The Matrix"".This movie isn't a comedy and isn't classified as one anywhere, its entirely patched with ridiculous clichés while the whole concept of curving bullets in the ""real world"" is really hard to feed to your brain (even shutting it down would not help).Instead, one could have watched Scary Movie 3 but at least know its a stupid comedy / parody with some patches of action taken from action movies such as the Matrix etc..In a summary: lots of scene were ridiculous especially the opening scene where the guy flies from a building to another (add the poor music with it) it seriously sucks!! At that point I turned to my friend and laughed. I even watched that same scene again on YouTube and I wouldn't change my mind regarding how poor it was.The rats kill the whole movie at the end as its really the dumbest encounter that no one would expect of an action/thriller movie.Angelina Jolie acting was perfect but was physically and anorexic thin. It sort of made her acting looked ""fake"" as she seemed to struggle when she had to carry heavy those heavy weapons to pump some action.. the chasing car scene was enjoyable yet over saturated by unnecessary cuts here and there to ""fill in the blanks"" and make the scene last longer (e.g Angelina Jolie spreading her legs, bending forward on the car with her gun...)i do agree the acting was perfect. However, the script was terrible and over-hyped. In addition, the story is easy to follow but gets ridiculous and exaggerated and you will have several ""WTF moments"".Overall: 5/10 ( if not even less, but I'm being generous for my first review of a movie)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted- kick ass adrenaline!,"Best thing about this movie is its pace. I was so glued to this pacey action flick that I forgot having sip of my coke and pop corn till intermission! It reminded me of movies like Speed and Matrix. Sheer adrenaline and nothing else. The story revolves around James McAvoy's dull life and how he is losing everything. There comes our super sexy Angelina Jolie to pull him out of this mess and taking him to where he belongs- the world of non-stop action. It's a world of assassins called Fraternity and he is one of them. Based on calculations done by Fate- a secret society, these assassins with gifted skills are killing their targets. James, now in his new avatar of assassin is getting trained by Fraternity-led by Morgan Freeman, building his super skills and stepping into his father's shoes. Yes, his father was an assassin too and been murdered. James is now after his father's killer but there is more that meet his eyes. He is slowly getting close to reality which is not what he was told. What is that truth? Will he finally take revenge of his father's death? These answers are the crust of the story which is brilliantly supported by special effects and its star cast.James as a loser and trying best to come out of his dull life has done a superb job. He is true to his character. He was brilliant in his earlier venture-King of Scotland too. Angelina is rock solid in such kick-ass roles and did a wonderful job this time too. Though I was bit disappointed with Morgan Freeman as he did not have much moments but Wanted is more about actions scenes and special effects. The scenes where the shots take turns in the air and hit the target, early car chasing scene and how these assassins kill their targets are brilliant. I agree that all these stunts are next to impossible in real but the way these scenes are clubbed with the pace of movie is mind blowing. The director is fast in narrating the story that you actually don't get a second to think what and how its happening. I suggest all you action freaks should give it a try.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A thriller but gives a black comedy-vibe,"""Wanted"" is a comic-book epic about Wesley (James McAvoy) who is kidnapped by a gang of brilliant assassins.

Maybe I would like it more if I was a fiction comics fan,"The weak point of this movie is the absurdity of the story itself, it's so unreal that the film could never ""catch me"" into it.

Freakin' Bullet-Bendingly Awesome!,"I saw the trailers for it, and I have to admit that the tattoo's showing on the back of Angelina Jolie, made me wanna see it just a little bit more, what can I say, Im a man.But WOW! This movie is awesome. I read on here that people say that its not realistic, its too much like matrix... Was Matrix not an excellent movie, with the exception that you had to watch it a few times to understand it. People.. Listen, Its a movie, its not supposed to be realistic, and especially about bending bullets, come on. Anyone expecting to see a movie that is realistic, when in the trailers it pretty much shows you people bending bullets, what would you expect? Action is over the top (but its awesome), CGI over the top, (but its awesome) no guidelines for reality (but its awesome). Well worth seeing at the movies. Ignore the comments about it being stupid, and not realistic, well DUH! I could have told you that before seeing the movie. One of the best movies this year you all need to go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Fast-paced flick with a few flaws and similarities.,"What to say about this movie that hasn't been said? First off, it was pretty much just a rip on The Matrix, all with the physics-defying moves and the bullet curving and the slow motion, but I think that's the point of it. I mean, it continues the Matrix-style, but it never really fulfilled it. In the beginning, you see Wesley Gibson as a man, and the narrative was just like Edward Norton's Tyler Durden. A man who is stressed out in his daily life, and talks about the things that interest him (in this case, the keyboard). In the beginning, you see Wesley as a bullied person, by his over- weight boss who uses the stapler to make him more stressed, and also by his best friend who has sex with his girlfriend and calls him a ""pussy"".Angelina Jolie's character comes in, saves him from Cross, who is supposedly the man who killed Wesley's father. She takes him into the Fraternity, where he is trained into an assassin. You see him get beaten up, get stabbed, and also get threatened. You find out that Wesley's stress level is just adrenaline, which helps him to become an assassin.I found the ""curving bullet"" to be a cool idea, actually. When it was used in the ending, when Fox (Angelina Jolie) used it to make a round-house suicide, it was just corny. But the bullet colliding was good, too.When you find out that Cross is Wesley's father, I was very disappointed. It was just another fail at an attempt to make a plot change, and make you go ""Oh my God!"". And how they explained how he was his father, and how he was trying to protect Wesley from going to the Fraternity was terrible. I mean, he was shooting him on the train, so how could that be ""protecting"" him?There are some flaws, but I found this an alright movie. It isn't the best, and I don't think it's really worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Ridiculously Awesome!,"I just got back from seeing ""Wanted"" and it was amazing! It was a lot of fun, a really great popcorn flick. I'm not going to waste time explaining the story because you can just read a synopsis. It was filled with action and some dark humor. What surprised me was that it was a pretty funny movie. I enjoyed Wesley's sarcastic narration especially.The action was ridiculous of course. If you're not a fan of violent films then you won't like this one. It is a really blood shoot-em-up, but loads of fun. The action sequences are ridiculous and had people in the theater flipping out and even standing up clapping. The humor was great, too. I thought that all the actors did a good job as well. James McAvoy was great as Wesley, Morgan Freeman as Sloan, and Angelina Jolie as Fox. If all the action and humor still don't make you want to see this movie, Angelina Jolie will. Brad Pitt is a lucky man. I don't want to reveal anything too great, but she has the best booty ever put on screen. When this movie comes out on DVD I will be putting my pause button to great use!All in all it was a load of fun. Tons of action, some great humor, and ridiculously hot Angelina Jolie! Any fan of action films has to check this out because they are in for a thrill ride. ""Wanted"" doesn't disappoint and will keep you thoroughly entertained until ""The Dark Knight"". I highly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Yep. Everything They Taught You Was A Lie (Natch!),"Dazzling (but, at times, preposterous) visual effects aside, ""Wanted's"" 2 major flaws were - Taking itself way too seriously - and - Being in dire need of some genuine comedy relief.In my opinion, the daunting and downright heavy-handedness of Timur Bekmambetov's direction was what clearly prevented ""Wanted"" from becoming the fun, roller-coaster-ride-of-a-film that it was surely meant to be.To say that ""Wanted's"" story was pure, nonsensical garbage would obviously be an understatement of the highest order.""Wanted's"" story concerns ""Business-As-Usual"" for a 1000 year-old organization called ""The Fraternity"" who seem to be doing a really terrible job of maintaining their deluded idea of ""Order-In-The-World"".All-in-all - I'd confidently say that ""Wanted"" was well-worth a view. But this recommendation comes solely on the merits of ""Wanted's"" wild, over-the-top visuals, and, definitely, nothing else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Nothing new in this film,"Nothing new in this film, just a number of Hollywood cliché's, including the sob story told by a narrator in the third person, which ultimately turns out to be their own sob story, and even the Star Wars idea of the central character seeking to avenge their father's death, only for the villain to say ""No, I am your father"".The rest of the plot comprises of special effects, absurdity (laughing AT not WITH the film), excessive blood and shooting and swearing and achieves nothing by doing so. James McAvoy totally lets himself down in this role- he was brilliant in ""Last King of Scotland"", but doesn't do himself justice as soon as he starts speaking in a pretty naff American accent. His character isn't that believable, and his excessive swearing makes him more unrealistic, instead of realistic. The rest of the cast, including veteran Morgan Freeman, are paper-thin characters, which also lets them down as actors. As the characters die, it is difficult to be upset as you barely know them or sympathise with them.Although there were some interesting twists in the end, they fail to salvage a film that's only purpose was to try and lure people in with mindless violence, blood and bad language with very little substance. The script is also quite poor, like many modern action films. In my view, this is trying to outdo Goodfellas in violence, bad language and blood, but otherwise would fail miserably in competing on the scale of quality and credibility. A further demonstration of unoriginality in Hollywood film-making.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
wow....,"When i went to this movie i didn't expect the get blown away... well i was... this is the best movie of the summer so far... (the next batman movie will probably end up being better).

Once again just like always Morgan Freeman was flat out great and he had his funny moments in the movie... and i also like how he played his role in the movie... he does a great job playing the role he did.... Angelina Jolie was also just flat out great in this movie too... she did a great job playing the role of fox... during the entire i never would have guessed what happened... James McAvoy did a flat out amazing job also...

The camera angles were flat out great, the script was amazing, the way the movie flowed was perfect and i couldn't believe what i was seeing for the most part...

This film is one of the first in a long time to be really entertaining but at the same time forces you to be introspective. This is not a film for the simple minded... this is a film for people who love great film and can appreciate the inter workings of film making. WANTED is a masterpiece that forces you to appreciate life in a way that has never been done before. It is not a feel-good movie. It is an awesome movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Entertaining But Totally Disturbing,"This movie has potential. James McAvoy does a decent job in his role as an average Joe who transforms into a ruthless killer. Angelina Jolie works her magic as a goddess of sex and death and Morgan Freeman knocks 'em dead with his spot-on portrayal of the paternalistic but decidedly sadistic ring leader. The action is non-stop in a nice way; what the movie lacks in substance it makes up for in awe-inducing effects that suspend us in a state of mindless, heart pumping excitement.What I cannot *fathom* is why the creator of this film had to ruin what would make a perfectly entertaining if not terribly enlightened summer flick with disturbing violence that takes on a distinct fetishistic quality and morals so distorted they could hardly be called such. Wanted end's up bordering on a snuff film; or at least someone peaking inside the fantasy of an angry teenage outcast who plays too much Grand Theft Auto. It takes the concept of coming-of-age, rags-to-riches and twists it into a mangled horror-show that says one thing above all else: Killing is Cool. Being a human being with no friends, no life and no heart is bad ass and really gets the girls - it's what makes a man.The hardest part about watching this film is that I could not hate it. It had it's funny moments, it had a likable main character and profound special effects. Clearly, however, somebody decided that they needed to make a mindless action/thriller into a powerful, daring statement about society and instead created a vicious abomination. Somebody ought to have stepped in and made some changes before this piece of action-packed filth got to theatres. This is NOT anything you want your kids watching. In fact, I think it really says something about the people who participated in the making of this - these are not people who make acceptable models for our youth. This sort of thing ought not to make a single penny.In the end, the only thing that ""Wanted"" really kills is any idea of responsible film-making.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Very entertaining film, but the action is a little too zany.","The thing I love most about Wanted is the dialogue. It's incredibly witty in several cases and very sharp. And the best part is it's not just a singular character that supplies all the memorable quotes, either. The characters played by James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, and Angelina Jolie respectively all have their moments in the film's script.But you will notice in my title it says that the action is too zany, and here's what I mean. The first car chase with the Viper is brilliant, and it has lots of phenomenal driving- just enough to set it apart from other chase scenes without making it look corny. But all the action from that point on is simply too wild for me. There's just no way in the laws of physics that someone is going to launch a car in the air, rotate around in a rolling motion, all while shooting the person in the car you are flying over dead. It just doesn't happen, and neither does someone shooting a pistol at an angle that lets the bullet curve all the way around the perimeter of a circular room. I have no limits when it comes to films having zany or over-the-top plot lines, but I think every movie needs to abide by the laws of physics, unless it is a fantasy or science fiction, which Wanted is not.But other than all of that, Wanted is a great film, and is very underrated. All three of the main cast members deliver stellar performances that go together nicely with the several witty lines that you will hear in this film. Wanted also has a very satisfying ending that will make you say when you get up from your favorite movie chair- ""Man, that was a fun movie.""So if you don't mind tons of violence and LOADS of cursing,and you can get past the over-the-top action (although some may like the style), you won't be disappointed by Wanted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Put it on your most wanted list.,"Leave your brains at the door, you won't be needing them. Though that isn't necessarily a bad thing. For thoses tired of blockbusters pretending to be otherwise (Prince Caspian, Grindhouse) Wanted is a true breath of fresh air. A action film that knows it's an action film, and doesn't pretend to be anything more or anything less. Though a great cast and a tired but still superb plot help. But as far as action goes this is some of the most fluent and nail biting action I've seen since The Matrix all the way back in 1999.It's unlikely action hero James McAvoy who shines brighter than anybody else, though slightly irritating at the start of the movie one his kick-ass side develops he is every iota the James Bourne beta we were looking for. Though credit must go to the suburb Morgan Freeman and the shimmering Angelina Jolie who both sweep away the competition as some of the greatest action movie characters to date. Though Wanted may lack the smarts of Casino Royal of The Bourne Identity, it very easily Makes up for all of that which is lost simply because of its outstanding action sequences. Wanted is never dull and never boring and only ever silly, but who really cares about that? Night Watch director Timur Bekmambetov helms his first English-language feature film with this big-screen adaptation of Mark Millar's action-packed graphic novel. Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a cube-dwelling hypochondriac whose uneventful life has become a mundane blur of terminal boredom. Repeatedly humiliated by his boss and constantly cuckolded by his cheating girlfriend, weakling Wes seems to be living right down to everyone's expectations that he would never amount to anything in life. However, upon discovering that the father he never knew has been brutally murdered, the spineless, clock-punching pushover is recruited into a secret society of assassins known as the Fraternity.During the course of his training, the man who was once an office-bound wimp develops lightning-fast reflexes and superhuman dexterity courtesy of his skilled mentor Fox (Angelina Jolie). Upon completing his training, Wes is assigned the task of dealing out death to the mythological Fates, who possess the ability to alter the lifelines of mortal men.Jolie is all wolf, kohl-eyed and coldblooded. But for all her lethal skills (and drop-dead physique), there's something approachable about her. She plays Fox with a hint of sardonic remove and a touch of down-to-earth grit, as if this pumped-up killing machine hasn't forgotten what it's like to be one of the girls. She puts her cat suit on one leg at a time.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed Wanted and it ranking just behind Cloverfield as one of the greatest action flick of 2008. With only minor stumbles Wanted glides through its fluent action sequences with no problem what so ever. Though non-of us like that part where Morgan Freeman swears. He's too nice for sh*t like that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Great Action,"Wanted (2008)** 1/2 (out of 4)James McAvoy plays a common man who has a girlfriend cheating on him while he's at work with a boss his hates. One day he gets swept up into a league of assassins and learns that he must avenge the murder of his father. This is the type of action movie that not only asks for you to turn you brain off but also asks that you rip it out, shred it up and then eat it down just for entertainment. This movie doesn't contain a single shot that doesn't have some sort of CGI going on, which to me is a major drag but at the same time you have to give the film credit for its imagination, which is on overdrive from the opening scene to the closing credits. The plot of this film really isn't all that important, although you could call it a dumbed down, male version of Le Femme Nikita. The reason people are going to jump at this film is for its action sequences, which are all very entertaining as soon as you learn not to take them very seriously. If you take the movie too serious you're going to wonder how, in the first chase sequence, the fastest car in the world can't out run an assassin driving a beat up truck, which probably couldn't hit more than sixty-five miles per hour. The other action scenes including killing someone from a L-train, a train falling off a bridge plus countless other explosions with some including rats. All of these scenes will keep you entertained but for my money they aren't great scenes since all of them are faked with CGI. Give me The French Connection or any Buster Keaton film for real action. For a video game the stuff here is good but I could never call them among the greatest ever made. The performances are better than you'd expect from a popcorn film with McAvoy once again impressing me very much. He perfectly captures his character's weakness early in the film and is believable as the trained killer. Morgan Freeman is pretty much wasted as the leader of the cult and Angelina Jolie at least looks good in her brief nude scene.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

In my opinion, Ideas are the most important thing in a movie. If you have a fantastic idea, even though it's only a action, it could still attract many audiences. I think I've been attracted by the film. But there are also some problems in the film. Some scenes are too violence, and there's too much blood and head-shots.

But make no doubt about it - this is his movie & he carries it off even though the movies seems like one long car, train, bus chase. OK there is a plot of sorts about a Fraternity & some father/son issues but basically this is a cartoon comic book that is there to fill up our summer hours. I would have liked a little more sex & a little less violence but all in all it was a pleasant enough movie going experience. But please skip the sequel - spare us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Great action movie with great acting,"I think before watching Wanted, people need to be aware of certain things... First, the premise of the trailer is as good as the movie. However, Wanted is not another cliched action movie. The tone of the movie felt real and raw just like in the comic book. You better believe it when the MPAA classified this movie as ""Rated R for strong bloody violence throughout, pervasive language and some sexuality"". You will also find action sequences and special effects that you've never seen before.
The storyline is a cross between Office Space, Minority Report, and the Matrix. James McAvoy plays the role of Wesley Gibson who is this average guy working in an office from 9 to 5. He seems to be living a normal life, yet boring to death. One day, he gets recruited by an old fraternity of assassins. They train and turn him into a professional killer, someone with a status. But there's a twist to the story so I won't say much not to spoil the moviegoers.
Not only was James McAvoy convincing playing a geek through his full force acting but he also did a very credible American accent. Angelina Jolie plays the role of Fox as one of James' mentors. She exuded sexiness and confidence on screen as usual. I was pleasantly surprised to also see the musician Common in this movie playing one of the other assassins. Overall, I think this movie delivered.

Too far over the top,"A guy near the bottom of the well of his life is offered a new life. A life totally different from the one he is living now: the life of an assassin.When I saw the trailers for this film I was thinking it was going to be a brainless action film with lots of collateral damage, a flimsy story and some nice looking scenery, but overall a good sense of amusement. When the film started that thought was proved rather quickly. I had been wrong in one point though: the amusement factor. That last one was quickly broken when scene after scene went over the top and a lot of scenes did that so far that every sense of reality (and with that tension) was broken.To me it felt like the film tried for too much at once and eventually toppled itself over while it could have been a lot better.

Wanted,"WantedWanted is one of the biggest blockbusters of 2008. It was based on loosely on the comic book miniseries by Mark Miller. It was directed by Timur Bekmambetov, and this was his first American film after the very popular Russian film series, Night Watch. It made over 50 million in its first week and came in second at the box office.Wesley Gibson(McAvoy) is a nobody trapped in a boring world. His wife cheats on him, his best friend is a backstabber, and he has a boss that won't get off his back. When an assassin named Fox(Jolie) tries to initiate him into the Fraternity, his life is changed forever. He learns that his father was one of the best assassins in the world, and he must no walk in his footsteps. He leaves his nothing life and joins the Fraternity. He must undergo a grueling initiation, and then hunt down the man that killed his father.Wanted has decent character development. Wesley Gibson is a three-dimensional main character. He has problems with his drone life, and has a desire to get out of it, but never tries to do anything about it until the assassins come along. He is given unique personality traits like apologizing too much, and this does become funny later in the movie when it becomes sarcastic. Wesley changes a lot in the movie, something that is missing from most action flicks. The problem with the character development is that supporting characters are lacking. Sloan(Freeman) is the leader of the fraternity, and he doesn't become anything more than Morgan's usual Mr.Wise. A secret about him is revealed at the end, but it still doesn't help too much. Fox doesn't become anything more than the awesome assassin. The only thing they did to help develop her was to give her some background information. She could'vie had less development, but she still needed more. Cross, the man who we think is the main enemy, isn't very well developed either. He is in the same boat as Fox. He's given background information, but is rarely seen doing something other than shooting a gun. The other fraternity members don't have any characterization at all, like the Repair Man and the Gunsmith. Some of the characters are even stereotypes, like the mean boss and the snobby girlfriend.Wanted has a good plot. It is structured well, with Wesley not being able to turn back after Act 1, and a great setup for the climax after Act 2. There is even symbolism in the movie with a draw bridge coming apart. It symbolized the end of Wesley's old life. There are many obstacles put in Wesley's path of killing Cross. The screenwriter made sure that becoming a Fraternity member wasn't an easy challenge. Wesley has to suffer through multiple beatings, fighting an expert with knives, and other grueling challenges. There is a great twist in the middle of the movie, which made the movie way better. The ending is very entertaining. It starts off with a big bang that was planted since the beginning of Wesley's life with the Fraternity. There is constant fighting with some very creative kills. There is even a very nice trap set for the lead villain. One problem was that the action was either overdone or illogical in parts. In one scene, Wesley hits a man with a keyboard, and letters fly off spelling a phrase I'm not aloud to repeat. Also, some of the car stunts are stretched too far.Wanted does have unique settings. Wesley's apartment being next to a train is a good setting because it shows how sad his life is and foreshadows later events. The office is a good place to show how average his life is. The textile mill is a good place to put the Fraternity as it seems true to what the Fraternity is about. The meat packing part of the Fraternity is cool also and makes for a good place to fight. The battle on the train was good for the hot spot of the middle, and it was even better to place to on thin tracks going across two mountains. This leads to much more tension in the battle when the train falls off.Wanted has a very good director. It was a smart choice to pick a foreign director to get a new perspective on things. There is good lighting. It's bleak in Wesley's apartment, well lit in the office(like all of them), and it is about as dark as it should get The director does a good job of adding to the atmosphere. In the beginning we feel like we're stuck in a suck life. The Fraternity has a gritty, yet stylish feel to it. The music in Wanted is great, and it adds a lot to the atmosphere. We also have a few good rock songs thrown into the mix.The special effects aren't award winning, but they're good. The train falling off the tracks and cars jumping over each other look believable. The sound editing is good too, with the sounds of bullets hitting people and cars running into each other sounding very real.The acting is great. Morgan Freeman is always a good actor, although I would like to see him in a different role. James McAvoy played a great lead, reminiscent Edward Norton in Fight Club. Angelina Jolie was the weakest of the group, but she was still believable. She also should'vie been the weakest as she had worse material to work with than McAvoy. The minor actors, like Wesley's best friend, do good jobs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
In opposition to Adriennelontano's Critique: Wanted is the best film of the year.,"Wanted indeed has it all, and it is all fantastic. James McAvoy draws the audience in from the very beginning with his expert performance. His chemistry with Jolie is unrivaled in comparison with any on-screen duo in films out this year. The first ten minutes of the film were the most intriguing and visually stunning minutes to be found in the Action genre. Be prepared for a wild ride with the fast vehicles, violent escapades and emotional twists found in Wanted. Instead of listening to a few irrational viewers' reviews, check out Wanted. Because if you're looking for a gritty, exceptional alternative to the ho-hum films being thrown at families during this holiday season, you'll want Wanted.

"WANTED (Timur Bekmambetov, 2008) **1/2","I was let down by this Russian director's vampire saga of NIGHT WATCH (2005) and DAY WATCH (2007), so I had little interest in this over-the-top actioner (the generic title did not help)that is, until I realized it was adapted from a comic-strip by the same man behind the ultra-violent superhero flick KICK-ASS (2010), which I loved.If anything, the film is fast-paced, unrelenting in gravity-defying action a' la ""The Matrix"" (indeed, so extreme is the approach that this could well be dubbed ""When Bullets Collide""!) and engaging enough in plot to be tolerable. Still, James McAvoy does not exactly convince as action hero – nor is Morgan Freeman credible as the brains behind a group of rigorously-trained assassins (whose severe beatings are eventually cured by undertaking a wax bath)! On the other hand, while I could not care less about the gossip-mongering style of Angelina Jolie's private life, her casting is ideal – though the role itself seems to be merely an extension of her MR. AND MRS. SMITH [2005] characterization – and slinky presence obviously easy on the eyes (the fact that an old flame of mine is not just the exact same age as Ms. Jolie but is practically her spitting image never fails to arouse yours truly!); besides, it is nice to see Terence Stamp in anything these days.The mayhem, then, is interpolated with quirky humor (particularly involving McAvoy's messy domestic situation and his relationship with an insufferable and obese female boss) and, for what it is worth, the plot undergoes a 360-degree twist at the finale (resulting in a jaw-dropping mass execution/suicide via one solitary bullet).",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Gluttanous Eye Candy with No Sustenance...Entertaining to a Point,"Lacking the Wit of ""Hardcore Henry"" (2015) or the Grounding Sophistication of ""The Matrix"" (1999), this Over the Top of Over the Top Exercise in Expressionistic Extremism is Entertaining to a Point.But the Breaking Point is Reached Quickly as the Brain Turns to Mush and the Stomach Wretches at the Obnoxious Portrayals of the Characters that go through all the Motion.

From a 7 to a 4,"I saw this movie when it came out ages ago. I only just read the graphic novel out of curiosity. As a movie, it's watchable, and even enjoyable. Just like everyone else said, it's a worse version of Matrix, but it's still a pretty decent movie. But compared to what Mark Millar managed to do, it's a load of sh*t(head). What happened to the mass-murderer Wesley? the one that kills and rapes for fun? The amazing plot line of the graphic novel has nothing but NOTHING to do with the movie's. Where did they get the idea of threads? Seriously, where does that come from?The movie has nothing to do with the GN and if you despised the movie, give the book a shot. I had so much more fun reading the GN than watching the movie. I give it a 4 for butchering the story.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A mindless action flick with outstanding performances,"Many comic books and action and fantasy films focus on empowerment. The protagonists of many of these (think...Luke Skywalker, Peter Parker and Harry Potter) are thought to be rather dull people. Of course, no one knows about their secret identity/life. Usually, these characters are taken out of their normal day by an older, wiser figure and taught the ways of a hero. Wanted is just this, with James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson, a boring account manager being whisked out of an ordinary life by Fox (Angelina Jolie). Ms. Fox is what I'd call a ""super-assassin,"" and she hands him over to Sloan (Morgan Freeman). Sloan reveals he is heir to the skills of a master hit-man and has a place in the Fraternity. The Fraternity are a secret society that was formed by an order of weavers receiving coded messages from the ""Loom of Fate."" These messages give them their targets who they are required to assassinate.This plot is merely a way for Timur Bekmambetov (from Night Watch and Day Watch fame) to stage some truly amazing action sequences. And when I say amazing, I really mean it. Although many of them defy all laws of physics, they provide escapist entertainment in the highest form. The train sequence is probably the most intense and mind-blowing scene I have seen in an action movie this year. Since this isn't bidding for an M rating, the fights are bloody and gruesome, in particular, Wesley's training process. Headshots galore mixed in with brutal fist and knife fights pervade the fight scenes, but in a good way. Through these scenes, we are left to decide: ""Are these guys really that good?"" Throughout the film it seems that question always sprung into mind, which lifted this from a mere blockbuster level.The acting is good from everyone involved. McAvoy, boyishly charming and sometimes scary, carries off a tricky role and proves he can hold his own in an action movie as well as literary adaptations. Angelina Jolie, looking gorgeous as always, has never been more charismatic on screen, unfortunately, she has barely any screen time and about 6 lines. If ever there was a case of an actress being underused, this is it. Freeman plays the usual father figure in the first half, but takes an unexpected turn in the climax. In a year filled with lackluster summer blockbusters, Wanted serves up the good. A cast with great chemistry, stupendous and bloody action and enough twists, turns and surprises to fool viewers who think they know the story.Bekmambetov's Wanted is indeed wanted in this viewer's opinion. It may not be the best movie out there, but damn it, it is one of the most entertaining.3½/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Doesn't have much of a brain but delivers sheer, pure entertainment","At its peak in the late 1980's and early to mid 1990's, the action movie genre provided cinema-goers, perhaps for the first time since the Golden Age of cinema, with a broad, encompassing entertainment package that was impossible to resist: big-name movie stars, laughs, thrills, and excitement all wrapped up in an easily digestible package that doesn't require too much work to unwrap. Not that easy accessibility is a bad thing, especially during those times, when despite the audience's readiness to consume, filmmakers would still give it their all and each film was a labour of love.In recent years, though, with the novelty of the superhero movie increasing tenfold in popularity, the movie-going audience was provided with a new, easily consumable source for their excitement and entertainment which promised fantasy and science-fiction along with majestic action set-pieces, and the traditional action-thriller genre was reduced to shallow, bland fare such as xXx, Mission: Impossible III or Bad Company, with a few beacons of light such as The Bourne trilogy serving as anomalous but much-welcomed exceptions. Now, with Wanted, we finally get a clear-cut action-thriller that truly, sincerely, straightforwardly delivers everything we, the viewing audience, expect and call for to be entertained.The plot itself is really quite ridiculous, but naturally, it doesn't really matter. The thing is, Wanted grabs you right from the get-go and doesn't really let loose, right through the end credits. The action scenes  and they are plentiful  are so incredibly well-conceived, well-executed, and well-choreographed that one tends to easily ignore the rather silly plot devices employed to set up said action scenes. Car chases, hand-to-hand combat, intense gun fights: the film has it all, and every scene employs incredibly skillful craftwork in terms of choreography, stunt work, cinematography, editing and visual effects, of which there are many and which are impressively seamlessly integrated into the scenes, action-oriented or otherwise. The haywire cinematography and heavily rock-oriented soundtrack also contribute to the nonstop adrenaline rush of the movie.The strong cast also undeniably contributes to the film working so well. Angelina Jolie is majestic and ascendant as the mentor, and proves once again that she's quite a sufficient action star, combining grace and ferocity in her performance. Morgan Freeman is regal as the wise overseer, but also gets to prove that he has a tougher, rougher side. But the most impressive turn is provided by James McAvoy who, between The Last King of Scotland, Atonement and now Wanted, has proved that he is a truly talented leading man. And it's not just his spot-on American accent: McAvoy supplies another one of the major reasons why the film works: he provides us with a believable, down-to-earth character we can totally identify with. So just as he is in awe being pulled in to this new, intense, high-octane new world of conspiracies, car chases and lots of killing, we the audience are right along side with him.Ultimately, the great action-thrillers of years past, like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon, worked so well primarily based on that strong human connection with the lead characters. The action movies of recent years, besides being quite generic and bland in terms of their plot and execution, featuring by-the-numbers cinematography and the same stunts and action scenes we've already seen, are sub-par primarily because they lack truly down-to-earth characters we can genuinely identify with. Also, the film is so relentless in its over-the-top intensity, wild cinematography and haywire action scenes, I was so engaged in it that I didn't even feel the need to use my brain even once. So sure, Wanted doesn't have much of a brain nor much of a heart, but it delivers sheer, pure entertainment in its most absolute, heart-pumping, seat-grabbing, eye-popping form.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Lame,"Yet another teen wet dream on the screen. Any adolescent could dream up such a (Hey look at how cool I am) story. I myself (23) daydream now and then.

somewhere between absurdity and reality,"Like so many modern Hollywood moves ""wanted"" looks and sounds great but is a poorly conceived and written and is ultimately not a good movie. It's another in a long list of movies that is technically excellent but uninspired and unfulfilling.What killed the film for me was that it was utterly ridiculous from top to bottom. From the opening scene you think you are watching something like the ""Matrix"" but the movie never gets around to explaining how these assassins attain superpowers. If I could train hard for a few months getting the sh*t beat out of me and bathing in krispy kreme sugar and somehow develop superpowers to defy all know laws of physics, I would get started right away. It wants to look and feel like reality, but unlike comic book movies like ""Ironman"", it asks you to swallow way more implausible nonsense than you may be able to stomach. In fact, ""Ironman"" looks like a documentary compared to this noisy, overdone ""rollercoaster"". I did not know going in that the movie was based on a comic about superheroes and supervillians. They should have committed more to that...there effort to make the movie ""real"" just made it a sloppy mess.So it's a fantasy film that I found difficult to get into. The action is well done, the effects look great, but its another case where you are lucky not to have an epileptic fit by the first hour from all the flash cutting and gimmicks. Half the movie is in bullet time.And then of course there is the loom, which is just a retarded concept and in the face of everything else, I found myself rolling my eyes. If they had spent half the time they spent on effects working on the story, we would all have been better off.James McAvoy does his best with what he's given and its his performance that keeps the movie from slipping even further into the abyss.

Full of breathtaking effects but a shallow plot,"This Hollywood film of the same Russian director who made ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch "" is very similar in effects to his two-part sequel but lacks in depth of the plot. As usual, Timur is at his heights in turning one effect after another but the screenplay although interesting, is quite shallow for a Russian taste. What should we expect from Hollywood screenwriters anyway? When they started talking about the ""Assassins"" - I thought they would go further to their roots - in the Alamut Castle in Iran, where the first ""Hassassins"" - Islamic ultra sect - was formed. (The word ""assassins"" comes from the name of this sect). If the Hollywood writers didn't know this, at least Timur could have helped. But no, they made it into a fraternity without much connection with history. Pity. Also, this idea of killing people who would do harm in the future is the same as in ""Minority Report."" On the positive side, the unexpected ""table-turning"" in the middle is quite refreshing. Also, one cute moment in the movie when the Russian guy is helping the main character to recover in some kind of pool, he is singing a famous Russian lullaby!

These guys (and girls) really put the ""ass"" in assassin -- twice! I was quite disappointed as the movie got more and more ridiculous. Jolie was so bad (worse than usual I mean) that I was almost embarrassed for her. I'm sure she laughed all the way to the bank. I have no idea why Kretschmann was in this film -- he's had so much work since The Pianist that I can hardly believe he needs the money that badly. I can say the same for Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp. Too bad.

"""This movie is painful."" Ambar.","The above statement made by my friend best describes the madness that lurks within Wanted. The recent rise of the number of no-holds-barred rated-R flicks takes center stage here as we experience one ruthless gutsy film that meshes stylistic choices of The Matrix, the Bourne series, Fight Club, and even 300. If you enjoy a good portion of unrealistic yet jaw-dropping action then this is the flick for you. However, it is not a mindless action movie, which it a turn-off to those that want to shut off their brain and enjoy the carnage within. Wanted is a decent flick full of attitude, pain, torture, bullets, and more bullets. Did I mention the bullets?Based off a comic book mini-series printed in 2003, Wanted follows a lonely, stressed, high-anxiety bottled-up blue-collar worker (This description screams LOSER) by the name of Wesley. Wesley constantly questions the world around him and his existence, but finds refuge during a brush with death after meeting the beautifully mysterious Fox. Fox introduces him to a secret league of assassins with special abilities, and there they discover that the son of one of these under-the-radar killers happens to be Wesley; and yes he has the potential to be something big. This new change in life has Wesley thirsty for more, yet the further he plunges into this underworld, the darker the motives become.We've had several lower-profiled strong action movies in previous years, but this one rises above all of them in terms of plot. Usually an action movie has a simple plot to set the film in motion, and the plot never weaves a web of uncertainty and surprises. Wanted drifts in another direction by offering plot twist after plot twist in the midst of all the action pieces. The script, well-written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, not only gives us a good adaptation of the comic book, but also thrusts all these questions about the morality of assassins in the 110 minutes. A thinking action movie? Does this actually exist? The acting is also good for a movie of its type. The main star James McAvoy hides his accent perfectly and does a good job portraying the tortured soul Wesley. While Angeline Jolie seems to have more screen time in the trailers than in the movie itself, she also plays her role well. Jolie will make you drool over her body, yet at the same time make you fear her because of her sharp eyes that can crush a soul. Morgan Freedman never disappoints, and delivers easily the best line in the movie (Don't expect it to be mentioned here). Timur Bekmambetov runs the show well by giving us nice long action sequences, and by fiddling with the speed of the movie many times. The energy presented on-screen more than makes up for the obvious displays of special effects and slower moments in the flick.However, there is a little-known flick that came out in September 2007 that delivers the same kind of over-the-top action, except much more of it. If you had not seen it, then it won't leave you disappointed in Wanted. But, if you did see Shoot Em' Up, you can't help but get the ""What if"" feeling when watching this movie. Wanted is decent, but is structured like an introductory film of a potential franchise; much like Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, Batman Begins, among others. Shoot Em' Up offers action only two minutes into the movie. Wanted could have been something really special if they threw away training montages and exchanged them with more assassinations, more insane amounts of action, and more bullets. Bekmambetov knows how to craft a good scene, and the best example is the final major gunfight towards the end of the movie (Prepared to have your jaw drop). Shoot Em' Up's lack of success can be attributed to no major stars, lack of marketing, and perhaps bad timingnot because of the quality. Just like Iron Man back in May, Wanted is good, but could have been so much better if we hadn't required time for introduction and transition from loser to killer. Wanted 2, if it comes, automatically has the advantage by not requiring backstory or set-up.Bottom Line: Don't let the last paragraph upset you, because odds are you never saw Shoot Em' Up, and odds are you'll enjoy Wanted regardless. But, if you did, Wanted goes by this equation: Wanted = Shoot Em' Up + Plot + Angelina Jolie + Morgan Freedman  Action Scenes  Intense Irony  Insane villain.Basically, Wanted is a good flick that sets up what can be one heck of a sequel. The director and writers have already proved that they can weave some intense action moments, so if the executives are smart, they would keep these men around. In the meantime, this movie is worthy of our hard-earned money as long as you are willing to be blown away and entertained yet at the same time think a little. Wanted earns a 7/10 from me, but a high 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Wanted is a surreal action flick that is a cross between The Matrix and John Wick with it's lore and over the top bullet time esque action sequences with a cool little twist in the final act that leaves you satisfied in the end. The acting too is pretty great and features a young 28 year old James McCavoy in what would probably be considered his breakout role that launched his career. While some parts may seem to lean in a little too much on the CGI with the bullets and what not, it's a minor inconvenience next to the amount of cool moments are within this action flick.

Slo-mo moves out of the shadow of The Matrix.,"n the midst of slow-motion action, gravity-defying leaps, bullet-time sequences and curving bullets, the hero puts on a pair of sunglasses, then promptly takes them off quipping ""Bad idea!"". Wanted belongs to the generation of movies after The Matrix that have benefited from the success of slo-mo stylized and choreographed action sequences. But Wanted distinguishes itself in the most prominent way possible: it enjoys what it is.Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a regular office cubicle-dweller who discovers, in quite style, that he is the son of a legendary assassin. Mastering his 400-beats per minute heartbeat to super-sense makes him one of the Fraternity, a group of assassins led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman) that exist as the hand of fate. As Fox (Angelina Jolie) says: Kill one, maybe save a thousand.Timur Bekmambetov, the Russian director of visual stunners Nightwatch and Daywatch, brings the same manic imagination to Hollywood that has become his forte. Kids with toys hardly come up with wilder sequences. These set-pieces occur in frequent intervals through out the movie with enough story filling in-between them to make the movie work, starting with a jaw-dropping gun-fight involving two skyscrapers. Almost all of the action is physically impossible, so the movie does require a suspension of belief. But having Angeline Jolie as the instigator of most of these scenes only adds to them; she resonates the screen with a coolness that makes it far easier to enjoy what could otherwise be quite absurd. Look out for her scenes with the red car  who else can pull that off with such charm? Morgan Freeman, as the leader of the assassins, is voice and presence. It is always a relief to watch Morgan Freeman play characters like Sloan (or The Boss from Lucky Number Slevin) after all the serious work he does.Surprisingly, after the movie is over and you have left the cinema, you are not left with just an imprint of some screenshots of visual beauty. Wanted has a life longer than usual popcorn summer movies. It has a rare mix of arrogance and humility that brings it closer to home and makes it likable in retrospect. Saying any more would be giving away too much.My rating --> 3.5 of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Hollywood is in danger,"if it start giving away production to a people like Bekmambetov. As you can guess i am from Russia, we had a lot of hype about this film here. i was watching it on a release date, painfully surprised by the ticket price (2 dollars higher then normal). now what i am going to tell you - first 10 minutes of the movie are god dammed promising. the whole scene is well filmed, and the effects are right where they should be. problem is, after that, movie just goes down all the way you can imagine - in the end its you actually don't know what to do - laugh at the incredibly weak plot, full of clichés and poorly connected threads, or cry because you know it was a lot of money invested in this piece of junk and still it failed.if you are a fan of special effects - then you might want to see this in a cinema, but if you want some more from a movie - do yourself a favor, wait for a DVD release. or don't wait and simply skip this one.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Thumping Good Action!,"""Wanted"" is a rip-roaring thrill ride that will keep you entertained from start to finish. I'm usually a silent movie-goer so it's a testament to the excitement generated during this film that on a couple of occasions I audibly vocalised my amazement at what was happening on-screen.The title seemed slightly arbitrary to me, but this may relate to the fact that the film is based a somewhat obscure comic-book series. However, the plot is patently derivative and owes as much to (the very over-rated) ""Da Vinci Code"" and (the very under-rated) ""Equilibrium"" as it does to the ""Matrix"" trilogy. But this potential weakness did little to offset my enjoyment of the story which delivers a cracking twist at a moment when you least expect it.Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a complete loser. His overweight boss terrorises him, his best friend is sleeping with his girlfriend, he apologises way too much, and cares only about the fact that he cares about nothing.Abruptly yanked from this humdrum existence by a shadowy band of assassins called Weavers, he learns from the leader, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), that he has to take the place of his long lost and recently murdered father. And so begins an inexorable advance to a showdown with his father's killer.The phase of the plot where Wesley uncovers his father's almost supernatural legacy introduces several colourful characters, chief among which is Fox (Angelina Jolie). Powered by the seething sexual tension between them, Wesley gradually awakens to the true extent of his latent capabilities. But then again, Jolie's deliciously-tattooed hotness is enough to awaken latent capabilities (supernatural or otherwise) in anyone.Unfortunately, intriguing plot elements like the history of the Weavers and a jaw-dropping new gun physics weren't developed more. But this is a petty point because there is already a lot of really good stuff happening in the narrative. Those plot points may contain the makings of a fan-boy sequel, but it is unlikely to attract the same stellar cast or live outside the domain of DVD-release. And that's a real pity because I do believe there is a still a solid prequel buried in there somewhere.Visually, the movie is an achievement. CGI is powerfully employed to generate violence and car-chase imagery that pays due deference to the graphic novel genre from which the story springs. Nothing revolutionary is presented per se, but Director Timur Bekmambetov has reworked definitive elements from other films and definitely taken them up a notch.The acting was the only truly questionable element for me. McAvoy may well be the darling of the new generation, but he looks hopelessly out of place all the way through this film. The benchmark performance for his role Was Keanu Reeves's Neo, who managed to sustain a convincing level of ""engaged blank-ness"" through three ""Matrix"" films. McAvoy by contrast seems incapable of shaking his art-house aura and makes a play for being serious. But he comes seriously undone and his fake American accent does him no favours at all. Jolie was closer to the mark and left the screen positively drenched with raw sexiness (and yes, it really is better on the big screen). Both Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp's performances were not given enough space, although Freeman does have a delightful flourish near the end.But despite being found ""wanting"" in some areas, ""Wanted"" is still a thumping good action movie. Watch it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Weird.... But Riveting,"So there is me. I like movies with plots. That make sense. That draw me in.And then there is Wanted. The plot is sorta minimal. It doesn't make much logical sense.But, oh man, did it draw me in!I sat there, almost open-mouthed, just staring at the screen as the movie played. Bullets that went bent around corners, plot lines that made little sense, but oh-so-incredibly well-done!I liked it a lot. And, interestingly, if you can deal with something quite different, I would recommend it.The cast is good, the direction is fabulous. And the action sequences are in a class by themselves.Enjoy it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
action is a rush but the rest of the film requires a leap of faith,"Wesley Gibson is the guy everyone can relate to: he hates his job, his girlfriend is unfaithful, his best friend has betrayed him, and life in general just seems like a big waste of time. Little does he know that his long lost father was one of the world's deadliest assassins, that is until his latest assignment cost him his life. Wesley is recruited by a mysterious fraternity to become his father's successor, but in order to do so he's going to have to endure hell. Loud, ugly, and incoherent, this one is sure please action fans with it's flashy, Matrix-like action scenes, unrelenting pace, and abundance of brutal violence, but at the end of the day it's hard to root for—or care—about any of these characters. **",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Morgan commanding and meaning business.The plot (son of assassin is sought out by special blah de blah opps because of possible special genetic assassin ability).Oodles of incoming swerving bullets, usually going either through the back of the head and splattering blood everywhere, or, swerving right around the head at the last minute, and meeting another very cool missile shaped bullet and splatting it like a pancake.Anyhooo...lots of action but don't get your hopes up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The best action movie in years.,"WOW, This is a movie I won't soon forget, it's like the film is planted in the back of my brain where it would never get out, the film from beginning to the very last word is just delicious and you find yourself asking for more when it's over just like a delicious meal you just ate but didn't have enough of. The best slow motion effects since The Matrix and the most profane characters since The Departed were shown in Wanted. And not to forget the most amount of violence every action fanatic would ask for. As far as the story goes, Wanted is a tale of a guy named Wesley Gibson who works as an accounts manager and basically lets others stab him in the back and treat him like crap. But soon he realizes that he is destined to succeed his father who was a specially skilled assassin and worked with other assassins who call themselves as 'The Fraternity'. As revelations are gradually made Wesley finds out who his real enemies are and why he got tangled up in his so called destiny in the first place.James McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, and I couldn't have asked for a better performance. He was phenomenal. I always enjoy his performances, whether he plays a physician for a notorious tyrant in The Last King of Scotland, or he plays half a human and half a something else as Mr. Tumnus in The Chronicles of Narnia. In Wanted, there is no difference, he is flawless at every angle and he does some awesome things in the film, from curving bullets to shooting people from a mile or two or even more away or even shooting the wings off of tiny flies. Nevertheless he had some serious actors with him who got their shares of bullet curving. Jolie who plays Fox and Freeman who plays Sloan, Both astonishing, as always. Amazing chemistry throughout the movie and the actors were just awesome.I would suggest a sequel for this piece of art. It was brilliant and has a plot twist that turned the whole film around, though a bit unrealistic, yet again really cool special effects, and did teach a little lesson about how we shouldn't let others step all over us, and even if a sequel doesn't come out, this will be a movie, as I already said, that won't be soon forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"""Wanted"" Nearly Awesome","Up until the last 3 minutes I thought Director Timur Bekmambetov's ""Wanted"" was the coolest movie ever made. The campy dialogue at its conclusion does the movie in. In context this is surprising. ""Wanted"" is completely over the top orchestrated chaos and violence, and classy camp is just part of the deal. Ultimately, the script douses the movie's innate genius and style. ""Wanted"" is blatantly reminiscent of ""The Matrix"". Writers Michael Brandt, Derek Haas, and Chris Morgan wrote their screenplay based on the graphic novel by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones. Unlike the cyber reality of ""The Matrix"", ""Wanted"" invents the mythology of the 1000 year old Fraternity—prolific assassins. The Fraternity terminates designated targets and maintains the balance of good and evil in the world. Theirs is a dark world of order and secrecy. Members of the Fraternity have the distinct inherited ability to control the adrenaline in their bodies. Consequently, they can seemingly summon great physical strength, speed, agility, and reflexes at will. As part of their Zen-like training they can curve the trajectory of bullets. They are the ultimate assassins. Angelina Jolie is amazing and so darkly charismatic as Fox, the Fraternity's elite assassin. James McAvoy captures the emerging hero Wesley, who is so disgusted with his ordinary life.Curved accelerating bullets, high speed automatic weapons blazing from a red Viper, and the cataclysmic derailing train during assassination attempt characterize the bold and maverick style of Bekmambetov's ""Wanted"". Most of the narrative shortcomings are diluted by the director's blinding pace—mostly.McAvoy plays Wesley, a panic suffering account manager working for tyrannical morbidly obese office manager Janice (greatly evil Lorna Scott). Wesley is hooked on anxiety medication, enduring his venomous girlfriend Cathy (pretty Kristen Hager). Wesley's co-worker Barry (comically dense Chris Pratt) is having sex with Cathy, which Wesley also knows. One day while Wesley is refilling anxiety medication prescription he encounters strikingly beautiful Fox (Jolie). Fox tells Wesley that his father, perhaps the greatest assassin who ever lived, was killed the day before. Wesley had thought his father had died soon after he was born. What ensues is spectacularly orchestrated carnage and mayhem with Fox, Wesley, and apparently the man who killed Wesley's father—Cross (silently charismatic Thomas Kretschmann). What also follows is one of the most amazing car chases in movies.Fox brings Wesley to Fraternity Leader Sloan (ultra cool Morgan Freeman). Sloan demonstrates to Wesley his legacy and innate gifts. He invites him to ""take control of your own destiny"", and join the Fraternity. After predictable soul searching, Wesley chooses to join the Fraternity. Fox is charged with transforming wimpy Wesley into the next great master assassin. Wesley endures unbelievable physical beatings and training, toward one end—avenging his father's murder. Here Angelina Jolie emerges as a powerful force. Jolie's Fox has an air of quiet gravitas and profound sadness. In a great moment she recounts her tragic past, and then tells Wesley, ""Kill one. Maybe save a thousand."" James McAvoy plays the lead hero Wesley, but it is really Angelina Jolie's enigmatic presence that resonates throughout ""Wanted"". McAvoy brilliantly captures the angst and thrill of the young man reconciling his great powers. Freeman leverages his regal and calculated persona as Sloan. Jolie embodies a samurai soul that serves ""Wanted"". As Fox she is strong, vulnerable, and all about honor. Jolie is perhaps the most stunningly beautiful woman on the motion picture screen. She is a compelling actor, who performs all the action with pathos and élan.""Wanted"" could have been one of the coolest movies of all time, had the story followed through and eased up a bit on the camp. That being said, ""Wanted"" is a brilliant wild ride with killer performances from Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy. Hold on to your seats.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Epitome of Everything That Is Wrong About Hollywood,"This film has got it all!! It starts with the brain-dead script, of course borrowed from a comic-book practically nobody has ever heard of!

Matrix meets Fight Club,"To be sure, this movie has tremendous parallels to The Matrix. The action scenes are thorough (and a little too long) but clearly show the work of an exceptional stunt and spec. eff. team. There are parts of the story which should have been developed better. And the writers tried to create (unsuccessfully) an Armageddon scenario.Cons: There is simply way too much graphic violence. People die in action films. But so many die in Wanted and the bullet to the head scenes are just over the top and way too frequent. They also use the CSI effect of travelling with the bullet through its ""target"" and out the other side, gratuitous splatter included, about two dozen times. There is also a lot of non-fatal violence which adds to the story but also gets excessive; lot's and lot's of lacerations, with good and chilling knife-like sound effects.Then there is the F-word. This film has no deficiency of F and MF. It's just too much. Here and there, OK, that will work. But it seems like the writers had a love affair with Howard Stern and it found its way in to the movie.If you like Angelina Jolie, you'll enjoy the brief view of her semi-clothed back side. She plays the same kind of tough but sophisticated chick as in the one she did with Pitt a few years back.I characterize the movie as Matrix meets Fight Club. It's dark, twisted, and violent with good guys vs. bad guys. The climactic twist, like Fight Club, caught me by surprise and I thought it was very smartly inserted.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A whole lotta fun,"The latest offering from the Russian director of ""Nightwatch"" is an exhilarating, effects-laden romp, that offers top-notch action but clearly does not take itself too seriously. The plot centers on an undistinguished office drone Wesley (James McAvoy) who is inducted by Fox (Angelina Jolie) into a secret brotherhood of assassins. Initially it seems that he was chosen to follow in the footsteps of the father he never knew, but of course things are not quite what they seem...There is no shortage of high velocity mayhem involving curving slow-mo bullets and spectacular vehicular acrobatics, particular kudos must go to an early scene involving a Dodge Viper. In addition, the script is smarter and funnier than what is usual for this type of film. The strong cast (which also includes Terence Stamp and Morgan Freeman) acquit themselves well and Ms. Jolie looks utterly divine- as always. All in all, this is an awesome popcorn movie that works extremely hard to entertain it's audience and, though violent, has a very hard time pulling it's tongue out of it's cheek. Definitely big summer fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
What A REALLY Good Movie,"I didn't expect much from this movie, however this was an absolutely fantastic movie with GREAT action and a thrilling storyline.We all know it isn't possible to bend a bullet, physics simply will not allow such a thing. That being said, I went into this movie with rather low expectations. However, I was blown away by the action scenes as well as the storyline. I didn't expect the storyline to be so deep and thought out. I was highly surprised at the end of the movie, as well as being rather saddened by what transpired. I won't give that part away too much.I don't recommend this movie for kids, especially the younger ones as there are a couple scenes that are pretty graphic with the violence. But I do recommend this movie VERY highly to those who love high action movies. Not only was I blown away by the ""bending"" of bullets, but I was blown away by the main car chase. That was some wicked driving by Jolie. Plus it didn't help that she's a 25 on a scale from 1 to 10, lol.Morgan Freeman, as usual, did a fabulous job in his role. Angelina Jolie was as HOT and sexy as ever. Before Wanted I has never heard of James McAvoy, but his performance was every bit as superb as Jolie's and Freeman's.Don't take my word for it, make sure you see this movie for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Interesting movie, but not the comic.","This is a difficult movie to review. It's based on a comic of the same name. If you liked the comic, then you can forget the movie. The movie shares almost nothing in common with the book. Only the title, The Fraternity, Fox, Wesley and the initial opening of the comic are in tact. Oh, and even though the names are there, the characters are nothing like the comic book counterparts. It's like making ""Spiderman"" only he wears no costume and doesn't have spider powers. Fox in the comic (AJ's character) looks pretty cool and wears an orange costume similar to Catwoman, but she is African-American with short hair. Now AJ in my opinion is a good actress and I think she's pretty attractive. But she looks nothing like the comic book Fox.So if you read any reviews on IMDb that say this movie sucks because it's not like the source material, then you can believe them. However, for this reviewer, having read the comic, I am glad for that reason. The comic book was about scumbags who rape, murder, kill and swear as if it was a day job. The ending of the book goes so far as to insult the reader and thus serving no purpose in the story other than to say that guys like the people who post on this site, are stupid and meaningless. Now the point of the comic may be to get us off our butts and do something with our lives, and that is a good point to make! I am a writer and make my own movies. I'm sure a lot of you guys are too, and like you all, I try to make what I can, and maybe something will happen in the future. I don't think my day job (just as crappy as the one in the movie) should judge who I am as a person. Now that I got that off my chest, on to the movie.If you accept the movie on it's own terms, you will enjoy it. Bending bullets, jumping off buildings etc, are all fine. I like fake action movies, they are entertaining and serve their purpose. The main complaint about this movie is the how the targets are chosen. But it doesn't really matter because how do you judge who lives and who dies? The fact is, is that Fox believes in their theory of fate choosing and believes in it so much that she makes a powerful decision in the end of the film.If that ending didn't occur, you could throw out the entire film, because the characters didn't buy it, so why should I? But because AJ makes the choice, she proves she does believe her version of ""fate"", so the audience has to at least understand why she did what she did. Saying things like, I don't believe this could happen, etc etc, is just foolish.It's a movie. Movies are fake, but the should serve one of two purposes. 1  to entertain us from our crappy jobs, where we cant tell the boss to F-off cause we have to support our families, or 2  to make us think about our lives, religion, society, history, our place in the universe etc. Wanted entertained me and for a few moments I did think about my crappy job and thought, maybe I could do something better and still support my family.Since Wesley is the protagonist, we identify with him and want him to succeed. Some say the movie is predictable. Well name me one action movie that's not? Now, don't email me telling which movies are not (I own 1900 dvds, original ones, not burned) and I know every action movie out there. But to say it's predictable is to say that I knew Batman would win in the end. Like come on, that's what genre pictures do. The deliver a formula which is sure to please and the better ones (like this movie) throw a bit of thought and excitement in too. Give it a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Same stuff with a different flavor.Watch it,has style.","'Wanted' is a good action flick.Stylish,Fast and having it's own dose of twists and turns.However, It would be unwise to compare this movie to a Cult Classic like 'Matrix'.The story does not have enough meat, the plot is having many a loophole, but James McAvoy does a decent job in carrying his role through. Angelina Jolie's character 'Fox' is much more believable as an assassin than McAvoy's 'Wesley' but probably this was how it was meant to be.Even when McAvoy goes through a complete transformation to a super killer from a door-mat nobody, he does not really look tough enough for his part though he makes up with his acting skills. The action shots are innovative.You would have seen similar stuff before but you can find a different stylized version here.The camera work is very good and the slow-mo effects does not sap the pace of the fighting sequences.That is a job truly well done.The story never reaches anywhere near the sublime dimensions of Matrix,so for a overall rating 6/10.(Angelina looks sexy but thinner,if you do not like action no point in walking into the theatre just to check her out).",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
no blockbuster here,"One of the more popular reviews on this movie at IMDb (by uniiq) remarks: ""As bullets curve, heads get punctured, hilarity ensues, and rats explode (peanut butter rocks, BTW), you'll smile besides yourself."" I'm sorry, did I miss something? Heads getting punctured is supposed to be hilarious? I love violent action films, and I enjoy 'black comedy;' but a good action film knows when to take itself seriously, and a good 'black comedy' knows that violence is painful, even when the events around it are absurd. Yes you can mix the two genres - ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a fine moment of this - but it requires a real delicacy.Which this movie hasn't got. The first third is an amusing look at a nerd who suddenly finds himself in a comic book world of professional assassins; the second third is simply unpleasant, the nerd's occasionally sadistic initiation into that world. The third act is high concept - ""James Bond in 'The Empire Strikes Back.'"" And unfortunately the concept doesn't work. Towards the end, although we know exactly what's going on, the film has lost it's focus just as a film - that is, as a story cinematically told - and we end up not giving a dam'.Finally, there's the acting - the nerd is a wimp, the supporting characters get hammy or wooden, and the actors who actually know what acting is don't have anything much to do here - including Angelina Jolie, who is almost completely wasted (anybody who thinks this movie is 'sexy' obviously hasn't reached puberty).Not a total loss as a dumb action movie - but blockbuster?

One of the better action movies in awhile,"Overall this movie was very good. I went into this movie expecting a thrill ride and thats exactly what it is from beginning to end. If you've watched the previews, you already know there is a lot of overblown action in this movie, however it never takes itself too seriously and a lot of it has surprisingly good explanations. James McAvoy does a good job in the lead role and makes a believable action star. The rest of the cast is sharp as well, with Angelina Jolie standing out very well. Its nice seeing her returning to this kind of role. There are some humorous moments in the movie to nicely balance the action and i think the director did a pretty nice job in the action sequences. There is only one thing that truly bothers me about this movie at the end but i won't give it away. However i will say that it is an insignificant detail, not some major plot point of any kind.

Wanted Movie Review,"Wanted Movie ReviewNew Addition: The question of is The movie worth buying renting or never seeing it?Wanted Movie ReviewCategory: Action/AdventureWhen I first saw the previews of Wanted, I did not really wanna see it, it seemed like it was all flash and pizazz with little substance. So I did not see it the opening weekend like I usually do, instead I waited about two weeks after many of my friends said it was one of the best movies they have seen. Some of my friends compared it to Fight Club and The Matrix, Two movies, which after watching Wanted, I have to say are vastly superior to this Generic Flashy Hollywood Action packed movie with as I predicted had little substance upon viewing it.The Good:The best thing about this movie is the action sequences and special effects, which is enough to warrant a viewing at the movie theaters. In fact I thought the action was pretty groundbreaking, albeit with a little too much CGI (computer generated imagery). Everything else is just really bland and rehashed. Even the twist at the end of the movie was sort of expected, although it was predictable if you thought about it. The acting was also OK at best. This movie,overall, left much to be desired.The Bad: The plot was sort of ridiculous, there were many things that did not make sense. The acting was average at best. The movie was too predictable, too flashy, and altogether too much Hollywood to be considered a good movie. The main actor James McAvoy for some reason I thought was not suited for the role of the main protagonist. Angelina Jolie also looked sort of old in this movie as well.The Ugly: A bullet flying though 10 miles of obstacles to slowly explode through a skull, that was pretty cool and ugly at the same time.Conclusion: I can see why many people compared this to Fight Club and The Matrix, it seems that Wanted borrowed from both these movies, but failed to live up to the originals. Basically Wanted is a very watered down and bland version of both these movies with a more idiotic plot and just as good action sequences.Is it worth buying, renting, or never seeing it? I think its worth renting once a year, but its not worth buying at all.Supra Score: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Not me, fateWanted","The trailers for Wanted show how this will be a visceral treat above all else, hopefully containing a great story too, but not necessarily needing one. There is definitely more story than you'd expect from the high action, quick cut trailer, and the performances help keep it grounded in some sense of reality, despite the otherworldly things done by them. Eye-candy for sure, the end result does manage to be more than just the effects, infusing a lot of humor into the action, culminating into a very entertaining experience.The opening sequences definitely set-up what will be expected for the duration. A very stylistically shot film, we are treated to an introduction of Wesley Gibson, our hero, at an office party complete with voice-over narration, changing film speeds, and cuts to events he is thinking of to help illustrate the mental state of ambivalence and docility he has slowly built up to numb himself to the world around him. Juxtaposed with this banal, cubicle life comes a battle scene atop a couple skyscrapers downtown. We have an assassin on the trail of a rogue member of the Fraternity, a group of killers with the ability to hone a massive amount of adrenaline to slow down time and enhance their actions to superhuman levels, looking to identify the bullet being used to out his partners. The fight sprawls into a shootout featuring an impossible leap over a city block through the air, window to window, in order to murder the men across the way, also shooting at him. These men were only decoys, however, as the rogue agent watches it all and finishes the job from miles away. This event begins the search for young Wesley, the son of a Fraternity elite, unknowing of the lion that dwells inside of his beat-down suburbanite façade; a force that will soon come out to play as he discovers his power and a bloodlust for the man that killed his father.Wesley slowly becomes a lethal machine, honing his adrenaline rushes for super sensory ability, the power to bend a bullet through space, and educating himself on the thousand year history of his new brotherhood, learning everything he needs to know to be the best assassin he can be. A guild of weavers to begin, this troupe still keeps up the work in a textile factory using the machinery as tools of training and also as the way to discover who is next on the list to kill. Fate and faith brings the names out through a secret code in the fabric of a giant loom, spelling out who must die next. The world itself deems who is to be taken; a power we can't understand or question makes the decisions because one dead might mean a hundred can continue living. Training with knives, guns, and fists; getting the crap beat out of him until his mind is clear to answer even the simplest questions with complete honesty; and bathing in a concoction of a waxy stimulant that speeds up the healing process by increasing white blood cell count, Wesley quickly becomes the professional he needs to be to take out Cross, the rogue agent that the group says killed his father. Gibson is the only man for the job and the fabric has spoken that Cross' life must be ended.The mythology is very involved and I believe well explained. We learn about the history of the Fraternity, what they do and why, while also getting a feel for the members and where they all come from. Helped immensely by the brilliant special effects, the sequences aren't so much unbelievable as they are just plain slick and cool. The world Bekmambetov has transported us to is such a heightened reality that you begin to accept what occurs for the simple fact that it does. Curving bullets through space, driving cars to flip over another so as to shoot through the sunroof, shooting guns from miles away and hitting the target, and leaping through glass as it slowly shatters are definite feats to behold. One thing this film cannot be faulted for is the flair for which it all happens.To enhance that style is a very prevalent sardonic wit. James McAvoy, who's American accented whine isn't as bad as I feared, is perfectly cast as the lemming breaking free from the constraints he has built around his life. The humor comes through his words and actions, bordering on overkill, (the keys spelling out profanities as he slams a keyboard into another character's face), but never becoming out of place. The aesthetic is set up early and therefore stays faithful throughout. Complete with a well-rounded supporting castKonstantin Khabensky having fun with the director that cast him as the star of his Russian vampire saga, Terence Stamp solid as always in a small role, Angelina Jolie just plain having fun on screen, and Morgan Freeman doing what he does best while also awkwardly yelling out profanities, (for some reason a surreal event), Wanted hits the mark. And Thomas Kretschmann, as Cross, the man being hunted down, is great. There is more to his role than one would initially anticipate and he handles the dramatic needs of the part in concert with the action fights.The film's story takes some very interesting twists and turns that could have ruined everything if not handled correctly. A realization is presented at the end, pitting characters against each other and surprisingly, the question at hand of what to do next, is solved precisely as it should be at the cost of many lives. Whether he goes back to corporate America or stays a vigilante, Gibson's life will be forever changed. The very end might be a tad too conveniently wrapped up with a bow, but it does help bookend the film as a package of pure adrenaline rush, satisfying on a cerebral level through all the bells and whistles exploding around each corner.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted: From Russia with Love.,"Great Job Timur! Russian Director with Rus/USA team made a great Russian/American Movie and proved that the Rus/USA mix in cinema could be a good thing. McAvoy and Jolie did a great job, great acting. Look at Jolie's reaction after McAvoy takes the gun and try to escape from this crazy place. I'm sure Stanislavsky said ""I believe"" from the sky at this moment. Special effects are awesome. It's not Hollywood Sp.Ef. It's Timur's Original Style with Sp.Ef. Looks beautiful.

Slick and flashy but without a lot of substance to make it memorable,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWesley Gibson (James McAvoy) has a boring job working behind a desk, without the guts to stand up to his bullying boss or do anything about the fact his best friend is shagging his girlfriend. But that all changes one night in a convenience store when a lady named Fox (Angelina Jolie) saves him from being killed by the guy who killed his father. He learns his father was part of an organization called The Fraternity who've been around for many years killing those selected from a weaving machine whose existence poses a threat to others. The head of the organization, Sloan (Morgan Freeman) has him trained to be like his dad and he progresses well, until an apparent assassination attempt on him draws him to a man named Pekwarsky (Terrence Stamp) who casts a different light on things.Wanted is adapted from a 'graphic novel', as is becoming quite the craze at the moment, and seems to rely more on the flashiness and style of this than anything deeper. A grown up comic book of a movie, with gratuitous sex, violence and swearing by the bucketload, this truly feels like a big case of style over substance, with a messy, convoluted, possibly over-ambitious plot (that, as others have noted, does bear similarities with The Matrix), with thin characterization and a deadly lack of substance. I've not heard of director Timur Bekmambetov before, but I bet he had some sort of past as a music video director or something along those lines, because that's the impression his film gives off.Cast wise, a wide range of famous name actors, from Jolie to Freeman, fail to make anything out of such uninspiring and flat characters and when talents like this can't save anything, you know you're in trouble.It's not awful. It's sharp and well written in parts, with some funny lines and some cool stunts, including killing a mafia guy while in a car flying over him and a nice bit involving a train going off the rails toward the end. But it all seems to drag rather than keep you hooked. Never mind what I've said though, enough people liked it that a sequel's apparently already being made, but from me it's certainly most un-Wanted. **",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A very original and sleek action/thriller with a relentless adrenaline rush.,"Well, you certainly can't fault ""Wanted"" for it's originality. There's all kinds of great action to be seen here, and it will satisfy every action fan's wildest dreams. What I like most about the movie is that it is a massive adrenaline rush (which, of course, is what the movie centers around). The action is jaw dropping, crazy, breathtaking, yet not mindless. The movie's plot, albeit progressively unrealistic and unbelievable, always remains a factor. The scenes are not random, and are perfectly contained within the storyline. Notice I said storyline, NOT reality. Timur Bekmambetov is the master of action, as evidenced by the Night Watch films and this action masterpiece.The acting...Of course, it's an action movie AND it's based on a graphic novel, so I wasn't expecting much here. The acting won't blow you away, but the stars live up to their names. James McAvoy is stellar as the geek turned assassin, a man who has led a nothing life with no purpose, until he meets Fox (Angelina Jolie) and her fellow assassins, led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman). Together, they form The Fraternity. It's certainly not McAvoy's best performance, but he does bring a likable depth to the character, and a tinge of badassery to the part at the end of the film. I enjoyed Jolie's performance the most in the film. There's a certain subtlety to it that doesn't show itself until the end, and you'll leave saying to yourself, ""THAT'S why she's considered one of the best of her time..."". Common and Thomas Kretschmann add strong showings, along with Morgan Freeman's fierce portrayal of Sloan.Don't worry too much about the writing. The film gets cheesy at many points, but that IS the point. Bekmambetov knows this, and he continually hits us with mind blowing and crazy action. I was left stupefied multiple times during the film. The film opens and ends with a bang. There's car chases, sniper shots, shootouts, ingenuity, finesse, and even some stealthy action. I really enjoyed Bekmambetov's work on this movie.The supreme unbelievability of the movie does detract a bit, but it's not like the filmmakers could have changed this. What makes it unbelievable, it's part of the story, and essential to the plot. Wanted is a sleek, sexy, action packed, and wonderful thriller film to offset all the superhero films of late.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"The most energetic, mind-blowing, and action-packed film of the century!","Wanted is like the new type of action-film. It knows it's silly, it knows it's over the top, and because of that it is an extremely fun and entertaining film. I had so much fun with this movie! The main characters are very fleshed out so we can relate to them and care for them. The performances are all very good, notably James McAvoy proves he is an amazing actor capable of a lot of things. His performance here is really different than the rest of his films, but his performance is pitch-perfect I have to say and went along with the film greatly. Angelina Jolie is great in this role, as is Morgan Freeman. The acting and writing are done purposely comedic and silly, but by no means in a bad way. Both the script and acting are very, very good for an action film. Now to the amazing action sequences. This if the most fun I have had watching a film in like the last few years, and I mean that with a big smile. The action pieces are amazing. The curving bullets, the over-the-top car scenes, the gore and the violence! Just WOW. I have not seen a film this over-the-top and unrealistic in a very, very long time. I mean that as a big compliment. Why have an action film that wants to be realistic even though they almost never are? Here, you can play so many tricks with what is happening on screen, so much fun! Director Timur Bekmambetov is very talented, his direction was superb and very stylish and in control. The visual and sound effects are amazing, as proved since it got two Oscar nominations for the sound. The slow motion is cleverly used, not like it was done so often in 300, but here it works a lot better.At the end of the day, yes, Wanted is just an action film. But boy, I had not seen an action film be able to captivate me the way this one did. It has mind-blowing action sequences, awesome energy, and so stylishly done effects. Not to mention the characters are very leveled out and it is a film that really hits us on an emotional level with all of it's twists and turns. Movie-going at it's best. I am sure a lot of people do hate it, but honestly, I could not care less. To me, Wanted is the most action-packed film of the decade, and perhaps the best as well.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
another print to film?,"This film, if taken on its own, isn't all that bad. If you are looking for realistic actions and plausible situations, please do your homework.I am not sure if this is a comic adaptation, but it sure looks like one. In fact in many of the scenes, it reminds me a lot of Matrix and Sin City.The movie basically keeps a good pace with plenty of action sequences between short conversations. Now this is where I love the movie. The dialogues are short, concise and sweet. the only thing I didn't like, the main character being such a useless punk at the beginning. However his transformation into a top-level killer seems rather rushed, sudden to say the least.The twist in the story was expected from the very moment he was made to believe he is the heir to a ""great"" legacy. There I smelled the rat and thought it would be far too simple, too straight forward, a movie to be made today.Angelina Jolie is beautiful, however, I had expected more out of her than the role she played in this action movie. BTW, she is showing some aging since her last movie.Overall, the big names are wasted here. This movie could have been made with less budget on the names and more on the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
MATRIX RIP-OFF?,The beginning scene with Wesley seems oddly similar to The Matrix. Even the recruitment scene. The first half of the movie was basically The Matrix but set in the real world. Jame McAvoy was really trying too hard to be an American here. He sounded obnoxious and annoying at the beginning but then bearable in the middle to the end cause of the action sequences.

One of those movies that is very underrated,"Maybe 'Wanted' wasn't as successful as - I thought - it should be when it was released back in 2008 because these sorts of (semi) superhero movies were only just coming into fashion? Maybe it's because it was based on a comic book that wasn't that well-known and the film's producers annoyed the die-hard fan by changing various elements? Or maybe it's because it's got a pretty 'uninspired' title which doesn't really tell you what the film is about? It could just be someone posting something on Craig's List! Either way... I loved it then and I'm pleased to say that it stands up to this day.It's about a young man Wesley (James McAvoy, before he really hit the big time in Hollywood) playing a young man who doesn't know his place in life. He medicates himself daily while working in a dead end job (don't we all?) and is routinely victimised by his boss while his girlfriend is having an affair with his best mate. However, his life takes a slightly more wild turn when a femme fatale known as Fox (Angelia Jolie) inducts him into a super secret society of assassins known as 'The Fraternity' led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and together they'll... well, you'll have to see, but there's naturally various bad guys to kill and noble causes to fight.I suppose the plot isn't that radical to attract much attention, however, it has all the look and feel of a good comic book you could ever want. Now, I call that a plus, whereas I think a lot of people saw it as a drawback. Largely, because these assassins are pretty damn amazing - their main 'special ability' being the knack of 'bending bullets' so they can bend the missiles around corners. Yes, it's a little far-fetched, but this is a comic book movie and if you can get over this then I think you'll have a really good time.If you're expecting something uber serious and gritty then look away now. There are more than a few times where the film does things simply for laughs and to not just bend bullets, but also the movie's reality. It never really takes itself that seriously and so is a lot more fun and popcorn-worthy than some type of 'darker' modern action movie like Daniel Craig's 'Bond' franchise or the 'Bourne' moviesYes, there's nothing that new here, but the fact that it's a great action movie with A-list stars and set pieces that make the most of the unique 'fighting premise' that exists in this movie world should be enough to give it at least a 'cult following' and stop it fading into complete obscurity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A very brief account of my experience...,"The movie started lame. There were plenty of holes in the plot. Kept getting better with the running time.

""Equilibrium"" (good build up, sci-fi, Christian Bale)Overall, it was a fair experience watching the movie. Watch it when you're not in a very serious mood.

"All style, no substance","What a load of hogwash! It's as if The Matrix got mixed with Looney Toons and the whole concoction was directed by someone trying to imitate John Woo while high on crystal meth.Its about an organization of assassins who can do almost anything, but yet they require a ""nobody"" who works as an office drone. Their big ""reveal reason"" for wanting him to join doesn't even make that much sense, cos they're supposed to be ""SO"" well trained in the first place. Plus they can manage to do the most impossible stunts in the world as if they all had formal training at Cirque Du Soleil and can kill any target at anytime but yet they're so dumb they cant think for themselves. Cos they all seem to get taken by surprise for the final ""twist"".2 awesome action set-pieces (One involving a car and a bus, and the other involving a train falling of a suspension bridge over a canyon) managed to save me from gouging out my eyes. And my disappointment in Morgan Freeman is growing, as he was one of my fave actors, but seems to be doing anything for money these days. (Edison, The Contract, Wanted. WTF?!?) And as for Angelina, looking nothing like her former voluptuous self, and seeming kinda sickly is distractingly nauseating. James McAvoy does a half-way decent job for the first 30 minutes, until he turns into the spawn of Neo (from previously -mentioned Matrix) It's made oodles of cash at the box office though, so of course the sequel is a lock.

Not as Much Fun as I Hoped,"Wanted is based off the comic book series of the same title, and follows a man who lives an unsatisfying life and gets recruited as an assassin to kill the man who killed his father.The plot isn't anything special, nor is it presented in any particularly special way. We see how bad his life is, get some intro to the characters, some action, a training montage, etc. Nothing we've never seen before.The characters are, again, nothing special. There really isn't much development of them, nor are they particularly interesting. The main character was somewhat, but everyone else isn't.The action was decent. I expected this just to be an over-the-top fun action movie, but there really wasn't all that much of it. The handful of action scenes were pretty great, there just weren't enough of them.One thing that particularly bothered me was James McAvoy's scream. He screamed fairly often, and it was really annoying to listen to. I don't know why, it just didn't sound like a real scream.Overall Wanted is just decent. The action is great but too spread out, the characters are okay, and the plot is extremely average.

Amazing movie...!!!!,"This is the first ""comment"" I've written for a movie. I just saw the movie on opening night with my girlfriend. And we both LOVED it! Were both 17, so for a teenager i'd say its a good movie to go to.I watch a lot of movies, and not man blockbuster films, and i like pretty much any kind of movie (or i at least give them a shot). I read reviews that this movie was The Matrix with humor, but just a few of the special effects reminded me of the matrix, but otherwise not that much, although i can see how people compared characters in Wanted with the Matrix,but i didn't even think about that during the movie.I recommend this movie for everyone to go see, even adults. The humor in it is funny, and makes the movie seem a little less serious, which is good...trust me! The only thing i didn't like about this movie, (wont give anything away don't worry) was when Angelina and Mcavoy are the train at night, the green screening makes it look kind of fake, and that just bugs me with movies.

It's got Jolie and guns - what else ya need,"In 2008's Wanted, James McAvoy plays an anxious computer jockey, taken advantage of by all who know him, who discovers not only that his long-lost dad has been murdered and that said dad was actually an elite assassin but also that he himself has super-spy skills and must be trained to harness them. And one of his fellow assassins is Angelina Jolie. So it's basically a fantasy aimed at shlubby white males.McAvoy's Wesley is an office drone who takes medication for his anxiety and is bullied by his abusive stapler-clicking boss and whose buddy (played by Chris Pratt) has been boinking Wesley's harpy girlfriend. He lives in an apartment alongside an elevated railroad. His life sucks. So you can imaging his surprise when he's confronted by a mysterious woman named Fox (Jolie) while getting his prescription filled. A man has tracked him to the drugstore, she purrs, and he's about to kill you. A shootout ensues. Fox and Wesley escape, and he's brought to a textile factory to meet the suave Mr. Sloan, who gives Wesley the lowdown on his origins (every hero needs one) and gives him a motive – to find and assassinate the man who murdered his father.But before that can happen, we must endure a training montage. Wesley learns how to fight with knives – and gets plenty of slices of his own. Wesley learns how to take a punch while being tied to a chair. Wesley learns how to fire a gun so that the bullet curves around obstacles. You know, standard-issue stuff. And then he's ready! Wait, no he's not. Sloan makes him do some killin' missions. You know, to keep up appearances with the other assassins. The basic idea is that the looms in the textile factory contain coded messages that, when decoded, provide the name of the assassin group's next target.The story is based on a comic book, or graphic novel, whichever is appropriate, so suspension of disbelief is paramount. Take the idea behind curving bullets. Or that Wesley can suddenly get ripped and become great at hand-to-hand fighting. Or that there's a magical soaking tub that heals everything from scratches to broken bones. Gotta just buy into it. Fail to do so at your own peril, is what I'm getting at here.Anyway, I liked the movie. A lot of exhilarating action, and then there's Jolie. Hardly says a word for the first hour of the movie. Easy work if you can get it. Come to think of it, she doesn't say much in the movie, and I'm betting a stunt double helped in some of the action scenes. Now that's a good career choice.Wanted was as outlandishly high energy as one might expect, so I'd recommend it for action movie fans, or comic-book fans, and especially Jolie fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Wanted? Oh, you mean Luke warm gun-kata movie.","Overall, Wanted's plot is a half-asses excuse to bring forth another gun-kata movie. The love interest or relationship between Fox and Wesley is low-budget and uncertain. Most of the main character's archetypal training exercises used to develop his power seemed to lack meaning and congruency. Wanted leaves the viewer asking questions about the origin of some of the conception and reason of certain organizations in the movie. It is understood that this is an action movie(I guess action movies sometimes relatively have weak plots) and is not necessarily supposed to appeal to ideals, but when compared with previous actions movies, it's plot is sorry. O yeah...if you're looking for action that is reminiscent of The Matrix's, you'll find it here a little bit...not much though lol. Despite my seemingly negative review of this movie, it IS worth watching. But only if you get it from Blockbuster's used section or you see it at your friend's and you want to borrow it.

Flaccid and Formulaic,"Two scenes in this movie are worth watching, (1) a car chase early in the film, and (2) a pyrotechnic-filled montage towards the very end. Everything else in between has a phoned-in feel to it, from McAvoy's embarrassingly bad American accent to the vain attempt at creating plot complexity by adding more meaningless twists. The plot arc of the movie is clear early on, and all the added detail just serves to clutter up the story. Jolie, as much as she can be a joy to watch, has to suffer through ridiculously terrible writing (her childhood story is one of the worst-written scenes of the past five years).

Angelina Jolie, however, typecast as herself, is quite natural as an emaciated ""bad a**"" whose weak lines and pouty expression are at best worthy of a courtesy smirk. As to James ""Mr. Tumnus"" McAvoy, he is absolutely unconvincing as an assassin---a nerd, indeed, but little else.

One of the strangest and best Hollywood action films I've ever seen,"It's hard to judge whether Wanted is a brilliant masterpiece or a train-wreck off a film. The plot (which is based on a comic although the similarities end after the first five minutes)is simple and potentially great: Wesley Gibson is an office-drone loser with a cheating girlfriend and bullying, morbidly-obese boss finds out his father was an assassin for a secret the 'Fraternity', an ancient and secret group of killers. Wesleys father is killed by a renegade of the Fraternity and the group recruit and train Wesley to stop his fathers killer.What makes the film so great (for me anyway) are the weird incidental details thrown into the film without explanation, The Loom of fate, curving bullets and all, not to mention the spectacularly over the top action sequences which get so extravagant two thirds in the film completely leaves anything resembling reality or logic behind. It's almost like ancient mythological story taking place in the present day and I think thats why the film doesn't really work: the surrealy over the top mythology doesn't gel with the character(ish) driven storyline and the film runs out of steam towards the end, which isn't helped by an obvious and over used plot twist.As for the actors, McAvoy is slightly miscast, he's great as the loser Wesley but hasn't got the charisma for the super-cool and lethal assassin Wesley, Jolie is underused, a few more lines and better characterisation would have been good and Morgan Freeman is great as Sloan (hearing him swear like a trooper and break out of his 'saintly black guy' type is one of the best parts of the film).As mixed as this film might be I defy anyone to watch Wesleys keyboard-smashing exit from his job without smiling and there's plenty more to like about it so seven stars anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"OMG, one of the  best ever","Wesley Gibson's (McAvoy) life is going nowhere, and he knows it and can doing nothing about it. Then he is told his father was a top assassin and was recently killed. Wes is given the chance to avenge his father's death by joining a secret society of Assassins.I thought the last Die Hard movie (Live Free or Die Hard) was the best ever action movie. Mr. and Mrs Smith was very good too along with Hit-man (what, you didn't see that?). Then I saw Wanted. OMG, I saw stunts that I have never seen performed before, whether in real time or CGI didn't matter. I saw bullets turn corners (well, we do know that is fiction, but it works in this movie) and I saw a brutal training program (for Wes, of course) that had me on the floor crawling to the bathroom for rolls of gauze, Neosporin, and Vicodin. Wow! This movie is on a par with Live Free or Die Hard. Excellent.The acting by all is very good, but the stunts whether real or with CGI (hard to tell sometimes) keep this movie going at breakneck speed and you don't get lost, you are right there with it enjoying, and yes, cringing with every moment.But, then something began to happen.

I did not care if Wes succeeded or if anyone succeeded as long as the stunts kept coming.

"Far-fetched, tongue-in-cheek splatter fest","In a world where physics seem to be governed by suggestions rather than by laws, an ancient fraternal order of über-assassins, headed up by Sloan (Morgan Freeman), deals with a rogue element in its ranks. When told of the murder of his assassin-father, Wesley Gibson (James MacAvoy) joins the fraternity to be trained by, among others, Fox (an emaciated looking Angelina Jolie) so he can take revenge on the killer. The assassins, who supposedly are directed to their targets by fate (hence the clever 'loom of doom' metaphors) have superhuman strength, agility, healing, and marksmanship (including the uncanny, and very useful, ability to curve the flight path of a bullet). Oddly, these skills seem to be somehow genetic: without any training Wesley can shoot the wings of flies. The film is largely played for bloody, over-the-top laughs with lots of gruesome splatter-shots and a liberal helping of the F-word used as comic relief. The cast is fine for this type of rumpus but, other than the bending bullet shtick (likely considered too preposterous even for the likes of John Wick, Smith (from 'Shoot'em up') or Hit Girl), there's not much new on the screen, i.e. if you like this kind of movie, you've probably seen it all before. The plot is far-fetched beyond criticism but does suffer from the usual inexplicable incompetence of the otherwise super-competent when dealing with the hero as well as from the characters tendency to believe what they are told (when needed to do so by the plot) despite it being established that there are scams within cons within lies everywhere. Undeniably fast-moving and entertaining in stupid kind of a way. Musophilics (and animal lovers in general) should be aware that dreadful things happen to CGI rats.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Off the wall,"Nice to see that Wanted was given Oscar nominations in two categories related to sound. Well the film was certainly loud enough. But maybe the noise was to cover up the idea that the story was off the wall and unbelievable.I can see in Wanted where the current cult TV hit Mr. Robot gets some of what is driving it. Our protagonist James McAvoy is a drone of a human being working almost like Jack Lemmon at his desk, taken advantage of by everyone senior to him as Lemmon was in The Apartment. He's even having woman troubles as his girlfriend is being completely faithless.Well one morning he's the target of a shooting and saved by girl Rambo Angelina Jolie. Turns out that McAvoy is the son of a professional assassin and he's got it in his blood to be one as well. Dad deserted the family as a kid and that's the reason for all of McAvoy's issues.Well McAvoy under the tutelage of Jolie and head Morgan Freeman our hero develops into a full blown Rambo type and joins the group of secret assassins that have been around for a thousand years. But of course this is hardly the end of the story. And what red blooded American male wouldn't want to get tutelage from Angelina Jolie?You've got to love Morgan Freeman. That man can make the most pretentious drivel sound like it's from the Old Testament. And he does it in film after film which he's doing for a hefty paycheck between Oscar material like Boys Don't Cry. Well, we all have bills to pay.Fans of mindless action films will love this.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Surprising well-made action/adventure/thriller that is extremely entertaining.,"Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a bored Account Manager, who doesn't care anymore that his girlfriend (Kristen Hager) is cheating with his best friend (Chris Pratt) at work. He also can't stand his annoying overweight female boss as well. One night... when he was at the pharmacy, he meets an mysterious attractive woman named Fox (Oscar-Winner:Angelina Jolie). She tells Wesely, she knew her father and he was one of the best assassins in the world until he was murder. At first, Wesley doesn't believe nothing she said until an mysterious assassin named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) tries to kill him and Fox. Now Wesley finds himself running for his life along with the help of Fox. When Wesley meets the boss of Fox named Sloan (Oscar-Winner:Morgan Freeman), who tells Wesely he has the choice to life the life of a highly trained assassins or he could goes back to his ordinary boring life. After a few days of thinking through, Wesley decides to join Sloan and Fox for his training. Which Sloan and Fox are members of the Fratenity. Which it's a highly secreted society of assassins, it's going on for a thousand years. Their targets by the Fratenity are choosing by the Loom of Fate, a loom that gives the identity of their next target through a binary code hidden in the weaving of the threads. Wesley finds out that his training is no laughing matter, since it's extremely harsh and he is using his time as well to find out how was his father like and to find his father's killer with the help of Fox.Directed by Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch) made an highly entertaining action-thrill ride that plenty of creative action sequences, great visual moments and plenty of dark humour as well. McAvoy is excellent as the geeky young man, who finally takes control on his life to be a trained killer. Freeman and Jolie gives good supporting performances as well. ""Wanted"" is based on a Comic Book Series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones. Which i heard it is somewhat completely different from the Comic Books. Director Bekmambetov gives some of the finest action sequences since ""The Matrix"". Which i was glad since i was getting tired of action movies these days were using too much CGI effects but this one, director Bekmambetov goes a step further by making the action looking visually impressive. ""Wanted"" is one of those movies, you can't wait to see in theaters again or once it's comes out on DVD/Blu-ray. I was completely blown-away with the action, visual style, humour and of course, the story. I enjoyed the premise very much but i think it was McAvoy's role made ""Wanted"" to be one of the most unique things to be enjoyed. Danny Elfman (Batman, The Frighteners, Men in Black) offers an completely different music that his usual dark Gothic style score. Don't miss it. Screenplay by Michael Brandt, Derek Haas and Chris Morgan (The Fast & The Furious:Tokyo Drift, Cellular). Which Brandt and Haas wrote movie scripts together like (3:10 to Yuma ""2007"", 2 Fast 2 Furious). Super 35. (**** ½/*****).",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

What it does have is unbelievable special effects and a good measure of gore and ultraviolence that quickly becomes tiresome.The A list cast must have been short of money!

Impressive action but predictable twists,"Wesley Gibson works in an office. He suffers panic attacks often (mainly brought on by his boss Janice). His girlfriend is having an affair with his best friend. In all, his life is plain and dull. That is until the mysterious Fox tells him that his father was an assassin, and then Wesley finds himself with an organization called The Fraternity, training to kill the man who killed his father.....Wanted is based on a series of comics. I've no idea how faithful the movie is in relation to the comic books, but as a story it is a bit predictable. There are a couple of twists that take place, you could see coming.Having said that however, it is still a very enjoyable movie. James McAvoy as Wesley is impressive in his first leading role in a major blockbuster. The supporting cast led by Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman are pretty good, even though most, with the exception of the Jolie and Freeman characters don't really stand out.However, the impressive thing about this movie is the style it's shot in. Timur Bekmambetov, who directed the wonderful Night Watch & Day Watch movies, brings that style here. In some ways it is similar to that of The Matrix, with bullets swerving round corners, or assassins so good they can hit each others bullets. However, it is very well done, and the movie does have some impressive set pieces, the highlight for me being the train sequence.Unlike a lot of the summer movies, it doesn't skimp on the bloodshed when people are shot. It's rare for a so-called blockbuster to be given an 18 (UK) certificate, and it's a refreshing change to see a movie aimed at adults instead of the teen audience as usual.As a summer movie it is good. With less predictable twists, it could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"A fun, summer popcorn movie","If you just sit back and enjoy the movie as a fun, summer popcorn flick, it's not so bad. We've seen these CGI tricks before in the Matrix but they're still fun especially when people crash through the windows in slow motion. The only time I found the CGI really bothersome, was in really wide overhead shots like when they're running on top of the trains. This type of CGI didn't look real in Titanic back in the '90s and it seems they still haven't been able to improve much on it. It's nice to see Morgan Freeman playing a character who's not quite as saintly as the ones he's usually asked to do. Angelina Jolie is also good in this although the role doesn't ask her to do a lot other than watch the training sessions. James McAvoy is good as usual and the woman who plays his boss is hilarious. It's quite the scene stealing role.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
It's actually awesome,"I've never really liked theatre runs of loud, expensive action movies but I'm willing to make an exception for this one. Perhaps because it's so loud and fast and flashy and actually ends up leaving an impression on me rather than just staying on the screen and fading out like so many others. James MacAvoy gives his best shot at playing a total loser that in a lengthy fish out of water sequence is beaten up, stabbed and such and such. However, for some reason that can only be explained with otherwise redundant camera trickery he has some kind of ""Matrix""-like superpower which allows him to do a lot of implausible stuff I just accepted in the end. You can't fire a bullet through an entire labyrinth just because you believe in it(or maybe you can,I wouldn't know), but if you really plan on enjoying this movie hell get used to things like this. Even though the conclusion with the circle is even too much for me. Seriously,what the hell? Either way,it keeps you occupied for a couple of hours.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"An action packed movie, very enjoyable","Wanted is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours. It's like an adrenaline shot right to the heart. Full of exciting action, spectacular adventure, suspense and mystery with many twists and an unexpected ending. Its a entertaining and enjoyable movie which maintains a very good rhythm throughout the entire movie, it ends exactly how it begins. The story is very interesting and the plot about a frustrated office worker learns that he is the son of a professional assassin, and that he shares his father's superhuman killing abilities is very convincing. Wanted has a great cast, James McAvoy as Wesley Allan Gibson, his performance is very good, first as a guy frustrated with his life and then as a cold blooded assassin. Angelina Jolie in the role of Fox his acting is powerful and convincing. Morgan Freeman as Sloan, the leader of ""The Fraternity"", is excellent as always.

"""What are you telling me? That I can curve bullets?""","I haven't read the graphic novel, though I am considering it. From reading up on it, I understand that they took the title and a couple of characters, and then made this up from there. Does that even count as an adaptation? This is a mindless(and unpretentious) flick, and the noteworthy aspect here is the stylized depiction of the action(though there could be more of it, for this being an hour and forty minutes long), and the fact that the scenes remain exciting in spite of how over the top they are. It is purely a macho fantasy(if it does actually treat the morality issue reasonably), indulging in shamelessly doing things that everyone who feels inferior would want to be able to. I don't think the blame lies with the director; he seems to know what he's doing, and even something simplistic does take skill to helm. This isn't emotionally engaging, and the lack of risk and danger does lead to some of the things intended to be thrilling to be nothing other than visually appealing. A couple of bits in the montages make it look like the editor forgot when they occur in the movie; their are details that have not been divulged yet, including some related to the plot line. The lead is noticeably devoid of charm, and the cruelty he faces from his surroundings is ridiculous, unrealistic and not credible. I hate to be superficial, but Jolie looks unusually sickly in this. Her situation at the time has my full sympathies(I believe her mother had recently passed away), and I completely get preferring to work and distract herself. The rest of the cast and their acting varies. It is forced when this goes for being sharp and clever, and it tries way too hard. No role is all that developed. This has a brutal tone. The DVD contains two short featurettes that are decent enough, and reasonably informative. There is swearing, violence and nudity in this, and they are all gratuitous. I recommend this to those in the mood for turning off their brain and enjoy cool sequences that are a feast for the eyes. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

What a pleasant surprise,"This is the movie in which I knew so little when I was seated in the cinema except for the fact that Angelina Jolie is in it and it is action packed.Then came the first 10 minutes (no rolling credits) with James McAvoy as miserable as he can be. I started wondering if this was the right movie with Angelina Jolie! This is a very clever movie because the life of James McAvoy begged sympathy and provided an excellent balance with the actions. The action sequences was excellently choreographed and sent the hearts pulsing. The images as seen by the assassin, his leap across the building, the supermarket encounter, the car chasing scene were just the beginning of a series of breathtaking actions.Angelina Jolie is so charming (even more than in her role as Mrs. Smith against Bradd Pitt), her eyes are all smiling when she trains James McAvoy and her tutoring sessions on the top of the train fully demonstrated her fluid actions.I never peeped at the watch and there were twists and laughs from time to time. All the actors/actresses are excellent. The only minor disappointment is Morgan Freeman - he is excellent as always but he doesn't look a villain and he has played such paternal roles for so long. It would be nice to see a new face for a change.James McAvoy did exactly that. He looked so suppressed in the beginning, then his special talent surfaced and the running and fighting all added up.

"Wanted, continuing this recent trend of good comic book films","Wanted in short was really good, for a comic book movie it was good anyway. Some cheesy parts but the lead played by McAvoy was great.

Things go Boom,"I don't really know why I own this movie, but I do.I remember seeing it in theaters, thinking it was mildly entertaining, and then, for some reason, deciding that I would like to have a copy of it on my movie shelf for the rest of my life. Alcohol may have been involved. Things get hazy. It's a serviceable Star Wars-type hero journey with a lot of swearing, blood, and gunplay. It fails to connect emotionally on any level and never rises above its innate silliness, but for two hours, things go boom and James McAvoy puts on a halfway decent American accent. There are worse ways to spend my time.McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, a nobody office drone with a terrible girlfriend who cheats on him with his terrible best friend all while his terrible boss lords over him for not doing his work (which he doesn't do, by the way). He also has panic attacks. He's a completely pathetic creature, and his voiceover bemoans his existence. One evening he goes to the drug store to pick up his panic attack medicine and a mysterious woman, Fox (Angelina Jolie), speaks to him and saves him in a gun battle with a man she says killed Wesley's father.Now, here's where the movie fails to connect right at the beginning. Part of Wesley's opening voiceover is that his dad left when he was seven days old and he doesn't care about the old man. And then, Fox shows up, telling him that that man over there killed Wesley's father the week before, and Wesley now has a mission he cares about. This disconnect between Wesley and his father never gets addressed. There's no work done to show how Wesley actually feels anger at the death of the father figure he never knew, or met. Of course, this isn't the point of the film, the action is. However, that poor construction is definitely part of the film.So, the action. Fox brings Wesley into the Fraternity of assassins. His father was one of the greatest of them, and they all have the ability to bend the path of bullets while also having access to magic healing baths that fix all wounds. After a few weeks of training, Wesley is as awesome as anyone else in the Fraternity, and he and Fox are off to kill some people. Who do they kill? Well, this is where it gets silly. The Fraternity's actions are determined by the Loom of Fate...a large loom that speaks in code based on the missed threads on a sheet. This is just a stupid as it sounds, and the fact that the movie treats it with such somber tones is odd at best. That we have Morgan Freeman as Sloan, the leader of the Fraternity, acting his butt off to convincingly sell this nonsense makes it no better.There are double-crosses and reveals, leading to Wesley turning on the Fraternity in an orgy of violence that is amusing in how far it will go. Exploding rats, guns firing through someone's skull, and other extreme forms of violence are completely disconnected from any emotional reality but have a certain galling charm to them. I can't take seriously the scene where Sloan very seriously throws bits of cloth around at his assassins to prove a point, though.This was directed by the Russian action director Timur Bekmambetov, and he's just honestly not a terribly good director. His Night Watch movies from Russia were pretty much unwatchable trash, and his best movie is Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter which is, well, it's kind of okay. This is in that same realm but handles the emotional aspect even worse. What this movie has going for it really is the outrageous violence. It's a thin enjoyment that manages to pass the time but leaves little lasting impression beyond the shock value.If I hadn't bought this movie way back when, I'd probably not ever consider adding it to my shelf. As it's already there, though, I watch it from time to time for some purely brainless entertainment. It doesn't really work, but things go boom for 2 hours.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Wanted is a rip off of a brilliant comic by the same name which surrounds an assassin cult of infinite ability (called The Fraternity) owing to their supernatural ability to focus to an astounding extent.

"With good effects even inconceivable that a strong cast and interesting twists and not so predictable, the film winning several types of public","Wanted is one of those movies overestimated, which ends up having good action scenes, but that very piece on a script that could yield much more. Continuing the trend of recent years in Hollywood in adapting comics for cinema, The Wanted, which is based on the homonymous comic by Mark Millar and JG Jones, tells the story of Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) who is 25, is manager accounting in a company and hates his life. His boss Janice (Lorna Scott) is a hysterical and he has a best friend Barry (Chris Pratt) who had sex with his girlfriend Cathy (Kristen Hager). Fox (Angelina Jolie) is a centuries-old secret society of murderous Brotherhood, which saves a man who wants to kill him and warns him that the father of Wesley, he even knew it was dead. He follows the path of his father, he learns to be one of the biggest killers in the world, and joins the Brotherhood, a league of assassins trained to carry out the orders of fate, whose motto is ""kill one, save a thousand."" Under the leadership of Sloan (Morgan Freeman), members of the Brotherhood convince the protagonist that he must join the brotherhood and develop the skills that possibly inherited from his father, and finally feel complete. Soon he becomes the favorite of the Fraternity, which makes you feel good about yourself. But the situation changes when he realizes that his partners have no interest as noble as appeared.After having directed Nochnoy dozor (2004) and Dnevnoy dozor (2006), Russian director Timur Bekmambetov Hollywood debut in this adaptation scripted by the trio Michael Brandt, Derek Haas and Chris Morgan to tell the same old story: a boy that there is none, and one hour to another, becomes crucial piece of the universe where it is inserted. Timur Bekmambetov ends up distorting the comic book and leave out the whole story to deliver a film purely wild action in which all the laws of physics and any kind of consistency are ignored for the sake of fun. Permits film that virtually transform action in a sci-fi weapons include bullets that can bend along the way, cars can spin and fall on his feet without any damage, the protagonist who is a loser ends up becoming the biggest killer of all time can shoot a gun in wings of flies without ever even having touched a gun and later killing several men with only two weapons at a breakneck speed. What many people do not take into consideration is the universe of comics which also has in its alternate realities: a Nazi time traveler, an African immortal villain made of feces among others. So the situations are exaggerated shown no commitment to reality, but not enough to be anything as inventive or as impossible in comics.As for the script, there is a total distortion of comics. Originally HQ not cited a fraternity who performed mysterious orders to eliminate those who would threaten many lives. The Brotherhood of comics was an order of super-villains, who performed a global plan to eliminate all the heroes of the planet and any memory of their existence, silently taking the power of the planet. His murderers were amoral creatures, trained to ignore the suffering of others, kill without reason and even rape. The proper relationship between Fox and Wesley was much more aggressive with taking advantage of the beautiful young skilled assassin to ensure your space in the Fraternity, and of course to keep him as her lover. Excepting the sub-plot of superheroes may have avoided issues regarding copyright because many of the heroes were copies of the heroes of Marvel and DC Comics. But take a moral justification for Fraternity distorts the essence of the comic: the victory of Evil The promise of a story amoral succumbs when it discovers that The Fraternity chooses his victims deciphering messages on a loom, trying to eliminate anyone who kills many lives.One element that did not exist in HQ and covertly enters Bekmambetov is religiosity. The Brotherhood leader speaks in flock of sheep, there are candles everywhere, Wesley should follow his father's path. When you need to find the roots of the group the protagonist goes to an abbey in Europe. Wanted is not a deep film, but it causes. The Russian director prints your style desdea first scene, closer to the language of comics long. More than before, Bekmambetov and extrapolates David Brenner edition is full of features that let the action even more exciting and unbridled. There are too many cut scenes, making the action more confused at certain times. There is also an overuse of slow and accelerated cameras trying to prolong and especially impressed with the effects the best style Matrix. The problem is not the use of resources, but fill the whole movie with them, trying to mask the flaws in the script.One of the points that make the film work in the film is the casting of their main stars. James McAvoy gives a depth to the character that has your life changed from one moment to the next. Through violence he turns throughout the film. Angelina Jolie after the two films in the series ""Tomb Raider"" is consolidated from time as action hero. The actress who has starred in other dramas and thrillers, including winning the Oscar in 1999 for Girl, Interrupted, lends her strength, charisma and sensuality absurd to Fox A few scenes showing curves Jolie already make it worth seeing the film. Morgan Freeman is just right, but their mere presence has also accredits the movie to be a great fun and unpretentious.In a work with so many spectacular effects and appropriate scenarios, it is impossible not to mention the work in photography Mitchell Amundsen, the art direction of David Baxa, Patrick M. Sullivan Jr., Martin Vackar and Tomas Voth, and exciting, frenetic soundtrack by Danny Elfman.If such adaptation, we have a work that fails woefully depreciating the HQ, as we film a good deal of fun, which invests in a heavier tone for an action movie. With good effects even inconceivable that a strong cast and interesting twists and not so predictable, the film winning several types of public and commercial success is the best proof of that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Nice But Could Have Been Better,"29 June 2008. Pure action entertainment with a serious heart. Unbelievable, but this is an action movie. This is a action-packed movie once it gets going with the innocent, introverted man having to experience a much more brutal training program then has been brought to the screen before (but maybe with a purpose?). It's distracting to have some many improbables that spoil the action at times, but it does keep one glued to the screen regardless of what happens. The build up at the beginning isn't bad, but the foul language seems out of place periodically. The ending isn't bad either, it has a self-reflective, hard edged quality about it that leaves one thinking. Way to go Angelina Jolie. Finally, there are weak plot points as far as greatest assassins go. Taken together, the storyline is very good, the action is very good, the humanity is also very good, it's just that putting all together didn't quite result in a great movie. There was room for improvement - in a captivating, realistic way. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Wanted: One over-the-top action flick,"From four minutes into the film, 'Wanted' does not slow. . . from curving bullets to curvaceous women, the pace keeps to the highest point, almost near the point of 'Run Lola Run' and 'Shoot 'Em Up.' 'Wanted,' though it does get to be a little too much at times, features some of the coolest effects I've seen in an action film since 'The Matrix.' Also, the training session (at least the first half) was cool. Unfortunately, training/preparation takes up half the film which, to me, seemed like far more than enough. Repetition made for a bit of boredom, as did an ending you can see coming from Mars. . . which was a bit of a curse for this film. Boredom and predictability in an all-out action film are probably the worst things you can have.But, the impossible, over-the-top action makes up for it and turns it into a fun summer popcorn flick that isn't entirely brainless.Final verdict: 7.5/10.(One-half point was removed for the annoyingly insulting final line.)-AP3-",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted... to be a better movie.,"This film is a hodgepodge of better films. It borrows many of the effects The Matrix pioneered. Some scenes look like they were adapted from tossed Matrix storyboards. It borrowed the existential themes from Fight Club about a lost working drone of Generation X trying to find strength and meaning in his depressing life. It took several other plot points and ideas from other films but I don't want to spoil anything. I'm not saying you can't recycle old ideas but stealing them without paying the necessary homage is very uncreative and uncool.Wanted was packed to the brim with clichés in the dialogue, the plot, the characters, the sometimes 'Guy Richie-esquire' cinematography...and well just everything. I can just see how the details of this film were hammered out. ""What would The Matrix look like if they could curve bullets?!?""Well, now we know. I recommend wanted to anyone who hasn't seen Fight Club or The Matrix. I unfortunately couldn't enjoy it when I'd already seen the ideas done better in 1999.What? They're making a wanted 2?

Really good,"This film is good action movie with a lot of new special effects. Because of this reason I would strongly recommend to watch it in the cinema, on a big screen. I like the main idea of the film, when simple clerk are too tired with his life. And when he has an nice opportunity to change it. I think some people angry on this film, because they are exactly this sort of humans. They basically did not do anything worth and they just complain about everything. So, main character in a movie did something important. He made a decision. He drastically changed his destiny and life. I could not go to the further details because I don't want to give spoilers. :) As a negative part of movie I suggest that some physics laws a definitely abused in the movie. So, one should be ready for sci-fi in physics. :) I believe that film worth seeing, especially if you like action movies or if you don't like your boss. As for me, this is one of the best actions movies that I have ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Mindless action,"Having watched this movie around when it was released and having mostly forgotten about it, but remember enjoying it and hoping for a sequel, decided to watch it again and noticed more things on this viewing than when first watched it a decade or so ago.This film is based on a comic book series and it seems that many of the negative reviews don't understand its concept or purpose. Much criticism is how unrealistic the film is, with the bullets curving or some other stunts but that was merely on purpose and what makes this film stand out. It may be more style over substance but there is enough mindless action entertainment to enjoy. James McAvoy in one of his earlier leading roles is well liked and was a great choice for the lead. Along with the supporting cast of Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman.Featuring several twists along the way, as one had forgotten on this viewing but afterwards had felt it served its purpose and worked. A lot of negative hate seems to come from the fact tat people were expecting a different type of film. This wasn't supposed to be James Bond, or Jason Bourne, or Die Hard. It has its purpose and it pulls it off. Only a shame is how they never made a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Enough Wanted!,"The first time i saw the trailer for this film i have to admit i was a little scared. i thought oh no not another poor attempt to make guns look cool when in fact there designed to destroy life. well after having seen the film i still think guns aren't cool but the future of CGI in film was just given a overhaul and heading in a totally cool direction. Visually this film was one of the best i have seen in a while. I was trying so hard to see where they had slapped in a computer generated version of James McAvoy but was sorely disappointed due to the realistic visuals and effects.Wanted borrows heavily from fight club, the voice narrative the dry main character and the twisted reality which they where in. Wanted borders on bizarre and totally crazy at points but thats what drives this film to its full extent. its ability to bend the boundaries of reality and create what it wants to do much like the characters themselves. Jolie is after all one of the most unique woman to face our mainstream cinemas in a long time and is probably one of the first woman in a long time who can deliver as much sexuality into her performances and not be considered a tramp or cheap, in todays double standard world. Also she is way to skinny.The film felt like a series of bad events. Like a massive stack of domino's that have been stacked up to make a beautiful pattern but with a single breath came smashing down piece after piece. It kept your hands white as you clenched your teeth while the action went from one bad thing to another. Thats what a film should do. Keep you guessing, giving these characters situations which seem impossible to get out off and not ripple the screen with clichés and painful unoriginality. Not only did the action send your eyes and mind into a frenzy but the sound. The sound was continually attacking your ears blowing your mind away.The plot itself reeks of trying to be different. trying something new, and exploring boundaries which can be crossed. They had plenty to play with and if this film does any better surely a sequel will be on the way any time soon. Much like the action the storyline was bizarre, not so much complex but still gave the audience the chance to not get to lost in the action and noise. This film is purely for the senses a feast for the eyes and ears and a word of advice when seeing this film. leave your brain at the door and enjoy the ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Nowhere near as good as it could have been - 64%,"Haven't the Wachowski brothers got a lot to answer for? It seems that hardly a day goes by without another new action movie appears, created on a computer using footage shot in front of a green screen in a warehouse somewhere instead of using actors on location. And blow me, as if to illustrate my point, here is another one! Chock-full of all the ridiculous action you associate with CG-infused action flicks, this is one film that doesn't look too good if you peel away the pixels and gawk at what's left.Wesley Gibson (a miscast James McAvoy) is a bored, weedy office worker who feels trapped in his dull and repetitive life. But before he can scoop up another handful of anti-anxiety pills, he bumps into the oddly-named Fox (Angelina Jolie) who throws him headfirst into a bullet-fuelled adventure. It turns out that Wesley is the son of a super-assassin, a member of a secret society called the Fraternity, who recruit Wesley in order to hunt his father's killer - a rogue member called Cross (Thomas Kretschmann). As Wesley's skills improve under the tutelage of Fox, the Fraternity's leader Sloan (Morgan Freeman) monitors the situation closely as Cross's personal crusade against the Fraternity threatens the organisation's very existence.It sounds like it should have been an absolute winner but ""Wanted"" is the architect of its own demise. For example, I can go with the concept of the Fraternity and its thousand years' worth of assassination to ""maintain stability in an unstable world"". But why do the victim's names appear in weaving from the Loom of Destiny or whatever the damn thing was called? How did they appear before weaving was invented and why did it change to secret messages in textiles and why hadn't they updated it to something more 21st century? Never mind, the pretty CG provides enough distraction to stop you from looking into the plot too deeply while Jolie does her bit by pouting endlessly and occasionally flashing the flesh. As for McAvoy, he is not the sort of actor for this role - the first half of the film is spent whining and screaming a lot then when he realises he's actually a bad-ass, the abs come out and he can't go anywhere without a faintly silly grimace and a gun in each hand. The action, where it comes come, is certainly exciting but only possible in the mind of someone thinking in CG - vehicles don't behave the way they do here and I refuse to accept that you can make bullets go around corners by flicking your wrist when pulling the trigger. Nothing in this movie feels believable - granted, do any of these action films have the faintest whiff of reality to them any more - but when something is so fantastic and so ""garnly"", it stops being exciting and starts being stupid. Remember when you were a kid, racing your toy cars around the living room and crashing them into stuff? If you still do that then welcome to your dream film!There are things to commend, however - the CG, while dominating almost every scene, is well done and director Timur Bekmambetov has a terrific eye for the amount of bloody violence shown on screen and how best to shoot it. There is a certain amount of enjoyment to be had, especially when the plot twist arrives and the film really seems to kick into gear but I can't help feeling that ""Wanted"" is a massive disappointment, that it should have been a film to rival ""The Matrix"" - something ""Wanted"" desperately to be - but ends up as yet another wannabe. The reasons for the failure are quite simple: the wrong leading man, excessively silly action scenes and a plot with more holes in than Katie Price's range of knickers. What it needed was a bit more restraint, a brain to tell the inner-child that cars don't flip as easily as they do here and a brief shot of Jolie's wet butt shouldn't be the sole recommendation of a movie. Sadly, with ""Wanted"" that's exactly what you do get but unless your taste in movies hasn't evolved since the time of your early teenage years then you'll probably find other films more worthy of your time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Buy the premise and let this movie take you on a trip,"I'm revising my commentary (again) on this movie after seeing it more than a few times. It keeps getting better after each viewing. It's about a fraternity of assassins who've been around for 1000 years who kill based on the orders of ""fate"", a theoretically pure process divining who will be killed based on the best interest of humankind and ""to maintain balance in the world"". But a rogue member is killing fellow members and a son of one of the fraternity is recruited to kill the rogue. The possibilities and convolutions from that premise are plentiful and they are fully explored.You do have to fight through the incredible violence (much like the Matrix, it's in-your-face stuff) and a few artistic liberties. But there are some real spiritual, intellectual and emotional ideas being presented here. Along with some great visuals. If you're able you will understand and hook into them and come to absolutely love this movie. Even more with each successive viewing. ... Jolie's understated performance is nice but it's the story, the ideas, attention to detail and intensity that provide the brilliance. It's a twisting, turning, thoughtful, eventful, intellectually honest, unique trip that will meet every expectation you have in a movie. The last 25 minutes and final confrontation are a cinematic masterpiece.This is one of the best movies I've seen in the last 5 years and maybe one of the top 10 movies I've seen period. ... Warning. You might not get the genius of this movie from one viewing but you'll be drawn to watch it again. And again. Buy into this movie from the start and it won't let you down.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

silly but fun,"The movie seems like an.amalgamation of other movies such as Spider Man 1 (2002) with the boring nerdy, geeky kid who can't catch a break and something silly such as Master Of Disguise.(2002). The action was fantastic in the movie. The fight scenes were hit or miss and my big concern was the longer I watched this the sillier it got. To the point it felt like it was way longer than it was. At most this deserves a 6.5 out of 10.I loved the scene where he told his boss off. The limo assassination had to have been a highlight. There was even some character growth. That or I watched too many awful B and lower tier movies lately where there was none.Would I watch this again? Sure but not for a very long time. Id need friends too to laugh at the dumber parts of this. How the contracts are chosen is so stupid. The last 15 or so minutes of the movie needed serious work. Perhaps they ran out of money. Then again it's not the first time Hollywood hired people for their looks. The soundtrack was pretty good and stuff such as the subway scene were great. The twist was weak. I guess they needed something for the movie to hit that hour and 30 minute mark. I kind of hope they didn't make a sequel or we'd eventually end up with something really awful like the death race series. They got worst and worst every entry.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"Wanted is in my opinion the most underrated movie of all time. Everything is perfect about this movie. The plot (co written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas) is amazing and inspiring with a huge plot by the end of the movie. James Mcavoy, Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie, Chris Pratt all deliver great performances. James Mcavoy's character is vulnerable to the audience from the beginning of the movie which makes him likable and universally relatable. The music by Danny Elfman is one of the best film scores i have ever heard. The plot is emotionally satisfying. The action scene at the end of the movie is incredible and original (especially if you understand his anger). The cinematography, the stunts and the visual effects are on point. Timur Bekmambetov is a genius. The production design and the sound design are amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Fairly flat movie but some fresh special effects and ""not-another-stupid-happy-end"" save it","If you like to collect music videos like Madonna's ""Vogue"" or Fergie's ""Fergalicious"" this movie going to be nice amendment to your collection :) Director of this movie has been well known on Russian advertising market for series of visually catching TV ads, and this style is somewhat imprinted in the movie. Not that this is really so bad but movie itself very often lacks continuity in style, pieces of visually stunning clips are mixed with boring ""dramatic theatrical"" interludes - you'll probably like to view this movie again, but when viewing it second time prepare yourself to use ""fast forward"" a lot on your player. Movie is so overloaded with clichés and so openly appealing to quasi-real feelings of low-level office workers that people overfed with similar plots and marketing campaigns simply pucker up - it's like somebody is trying to give you a spoon of sugar after you ate a big chocolate cake.Nevertheless: many new fresh moves, exotic pirate's weapons and ammunition, tattooed butt of Jolie (just few seconds, deep sigh) and finally - beautiful samurai-way resolution closer to the end of the movie save it and make it clearly distinct from ""B"" class and direct to video releases.

I gave this a 9 16 years ago,"I was 20 years old when this movie came out, and it was the coolest movie to have come out in a while. I saw it twice in theaters. The movie recently made its way to HBO Max and decided to give it a re-watch. My rating decreased by 3 (would have been more, but the action sequences are its redeeming quality). Firstly, James McAvoy is usually wonderful, but here, if I had to hear him scream one more time in the first half hour, I'd have turned the movie off. The script is silly and predictable. I can't stand when films have a narrator. I'm a strong believer that good films don't require expository narration (with certain exceptions where we need more information that can't be given otherwise, I.e. Dune).

just okay..,"Wanted is a loose adaptation of Mark Millar's comic-book mini series of the same name. It is directed by Timur Bekmambetov who is better known for directing the Russian blockbusters, Nochnoy Dozor (Night Watch), and Dnevnoi Dozor (Day Watch). It stars James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman.The story revolves around a 1000 year old organization of assassins who are gifted with superhuman killing abilities, and young Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) in general. The first noticeable element of Wanted are its flashy visuals. The film itself is quite ragtag in nature. James McAvoy's narration, which is actually quite good, never gives you any time to think at first. Right from the start, one is thrown into a series of disjointed events. It actually takes a while to settle down and figure out what exactly is going on. The visuals are downright flashy and outrageous. Fun, awing, magnificent. The acting, with the exception of James McAvoy's lead, is passable.Wanted is not a film for everyone. It is a film which certain audiences will love, and some others hate. It mostly supports itself on popular graphic novel to celluloid adaptation elements; such as the narration, which is often angry and often calming, it also has the ability to make you think a little. Then there are the obvious comic elements. A lot of comedy. One scene in particular got me into splits. 'Iii'm Sorrryyy', he says, in slow motion, while putting a bullet through a man's chest from his car's sunroof. Yes, in Wanted, expect the unexpected, and you might just enjoy it.6.5/10.

Does what it sets out to do,"Wanted is definitely no Citizen Kane, but that doesn't mean it should be dismissed out of hand. It's a gloriously fun, if unambitious, Sunday afternoon flick whose leads (especially McAvoy in one of his earlier roles) seem to have a lot of fun with the balls to the wall over the top action scenes. The plot is fairly weak and could have done with some triming (it doesn't really manage to pull off any of its ""twists"" in my opinion), but I doubt anyone wanting to watch Wanted is in it for the plot and that is for the best. As for the action scenes, yes they absolutely defy the laws of physics, but the fact that the movie usually doesn't take itself too seriously makes everything a lot more engaging and these ""issues"" enhance the experience much more than they detract from it
All in all I'd say if you're looking to have a couple hours of popcorn worthy entertainment full of edgy humor and stylised action, do give Wanted a go!7/10 a fun time for the whole family (please don't actually watch it with children)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

I've always hated when someone goes from an ordinary guy to the best in the world over the course of a montage and without suffering at all.The music, the cinematography, and the acting were all off the chart. But the direction out-shined it all. The director managed to tease out a whole new side of Angelina Jolie, told a compelling story, and led the audience on an incredible journey of surprises.

Stylishly Vapid,"Fluff held together by overblown action sequences. Though it started out interestingly enough, as it progressed the plot became too far fetched for its own good. Once McAvoy steps into the Fraternity, the film throws all logic out the window and relies on action to advance the narrative. That the script is half-baked only emphasized that the somewhat creative action sequences are the only positive this film has to offer. The acting was a bit better, with Freeman, Jolie, and McAvoy delivering competent yet unimpressive performances.

The James McAvoy character is a low-grade accountant with a small office cubicle at a mediocre accounting firm with a boss from hell. His girlfriend is sleeping with his best friend. He has an all round lack of application. He rents a lowly apartment near a noisy railway line and he is the butt of jokes at the work place. The fact he does not know yet is his father is a hit-man from a secret group called Fraternity. He is approached and told that his father has been killed on the job and that he has rare talents for being a hit-man. He is then trained to become a hit-man with the ultimate aim of having him avenge his father's death. The training is atrocious includes being able to bend a bullet to hit your target, running on top of high speed trains. All main characters are doing their parts well. I especially like James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie. WANTED does not require a full acting ability but at least we know that all players do their part with much effort.

The acting from the major players is top-notch. However, I found James McAvoy a little irritating at times but he's still solid nonetheless. But it's Freeman and Jolie who steal the show with cunning ruthlessness despite being the good guys of the piece along with impressive stunts mixed with sharp acting and dialog. And what marvelous stunts there are; rivaling those even more-so than the Matrix sequels. Forget ""Live Free or Die Hard"" and ""Get Smart"".

I had heard great reviews, prior to it's release. Then I started hearing that the plot was SUPER thin and that it was really not very good. So, we started thinking Hancock.A couple of friends of ours talked us into seeing this abomination instead. The reviews were wrong. This movie wasn't bad, it was AWFUL. The plot had way too many holes and was NOTHING CLOSE to the MATRIX. Whoever made that comment should seriously be stripped of their Rights to review movies.The only thing the four of us WANTED was our money back. Everyone in the theater, it was a small one, agreed that this movie was written during the writer's strike. Either that or someone was paid a BIG favor by releasing this garbage.Seriously.

"Action written with a capital ""A""...","""Wanted"" tells the story of an ordinary office worker who is in for a not-so-ordinary future; the beginning of the movie could almost be confused with something straight out of ""Office Space""...Where the movie pays for its price of admission is what happens after this beginning, and it becomes wall-to-wall action at that point. The stunts are cool, the gunplay is spectacular, and as long as you don't think too long about what's going on, one helluva ride. If I had to find a fault with the movie, it would be that there are times when you are no longer immersed in the movie because the actor addresses the camera (by looking into it and talking to the audience), which somehow seems to (briefly) destroy the experience as a moviegoer. This doesn't last long however, and I found myself forgiving the transgression rather quickly. Without this, I'd rate the movie slightly higher (8.5 perhaps) if I could. As it is, it's still easily worth the price of admission...",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
If you don't have another choice of a movie,"Seeing this after watching the Dark Knight masterpiece, it left me with a feeling of a rushed, unfinished plot. Characters undergo drastic changes, too drastic in a too short of a time, leaving you confused at times or even surprised that it goes that way. This doesn't mean it surprises you for the good. It is just an action summer movie, that has Angelina Jolie in it, and is making quite some use of it.Morgan Freeman's character just doesn't suit him in the second part of the movie. James McAvoy suddenly knows how to fight and control his anxiety attacks after he wasn't able to carry out a conversation with his girlfriend...all in just a matter of minutes. An obese guy handles knives like a Bruce Lee with martial arts...In a nutshell, there was a lot of potential in this movie, but it never got going. It just has brainless shooting scenes, and one scene where Jolie's back and lower back are seen. It is filled with swearings because they couldn't figure out anything to put there and they didn't want to make it look like it was a ""no-sound"" movie. The movie does not leave you with any emotions towards the characters. What is does, is it leaves you confused for most of it. There are much better action films out there, better re-watch a movie you already saw than watch this. Take a collection movie and re-watch it or something. Or simply go on IMDb's top 250 movie list and choose from there. Don't waste your time on this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Worst film ever, definitely in 2008","First off James McAvoy is terrible not only that his fake American accent is cringing, Angelina Jolie is solid as usually but just a pretty face easily could have been replaced by a lesser named actress and achieved the same result (therefore used just to bring in fans). Morgan Freeman is miscast like always since Shawshank. Basically the film is so crap that they narrate every tens minutes to tell you whats going on ( Why when the film is predictable). Storyline is something out of some idiots head, some matrix wannabes who's trying to make the slow-motion action parts so good as to make you forget about the crap storyline and acting. Don't wast your money on this film I couldn't believe what i was seeing when i was in the cinema i thought it was a joke, If it were up to me it would be straight to DVD.

"Exceedingly gratuitous violence, bordering on savagery.","This is an example of unconstrained brutal movie making at it's worst. Technically excellent, but that is routine now. As I watched it at a friend's home,(randomly selected I might add) my mind was almost immediately revusled, at which time I switched to analytical mode. In my opinion, this movie is one of many recently made of the same genre that glorifies brutality and savagery. I was literally stunned at the level of violence graphically portrayed. And yet we wonder about the likes of Columbine, and other merciless real life killings. What could be an inspiration I wonder? Movies like this make such actions in real life to appear normal. And, so some act it out. Many are becoming morally decrepit and violence numbed individuals. ""It's only a movie"" some say. Yes, but humans learn from watching, especially young people. God help us. Avoid this movie at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Nervous wreck gets recruited by elite assassins.,"Here's what you need to know real fast.Wanted is a movie ""somewhat"" reminiscent of the Matrix and Die Hard movies as far as the action goes. It concerns a secret group of elite assassins and a new recruit that get their marching orders from a ""loom"" (Say what?!!). Yeah, you heard me right. So we're clear: the weaving machine --not the ""loon"" which is a diving bird. However, since the loom operates like a crazy raffle wherein even the assassins themselves can be targeted you are within your rights if you want to confuse loom with loon. My recommendation is that you not think too hard and just enjoy the ride because the movie is entertaining. At this point, if you have better things to do --go do them. You have the essentials. If not, pray continue to read the rest of my crap --er--my views.Now, continuing with the loon --I mean ""loom"" business: The assassins apparently don't know anything about their targets beyond a name, a face, and a location. So they have to take it on faith that they deserve to die; that the world would be a better place without them. As well, they must view the kill as an act of ""fate"". Hmmmm!Another of my issues was that the powers of the assassins is not, in my view, adequately explained beyond saying that it is the result of some kind of adrenalin rush that they can consciously control. I didn't completely buy that. But that's me.When the assassins get injured they take some sort of healing bath that makes them recover very quickly. My question is: why not share this with medical science which would do a lot more good than randomly offing people you don't know anything about? This brings us to the important question of whether the assassins purpose is indeed to do good --or are they ""blind assassins"" to which good and bad as we ordinarily think of it is irrelevant?Finally, there is some humor in this movie and in my opinion the best laughs comes from Morgan Freeman who throughout most of the movie had a dignified, urbane, and erudite bearing. ---But then he goes ""street"" on everybody's ass. I don't want to say anymore. See for yourself. One last thing: watch for the clever path of that bullet as it basically says ""f**k you!"" to four people all at once. My goodness, two birds with one stone is nothing compared to this! Love, Boloxxxi.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted enjoyably hyper-stylises its action but is plagued with an infestation of underdeveloped plot points.,"Stylisation can be used to enhance many aspects of a film. The cinematography, sound design or even acting. In this case, it is ""balls-to-the-walls"" action that enables cars to flip, land on the side of a bus and dismount gracefully. So suspend your disbelief, and enjoy the brisk ride. An office worker, who essentially hates his life, discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin from a group known as the ""Fraternity"". This secret society train him (vigorously might I add) in an attempt to better his father. Based on the comic book miniseries that rarely anyone read, this is not a bad adaptation. The world of assassination is riddled in lore and fateful findings however these are quickly illustrated through Freeman's mesmerising monologues that release a sense of world building. There's much to learn about weaving, looms and bending bullets, and the 110 minute runtime speeds along faster than a bomb strapped to a rat. Every action sequence is stylised. From the effects of adrenaline to the shooting the wings of flies in slow motion. It consistently appears to be exciting, despite the occasional poor visual effects. Jolie is stunning, Freeman is captivating and McAvoy adores screaming and shouting in his tenuous American accent. The problem is with its structure. It is so fast paced that several aspects of the plot are not developed at all, with a few underwhelming twists. So much is spent on the training montage (nearly 25 minutes) that the actual plot feels like an afterthought. Then the final five minutes occur, supposedly hilarious harking back to a previous scene, and ends on a fourth wall break. The only thing that broke was my spine from all the potential this film squandered! Yet, it remains enjoyable nonetheless. Rapid, ridiculously crazy and with plenty of blood, especially from a keyboard smash. I can't think of another film that has assassins block bullets by shooting another bullet. Bullet blocking. ""Bullocking"". Actually, maybe not that last one...",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Great cinema experience,"I went to see this the other day and it was fantastic. I haven't enjoyed the action scenes that much since the matrix. The people who believe this is a rip off from the matrix and other similar movies need to get a grip. There is obviously going to be influence from the movies that have shaped the industry, and wanted has took these influences to create a great movie.The story line is pretty good, your never bored at any point during the film. The acting from James McAvoy shows why is one of the best up and coming actors.For all the poor reviews i've read, I just can't believe your comparing it to other movies such as the matrix. Its most likely you all went to see Wanted with that movie in your mind and compared every little thing to it. If you go by that standard I guess any movie where people can do things out of the ordinary is a rip off of the matrix.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted is a good movie,"When his father dies, Wesley Allan Gibson (James McAvoy) comes to find out that his father was a member of an elite group of assassins called The Fraternity. He is recruited by Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and trained by Fox (Angelina Jolie), The Repairman (Marc Warren), The Butcher (Dito Bakhtadze), and Gunsmith (Common) to assassinate his fathers killer, Cross, who was once a member of the Fraternity but he betrayed them. Throughout the movie, Wesley's personality and attitude change and so do his abilities.Directed by Timur Bekmambetov, Wanted is slow at the beginning and you have to kind of follow the plot very closely, but it is a good movie in the end. There are a lot of unexpected twists and the casting was great. There is great chemistry between all of the cast members on camera. The scene where Wesley and Fox are racing for the flags that are on top of the train was very good stunt work. I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes action movies with a tint of comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"""Your name came up.""","James McAvoy plays nerdy account manager Wesley Gibson, the kind of guy who lets people walk all over him - his girlfriend (Kristen Hager), his best friend / co-worker (Chris Pratt), who incidentally is getting it on with the girlfriend, and his boss (Lorna Scott). To his complete surprise, he learns that the dad who abandoned him as a baby was in fact a member of a team of assassins. Hooking up with a sleek lady, Fox (Angelina Jolie), and tutored by people such as Sloan (Morgan Freeman), he decides that he will leave his humdrum life behind and embrace the idea of avenging his fathers' death.It's not surprising to see that this was based on a comic book series. It does have a slick, over the top, sometimes cartoonish quality about it. It's often stylized to the point of insanity, with a nonstop barrage of CGI gags. If this is indeed meant to be viewed as a parody of ""Matrix"" type action / sci-fi movies, it works pretty well, because it takes ridiculousness to a whole other level. The world that our characters occupy is a world where bullets can be made to NOT fly in a straight line, but CURVE AROUND objects. The visual gimmickry on display can be quite amusing. This does offer some fun, and gets better as it goes on and the story deepens. Whether the audience members predict the plot twists or not, these twists do help to give weight to the saga, and by then it's hard not to root for Wesley. His story does have the appeal of any such tale that involves a ""worm turning"".Freeman is good as always, and Jolie is cast in a perfect part for her. The solid supporting cast also includes Terence Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Common, Marc Warren, and David O'Hara. But most of the heavy lifting is done by top billed McAvoy. On occasion, his character can be annoying, but he grows more endearing as he ""grows a pair"", so to speak.Overall, one thing can certainly be said about ""Wanted"": it may be silly, but it's not boring.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Non stop action and great fun!,"I expected this film to be the type of movie that showed the best bits in the adverts and left you with nothing but filler to watch but I was wrong, from the first few minutes the film had action and it never seemed to stop. Jolie makes killing look easy and cool(not sure that's a good thing in real life but hey this is film and fiction after all) McAvoy did a good job with US accent and was far better at the action than I expected.

The Wachowski Brothers (Matrix creators) must have had a hearty old laugh at the trailer for this nonsense. Probably felt too much pity or were too hysterical to talk to their lawyers about suing.Also, I wonder at what point in his career Morgan Freeman decided 'you know what, Im going to stop challenging myself as an actor and just start collecting hefty sums for playing a wise-old-relaxed-authoritative-father-figure type guy.'One day I hope there's criminal penalties and a campaign of warning ads that tries to dissuade people from watching crap like this.

Formula-loving action fun,"Car chases, gun fights, slow motion, a protagonist with exceptional yet hidden assassination talents, Angelina Jolie's bare backside and Morgan Freeman as a wise leader figure. Let's just say that ""Wanted"" has all the bases covered when it comes to building an action movie. Hard to argue with that formula and to be honest, what you see is what you get. This movie is action, action, and more action that's been injected with steroids. If you want substance outside of the overdone ""choose your own destiny"" theme, look elsewhere. Seriously.""Wanted"" stars James McAvoy in his first blockbuster-style movie as Welsey Gibson, an ordinary loser accountant that hates his life until he's magically whirlwinded into learning his father was the greatest assassin ever and that he too has those abilities. Wesley of course learns from the best, Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie as he assumes what he comes to believe as his destiny.This film walks a fine line between borrowed concepts and clichés from action movie secret society stories. At times you get the sense you're watching something you've never seen before and yet you get this feeling that it's all incredibly familiar. For example, there are some really awesome, unique scenes, particularly the car sequences and then there are overdone slow motion techniques that first-time director of an American film Timur Bekmambetov uses. As a result, the film bounces back and forth from cool and engaging to overdone and over-stimulating. So, when the film spits this edgy narrative and flashy style at you, you either say ""awesome"" or ""seriously?""It's easy to say this film is fun. Cool is a bit more risky because it tries to be a bit too much and usually cool films don't try to act too cool. It's for sure entertaining and a good kill of a couple hours, which is all you need from a film sometimes. There are a lot worse action films out there that won't keep your attention but this one does. Somehow, you still are interested in these characters, even if they're a bit hollow.Gotta give ""Wanted"" credit though. Nowadays, you don't usually see ""all-formula, all the time"" films come out and get solid reviews. It's really good at recycling and putting twists on familiar concepts and making them appear a bit more fresh. ""Wanted"" knows which cards to get and how to play them right, that's for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Finally a good vehicle for Angelina Jolie,"There was an Angie before and after girl interrupted/bone collector. Before was a great actress for miniseries but very bad for movies.

And her dramas and comedies were bad and her performance even worse. Even I dislike her in the too hate or too love performance of a Mighty hard.

I am glad the reviews pulled me in because Angie could not have done it alone. I never paid for Tomb Raider because every single movie ever made from a video game pretty much sucks in my opinion. This is a film you really must savor on the big screen. The action almost never lets up and when it does there is a solid fun story going on. Is the premise ridiculous? Absolutely. Who cares?

A good action packed movie with lots of flaws,"I saw the trailer of this movie so I could not wait to watch it. I pretty much got what I wished for; maybe even more.

I recommend the one entitled ""Why, why, why"" from 30 June 2008.2) (-2 stars) The main character. People seem to like James McAvoy, but I really really don't. I think he cannot pull off a character like this. The movie shows some similarities to the first ""Matrix"" (fortunately not too many) where Keanu Reeves COULD play a 'superhero'. Or check out ""Hancock"" with Will Smith. That's a superhero! Even if in the beginning Hancock was a drunken bum. I think James McAvoy is even worse than Tobey Maguire in Spiderman. And his monologues are lame-lame-lame.The rest of the cast is OK, Angelina is perfect for the part and Morgan Freeman can play anything and anyone.Another small complain is the impossible action scenes. For example I made some trajectory calculations and it just doesn't come out. Even the ones that do are impossible to execute by a human. While this is not a flaw next time please put ""Sci-Fi"" among the genre list.If you are a fan of action movies you should definitely watch this one.Update: after watching the movie for the 2nd time James McAvoy does not seem so bad so I raised my vote with one star. Another thing I noticed is that the headshots are extremely brutal. So go ahead and watch the DVD.Update2: after watching the movie for the manieth time I just realized it's kinda like a lite version of ""Fight Club"" but in a more fantasy setting.

He's the man alright.,"Wanted is loosely based on the comic book miniseries of the same name by Mark Millar. It's directed by Timur Bekmambetov and stars James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, Thomas Kretschmann, Common, Terence Stamp and Konstantin Khabensky. The storyline follows Wesley Gibson (McAvoy), a frustrated and downtrodden office worker who discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin when he is saved by Fox (Jolie) from being assassinated himself in a supermarket. Initially he is baffled and out of his depth, but upon meeting the secret ""Fraternity"" headed by Sloan (Freeman), Gibson starts to undergo training to fulfil his destiny as a ""Fraternity"" hit-man.One of the better things about popcorn action movies is when there is a geek coming good and kicking ass. Be it super-heroes or average Joe's finding something extra, having the rise of the meek get tough at its core is normally a winner. So it is with Wanted, the US directorial debut of Night/Day Watch helmer, Timur Bekmambetov. It's not so much that McAvoy's anxiety riddled office worker gets to play guns, sports cars and hang with a lithe Angelina Jolie - it's that he, courtesy of a good source, gets to not care about the killing. The film may not be as dark as the source material, but the essence of it is there with corruption and violence at the core. The story, as bonkers as it is, is simplified into one that features ancient weavers receiving messages depicting targets to be wiped from the planet for the greater good of humanity. Enter the ""Fraternity"" in modern times, which in the name of good, goes out slotting said targets. Oh but it's not just a case of line someone up in a telescope and pull the trigger, this is more fun than that.For action movies in this decade, Wanted has few peers. From the intense and brutal training regime that Gibson undertakes, to the number of explosive and inventive sequences that flit in and out of the piece, it delivers pulse raising cinema. There's outrageous car pursuits, car jumps with whirls and crash bangs, speeding trains resplendent with stunts, a train crash sequence that's as good as anything in popcorn world, and then there's the bullets. Curving bullets that either smack into each other or do untold damage to the forehead of some unknowing target. That the makers are not aiming for the PG-13 market is an obvious bonus, for it allows them to fully payoff on the fights and blood letting. Even those that come with funny and inventive gimmicks. Bekmambetov is having fun, the nature of the beast is a haven for his fast-cutting and slow-mo dalliances, while the noise that thunders out of the speakers pulls one further into the action.McAvoy steps up to the action plate with great success, at times charming yet pathetic, at others totally scary, he revels in the chance to carry a movie of such adrenalin fuelled excess. Jolie too comes out with much credit, the role of Fox giving her the chance to shine, unlike Lara Croft, as a charismatic action girl. While Freeman does what Freeman does well, be straight and oddly classy. Not since John Woo's action berserker Face-Off 11 years previously has the action genre been this much fun and exciting. The pace may not be perfect, and some scenes will be just too ridiculous for some demanding critics (they of course realise the tongue in cheek/nudge in the ribs that's going on?), but regardless, Wanted has taken the action genre to another level. Lets hope it's not 11 years till we have to wait for the next bar raiser. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Thought it was a commercial at first...,"Saw this by mistake in the theaters awhile back.The ticket taker led me to the wrong theater, can't remember what I actually came to see, but I sat down and the usual commercials started playing. Then this thing came on and I thought 'hope this is the last one and the movie will start.'Well, it turned into the longest commercial I ever remember seeing at the theater. I kept thinking ""wow, they're really stretching the limits on what they think we'll tolerate on commercials these days"".So 15 minutes into it and I'm thinking what in the world... is this commercial ever going to end? As far as commercials go I'd pretty much had it, it looked another horrible Angelina Jolie I'm-such-a-badass movie, and made a mental note not to ever see this piece of garbage.Then *ding* it finally dawned on me that I wasn't watching a commercial, I was actually in the wrong theater.

I got what I wanted !,"Right from the onset I was enthralled by Wanted. It is one of the most explosive action movie I have ever seen.Wanted is a story about a loser Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) who works with a firm as an accountant. His life is hell and nothing seems to be going right with him. He is on anti-anxiety pills and is also harassed by his grumpy boss who keeps irritating him with a stapler and loads of work. He is such a miserly person that together with his best friend his girl friend is cheating on him. But one day his life takes a new leaf when he is rescued by Fox (Angelina Jolie) who happens to be a member of 'The Fraternity' a secret society of trained assassins. She rescues him from a rogue assassin Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) who wants to kill him. Cross has also 'allegedly' killed Wesley's father who was one of the assassins at 'The Fraternity'.Wanted is a film with a lot of twists & turns. It's thrilling narration will keep you absorbed in the movie.It is a suspense thriller with bloody action sequences.. The cinematographer of the movie uses a lot of computer generated effects to give the thrills to the movie.The movie was also nominated for 2 Oscars for 'Best Sound Editing' & 'Best Sound Mixing'. It's a cruel irony that it lost out the awards to Slumdog Millionaire. In my view the guys at the sound department did a flawless job in delivering some of the best sounds ever made for a movie. The sound mixing was awesome & added the necessary juice required for an action movie. The heart pumping background score really sent shivers down my heart!Performance wise going, James McAvoy was surely the show stealer of the movie. I have always been amazed by his expressions. Morgan Freeman's role was small but important. I hope he gets some longer roles in future. His talent needs to be given more on-screen time in order to really get a feel of what he has in store with him. Angelina Jolie was awesome in her role. The rest of the cast did a fair job too.Overall Wanted is a nice & sleek action movie. It will surely remind you of the Matrix series, although it's much more violent. Go enjoy yourself out !http://muditsood.info/articles/",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Rubbish...that's all I have to say about that,"Wanted is a dull exercise in guns, blood, ridiculous vehicular stunts, and mediocre CGI. I appreciate the film's unapologetic, in-your-face attitude, but the experience is overwhelmingly generic. There's your usual bullet-bending, Matrix-style action hackishly combined with a story about a nebbishy CPA who discovers he's the son of an assassin.McAvoy is unremarkable in the lead role...I actually found him quite grating and unlikeable and never really believed he was some badass killer. There's some star power here as well w/ Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie's lips...they are adequate but not really given much to work with. And anyway, the actors take a backseat to the bloody action and mayhem, which I've seen done better in some of the ultraviolent Asian action flicks this movie is so obviously trying to emulate.Stay away from Wanted, filmgoing public. Stay away!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Flimsy but Spectacular Movie,"My bottom line is this.. if your are expecting a movie that obeys all known physical, chemical and gravitational laws, and that nothing about it should be deviant from what you already know, then go watch discovery channel, or National geographic. If you wanna spend about an hour and a half, just being entertained by and action thriller, then this movie fits the bill.There are some scenes that are brilliant, simply brilliant. You just cant help but gape at the screen, just by the sheer brilliance of the direction and cinematography. There will be again some more scenes, where you just wanna pull your hair out, cos its so incredulous. Bullets hitting bullets, and curving the path of the bullets by flicking your arm are just some of the things that begin to make you think this is one stupid hell of a movie.But believe me, the way the story has been taken through, though predictable, doesn't leave you unfulfilled. You almost just cant wait to find out whats going to happen next, cos its gonna keep you guessing any which ways.The acting is splendid. Anjelina and McAvoy have played their roles to perfection. And Freeman, though a small role, plays it with panache. The music score is OK, nothing spectacular, but the camera work and the special effects are nothing short of spectacular, for sure.Again I warn you, don't go to watch expecting to be convinced, but go to watch the movie, just for the pure thrill of watching an excellent action movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
one of the best action movies of the year,"Every actor and actress played a vital role and it did suit their images..Everything was great from story till the direction.. must see if you are an action fan and also if you are Angelina fan....The story line was a different and direction was beautiful. The stunts were organised well. There were lots of graphics involved and it did give proper touch to the movie.. It is one of the best action movies in my books and I cant wait to have it released in DVD so that I can add to my collections. I could not believe here in UK, it was going to be houseful. Everyone had smiles in their faces when they are out of the cinema. It really made my evening go good and this was the first time my girlfriend liked an action movie...

Crazy action+humor=amazing,"I was amazed after I saw Wanted. I was expecting Wanted to be a really good movie, but not this great. I was really blown away by what this film brought to the big screen. Sure it does have a matrix style to it, but the humor and twists made it even more interesting and enjoyable.James McAvoy is Wesley Gibson, a 25-year-old man whose life is miserable as hell. When he is working, his boss always complains regarding his work and his girlfriend cheats on him with his best friend. Gibson is basically nobody until he meets Fox (Angelina Jolie), a member of the Fraternity, a secret society that trains Gibson to develop pretty amazing and find the guy that killed his father. After joining the team, Gibson turns his life around and soon learns that the organization he is in, is not actually what it looks like.I thought the story was great and really well told. I was very surprised by the twist in the story. The movie wasn't really long, but it still manages to tell the whole story fine and clearly. I thought the director did a great job at that.The acting in the movie was great. James McAvoy was the perfect choice to play Wesley Gibson. He understood the character and did a great job. I thought Angelina Jolie did a good job as Fox. Some people thought she was bad, but I though she delivered a pretty good performance. Angelina was tough and physical, which I love about her. As for always, Morgan Freeman did a great as Sloan and he made me laugh in some parts of the movie.Besides the storyline, the action, humor, and special effects were amazing. The action scenes were incredibly entertainment and mind blowing (curving a bullet is pretty cool). The special effects were amazing. I thought the effects were very realistic. The humor is the last thing I love about Wanted. I was seriously not expecting the movie to be so hilarious.Wanted is one of the best summer movie and it delivers in every way. This is one hell of a ride and I can't wait for the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Unrealistic to the extreme (in a bad way),"I hope that this movie was not supposed to be smart in a Matrix kind of way. I'm pretty certain that it was intended to be more of a comedy then a action. But for me this movie was way to exaggerated. It was simply to many unbelievable and unrealistic events for me.If you can relax with that, and enjoy the movie for it's action then ignore this comment.I don't like to be negative and comment on films just because i don't like them. It's more fun to give a movie credit or at least good constructive criticism, but this was one of the worst modern ""blockbusters"" i have ever seen.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Purely Action,I must preface this with: I'm an absolute sucker for action flicks.There are multiple topics on the message board stating how this movie's physics are impossible making the movie not enjoyable. If you went into Wanted thinking that it would be realistic you must not have seen any of its publicity because every trailer and summary that I have seen gives an accurate representation of the contents of the movie.It is completely unrealistic but that should be expected and instead you should focus on how visually stunning it is. The cast is beautiful and the effects are fantastic. The plot had some unexpected turns but in the end you should think of this purely as an action movie. The viewer must go in appreciating its ingenuity and physics-bending ideas and simply enjoy the ride.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Warning - too much brain candy may actually rot your brain!,"Contains Spoilers: I really couldn't believe this film.I don't mean I couldn't believe that a young guy could be plucked from his boring life and trained to be a super assassin.I don't mean that I couldn't believe that by channelling adrenalin, he is able to alter his perception of time to dodge or catch bullets, is able to jump onto moving trains, and is even able to shoot around corners.What I couldn't believe is that major film studios still insult their viewing audience with awful scripts such as this.Despite all the slo-mo digital effects, this film had no characters you could empathise with, lousy dialogue, no humour and no sense of drama.I don't understand why the studios would be prepared to pay many millions of dollars for top Hollywood stars and special effects when the script is so shoddy.They are presumably quite happy that the film has made a lot of money, but it cost a lot and could have made even more if it was truly involving and entertaining.Surely the cost of writing a decent script for this would have been negligible in comparison to the overall cost of this film.Sam Raimi's Spider-man films show how you can portray ""comic book"" characters with plenty of action, but also sympathetic characters and humour, this surely greatly broadens the appeal of the films.I bought the 3 Spider-Man films, I have all the Superman and Batman films etc, like this film, they all stretch credibility, but have the added advantage of good scripts and humour (well maybe not Superman IV).There's no way I would buy this tripe on DVD, so they've lost out on an additional £15 from me.Why did they base this on the comic book when it is such a departure from the storyline anyway, why did the publishers let them? The studio should revisit the accounts for this film in a year, and see how much net profit The Dark Knight and Iron Man have made with additional cinema tickets, DVD and Blu-Ray sales etc, and think strongly about sending the chimps with typewriters back to the zoo.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
pretty damn cool,"Wanted is based on a controversial comic of the same name written by Mark Millar. It will be hard to believe for those that see the movie without having read the comic book, but the film is actually toned down. ""The Fraternity"" has their own code of ethics. They are doing what they feel is right and are unconcerned with and unapologetic for any collateral damage. They train Wesley in the ways of their world: special baths that accelerate healing, the power to slow down their perception of time (thereby increasing their own reaction time) and the ability to bend the trajectory of bullets.And let's be honest, it looks pretty damn cool. Tooling around Chicago in Dodge Viper, killing bad guys and using Angelina Jolie to make your ex-girlfriend jealous makes for a fun Friday night in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Good summer blockbuster,"With action and suspense elements comparable to (but still slightly lower quality than) The Matrix and the Bourne movies, Wanted brings a lot to the screen. The action sequences are phenomenal, and with James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, and Morgan Freeman as principals, there is plenty of star power. McAvoy's change from patsy to hero is inspiring. Jolie is beautiful, tough and sexy as usual. Freeman's wise old man persona carries his usual weight. Despite the intensity, the film did seem to drag occasionally and the patsy angle seems slightly overplayed. Still the story was compelling, and held my interest through to the end. Some of the effects are truly spectacular and cutting edge. If you like action movies, you will want to see this one",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"All the plot structure of The Matrix, and a little Fight Club, dressed up like Shoot 'Em Up doesn't  make this any good.","I never write reviews on IMDb. It takes too long. But this movie blanked me off.The entire plot structure is stolen from The Matrix, and I mean directly ripped off. Some loser finds out he's one-in-a-million with super crazy powers and he must join a group of people who will train him to use these powers against evil, etc. It doesn't stop there though. Angelina-Trinity saves his life and takes him to Morpheus Freeman who explains 'their secret world' to him and through brutal training he teaches him to dodge bullets, or in this case make bullets dodge other things. Same story.The action is fun enough I guess but it's almost all CGI and feels very fake. I liked it better in Shoot 'Em Up when the crazy blank was tongue in cheek. Here, we're just supposed to accept their mind-bending reality without question AND it gets real serious sometimes. You can't have both, seriously.There are many other really obvious blank-ups here if you pay attention, pick 'em out for yourself cause I won't list 'em all.Bottom Line: You never find out anything about these people or why they are assassins or who their boss is, etc. If you really wanna see this for the action my comments aren't gonna stop ya. Some of the scenes are kinda fun, but as a whole this movie is very hollow, and nothing I'll watch twice.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
WANTED is an EYE CANDY and delivers more than expected...,"Hello folks, First of all I must admit I am huge fan of Timur Bekmambetov and his previous Russian/international hits NIGHTWATCH / DAYWATCH (although he's done some pretty good other Russian-only movies). Also I tell you that I am huge fan of action thriller movie genre at all and I seldom miss any decent film which comes out of this genre.So, to start, when I first seen WANTED trailer - I thought to myself that this movie would be average action fx movie, kinda NIGHTWATCH themed. Because I can feel that Timur used his same visual style in it.However when I have watched it - I thought that it is absolutely one of the most entertaining action movies of the Spring/Summer this year (of course I have so far IRON MAN as #1 and waiting for DARK KNIGHT as main summer event).I won't fo into details describing the movie plot etc - there's plenty in other comments. I do understand that this movie of course is not perfect.The story is clearly ZERO. And the all it has is a very typical MATRIX style clichés like THE FAITH concept, CHOOSE YOUR OWN DESTINY. It also has some pretty similar parts and even dialogs that were extremely close to the original MATRIX.However.This should not mislead you that this movie is worthless. All movie is done as a remarkable EYE CANDY. All film like an complete 2 hours FX sequence. Plot is not smart but the action entertains and great lead actors DO manage to keep the tone of the film. Indeed there are too many SLO-MO sequences, but they actually cool. There is a dark humor and self irony in that film. What else - some graphical and this bullet bending thing - is not done (as far as I know) in previous movies.The score and song by Danny Elfman is clearly great shot to deliver the film.I really laugh out loud when people say that other films has some more sense - COME ON - this is just action movie! It get's you entertained.As a bottom line I just say 2 things: 1. I have seen this movie already twice in cinema and will plan to go with my family again this coming weekend. 2. Today as a first day of start HANCOCK I went to see it too and I found it really MUCH LESS entertaining that WANTED.I think you guys (thous who say this movie is crap and ripoff) need really make your mind. How many movies actually don't rip off others? OK there was a Matrix, but what? There was for example DARK CITY ....Also if you say that IRON MAN (my fave) is not a ripoff of a SUPERMEN crossed with TRANSFORMERS and BATMAN BEGINS - I would say that you do only jealous that Russian director did that.Actually you should not blame Timur for plot as the script and story was not his... As director he did a great job and I already got myself a complete Danny Elfman soundtrack to this movie.OK enough of this. I this this movie deserves to be watched.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
It's cool to jump through the air shooting without taking aim and to curve bullets is AWESOME.. Or IS it?,"When I first heard of this movie, I thought it might be an interesting take on the action-genre and with Freeman and Jolie in the cast it reinforced my thoughts.Taking a pile of assassins with the ability to dodge bullets, shoot wings off of flies, jump from scraper to scraper and much much more, is surely to make one hell of an action-flick.Sadly this couldn't be farther from the truth. The script must have been written down by a 12-year-old, who must have been retarded too. All the action gets lost in the infantile mood and exaggerated abilities, which aren't explained with more than 5 words.The movie is a mess and Freeman, who I think is a well performing actor, can't even remotely hide the bad writing or the irretrievable lame execution of this movie.I am mostly disappointed with this movie... And 4 stars equals very generous! Watch it if: It doesn't take more than Jolie with a tattoo and Freeman in a suit to maintain your interest.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Solid Summer Flick for Adults,"Although not a ground breaking film by any means, Wanted is a fun & fast-paced thrill ride packed with humor and violence - if you can get past the hefty helping of ""camera-shake"" and f-bombs that is.James McAvoy makes the part his own. I was stunned to learn that he also played Mr. Tumnus in Chronicles of Narnia! Talk about range, lol. He's fun to watch and has great timing and presence.Jolie steals the stage with her trademark smirk, phenomenal looks, and bad-girl persona. She and McAvoy pair well on screen.Weighing in is Morgan Freeman. This film probably won't win him any awards, but his charm and strength plays well and anchors the film.The movie was edited well, the scenes flowed easily and breaks in the momentum were purposeful and not drawn out. A major plus Wanted has going for it is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. You'll be switching from laughter to saying, ""Whoa, check that out!"".I don't know how well this will stand up to this year's lineup, but on its own merits its definitely worth a little coin and a Friday evening to check out. If you like action, a plot twist or two, some good humor, and smart writing then definitely go see Wanted! P.S. Definitely NOT MEANT FOR YOUNGER VIEWERS!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Nothing Else Can Compare,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along which breaks every rule set down by decades of films before it. Every era has at least one, and ever since the Matrix came along, with its seamless integration of psychedelic CG, incredible imagination, and jumbled direction that always leaves you slightly perplexed but wanting more, (an experience only slightly hindered, in my own opinion, by Keanu Reeves' acting,) we've been living in the era in which action movies strive to follow in its footsteps, (even to the point of casting Keanu Reeves, god knows why.) Now Wanted has come along that beaten path and the rules have been broken again.If I were to describe Wanted as a rigid film connoisseur, I would probably have to give this movie a 4/10. A movie with barely any plot, direction, character development, closure, with predictable twists and uninteresting situations etc. A movie which breaks not only every film law in the book, but also the fundamental laws of physics, gravity, reality, biology, etc, etc, etc.However, I cannot give this movie anything but a 9, because Wanted was nothing short of an astounding and awesome, and I do mean awesome, action flick I could watch every day for the rest of my life, and I doubt I would ever get bored with it. The numbness inflicted when I watched the ending sequence left me in a state of awe and wonderment I have yet to recover from. The only thing preventing me from giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is far from perfect.As I've already mentioned, the story is somehow both simplistic and convoluted, Wesley - the protagonist- is as shallow as the rest of the cast of characters and is occasionally annoying with his overuse of words and phrases, which thankfully deviate from most classic one-liners, the direction zig zags all over the place, and you could see every plot twist coming from a mile away, if you were paying any attention to the plot that is. But I found myself forgetting all of this because of how awesome everything else was.And if you can go into a theatre, watch this movie, and see nothing but the problems in the above paragraph, believe me when I say that you are missing out on the cinematic experience of a lifetime.Again, this is an era in which CG can determine the quality of an action movie, and Wanted could never have existed without the effects it uses, and while this frequently this makes movies insubstantial and weak, it's far from true in this case. This movie blew my mind, and if you can set your disbelief aside for two hours to watch it, it will probably it will do the same for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Biggest Disappointment of the Summer,"This movie had everything going for it: amazing caste, excellent set-up for a story, and very high anticipation. Five minutes into the movie, I can already feel the disappointment sinking in. The violence and sex were explicit and pointless, and all it did was leave a bad taste in my mouth. The actual story is trite, incongruous, and not very original. The protagonist is an emo loser that cries and moans about his miserable existence. The message of the movie is that anyone that doesn't kill people for a living is not living their life to the fullest. I recommend not wasting your money on this huge disappointment of a movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted is different but every bit as good as the comic book!,"Wow, I was not expecting to like this movies at all because it was so different than the source material (they were actual super villains in the comics). But it was really good. James McAvoy was a good lead, and you can't miss will Angelina and Freeman. The action was really clean and quick with slick special effects.The story follows a dead beat, loser who has a crap life and nothing is going for him. He is recruited into a league of assassins after his father ,who was part of the league, was assassinated. They train him as he has potential to be as good as his father and they need someone skilled enough to catch his father's murderer.I don't know how some message board people criticize movies for having a bad premise when it is based on a book or graphic novel.

Do not vote for this movie with your wallet!,"As consumers we vote with our wallets, and the tide has been turning against consumers for years now. Have we come to the point that if the premise is great, we don't care about the execution? I just don't understand all these glowing reviews. I am not some high brow movie consumer. I just want to walk out of a movie without feeling like I just wasted my time.This movie wasted my time. Sure, I do think the concept is a really great one. No question. The whole idea is really great. No surprise as its from a comic. Did I read the comic? Nope, but as an avid collector many years ago, I know that there are some really great ideas in comics. This movie cannot take credit for the concept, people!What it can take credit for is a total lack of execution. I do not have issue with the first half of the movie. Everything up to the twist climax was standard summer movie fare. Nothing special (besides the great concept) but also nothing terrible (though James McAvoy's acting was borderline terrible). I would probably rate it a 6. After that point, it just fell apart and ruined anything positive this movie had to offer. The story became worse than lame, the characters less than 1 dimensional and the ending was a joke. I wished I had walked out before the last 30-45 minutes.Basically, it was a big buildup to an interesting climax, then everyone in this movie had no idea where to go with it. Without spoilers, its impossible to go into details. So I will just say the movie went from a 6 to -6 but I can't give it less than a 1. It deserves >1.I feel bad that we consumers have come to a point where there are enough people ready to settle for half a movie with a great concept taken verbatim from someone else, to give this pile of trash glowing reviews.

A very good popcorn flick,"If you go to a movie for entertainment  this is a movie for you. If you go to a movie for the artistic value of it, then stay away from it. I personally take the movie for what it is, and I greatly enjoyed it. It's fun, action packed and a hot chick is in there . If I have to sum up this movie, make comparisons -- I would say at the face value, it's a mixture of The Matrix (the corridor scene), Equilibrium (the gun fights and the logic behind their superiority), and the Enter the Dragon (fighting climaxes, moving up killing the villains to get to the main boss). If you liked those movies above you should enjoy this one as well.I think James McAvoy did very well in this movie. I liked him in The Last King of Scotland but he could not really shine in front of the mighty Forest Whitaker. This movie is all about him, there is hardly a scene without him once he comes in.All in all Wanted is a fun movie to watch for its action, graphics, and stunts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
I Wanted More,"I don't usually say things like this but there's just something about WANTED that brings out the boy in me so you'll just have to indulge me. WANTED is awesome! Seriously. Awesome. Well, it's awesome and also oddly preachy and condescending out of nowhere. And I guess if I'm being completely honest, it is also ludicrous. I mean, essentially, you've got this guy, Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) and, unbeknownst to him, he is the son of one of the world's greatest assassins. Apparently, the ability to hit a target in the most impossible of scenarios is passed on from one generation to the next. (See, I always thought it skipped a generation but I'm hardly an expert on the subject.) Meanwhile, what's he doing with this gift? Nothing. He is sitting around, wasting his time as a number cruncher in a cramped little box, I mean, cubicle, while letting his supposed best bud get away with nailing his girl on the side. (I apologize if that was offensive to any female readers but WANTED really got my testosterone pumping.) Frankly, I don't know how this wussy little pushover even managed to get a girlfriend but he can also shoot the wings off flies so his having a girl is pretty believable by comparison. By the way, shooting the wings off flies  awesome!Really, what is the more ludicrous scenario here? Is it any more unbelievable that there is a thousand year old group of assassins out there who kill bad guys before they fulfill their bad guy destinies than the reality that a vast majority of humanity gives the bulk of their lives away to the bad guys every day, contributing to their own slow deaths? When you think about how many of us are giving up our dreams, our hopes and our control over our own lives, it's a wonder more of us don't get up and become killing machines. In case you haven't figured it out yet, I work in one of these lovely boxes. I swear, every day I'm there, it's getting a little smaller. So yeah, my friends had to hold me down to stop me from standing and cheering loudly when Gibson grows a pair and tells his boss to stick it before slamming his ergonomic keyboard into his best friend's face. There isn't a day that goes by when I don't want to tell everyone I work with (who hopefully never read my work) exactly what I think of them before breaking out into a musical number with full choreography announcing my departure.Uh, sorry, my testosterone must have dipped there for a second. No problem though. Another screening of WANTED will fix that. Contemporary visual innovator, Timur Bekmanbetov, crams so much manliness into his first Hollywood feature that men everywhere who see it will inevitably walk out with their hands firmly grabbing their crotches. They may even spit. Who knows? You've got colliding car chases, furious fistfights, enormous explosions and Angelina Jolie. The best part about all of this is that Bekmanbetov ropes it all together with unpredictable ferocity. Sure there are unavoidable MATRIX inspired action scenes but once those are out of the way, the action always feels fresh and excitingly innovative. And while the stunts and scenarios are often shockingly brash, Jolie, as Gibson's assassin mentor, is controlled and calculated, like a mechanical goddess. She appears to Gibson when he looks away for a second and for a while, it seems like he might be imagining her as a way out of his doldrums. Once she gets a few good punches in on him during training though, it becomes clear that she is definitely there to wake him up but his scars are most certainly not imagined.WANTED is about wanting something from life, from yourself. It is about not giving in to the conformist existence so many of us fall into and choosing to walk a different path, a more exciting path. Now I don't think it's encouraging everyone to leave their desk jobs and kill people professionally. That has to run in your family, remember? There is no mistake though that Bekmanbetov wants to wake you up. In fact, he gets a little aggressive on the subject in the film's final scenes. This is the only thing that irked me about the entire experience. I had already a blast the whole time that the energy itself was enough to get my blood boiling over the monotony of my weekday life. Up until then, it seemed as though he had sympathy for Gibson and the millions of us out there just like Gibson. But then, all of a sudden, he was pointing the finger directly at me and calling me a loser to my face. Still, maybe getting everyone angry is the only way to get anyone to actually do something about it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Wanted?,...more like ""Found Wanting!!!"" :-(","This was possibly the worst film I have EVER seen, period! A complete waste of time and money in visiting the ""not so local"" cinema. What can I say apart from, interesting plot, poorly thought out screenplay with thoroughly un-realistic stunts and special effects. The film never really go going until the last 20minutes, but the most obvious issue was that you could predict what was going to happen well before it did, and I'm no medium!If ever there's a reason to stay at home, this film is it, and if I could give it zero out of ten, I would!Any reviewer here who gave this film more than three out of ten, must have been watching a different film!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Now this is an Action movie,"Action movies at its finest. Back in the day these movies use to be a dime a dozen but now you are lucky if there is one competent action film every five years. I personally am tired of mutants, people from other planets, and monsters being the heroes for once. Though this movie is based on a comic series it is not like spiderman or the hulk. This movie has the feel of the matrix meets equilibrium. Are the action sequences over the top yes but look at the great action films and tell me there's not over the top moments in those. Not to mention i absolutely love the fact the of the R rating. I have grown tired of the PC movies that come out. If PG-13 movies are so wonderful then why are there only 5 of the last 15 best picture awards winners pg 13. Not to mention those movies are very pushed to the limits of pg 13. Summertime use to be about popcorn and action films and its nice to see one that is absolutely balls to the wall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Total sh1t !!!,"Finally I saw it (2010-04)! I was interested cause i read an article about Bekmambetov (director of the film) in Russian Forbes.What can I say ? It was a total sh1t. Sh1ty plot, sh1tty ideas of violence and revenge, ugly Jolie (really ugly) etc, etc (I think it's not worth to list all negative things here). I think I wouldn't be able to name any positive moment or anything positive about this film at all.My explanation for this sh1t is Bekmambetov. He has 3 other successful (commercially successful) films here in Russia:A. 2 sh1tty Dozors (""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch"", i'm afraid I wasted time for watching 1,33 of them) - just the same sh1tty mix as in WantedB. Irony of Fate 2 - i didn't see it (and i am not going to). It was successful as it was a sequel of a very well-known old Soviet film.Bekmambetov is commercially successful but didn't respect his viewer at all - he believes that customer is so stupid that formula for success is ""twisted"" plot + u can be hero + Jolie + Freeman + violence + spec effects = success, but as a result I saw another TOTAL sh1t.So i'm afraid that in the nearest future you will have an opportunity to see another TOTAL SH1T from Timur Bekmambetov. I am very sorry ;))))Kind regards, IvanPS: SH1T was used only 8 times here. I believe the number should be greater. PPS: i am really sorry for using ""SH1T"", but i couldn't find another suitable words (they were even worse)",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Great summer action flick! with Angelina Jolie,"Wanted has been out for some weeks now and is winding down in the box office but if u haven't seen it yet u really should. This has to be the most badass movie since Crank came out back in 2006 (which u should also see). It opens up with about eight people getting their heads blown off, sparing no blood. Of course if ur squeamish to blood and violence this is not a PG-13 action flick for sure this shows the violence and in graphic detail. But enough about the violence, this movie truly has a good story and good acting. But the thing that stood out most to me was how well made this film was with the over the top action sequences to the countless times we get the bullets eye view and to the well done twist in the story towards the end. In short this is a great summer action flick that should not be missed.P.S. to all the guys out there, u even get a quick peek at Angelina Jolie's nude ass",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
There's only one word to describe 'Wanted',"Satisfying.Very good action flick with great special effects. Angelina is as usual bad ass and James McAvoy proved himself worthy of winning the role as Wesley Gibson.With twists and turns the movie doesn't seem to last the whole two hours of its running time.I definitely left with a smile on my face.Lets just say that if you're craving a good action flick, definitely see 'Wanted'.Obviously this movie isn't for children otherwise it wouldn't be rated R. It's a little gory and definitely not for the weak stomach. Wanted is definitely worth the ticket price and I'm buying the DVD immediately when it comes out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted: better characters. Otherwise sharp and intense,"Unsatisfied with his life, Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) joins a group of assassins to hunt down the man who killed his father.From trailers, Wanted may seem like an ordinary action thriller with a stereotypical list of characters but Bekmambetov's picture is very diverse from your run of your mill conventional genres with a truly intense twisting plot and a bizarre choice of direction.As good an actor as McAvoy (Last King of Scotland) is, he can't do anything about the stereotypical hero character he plays. Bored with life, feeling he has more potential, hasn't found love etc. These conventions of a central character won't surprise the most optimistic viewer. Sadly Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider) and Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar baby) are also stereotyped and thankfully the plot makes them slightly different.Wanted is sharp, fast and importantly interesting and diverse. This film fulfils the action genre with guns, chases and fighting. The thriller genre is also justified through the intensity of the central ideology.Gibson has joined the assassins to hunt down the man who killed his father and though this may scream that idea of unsung hero defying odds to get retribution, there is a charm about the approach in this picture. Despite logic saying that the clichés and conventions of scenes and ideologies are repetitive, the action and likability about the picture will keep you hooked right till the very twisty end, with one of the best final lines to a film in recent years.The approach is made intriguing through the direction. Very sharp and sophisticated, Bekmambetov is able to create an artistic action thriller with a slow down motion. As bullets fly, as the pounding in Gibson's head gets louder we are given this stylistic vision of slowness and is so different and bizarre that it simply has to be admired. There isn't one bad shot in the entire film and credit to Bekmambetov who has changed the ordinary view of an action thriller into a piece of art.His advancement and directness help create that cutting edge to the film and we are thrust into Gibson's life head first.The plot is exciting and always interesting, if some scenes are predictable and unrealistic. There are many twists and turns along the way which makes Wanted an intriguing thriller with excellent direction, if not the best characters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Unpredictable movie!,"Wanted is one of my favorite movie! Action. Angelina Jolie was very cool,powerful, and sexy on that movie! It's a little too complicated but you wouldn't predict the end of the story. It's about ancient,history mentioning Ku Klax Klan(KKK). Even it's seems just full of action,but you can also feel their togetherness,their love besides the killing mission. Fraternity community who killed bad guys which based on the message from the wool.And a Father will never see their child suffered and being used by someone. Do you wonder about this movie??

Wanted Review,"I saw Wanted at a Sneak Preview. First let me say that I went expecting to hate it. Nothing I saw about this movie in trailers or commercials made me want to see it. I WAS WRONG. This movie blew my socks off. I don't go to movies just to watch stuff blow up. I need more, something deeper. Something with thought, and creativity. Wanted delivers all of that and more. Our hero Wesley is reluctantly trained to be an assassin. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything, this is not news. I was reminded of Rocky with the training scenes. Only Wesley is the side of beef. I'll not say any more. The movie has twists and turns and mind numbing action, and a little bit of heart. Keep in mind, this is based on a graphic novel, so stretching reality is okay. Angelina Jolie, while I get tired of her holding orphans and wanting to feed the world, she is incredibly beautiful. And she uses it like a weapon in Wanted. Although she could stand to stop feeding the world and eat a sammich. Don't take the kiddies to this one, I sat next to a family with little kids and the mother had to rush and cover the kids eyes when suddenly sex is thrust in their eyes. Not once but twice. Then F Bombs flying everywhere. Not to mention the gore. There's plenty of that. What I expected to be a 1 * movie turns out to be a 3 *** movie. Butter up the popcorn and buckle up, it's going to be a fun ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Decent Action movie with standard excellent effects and ridiculous plot,"Wesley Gibson isn't exactly leading the life of his dreams. He's stuck in a dead-end job presided over by a tyrannical bitch, his best friend is having sex with his slattern girlfriend, his bank account doesn't allow him to retrieve $5, and he suffers from random panic attacks that send him scrambling for his pills.One evening while refilling said pills, a pretty woman arrives and tells him his father (whom he had not known since birth) was assassinated on a rooftop the day before. She then embarks in a furious firefight against a would-be assassin, with Wesley caught in between.If you think this is about as tense as it gets for him, think again. In this action movie directed by relative newcomer Timur Bekmambetov, Wanted is a skillful mixture of high-octane fights and chases interspersed with storyweaving and character development. Both aspects are done remarkably well  nothing stellar perhaps, but better than your average Action flick.Anyway. The movie takes a little while to settle in, allowing us to meet and understand the protagonist and the woes of his pathetic life, and although the pacing can be a little on the slow side at times, it's never really annoying or limiting for one's experience of the film. Soon Wesley is brought into a group known as The Fraternity: a thousand-year-old secret organization of assassins that carry out Fate's dirty work by killing marks chosen by a sort of prescient loom. Now, seeing as you yourself probably had to read that doozie twice, imagine what poor Wesley must be thinking  and not only because he finds he's able to wield a gun for the first time in his life to shoot the wings off a bunch of flies.Eventually he decides to join the Fraternity after 'quitting' his job in a rather beautiful manner, yet his training is less about instructing him with assassination skills and techniques, and more about beating, cutting and berating the living crap out of him. One could wonder what beating a man to a pulp over and over again has to do with training him to become a more efficient killer, but perhaps that's all part of something I don't quite see eye-to-eye with. Anyway, moving on.The storyline is a long and archaic one, full of twists that are as unpredictable as they are intriguing. It's also about as plausible as mankind ever deciding to commence world peace. From men jumping hundreds of feet from office tower to office tower, to a young and average man suddenly possessing marksmanship talents to make Bob 'The Nailer' Lee Swagger jealous, the action sequences in this movie, while exhilarating and pulse-pounding, are remarkably lacking in credibility or realism. Thankfully the special effects are well-enough executed to hide this fallacy, and the result is an incredibly implausible yet highly entertaining action feature. The whole movie is basically like The Matrix, only minus the swooshing trenchcoats, cool sunglasses and evil computers. We even have a form of 'bullet-time', such as several creative and stimulating shots of bullets colliding in mid-air, though any reference is likely to be unintentional, and merely the product of my over-developed criticism muscle.The acting is strong and solid: James McAvoy is credible in his performance as poor Wesley Gibson, and Angelina Jolie is as powerful (and seducing) as ever as the enigmatic and ruthless Fox. Morgan Freeman is once again cast as a wise, all-knowing old man, this time as the leader of the Fraternity, Sloan.The movie has several instances of grotesque images or dialogue, from a pointlessly vulgar vernacular to some rather troubling shots of blood and gore (not to mention a particular scene near the end that will make any Animal Rights activists explode). One can debate whether such graphic content was really needed; not that I mind all that much, it just seemed slightly forced  or inversely, unrestrained. But overall, quite unimportant  no-one's gonna be offended by a few swear words or bullet holes when they go to see a movie about a bunch of professional assassins. Unless they're retards.* * * * * For hitting the screen with brilliant action sequences that unfortunately somewhat lack in the credibility area, I award Wanted 7.5 curving bullets out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

This movie sucked big time,"Many say that this movie is Matrix reloaded, but with much more humor. I'm sorry to say that, despite the fact that I usually am very tolerant with bad movies and try to have a good time even if they don't appeal to me that much, this time I just couldn't. I just sat there for 90-100 minutes and wondered what was in James McAvoy's mind when he accepted to act in it. I mean, my God, I never ever felt that insulted in my entire life. The whole film is just a big fat cliché, filled with ""Come on, how stupid do they think I am to buy this"" scenes. Now seriously, I thought Matrix really had a base on which to build the rest of the plot, a world of its own in which you didn't find it awkward for all those things to happen. In here, I just couldn't wait for the movie to be over and recover myself from this horrible experience... Everything in it either didn't make any sense or it was extremely predictable.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Unwanted movie,The movie is about a young man who finds out that his long lost father is an assassin who is killed and teams up his organisation to avenge him.Anyway let me get to the point this movie is absolutely horrible!!!! The only way I understood the story is by reading it not on the screenplay of the movie.The first half was so unacceptably bad that I felt like I'm in a car diving with no destination. At the start there was a birthday in an office then all of a sudden there was a useless sex scene. There were so many stupid and composite scenes and the filmmakers expect you to suddenly change your mood which is beyond irritating. The action was daft & unrealistic e.g. bullets that goes where you want them to go and shooting a bullet before it hits.The second half got a bit interesting and was going well but the ending was so bad that it just ruined the second half which was the only good part of the film. Personally I think that the beginning and the ending are the most important scenes of any movie because of the first and last impression and the beginning and the ending were the worst scenes of Wanted. There where also some questions that are left unanswered.Overall I Wanted to see this film when I seen the trailer and it totally turned out to be an Unwanted movie.,2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Guilty pleasure,"Wanted is a guilty pleasure for me. It's amoral, rather superficial but so much fun and stylish with a good plot, a few big surprises and really thrilling action scenes. There's stuff in this film that I've never seen anywhere else. I found it bold, dynamic and original. Keep in mind that I'm not judging it based on the comic books source material. I understand the two are quite different and I might have been miffed at the liberties taken if I had read them. Regarding the plot, the only thing I really have some issue with would be a special loom but I got beyond it. Wanted is a great action movie with some fantastical elements that enhance the wow factor. Just don't take it too seriously or think too much about all the victims of the collateral damage. Oh what the heck, since I was so enthusiastic after seeing it for the first time (which rarely happens) I'm going to give it another half star. It's worth purchasing as it's very spectacular and re-watchable.Rating: 8.5 out of 10P.S.: Since this original review, I read the graphic novel that inspired the movie adaptation. The graphic novel and the the movie are two completely different beasts that are extremely loosely connected. I've rarely seen such drastic changes in terms of story, characters and settings, heck practically everything.

"Dreadful, dreary, hackneyed load of old rubbish.","What a pity that actors as good as James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman can allow themselves to be degraded by such pathetic nonsense as ""Wanted"". I went with my sister, who I haven't seen for a couple of years. After this film, I felt embarrassed that after this long time apart, I ended up taking her to this turkey. I stayed to the end but was crawling in my chair from about 50% of the way through the film, wanting to get out of there. I didn't leave because I didn't want to spoil it for my sister. - Little did I know that she was desperate to get out of there too. I don't think I'll have the hide to ever suggest we see a film together.....This dog of a film trawls new depths. Whereas ""The Matrix"" hit the mark (the first one, that is - the second and third ones were dreadful). To compare The Matrix with ""Wanted"" is like comparing dog food with a top meal at Maxim's in Paris.

This is like riding a roller-coaster while hung-over and with a flu. I never identified with the lead adolescent, couldn't understand why they wanted an adolescent lead to begin with.

Moronic is the Word,"I miss simple films. You know, like Rear Window, Rope, and Duel. Rope and Rear Window take place in the same room for the most part and Duel is pretty much just on the highway but the stories are so powerful that it keeps the viewer hooked and on the edge of their seat. Now, let's talk about Wanted. A movie that is nothing like those classics in any way, shape or form. Wanted is movie that is so void of anything with substance that the producers tried to cover it up with a bunch of special effects and cuts every two seconds. I like to enjoy cinematography in a movie, appreciate what kinds of shots are in the film. This movie doesn't allow you to do that because the shot changes every few seconds. It's headache inducing!The acting isn't great at all. Morgan Freeman is pretty good but he's literally the only one who seemed to have any idea what he was doing whatsoever. Angelina Jolie is annoying and non-dimensional and she added nothing to her character. A lot of people have been happy about how James McAvoy is getting leading roles after his portrayal of Tumnus in Narnia. Well, his role in Narnia must have been a fluke because he was terrible in this, I think over-acting is the word. Over all, I wasn't impressed with the cast.The story is totally empty. It's like The Matrix minus a purpose or any form of coherency. I really can't say much more about the plot because there really isn't one at all.

Wow. What a splendidly choreagraphed orgy of gross and over the top violence. Not for the faint of hearted.,"Another VIOLENCE glorifying Hollywood spectacle, but this time around the way the violence is being portrayed and choreagraphed is in an utmost cruel way. Therefore definitely NOT suited for the faint of hearted.What makes the massive amounts of violence bearable though is the cartoonesque way in which it is being portrayed. The violence is so absurd and over the top that it doesnt feel too real anymore, making it easier to digest...More good: excellent acting performances by Morgan Freeman, James McAvoy and Angeline Jolie. This is not just another dumb action movie, because these actors lift this violent movie way up to a high level of quality acting. I was honestly really impressed by the excellent portrayal of all these different assassin characters, who have many layers, we dont yet see upon a first look.Even more good: terrific action choreography special effects, which I personally consider to be of the very best action photography effects I have seen so far...To top it all of, this movie has got a very simple, yet rock solid story, with true to life fears and desires, with true to life feelings of honor and rage. Not a minute is wasted, this movies flashes by with speed and lots of excitement. There is a really terrific mindbending plot turn at the end as well, which left me kinda speechless.Any bad? The violence is often obnoxious and the violence, just for the sake of violence, is definitely being glorified as well, which leaves a bad after taste. But then again, this movie is based upon a graphic novel, and those are by definition over the top violent and absurd. Dont expect too much originality either, it is still a gungho action flick, but a very good one!The story: James McAvoy is trained to become a ruthless, skilled assassin.

'Come with me if you want to live',"Hopelessly derivative generic action flick based on a comic book. It's either that or a computer game these days.It's about pod worker Wesley Gibson, played by James McAvoy of Atonement and Last King of Scotland fame this time putting on an American accent. He hates his job, his life, his co-workers etc, then out of the blue this lush assassin (Angelina Jolie) is hauling him off into a different destiny. So far, so The Matrix, but then there's the 'Come with me if you want to live' action scene where they're being chased by a nasty assassin and she's protecting him. It also reminded me of Weird Science, as the nerd is mooning over her, too.It's all a bit like Hit-man, the difference being the story arc. In Hit-man, the assassin is a cool deadly type who learns real feelings thanks to a girl he picks up, in Wanted it's a loser who learns to be a cool deadly type thanks to being picked up by a girl, it's reversed. I do prefer Wanted because the two leads are more charismatic and it has two outstanding action scenes.That said, while I like McAvoy as an actor on principle, I'm not sure he can really carry a film like this. I didn't care for his US accent, so far it's all a bit like Ewan McGregor when he tried to break into the States. He lacks the air of mystery or paradox. Really they may as well have cast an American actor. Jolie is terrific, I must admit she's a real celluloid turn on and you don't get many of those these days.Although it picks up towards the end, this is a real dumb flick . I think it needed a European director to tap into its moral ambiguity. I mean, someone tells you to be an assassin and you just go with it? Also, this nerd is meant to be trained up but it seems to take place within a few weeks rather than a year... It has lots of visual tricks to distract from the fact that most of it is nicked from other films.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Serviceable, yet soulless, action flick, oddly devoid of a sense of wonder.","Very loosely based upon Mark Millar's comic book miniseries of the same name, Wanted is the story of a white collar office worker who discovers he is actually the son of the world's greatest assassin and sets out to avenge his fathers death with a secret fraternity of assassins who choose their targets from 'The Loom Of Fate.' Yes, seriously, 'The Loom Of Fate'.Awkwardly pitched somewhere between 'Matrix' and 'Fight Club' (without the sense of wonder of the former or the intelligence of the latter) and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, best known for 2004's Night Watch, Wanted is difficult to judge as a film. It's oddly soulless, inflicted by an over reliance on CGI and A.D.D. direction that seems to infect the majority of modern action films, yet it does have some very good set pieces and a reasonable involving storyline, though the dialogue itself is a bit of a mess and the characters are never explored to their full potential.James McAvoy, one of the better actors to break through over the last few years, gives a decent performance as the film's protagonist Wesley Gibson, (ignoring his horrific attempt at an American accent) though the support, including a sleepwalking Morgan Freeman as Fraternity leader 'Sloan' and a 'going-through-the-motions' Angelina Jolie, is less successful.Overall, Wanted doesn't fulfil it's promise (which it may have done had it stuck closer to Millar's original work) but is a serviceable enough summer action film and there's certainly worse ways to spend 2 hours in the evening. Just don't expect anything to make you beg for a sequel (though there's one on the way, natch.)",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Wanted: More Movies Like This,"James McAvoy plays an accountant who escapes the daily grind to join a fraternity of assassins (who weave cloth). They weave, not as cover, rather to determine the name of their next target - deciphered from microscopic blemishes in the weave as has been the traditional for thousands of years.If you can run with this - and I urge you to try - you're in for a rare treat: an innovative, invigorating, slick, sucker-punch of a film that'll leave you clapping with glee by the end.The action, special effects and CGI are fantastic, but all blend seamlessly into the plot, not sticking out like tenuously connected set pieces (Indy IV take note). The violence is pretty brutal, but this is action, not horror - it's all pretty comic book in style as you would expect from a comic book film.McAvoy is brilliant and totally pulls off the full range required of him: from down-trodden office worker to action hero and most deftly of all, the man in between (where most of us reside). The American accent is totally believable too, in short, this film confirms that McAvoy can act brilliantly whatever the role.This is definitely one of those films you just need to go and see. Take a plunge. The plot, patently, is ludicrous, but this is a two hour cinematic experience, sheer entertainment. It's not going to change your life (unless you're an accountant on the edge perhaps); it's not going to educate you about anything worthy (although it is useful to know that rats love peanut butter). Just sit back and enjoy a brilliant action film quite unlike anything you've seen before.Must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Assassins with advanced senses.,"The movie itself is just as awesome as the trailers, which persuaded me to watch it as soon as it was released to theaters. The idea of the film to where there is an advanced group of humans who are assassins, is a good selling point for the film. But the combination of being able to curve bullets, awesome shootouts, and Angelina Jolie, makes this film as good as it gets. Speaking of Angelina, she is still as sexy and as beautiful as before she took time off to start her family. Although James Mcavoy and Angelina, who are the two starring actors, seeming as a very odd and unlikely duo, really had great chemistry with each other. There were some parts in the film where the CGI was just not up to par.Although this is a very cool and ingenious film, I think with the abundance of action/CGI infested films lately, movies seem to get monotonous, and forgettable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Enjoyable. Exactly what the summer ordered,"The classic Hollywood action movie. Such a tough genre to work in, especially now a days. In the 70's it was about gritty realism. The 80's was about over the top shenanigans. The 90's was the birth of CGI, when talent still mattered...Now we have the likes of the Matrix and the Star Wars prequels. Orgies of CGI that trying to force themselves upon the public as classics. The action heroes of old were able to mow down swaths of enemies before riding off into the sunset, kicking that snide smile to the audience. Where have the action heroes gone? I don't know, but this is a great action movie. If you were looking for a treatise on the superhero mythos, read the Watchmen comic book or wait for the movie. The action is ridiculous, over the top, gratuitous and completely enthralling. I spent the entire movie with my jaw dropped to the floor. And the best part? It was completely un-apologetic. No weepy second acts about the mayhem being wreaked. That definitely has its place in good cinema, but not here. It's balls to the walls from start to finish.The action is a lot like the Matrix, but it does not make you feel like you have to read a dissertation on Western Philosophy to appreciate it.

"Pretty Good, if not a bit goofy","If you're looking for a good summer block buster type movie to watch, this isn't a bad place to start for 2008's season. The movie never takes itself too seriously, but is more of an action/thriller than a comedy. It sort of reminds me of The Matrix injected with heavy elements of Fight Club and Office Space, if that makes any sense. The action sequences are amazingly directed, the cast works and most of the jokes are funny. It speaks volumes that this film was directed by the same guy that did Night Watch and Day Watch, which are personal favorites. Wanted keeps up with that level of intensity. There are a few goofy, awkward moments, but overall, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Loved it,"Watching the trailers of the movie had me excited about what i was going to see. however,when i read the reviews, i found this movie was just another matrix. despite this, i still went to see the movie and give it a chance. in the first scene of the movie, a man makes a matrix style jump to a roof top at least a block away. when i saw this i was disappointed that i had come to see this movie. after that jump, everything else in the movie seemed realistic and made the movie enjoyable (a movie-goer must suspend their disbelief of the impossibility of curving bullets). not only is the movie full of amazing action, but there are also snippets of comedy in it. watch this movie. you will love; unless of course you're a complete bore.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Great movie fills all needs for a modern day action movie.,To all those who have a vendetta against this film need to leave. The film was built with the right amount of action and deep thoughts of life. It is built like fight club and matrix were mixed into one amazing movie. The self loathing Wesley is easy to get in tune with for a lot of viewers until he joins the guild which most people would love to join in his spot. The plot was not weak or pitiful. The entanglement of the weavers and past guilds helps make it more in dept with the past of humans. Guilds of assassins have existed before so to have a movie with them in the modern day is a must. The actors don't let down on their roles they play the parts given to them with great understanding of who the character is and do it in a way to entertain the whole audience. Hearing Morgan swear is a must for any person who has seen his various roles including god in Bruce almighty.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Competition for Matrix and John Wick,"Honestly could not believe all the negative reviews on here or that the average score was below 8.0.

This is an imaginative superreal action movie much like the Matrix or John Wick. It tells a sort of fantasy story a lot of people can relate to.

Age didn't help,"""Wanted"" is one of those movies I was kinda hoping would be a little better with the passage of time. And after eight years, that's a resounding no. There were a lot of things that were awful about this movie back in that theater seat in '08, but one thing that really bothered me was the story's beat-for-beat ripoff of ""The Matrix"". McAvoy's reconditioning is more violent than Neo's, but it's all there regardless. It's pretty blatant.The movie is pretty hard to stomach, even having been reared on a diet of shallow action movies. ""Curve the bullet"" has gotta be one of the stupidest things I've ever heard, and the movie gives no good reason to accept it. C'mon, if you're going to steal bullet-time, at least give me something to go on; don't just shoot physics the bird.But even today, ""Wanted"" is a rotten reminder of how bad action movies could be in the 2000s. It's got that tweaked style that feels more like a bludgeon than a thrill, and a garish look to really seal the deal. To trot out the Matrix comparison one more time, it's got none of that film's artistic sensibilities, which would've helped this go down so much easier.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Wanted is a hyperkinetic, visually stunning thrill ride from beginning to end","While DC and Marvel Comics have the most share in the spotlight for comic-book-to-Hollywood adaptations, it is not uncommon for the lesser known literary material to meet success with endearing cinematic endeavors to the big screen. That is where this gun- blazing action thriller comes to play. Based on the graphic novel by Mark Millar, this action thriller directed by Russian filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov mixes hyper bullet time action with 'Sin City'-style violence to create a stylized Matrix- like bullet-time. From the striking visual flair, to the frenetic gun-blazing action, this film treats moviegoers to a bombastic hard-R adventure that while doesn't engage with a powerful plot nor to fuel the brain with its mythical law of physics with its action, provides just enough pulse-pounding thrills to keep action junkies glued to their seats. From the opening scene to the end, it is clear that the director draws his influence from the 'The Matrix', and he manages to put his semi-distinct vision into a good use. The results are something fresh for the action-thirsty filmgoers to chow down on. This film stars James McAvoy as Wesley, a frustrated and disillusioned Chicago white-collar worker tormented by his boss and living with his unfaithful girlfriend (played by Kristen Hager) who is secretly cheating on him with his best friend Barry (played by Chris Pratt). When he is caught up in an outrageous shootout with a hot-shot assassin Fox (played by Angelina Julie), he learns he is the son of a professional assassin. Fox introduces him to a secret society known as 'The Fraternity' lead by the charismatic Sloan (played by Morgan Freeman). With the help, Wesley must master their powerful abilities to prepare against the fraternity's most powerful enemy.The film pedals with a plot that is compelling enough, but perhaps nothing special or surprising on an eyebrow-raising level. But that is not the main appeal here as the film's major attraction to the park is the hyper-kinetic action. Director Timur Bekmambetov brings Mark Millar's graphic novel to life with some of the most electrifying action sequences ever put to screen, but certainly not in the way will engage the brain cells. That is because the main attraction in this visually stimulating action is the characters' abilities to curve gun bullets upon firing. Combining elements of bullet-time action that owes homages to the 'The Matrix' and stunning CGI, Bekmambetov brings a hefty hand to setting the action in a powerfully fresh showcase, but does so that like in the source material, rebels against the laws of physics. With bullets flying in a slow motion, curving paths, and at far more than enough times, colliding together in mid-air; this film superbly lands a fair amount of visual compulsion and heart-stopping action to fuel the adrenaline, while pushing the boundaries of physical absurdity. There is also a few car chase sequences added to the mix. While the action is nothing short of fun and excitement, it should not serve as a science lesson to how gun bullets as it is physically impossible to manually curve a gun bullet, and exceptionally rare for opposing bullet to meet in a mid-air collision. Nonetheless, it is clear that Bekmambetov has a clue of what he is doing. The plot moves a fairly decent pace, and the character stand just enough depth of them to make them compelling to watch. James McAvoy delivers a fine performance in the role of Wesley, a zero-to-hero man who discovers hidden ability he never knew he engraved. Although he brings nothing particularly powerful to the table, the actor firmly fits the bill. Easily the most appealing role is Angelina Julie's character Fox, who Julie blesses plentiful amount of grit and eye-appeal to. She firmly establishes herself as a strong, compelling badass chick. Morgan Freeman, the charismatic actor he is, storms the screen with a sound performance as the fraternity leader Sloane, nothing more, nothing less.Wanted is a compelling ride thrill ride and certainly fits the slot as must-watch for most, if not all action fans everywhere. Although this film never blows any entries of the genre out of the water including in terms of graphic-novel adaptations, it nonetheless makes for an appealing pick for everyone hungry for some hyper- kinetic action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

I do not believe that a movie needs to be 100% realistic to be enjoyable, but at least give the audience a reason for the things that happen that are not realistic (as is the case with a science fiction or superhero movie). How can anyone watch two bullets cancel each other out in mid air time after time and think, ""oh this is a great action movie.""

Orchestra of Action,"Masterpiece, It was released at a time when I was unfamiliar with most of the global market. It has a diversity of genres mixed together. It started with comedy then in the next few scenes shifts the gears toward action then violence knocks out at the door then It became a philosophical journey to know the purpose and identity of your life and finally outta nowhere tragedy and suspense befallen, overall a masterpiece.Wanted is known for Its stylized action sequences and fast pace thrilling tone with some wonderful performances from the leading cast especially James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman & David O Hara.At first, McAvoy was rejected after screen test for his short stature and unconventional looks contrasting to the Macho Man and desirable books of Hollywood conventional actors but studio failed to find someone who could actually pay the bill of ""Wesley Allan Gibson"", so they recruited him and Oh boy, this man gives a hard wrecking performance, his act was believable from miserably p****y to the death-defying superhero who can dodge bullets.
""Fox"" was a tailor-made role for Angelina Jolie with all the desirability and the most memorable thing about her performance was the ""Violent Silence"", limited dialogue delivery, and more action on the platter.
Morgan Freeman was typical as ""Sloan"" and David O Hara as ""Cross"" surprised me in his limited role.Direction by Timur Bekmambetov is flawless, and he has every muscle of the Russian approach in his storytelling and visual effects were his heavy alliance with sharp and spectacular cinematography, It is is very difficult to take 800 different shots of same action sequences which Timur had directed. Through wanted he has really transpired the ""Action"" Genre in Hollywood.Wanted is an action orchestra and Dany Elfman has rightfully brought the ""Heavy Metal"" approach to increase the intensities of sarcasm, weirdness, and action, and the film's main title track ""Little Things"" just push the adrenaline to another level.Last Word:

I expected it to be up there with ""The Fast and The Furious"" in that it would just be dumb and of no value.After seeing this I was pleasantly surprised. Much of the story downplays the terrible premises of ""what-if-physics-wasn't-true"" and focuses more on a Fight Club style ""change of your basic life-style"", at least in the first 2/3.Overall it has a solid plot and surprisingly doesn't over do it (to a flaw) although you must, of course, suspend disbelief to have a good time watching it.The (biggest) flaw is as usual the ending. It's as if the writers gave up by the time they got to hour 1.1. Don't want to give anything away so I will just say don't spend $8 plus popcorn and drinks but it's worth $5 total.

'Wanted' Displays the Emotional Maturity of a 13-Year-Old,"Most people will not agree with me, but this movie is ridiculously immature to be put out by adults. I love it when people say, ""Don't take it too seriously; just disconnect your brain and enjoy."" Funny, that sounds sort of disturbing in the ""let us tell you what to believe and don't think for yourself"" way. Here's why I take issue. Not because I don't know how to lighten up or just sit back and be entertained, but because a number of vulnerable teenage minds are picking up this movie (yes, they have plenty of access to R movies) and taking it seriously. So while we 'more mature' adults are telling ourselves the ideology of ""taking control of your life"" by getting ticked off at everyone who ever pushed you around is not to be taken seriously, a whole generation of sadly under-parented children is thinking that this is what we mature adults believe (after all, we put out the movie and we helped propagate it by paying money to see it). So, some sadly misunderstood kid decides to take control of his life and take a gun into his school, shoot the girl that turned him down, the teacher that was too hard on him, and the bully that pushed him in the hall. This movie seems to say, ""Good for you!"" You know what? Grow up. And I think we adults need to do some growing up too and stop excusing the pushing of philosophies like this with the irresponsible lament, ""It's only a movie; it's not like it really influences anyone (""hardy-har-har"")!""",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Entertaining action-packed extravaganza.,"I enjoyed this film and I almost got as far as calling this the perfect action film as I was typing the summary of my review because of how the movie includes everything that an action film fan hungers on. When action fans watch basic action movies they are commonly left unsatisfied with the movie because of how it is exactly the same as the last action film they watched and how those are usually missing the ingredients that they want in their steak and instead just rely on grease. Action films want bones in their steak, and what this film fully succeeds in is giving us the brutality of bones in our steak instead of overdosing on the cheesiness of grease. The film still has a bit of grease but it is enjoyable grease: the brutality of the violence is created intentionally over the top and is used as an advantage for some dark humoured laughs. This means that although we still have the cheesiness of a normal action movie it serves as a proper ingredient that mixes well with the brutality in it, and instead of just relying on cheap, recycled and cliché explosions it relies on bringing us some hilarious scenes of brutal, bloody, gory torture, and the mean- spirited cheesiness of this is what every action film fan lusts for.

This movie could have been so much better.,"I'll start off by saying I was not expecting this movie to be as good as I'd like, but I was at least expecting it to be decent. Sadly, that was not the case in the least. For a 'comic movie' it had surprisingly little to do with the series it was based on. About the only things that survived the transfer were some character names. Admittedly, the movie did have some cool sequences, however, they could not make up for the absolute lack of relevance this film has to the original story.Personally, I think that this movie should have simply stuck to the story it had and not try to make it more accessible to a wider audience. The comic had a brilliant ending, but the movie ends up being a practice in ruining comic films' reputations for accuracy. If you must see this, please, make sure you give the book a chance to make up for the waste of time this, poor, poor movie is.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Well done yet not satisfied enough,"I can't help but to want more out of a good action flick. Is that wrong?

But still, this movie is ahead of its time. Why? Because it's like the Matrix with a plot twist. An actual good one at that. The sense of humor in this film is wicked, and it has some nice action and car chasing. The main character James McAvoy does well in his evolution from the anxiety prone desk jockey into a cocky super-assassin with tricks up his sleeve. Angelina Jolie is still nice to look at in some scenes. Morgan Freeman is deceptively good in this film too.

It just doesn't use enough explanations to cover the sheer amount of impossible stuff going on, and can't be taken seriously. At the same time, it moans, pleas, and begs for the viewer to be awed by its non-existent depth.The protagonists are unlikable bastards.

I usually reserve my comments but ...READ THIS,"I don't want to get to much in depth about the flick, so I'll just keep it as short and precise as possible. If you are into the action/thriller genre then this is a flick you must watch. The reasoning behind the way the assassins are developed is original and the camera effects are sublime. I must give accolades to the director responsible for the taking of those fantastic action scenes.I read some of the comments above where people trashed this movie. I can't possible imagine how this movie can be trashed by anyone who appreciated flicks such as the matrix, equilibrium etc. The tag line at the end was definitely a catchy one which made us rewind the explanation at the end of the movie some 3-4 times. The plot was also pretty decent, but bear in mind that it is in the action/thriller genre with more emphasis based on the action.Overall it was a great flick and I'd actually watch it again.

Near Hollywood garbage,"If you want action, Wanted has it, but action alone is not enough, Wanted is also frustrating. The plot is awkward and totally unbelievable, the action scenes defy every law of physics making it tricky to suspend disbelief. Sometimes they even provoke unintentional laughter. The characterization is rubbish, and the script is full of silly lines. Worst of all, the ending leaves you feeling cheated. When all is said and done, Wanted is just a typical over adrenaline rush, where the only real talent is in the visual and sound effects department who are virtually unnoticed by the masses paying to watch this, while Angelina Jolie gets all the attention in a razzie worthy performance. Skip this movie.The story dumb all the way through, but for the first two thirds Wanted provides just enough (of something) to keep you from walking out. Yes it is slick, and things do start to build towards what promises to be something epic. That is where the film kicks the viewer in the teeth. The climactic act takes some lame twists and has a disappointing ending. There are several questions you might have when the film is over, but you may not care enough to want to ask them, depending on how annoyed you are with the movie.If a sequel gets made, I may forgive Wanted for the ending, but that would hardly cover it. As it stands right now, I'm afraid I cannot give it a pass.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Not aimed at me but.....,"I have only just gotten round to watching this film and although I am not it's target audience (I'm 64) I just loved it. James McAvoy proves his versatility as an actor (I have yet to see him in two roles that are alike) and he carries it off with aplomb. Jolie is as drop-dead gorgeous as ever and I was delighted to see Marc Warren (Hustle) in a supporting role. The only jarring note, as he always is for me, is Terence Stamp, who seems unable to deliver any line convincingly , no matter what the role may be. Luckily Stamp has a very brief role in this. The action is pretty relentless, mainly physically impossible, but truly imaginative and really exciting.This is the sort of movie where you check your incredulity in the minute it starts - if you can do that you are in for a treat. my wife hated it but it is a boy's movie definitely.

Stylish Snuff,"To call Wanted an ""action movie"" would be like calling Cannibal Holocaust a ""horror flick"". This movie is one step removed from being the most stylish snuff film ever made. Wanted is full of flair, inventive action scenes, and good special effects and sound, but it is thoroughly violent. Taken on craft alone, Wanted is good, but factor in the effect of the endless scenes of vicious, bloody murder, and this becomes a film you endure rather than enjoy.Wanted is about James McAvoy's Wesley, a frustrated office worker who is recruited by Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman into an underground assassin community to finish his legendary gun master father's last job. Or at least that is what the plot summary is about. In reality, Wanted is about violence. Lots and lots of increasingly brutal violence. Wesley and Fox (Jolie) kill gobs of hulking thugs, sometimes in creative ways, but always with bullets. Lots of bullets. And that's the movie, basically. Characters stop and talk here and there, but almost no single scene ends without somebody getting maimed or killed.Those scenes of protracted murder start out kind of fun. There are some imaginative sniper scenes, with long slow motion tracking shots of the bullet as it passes through the air, and Fox teaches Wesley to curve bullets in a memorable early scene. Director Timur Bekmambetov takes a hard-edged, gritty kind of style and rolls with it. For about an hour, you might get caught up in the mayhem. By the end, it's just too much. The movie is under two hours, but without any kind of engaging story to prop up the action, fatigue sets in quick. As things get more and more gruesome, the slickness of the bloodshed is lost, replaced by a feeling of nauseous unpleasantness. I understand Wanted is no family film, and I can get into angry, stress-relieving ultra-violence as much as anybody, but Wanted is a bridge too far for me. It is a very mean spirited movie, taking way too much gleeful pleasure in blowing the brains out of hundreds of heads.That's where the movie really crossed into snuff territory for me. I can handle violence. I can handle very gruesome violence. But the kind of sustained gun porn seen in Wanted would test anyone's stomach. The action is done well, and in a shorter, more absorbing story, it would work. By itself, drawn out over almost two hours, it doesn't. Your results may vary, but after a while, I was entirely turned off by Wanted.54/100",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A formulaic Comic books based movie with a few refreshing Twists,"This movie continues the cliché'd comic book story that has been done many times before. about an ordinary man finding out he has powers. it is very entertaining as he learns his powers.This movie however is original in that instead of using his powers for good (ie spiderman 'with great power comes great responsibility') he uses his power for his own personal benefit. it also deals with the evil nature of the group of extraordinary people (known as the fraternity) rather than most groups of people with powers use their power for good (ie justice league). another thing that is refreshing is how this has an r rating, instead of the usual pg-13 rating.this movie bothers a lot of elements from other movies. mainly fight club and the matrix. fight club in that a man in a white collar job is haunted by his life being nothing and later getting involved in violence and extreme activities. and the matrix mainly just cuz of the action sequences and similarities between fox (angelina joele) and trinity and some of the training is similar (fox taking wesley to run across a train.but regardless of the lack of originality, this is entertaining as hell, and i think is more homage to classic stories than a complete rip off.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wasted:  Money and Time,"I don't usually write any comments about movies I have seen, but this one is so bad I feel I have to warn others who are considering going to see it. Unless you like hearing the ""f-bomb"" every other sentence, and like seeing about 100 people get shot in the head, don't waste your time on this one. I'm used to seeing violence, but the amount of carnage in this film is ridiculous. In one scene, the cadaver of an old lady who could be your grandmother is used for target practice and shot in the head. In another scene, the main character of the movie shoots a fellow assassin in the eye, pushes the gun through his head and shoots at others...while running with the dead guy hanging from his gun. Give me a break. This is just a couple of the many examples of how ridiculous and over the top the movie was.As far as the performances go, James McAvoy has been pretty good in some others movies I've seen him in, but this type of movie is not his thing. He is unconvincing as a ""bad-ass"" killer, and his attempts at trying to be tough border on annoying. Morgan Freeman is emotionless and gives little to the movie. Angelina Jolie is decent and plays her part pretty well, but that does not help with the rest of the poor cast.This movie might appeal to some, but I did not care for it at all. My wife turned to me about 1/4 of the way through and said, ""I hope this gets better, because it really sucks so far."" It only got worse, and I considered walking out a couple of times.

"Wanted: Stylish, Derivative, and Hollow.","After seeing James McAvoy in Last King of Scotland, and Atonement, it was certainly jarring to hear his ""American"" accent. And this wouldn't be the only thing jarring about the movie. It earns its R rating easily by being very violent, perhaps irredeemably violent. I have nothing against violence in movies either, but I don't go to movies for the violence, I go for involving story, and Wanted for all its cool camera work and follow the bullet imagery just didn't grab me. The action is topnotch, but unlike the Bourne movies not set in reality, which should be cool but is less then expected, and Wanted certainly doesn't have the emotional resonance of those movies either. The chase in Bourne Ultimatum on the roof tops, playing cat and mouse, then the fight to the death; Wanted being rated R doesn't have anything as suspenseful or intense.Finally for all I respect McAvoy as an actor I didn't enjoy him in this. His character is a whiny wimp,who's transformed into a elite skilled assassin. His scared act is played for laughs,for me it was just annoying. And the journey from wimp to badass really has been done better in movies that Wanted uses for inspiration: Fight Club, the Matrix seem to be quoted freely both as ideas and visually. I was ready to be blown away by this and just felt the director has the technical chops, and a very capable cast, but the script was just derivative, it gave the actors little material to really bite into, making them into movable pieces in the action scenes. This makes me appreciate something like what Tarantino is able to accomplish in grade A superior action junk food like Kill Bill. Wanted is getting decent reviews, but for me it was a disappointment.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Soul-killing glorification of senseless violence and killing,"Technically excellent (especially the effects), but profoundly senseless, violent, disturbing and saddening. I t is not the NRA that should be blamed for senseless killing by desperate and vengeful losers, but rather Hollywood, and movies like this one. The answer to a sense of inferiority and a hopeless life is to get a gun, acquire power through it, and become a supper-assassin above any law. If you feel worthless and hopeless, follow Wesley's example. You will have power, money and all the sex you want. You will be ""the man"".By the way, don't trust anyone. The world is corrupt and friends will double-cross you any time. You will have to kill your own father in the process, but you will eventually be free of all that.The last words of the movie are especially disturbing. ""What have YOU done lately?"". Do you have a boss you hate? Do you have a girlfriend that cheats on you? Do you have a colleague who uses you?

Assault on the Senses,"Enough is enough. From this moment on, I declare war on Hollywood's infatuation with slow motion. 'The Matrix' revolutionized the technique nearly a decade ago, and in the years since has literally taken the industry hostage. It became an epidemic with '300', and now there's 'Wanted'. A textbook definition of excess, and a film that's more annoying than entertaining.An aggravating attack on the senses, 'Wanted' takes an interesting and potentially promising concept and weighs it down with a heavy handedness you can't prepare for. In fact, Timur Bekmambetov's style of direction may very well be a direct testament to this generation's perpetual short attention span. For while there are countless action sequences, adequately mindless and feverishly over-the-top, each one becomes less thrilling and more predictable than the last. 'Wanted' follows a simple formula and never strays, but in the end that comes back to hurt it.But above all else, 'Wanted' just isn't a very likable movie. The amount of skill involved in the project is undeniable, everything is executed with precision and glamor. But I didn't like the hyperactive camera angles. I didn't like the aforementioned use of slow motion, which became groan inducing after only a few minutes. I didn't like the ridiculous dialogue, James McAvoy's narration most of all. And if I never have to see McAvoy scream in slow motion again, I'll die happy.'Wanted' makes numerous stabs at putting together a coherent story, each of them unsuccessful. Some mumbo jumbo about fate, and an array of ludicrous twists that'll get eyes rolling in the last twenty minutes. It all seems so un-involving and contrived, I would have preferred if 'Wanted' hadn't even pretended that the likes of Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman were anything but props. Bad ass props, but dumb props nonetheless. Because when the last bullet is fired, what we're left with is little more than another empty Hollywood lackluster that's all style and no substance.

Oh Dear...,"I don't get this film to be honest. Having received so much praise and attention from the media I felt compelled to check it out. What a waste of 2 hours. The highlight was when Nine Inch Nails appeared on the soundtrack a few minutes in...To me, this seemed like it was heavily influenced by the incredible ""Fight Club"", a film which most people will agree was fantastic. This, however, had a completely ridiculous plot line, LAME acting (I really don't like James McAvoy..) and corny action scenes. Don't get me wrong I love a good action film, and senseless violence can be great if done properly, but in Wanted it was done very badly.I thought I was the only way that felt this way, but after much searching I found many people that share my opinion. How this got so much I attention I'll never know, maybe because of Morgan Freeman?Anyway..as I mentioned earlier, to me this film seems like a rip of off Fight Club (what with the inner monologues, the journey the main character goes through and the way the action was directed) that was done VERY badly. I couldn't stop thinking James McAvoy was trying to copy Edward Norton..This film gets two stars purely because Morgan Freeman was in it and it had NIN on the soundtrack. That's it. I urge people with a decent film taste to steer well clear of this. However, if you like useless plot lines and corny action scenes, be my guest.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Children of the Matrix and Coca-Cola,"Video games are fun. They're a fantasy as deep as fantasy can go; where films merely show you exciting and exotic professions, video games allow you the magic of interaction, involving you to the fullest level possible outside of actually doing it. With video games, you are given the chance to be a hit-man, a guitar hero, a superstar athlete, or the Chosen One, tasked with saving a fair maiden, or an entire world. Wanted has the DNA of a video game, but you have to sit and watch someone else play.Wanted is a film made by men who work tireless, empty office jobs, watch Fight Club and Office Space, and fantasize about emulating Edward Norton and Ron Livingston. These are white men who have a DVD collection full of action movies, including perhaps Gone in 60 Seconds (the remake), and all three Matrix films (ESPECIALLY those), and have an extensive video game collection, including Grand Theft Auto, Burnout, The Legend of Zelda and Max Payne. These are men who enjoy intense, industrial and rap-metal, Nine Inch Nails and Korn chief among them. One day, they got home, watched The Matrix, played Max Payne, saw the video for Korn's ""Freak on a Leash"", and epiphanically said, ""Dude."" The entire mythology of Wanted can be unspooled simply by taking a cursory look around their shabby apartments. A normal man is informed that he is The Chosen One, out to avenge his murdered father, and is drafted into a secret group of gun-wielding revolutionaries that take him from his dead-end office job and train him. They train him to do amazing things to manipulate time and space, specifically in the form of moving and dodging bullets. He is tasked with practicing in hand, knife and firearm combat in various, shall we say, ""levels"". Sometimes he fails. No worries, he has infinite lives, as each time he is injured, the narrative merely restarts from a standard save point (in this point, a sort of bathhouse room) with all wounds healed, allowing him to try again. He is given a set group of tasks where he has to commit various acts of violence. Upon completion of these tasks (and a series of non-action-based cutscenes), he gets closer and closer to his ultimate goal, a 'boss fight' if you will. There are a few twists and turns, and we are taken to exotic locales and have plenty of running, car chases and gunplay.Unfortunately, another aspect in which Wanted resembles a video game is in its poor acting. James McAvoy's delivery is unbelievably poor. His American accent is solid, but he has no range and no believability whatsoever. Angelina Jolie has big fake-looking-lips and a gangly strut (although, if this was a video game, her breasts would be substantially larger; see Tomb Raider). Morgan Freeman is the token respectable name slumming, and he has such an authoritative voice that he sticks out for commendation even when he's phoning it in. The rest of the cast is generic in a way that you couldn't recognize them or care to if they weren't live in person in front of you.Now, this is not to say that a film that looks and runs like a video game can't be fun. Running Scared had a gonzo quality that still amounted to a 'go here and find this' plot line, and managed to be brilliantly entertaining. Crank was a bit more empty, but had several fantastically silly bits of over-the-top action that made you giggle even as you didn't care. Even Jumper salvaged a decent score because its effects were unique and exciting. Wanted lacks here as well. The film has a couple nifty scenes but overall, nothing all that fantastic occurs (specifically, nothing you haven't seen in The Matrix), and the film has so much slow-motion, the makers of 300 thought it was overkill.As stated, it's no fun to watch someone else play video games, and although they occasionally take your advice (""Dude, go back to your apartment and punch that douchebag Barry""; ""Oh sweet, I had to go retrieve the gun here anyway, thanks, bro""), for the most part, they frustrate you with their inability to instantly perform the tasks, and the character is sort of whiny and annoying anyway, and it's just not that much fun, especially since you've played so many games like this that were a lot more fun. Wanted is a mediocre video game, and a mediocre film. The film apparently did in fact get a video game translation. I can't speak for its quality, but as a film, Wanted feels like you rented a game, your friend made you watch him play, then took it back to the video store without even telling you.What a gyp.{Grade: 5.5/10 (high C) / #29 (of 64) of 2008}",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Preposterous Action and Orgy of Glorified Violence.,"A slick looking hyper-adrenaline-rush contrived-flick with an absurdity quotient 15 points off the credibility scale, may entertain some whom may still believe that Mad Max was a real person, and that Santa Claus, The Tooth Fairy, and Wrestlmania are real.Yesh there are fine performances by McAvoy and Mr. Freeman, Jolie looks fine and sultry in a smoky come hither-I'm gonna beat your ass then apply my considerable lippage to yours-kinda way.But the general premise of a ""Fraternity"" of Assassins and there naturally gifted enhanced physical abilities wears wispy thin in the opening sequence, where an Assassin can manage to pump up his heart rate and adrenaline so he can run and propel himself through significantly sturdy Office Building plate glass window-with out having to blink or close his eyes-then able to still have enough momentum to streak-in mid air-across almost to another building while shooting pistols and automatic weapons accurately, before losing a few feet of elevation and crash through another plate glass Office building.The movie attempts to get clever with the plot and doesn't work with any believability at the end, and actually caused me to groan out loud.Of course this movie has a steady stream of well crafted action sequences that will surely keep most entertained; well those who secretly wish they could be an Assassin with Angelina Jolie as their personal trainer.The movie manages to directly insult it's audience towards the end, and I was like, ""I am no such thing"", well that's not exactly what I was thinking but you get the drift.There is also a laughable attempt at visual allegory towards the end, hinting at the ""oh what a tangled web we weave..etc, etc, blah, blah.""

"""Fight Club"" meets ""The Matrix""","""Wanted"" is solid big screen entertainment with a lot of bang for your buck. From the impressively violent skyscraper opening to the bullet strewn end, this is a great escapist action movie from ""Night Watch"" director, Timur Bekmambetov.James McAvoy is excellent as office worker turned assassin, guided by the very beautiful Angelina Jolie. McAvoy's transition in the film is convincing but a healthy suspension of disbelief is required for this comic book tale.

It was entertaining, it was violent, it had a relatively likable character for whom you develop empathy, and that ugly dog-faced creature, Jolie, was not typecast as some kind of ""sexy"" femme fatale, save for a brief shot of backside nudity which awesomely displayed her bony upper body.All in all, the comparison to 'The Matrix' was accurate (nobody realizes he is 'chosen'; slow-motion bullets), the car stunts were good, and the acting refrained from treading into silliness, like many action movies tend to do.Recommended for non-pretentious people who can enjoy a movie for what it is.Don't mind the stupid whiners.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Wanted bad on every level,"WANTED was awful. I could only get through 5 minutes maybe. I turned it off when a guy ran down a hall, jumped through a glass window, and had a running gun battle.

"I tend to agree with bad comments, nonetheless I LOVE this movie!","I think Indiana Jones 4 was the biggest rip off this year and strangely I found most criticism made to that movie is similar to Wanted. And they are honestly true! Most action scenes in wanted are just out of reality! However what I could not swallow for Indiana Jones I did it totally for wanted! I think it is because of the atmosphere, which is one of the most stylish I have seen this year. The world and the visual are so fluid and cool I just swam into it from the absolute beginning. The coldness and the very little dialog of most support character, including Fox (Angelina Jolie) reinforces this feeling. And what at direction! Many beautiful scenes magnificently filmed! This director has lots of potential.My only criticism would against Angelina Jolie. She has a great role in this movie but she looks too anorexic.Voila, wanted is a great pop corn movie for this summer. They even made the effort to have a good plot.

Any Bollywood movie is better than this one...,"'Wanted' in one word can be described as 'Pathetic'. Its a complete waste of time and money. I fail to understand why Morgan Freeman had to sign such a stupid movie. I am not going to discuss about the story because frankly there is no story in this film. Its just dumb action which is not all soothing to your eyes.There are many weak points in this movie, the one being casting of the main lead James McAvoy. You watch him in 'The Last King of Scotland' and then you watch him in 'Wanted', you would realize the difference. You would hate him in 'Wanted' as much as you feel pity for him in 'The last king of Scotland'. Angelina Jolie looks disgusting. This is by far the worst appearance of Jolie. This is one of the worst action movie i have ever seen. And its really baffling to me that this movie has a rating above 6 on IMDb. The users who have given good ratings to this one doesn't know what film making is all about. I would recommend to watch any Bollywood flick instead of this Un'Wanted' movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Wanted is a cool, action movie that is kick-butt from start to finish","Before seeing Wanted on DVD I though ""Well this might not be a good movie"". Boy was I wrong. Wanted was a pretty cool movie and the action sequences were shot in slow motion so that you can actually see every detail of gore in the kills. If you are looking for hard R material, pedal to the medal action then Wanted has it.Wanted is about a man named Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) who's life has gone down the toilet. He has a mean boss, his girlfriend is sleeping with his best friend, and he swallows pills like candy. Then Fox (Angelina Jolie) meets Wesley Gibson at a store and invites Wesley to come join her and Sloan (Morgan Freeman) to the Fraternity which was where a league of assassins would work. His father was also the greatest assassins who ever lived.Now Wanted does start out a little slow. But that's okay because after the first 10 or 15 minutes it's non-stop fast paced action. After that in the middle of the movie it actually gets better and by the time the movies done it turned out great. A lot of people are hating on Wanted was because of the ending. So what every ending has to be good? Another thing. They say it takes itself too seriously. It's just a movie. What were they expecting? The dark knight or something? Give me a break.Every action sequence in Wanted is shot very unique. For example in one scene Wesley someone with a keyboard and the letters spell out 'FU'. Every single time someone shoots by curving the bullet the sometimes have names on the bullet like 'Goodbye'. I thought that was really cool. Just how they take the action sequences in slow motion was just amazing.Overall I think Wanted is a cool, action movie that is kick-butt from start to finish. It delivers everything a fan could want. You see a bare back shot of Angelina Jolie with her tattoos, Morgan Freeman drops f bombs which never happens, and very cool action sequences.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
If only films like this could keep the low profile they pretend to have.,"I watched this movie very well aware that I was not going to see a piece of great cinema. Everyone who sees the trailer for this film knows what he's is getting into, as did I. So placing a comment about a stupid plot, absurd action or bad acting would be silly, for those are not things one should even be hoping for with a film like this.What you want - and what is fair to expect - is a couple of thrilling action scenes, no-nonsense dialogue, some beautiful women and a pack of bad ass hero's. Nothing more, nothing less. There is nothing wrong with this sort of film, they can be great fun.So now the but: But, what you really do not need is a director trying to put all sorts of stuff in the movie that really have no business there - that try to deny the sort of film that it is, that pretend to be part of something much greater, that insult your intelligence as a viewer and ultimately ruin your evening because you feel lied to, deceived. You were tricked by the clear, shallow surface but stumbled into a filthy sea of sticky nothingness.So I am really interested to know what on Gods green planet that commentary on the supposedly 'boring' life's of civilian people was doing there. And why they felt urged to have some scientific nonsense explain why there simply is a limited amount of people on earth that can do impossible things.This film is so full of pretentious bullshit, you are continually fighting to oppress the vomit trying to spurt through you throat and all you want to do is punch someone who had anything to so with this garbage. The last line is maybe the worst ever because it completely confronts you with the fact that you've sat through nearly two hours of torture voluntary.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Ultimate male fantasy,"One of those ""style over substance"" movies. It is super cool, fast paced and makes no sense at all. There is a very thin storyline there. Lot of shooting, car chases and f-boms. James McAvoy is a surprisingly great action star. He is a talented actor in everything he is in. Angelina Jolie is cool as a cucumber and as gorgeous as ever. She is the embodiment of the ""cool-girl"" trope. She has probably 15 words of dialogue in total in this movie.

Your Eyes Should Roll At The Stupid Writing!,"I never bought ""Wanted"" the comic despite the good art. I'm not a fan of Mark Millar's comic book writing. My hope was that the movie would be better than the comic regardless of how much I dislike Millar's writing. Thankfully someone else wrote the screenplay.There are movies that are so bad they are good. This isn't one. There are movies where the special effects are cool and you don't care about the story. This isn't one. There are movies where the actors are so good, they can carry a bad story and make it work. This isn't one. There are movies that just have a stunning plot and you watch it thinking ""Wow."" This isn't one.The story starts stupid and gets progressively more stupid at random intervals throughout.

What more could an action fan want?,"I've read some of the comments and many of them are way off anybody giving this lower then a 6/10 just doesn't know a good action movie. Wanted opens with an intense 20mins that keeps you literally on the edge of your seat with the great action sequence and car chase. Then we are treated to the plot for the next 40mins where Wesley undergoes training from Fox (Angelina Jolie). It was quite interesting seeing how they trained him because most action movies don't give a good back story at how the action hero became what he is now. That was a smart idea from the director to show what the life of Wesely was like before and after he transformed. Everyone knows that some scenes are impossible but does that stop a movie from being a good time and something to entertain you? No, Wanted was a fast paced thrill ride with 2 of the biggest twist I've seen in a movie in a long time. This is better then The Matrix sorry but it was written with a smart script and added with top notch acting. Some of the lines in this movie were made to add some humor and it did! Excellent movie, excellent plot, top notch twist you'll NEVER see coming, and superb acting and action sequences galore!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Mind-Blowingly Awesome,"OK, to truly appreciate this film you have to forget all your usual action film ""rules"", clichés and the general ""do's"" and ""dont's"", because Wanted literally throws this all out the windows, picks it up again, shakes it around and slow-motion shoots the rules right in the face, and does whatever looks cool! However this works. In some weird way, it manages to pull off all the over-the-top action, stunts and shooting because it looks amazing on screen and completely fits with the comic book style. I left the cinema literally wanting to be an assassin.Apart from the spectacular action, there is also so much humour, which made me literally laugh out loud, for example his hilarious boss, Fox's reactions to Wesley, and Wesley's general nervous, awkwardness when faced which such intimidating people. James Macavoy was perfect for this role, you completely buy this character and you really want him to succeed. People in the cinema were literally clapping when he smacks the keyboard across his friend's face, spelling the word ""fuck you"" in the air from flying keys, the ""u"" being made up from a tooth! Angelina Jolie was also painfully cool, everyone gasped when she first appeared on screen. Her action scenes make her even more hotter as she effortlessly drives a car whilst laying on the bonnet, shooting bad guys, whilst dodging passing traffic, and her chemistry with James was hilarious from start to finish. Morgan Freeman, is as usual fantastic, only enhancing the quality of this film.The story is generally gripping, filled with twists and turns, leaving you to wonder how it all will end out. And the ending is certainly no let down allowing you to leave the cinema feeling completely satisfied and wanting more. The quirkiness and absurdity of this film makes it completely different from all your other action films as it really is a real fun watch. Wanted is definitely the best action film of the year, and one of the most original i've seen for a long time!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Sarcastic Fun Action Movie for Guyz,"I knew from the adverts that this was a Badboy Assassin action movie-- plus it had Angelina Jolie! What's more is there to think about? Plus, I don't write reviews for Blockbusters as a rule, because everyone else is doing so already. WANTED is different though.And so you put in the DVD and are introduced to Mr Gibson via the dweeb voice-over narrative describing his pathetic little life. And you go ""Hey? This isn't Bourne Ultimatum!""That's because it ain't. The Bourne Series, good in their own right, is NOT FUNNY. They're serious. And this ain't the Matrix. For God's sake, someone tell me if there's such a thing as a FUNNY Keanu Reaves movie. I don't THINK so!When I say ""Wanted"" is Sarcastic Funny-- I don't mean Girlfriend ""ha-ha-ha"" fake laugh funny. I don't mean Siskel & Ebert ""Oh that comedic line touched my sardonic sense of humor"" funny. This isn't metrosexual funny.This Movie is Guyz funny. It's a buncha guyz with pizza 'n' beer funny. It's a buncha guyz who took the crap at work all day and need a hoot funny. It's bang tha wall funny. It's the Funny that Mothers and controlling Girlfriends disapprove of because when the Guyz aren't laughing, they're ROARING approval at the screen. And the women frankly don't understand WHY.Naw-- people, ""Wanted"" is over the top action, good script, good characters. The premise is simple: little guy wakes up and realizes he's not one of the sheep. Instead, he's a Wolf.And when he wakes up to being 'Tha Man', everything Wesley Gibson goes through as his life changes touches something deep and ordinary in everyday Guyz. Because the script was written to speak to Working Joes and Guyz. Not the New York Times Elite. Not the cellphone vamps. Not the Siskel & Ebert Wannabees. Not the vapid girlfriend.And when that Stapler is clicked for the LAST time and taken AWAY. . . Guyz say with Quiet Reverence: ""Oh yeah. I'm down with that.

Worthy of leaving anyone marveled,"Wanted leaves you marveled by the fine web of its deception,encapsulating charm, so much so, that for most of its plot, it takes viewers to the height of the plane of believing that they have seen it all and heard it all. We have some excellent stunts, a hard-nosed hero who doesn't believe in the seemingly-impossible, special effects and an endless list of assets which make this flick deserve its share of kudos, and leave us gaping in awe. We get to see how the boring life of a slacker, plagued by tormenting from his boss, and other problems, help unlock his dormant powers, giving way to lightning-fast reflexes and phenomenal agility, which are made to blossom by FOX. Plot twists, and turns moreover, are another facet of the synopsis, which allow us to get partial wind of the underlying twist, present since the very beginning under our very noses, for instance, when Cross tries to rescue our hero when he's on the verge of plummeting to his death from the train.In all, a worth-watching action packed film, with brilliant acting by Jolie, which makes it deserve plenty of éclat.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

They need to explore beyond the pain where the answers of who they are and why they are here are to be found.

"Brutish Violence Porn - What were Jolie, Freeman Thinking?","My wife and I haven't walked out of a movie in nearly a decade, but we gave up on ""Wanted."" Lured in by the stellar cast and a positive review by David Edelstein, we were expecting dumb, loud, summer entertainment with great production values.What we got was violence porn: ""Sin City"" without the high style or prevailing sense of loss and regret. I was worried that I was going to find a bloody tooth in my popcorn.Don't get me wrong. I have no illusions about what sells movie tickets or who buys them. Major-studio Hollywood has long been a purveyor of grisly, loud, slo-mo, blood-spurting violence. But used intelligently by a skilled film-maker, it can be provocative and compelling: David Cronenberg's most recent films (""Eastern Promises"" and ""History of Violence"") are shot through with explicit, gut-churning mayhem, but they don't revel in it. ""Wanted,"" on the other hand, wants you to savor the thrill of every blood-spattered smack of bullet or fist. The first hour of the movie exists largely as a vehicle for the torture of James McAvoy, served up for our delectation and amusement.Lord knows there's a big market for that stuff, and I suppose we shouldn't be expecting anything different.But what's confusing here is the presence of distinguished, A-list actors. Angelina Jolie has generally shown better script sense: she's always fun to watch, but the blunt-force trauma of ""Wanted"" is light years away from the effervescence of ""Sky Captain ..."" Morgan Freeman has squandered his natural authority by appearing in this spatter-fest.Maybe the heretofore charming McAvoy needs the money, but surely Jolie and Freeman can be choosier? If this is what they've been reduced to, why don't they just get to the point and sign on for ""Hostel III"" or ""Resident Evil IV""? Terence Stamp? Thomas Kretschmann? I respect these actors and their work. They can, and must, do better than this.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Its a FANTASY FILM BASED ON A COMIC BOOK, geeze, just have fun with this vehicle or you will miss the present inside the slick wrapping!","Every now and then a movie comes out that has elements which fly completely over the head of many otherwise savy film buffs. From the polarized reviews here, ""Wanted"" is clearly such a work. The differences of opinion in reviews remind me very much of those on IMDB for ""The Signal"" with Lawrence Fishburn. So eager to say why they think this or that is wrong or bad, they pick apart a movie in it's literal sense and choose to completely miss what the movie's trying to convey. A jaded perspective that demands a movie be strictly confined to our reality will serve nothing for a viewing of a fantasy film, thereby losing the perspective that puts everything in a context the director and writers don't feed or preach to you but offer up the clues that allow you to open your minds eye as well. Either way, you won't feel like you wasted your regularly scheduled movie couch time at the end of Wanted unless you whine about ""that cant really happen"" ... no chit, it's a fantasy film - but maybe like me, you may give it several watches and enjoy the fourthwall piercing narratives which are the lens to the higher plane the movie conveys. I also enjoyed the humor - disdain as comedy is squeezed in rather well, complimenting rather than distracting from the roller coaster ride. And like a good thrill ride, the movie is meant to be fun - don't look for finger nail biting tension or characters to cry for because they aren't here nor are they meant to be. Look for characters whose roles are more metaphoric to the internal conflicts sparring for position in the heart and mind of a typical everyday person. You can think about doing what you wish you could and be defeated by your own doubts and addictions to your status quo, or you can choose to listen to the one idea for a life less ordinary as you define such - and not just answer the question ""why am I here?"" But actually get up and fulfill it.

How he ended up being in this film... 2) James McAvoy needs to go to Borders and buy Acting for Dummies. 3) any and all of you who rated this movie over a 1/10, thus contributing to its woefully, over-inflated-like-a-dead-body- underwater-for-three-weeks 7.2 rating should be banned from ever speaking again, to say nothing of the fact that you're allowed to rate movies. IMDb's ratings have officially lost all credibility. 4) I don't object to violence in movies--after all, I love Pulp Fiction--but there should be some reason for the over the top violence and gore. Really, I'm not offended by it- -except as a person that is offended by stupid movies would be offended. 5) I can appreciate movies that are unrealistic. After all, I love comic book movies as much as the next person. But help me out here. The story is so ridiculously bad that I wanted to drown myself in a theater toilet after leaving the movie. Not a spoiler, really, but if you choose to go see the movie just watch for when Angelina is driving alongside the train to see what I mean by over the top ridiculousness.The only good news is that after seeing this movie, I know that life can only get better, because that was officially the worst two hours of my life.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Thriller.,"I personally feel that the movie starts with the necessary ingredients to keep a man interested for at least half an hour. Sex, violence and a little bit of dark humour. This is just enough time for the movie to form a plot. The initial ingredients continue to run throughout even after the introduction of the Faternity. Once the movie kicks in, it starts to become real gripping, some excellent acting, action and music help bring the story along nicely. Thanks to a great performance from James McAvoy, its the type of movie where you want to be the lead man at the end of it. Plus, it's better the second time you watch it.

Know What You're Getting Yourself Into,"I saw the trailers, like everybody else, that were run up and down the block. The big thing was the curving bullets and the assassin son right-of-passage bit.

But the first five minutes had me surprised at the cheap-trick hype of vulgarity usage. Another half hour in and I thought okay, this is like ""Shoot 'Em Up"" except no Clive Owen. Another fifteen minutes later, as the plot unravels, Angelina Jolie isn't good-looking enough to overcome disinterest in the film. And lastly, I'm thinking, ""Wow, at least ""Shoot 'Em Up"" came off as an action farce. All you had to do was just sit back, laugh, and watch the bullets fly.""

The opening scenes are very cool and set the tone well.James McAvoy plays a frustrated (American) office worker who is recruited by a sexy & mysterious (Jolie) to join a secret society of assassins and avenge the murder of his estranged father. This has a real Matrix vibe to it with healing baths, an oracle loom, bullets able to go around corners because the character ""thinks"" they can, stuff like that. There's also a great twist involved and some seriously awesome stunts including Jolie scooping McAvoy up with her car, OTT train crash sequence and the two of them ""playing"" atop commuter trains. Super fun.I just love Angelina Jolie in these action roles. She is just so cool, sure she only weighs about 95 lbs here and I doubt would have the strength to pull off (any) of the fight scenes without eating a sandwich first but I still enjoy watching her do her thing.I enjoyed McAvoy too, I always do even though it was weird to hear him with an American accent, no reason why they couldn't have kept his character Scottish. 10/19/14",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Action Packed with Unique Characters,","Wanted is a great movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is action packed and very intense from start to finish,the story and the characters are very unique and not quite like any action movie i've seen previously,I loved the slow motion shots that are used quite regularly throughout the movie and is the best example that it is also directed in a very unique way.James McAvoy does a great job in the lead role,I didn't think it would be easy to keep the audience interested in your character, especially when Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman are in supporting roles,but he is genuinely that good of an actor that he was interesting enough to keep my attention.Action packed and very enjoyable,I would recommend Wanted to anyone looking for a good crime or action film.A man survives an assassination attempt only to discover he's destined to join a band of mystical killers.Best Performance: James McAvoy Worst Perfornance: Lorna Scott",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted: A new age depiction of the beloved comic.,"I liked this movie. It was an odd twist to the source material that still probably instilled a few of the points the original was trying to make.I'd love to see an updated, funny, edgy remake of the comic book movie. We live in a new age; the jokes and violence that exist in the comic book are all tolerated as simple entertainment by an exceptional generation. We could truly pay homage to an influential comic that spoke volumes about us as a species in this grand universe.I give it 8 out of 10 simply because i wished they had paid tribute to the source material faithfully the first time.I can understand the violence was a bit much, however i believe that with our collective intelligence rising, we can begin to welcome art in any form without worry. Let us not mix fantasy with reality.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A disaster!,"First of all, the story seems to be pointless, an assassin, that goes around killing people, because of some ""rule"" or ""code"". It seemed that the story was boring, and should have had more to it. It seemed plain, and was something that was not focused on by anybody, who was making the film. I find that they thought, the rest of the elements of the movie would make up for it, which they did not.Non-stop action I predicted, and that was true. Every seen had some action in it, all of it, had very well done special effects, and great ideas, but if there is no story, its ruined, and wasted.The humor in the film was honestly stupid, just awful, it was dark humor, and pointless again. Seemed quite childish.In terms of acting, in my opinion, Angelina Jolie will always be bad, to me, she is meant for the action parts, why not be a stunt double! Only in Mr. and Mrs.Smith was she good. Freeman was okay, quite good actually, but deserved not to be in this movie, honestly, he does not belong in it, swearing etc...This movie is a catastrophe!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Suspend belief for an out-there comic like story and...,"I guess some times you really can't tell what's going to hit and what's going to miss.Something I need to preface before the review is that this movie was shot basically in my neighborhood in Chicago and that reason alone ramps up nerd points. Imagine, Angelina Jolie running and spraying bullets in your backyard. It would be a little more effective than if say she's pelting through the Vatican.Preface aside, this movie was pretty awesome. I didn't come in with high hopes but it really hit home with me. I used to have a corporate stuffy job with a boss and accounts and blah blah blah. There are tons of better movies out there that better deal with corporate malaise (Office Space), but this one felt particularly real.It wasn't without it's problems, the story gets down-right silly at some points. Morgan Freeman's role is pretty stupid. I think it's almost a joke, he's recycled the old sage role that it's time to put a moratorium on him acting at all. Stick with the voice overs for the next three-four years, perfect timing for him to come out with some Nelson Mandela movie he can probably rock out on.The secondary acting was terrible, particularly some dude who plays his friend (Barry). He was terrible, and his girlfriend was pretty bad, too.The ending is good, though. Angelina Jolie is always wicked hot, but I can tell she's older than when she was in Hackers. Normally, I just can't tell.Go see this movie. I can go on and on but it's enough to say it's really good. As a GTA playing, ultra-violence loving, white male aged 18-35, I can speak for all of us and say it delivers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Fast and full of action,"All in all this film is a good way to spare some time in cinema. It is of course way too full of action, slow motion, explosions, but it is showen in a funny and even acceptable way for all of us who spend their life time in a bureau.When you go and watch this flick, you should not expect to see super action like in dark knight, but you will see a movie about a guy who goes out to start a new life. I really could identify with the role of james mcavoy, in my opinion he did a good job.It is all of course not realistic, the dudes in here can shoot around corners, but does this have to be bad? It is showen in a realstic way, or at least in an acceptable way for me as watcher. After all i found the effects astonishing and the film is not in 1 minute boring.The ending is a good one, it is something unexpected and it shows the main idea of the film: that everyone is able to control his own life like he wants. Thats a good message i think.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
logic?what's that?,"if you go into this movie,expecting logic and/or realism,you will be disappointed.it has almost neither of those elements.nor is it original.what it is,however,is wall to wall action,with death defying stunts and explosions galore.the acting is adequate,though it doesn't really mater here,as it(and everything else)takes a back seat to the spectacle.however,i will say that the casting of Morgan Freeman was a very inspired choice.you get to see him in a role quite different than usual for him,and you get to hear him say words you wouldn't normally hear from him.James McAvoy plays the hero,and does a flawless Shia Labeouf impression.Angelina Jolie plays a prominent role,and Terrence Stamp has what is pretty much a cameo appearance.as for the movie itself,it is intense,loud,and frenetic and there is one plot twist i didn't see coming,though most people probably will.anyway, found it to be a fun waste of time,thought not really memorable.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

canceling the laws of physics and morality,"I was expecting the American debut of director Timur Bekmambetov, the man who made the Night watch series, a fascinating and catching vampires meets Bulgakov film in the decadent post-Communist Russia. The result is quite disappointing, but no usual stuff either.You can watch 'Wanted' and enjoy it if you forget for the duration of the film both laws of physics and rules of morality. The story is of a secret society of assassins, working according to a code of rules and instructions received from no other than Fate itself. Killing is presented and I would not say say justified, but no question is asked about who writes the rules and what is the collateral damage of the actions of the society, in a film where more than half of the screen time is spent in motorized killing rampage. The annihilation of the laws of physics is of course another accepted feature of the comics genre, the effects are well done, remind to some extent Matrix without the astonishing visuals of the brothers Wachowski, while the innovations (curved trajectory bullet, a recovery bath that looks like some kind of a cement mold, etc.) seemed to me to be somehow naive.WHat about the movie itself? The dark cinematography was consistent, but the unidentified American metropolis looks less intriguing than the Moscow the director left behind. Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie do what they are expected. James McAvoy makes here another 'landed-in-a-foreign-world' type of role, same as he did in 'The Last King of Scotland' and ends by being the most incredible serial killer we are in danger to see again if this film is only the start of a series.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Wanted,"Much hype, Russian director, superb star cast, action movie, big scale, great stunts  that is what I saw in the trailers; added to that a few friends who saw the movie  recommended it as a very good movie. So here, I go to see the movie.Wesley (James McAvoy) is an accountant  bullied, worried and bankrupt. In a supermarket shootout action  Wesley knows through Fox (Angelina Jolie) and Sloan (Morgan Freeman) that he is the son of an assassin. Soon he gets involved in being rigorously trained by this assassination cult. His missions are to kill bad people. In one mission, his target becomes his own father, and that is the time  Wesley realizes the real story behind everything happening to him. I won't give spoilers here  but Wesley in the end, does take his father's place by eliminating all the bad guys.This movie is a collassal waste of money, with senseless action sense and a story that only naïve person can write. One has to keep our brains out while watching the movie.The Russian director Timur Bekmambetov  Hollywood outing does not fetch him any great points and he has to wait for another good story and movie to showcase his talent. Surely his talent is shown in mega-scale actions and mystical suspense  but that does not bite the audience taste.James McAvoy, a good actor  does everything that his director asks him to do  but the movie is not a Matrix to fire anything for him. Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman  are those stars who would fetch the director some good audiences, but nothing sustains in the end.The actions are high speed and out of the world  whatever one can imagine one can find here. Believe in the instinct and one can curve the path of bullet while shooting  that is the type of stuff they show.For very hard core actions friends  who just want fun, this is their outing.(Stars 4.25 out of 10)",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted: A Stylish and Thrilling Ride,"Wanted, directed by Timur Bekmambetov and starring James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, and Morgan Freeman, is a 2008 action thriller that delivers an exhilarating blend of high-octane action, stunning visuals, and a unique storyline. Based on Mark Millar's comic book series, the film pushes the boundaries of the genre with its inventive action sequences and dark, edgy tone.Plot and Setting:
The movie follows Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), a disenchanted office worker with a mundane life. Everything changes when he meets the enigmatic Fox (Angelina Jolie) and is introduced to the Fraternity, a secret society of assassins led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman). Wesley learns that his father was a legendary assassin, and he is recruited to follow in his footsteps. The film is set in a gritty, hyper-stylized world where the laws of physics often take a backseat to spectacular, bullet-bending action.Performances:
James McAvoy shines as Wesley, transforming convincingly from a downtrodden nobody into a confident and lethal assassin. His character's journey is both engaging and relatable, making the audience root for him. Angelina Jolie is magnetic as Fox, bringing her trademark allure and intensity to the role. She commands the screen with a mix of grace and deadly precision. Morgan Freeman adds gravitas as Sloan, delivering his lines with a calm authority that masks his character's darker motives.Direction and Writing:
Timur Bekmambetov's direction is bold and visionary, with a keen eye for striking visuals and inventive action choreography. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The screenplay, written by Michael Brandt, Derek Haas, and Chris Morgan, effectively adapts the comic book's premise while infusing it with a cinematic flair. The dialogue is sharp and often darkly humorous, complementing the film's tone.Action and Visuals:
Wanted is renowned for its groundbreaking action sequences. From the adrenaline-pumping car chases to the iconic bullet-curving shots, the film consistently delivers visually stunning and innovative scenes. Bekmambetov's use of slow motion and dynamic camera angles enhances the impact of the action, creating a visceral experience for the audience. The film's special effects are top-notch, adding to the overall spectacle.Themes and Impact:
Beneath its action-packed surface, Wanted explores themes of destiny, self-discovery, and the struggle against mediocrity. Wesley's transformation from a passive victim of circumstance to an empowered individual resonates with viewers, providing a satisfying character arc. The film also delves into moral ambiguity, questioning the ethics of the Fraternity's actions and the concept of fate.Conclusion:
Wanted is a thrilling and stylish action film that stands out for its innovative approach to the genre. James McAvoy's compelling performance, Angelina Jolie's charismatic presence, and Timur Bekmambetov's visionary direction combine to create a movie that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. While it may not be for everyone due to its violent and dark themes, it offers a unique and exhilarating cinematic experience. For fans of action films and comic book adaptations, Wanted is a must-watch that continues to impress with its audacious style and inventive storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Enjoyed,"I have to say that I never followed any comic book synopsis before going to see this. I knew nothing about the picture other than Angelina Jolie was in it and it was an action film. Though, it apparently pulled from various past films as most do i.e. Edward Norton's in Fight Club/Keanu Reeves in Matrix in combination with the obvious visual effects stunt of bending the bullets which was an obvious rip off concept from the Matrix, or so I believe, the film succeeded overall and was thoroughly entertaining. Main point of interest was the rating. Too many films these days have quality, storyline, and visual content that is sacrificed by child friendly ratings. Mind you, ratings have become more relaxed over the past few years, the R rating allowed for just the right amount of gore (missing from the Matrix) to satisfy my appetite. Very pleased!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Great popcorn entertainment,"The story is about Wesley Gibson. A loser, stuck in a boring job. His best friend is fu**ing his girlfriend. But that's all going to change. On day he learns that his father was a top assassin, belonging to a secret organization that disposes of people who deserve it. While being in a convinience store Wesley is rescued from an assassination attempt by the the ultra cool Fox (Angelina Jolie). After that he quickly realizes his destiny and gets trained in all the deadly arts. What follows is a thrill ride that contains action that is so over the top that it's almost unbelievable. But it looks great and is entertaining.Also the plot of the movie has a few interesting twists.Morgan Freeman is the only cast member who seems kinda out of place as he is obviously unchallenged by the material. He is too good an actor for the insignificant role he is given.Aside from that little flaw the movie is almost perfect Action Entertainment. With stunts that make it hard for you to not cry ""WOW"" out in your theater seat. If you like action, you will certainly not be disappointed by this movie.My recommendation: Shut off your brain and go and enjoy this movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Worth the buy,"This movie has one of the best opening scenes of the new millennium. For all those that think this is a ""Matrix"" rip off obviously are not over their hopes of another ""Matrix"" movie. This movie has an all-star cast and back to back action throughout the movie. Bullet bending, obviously, is not possible, but then again neither is an E.T. or mutant zombies but that does not stop people from flocking to the theaters to watch the movie. Easily one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. If you are not a fan of action movies then this movie has nothing for you. On the other hand if you are open to the suggestion of ""bullet bending"" as the second hand premise for an awesome story line and get past the fact that it is Hollywood and movies are for entertainment purposes only, then I would strongly suggest at least the rent to form your own opinions of this movie. Ironically enough that is also part of the story line, form your own opinions and stop being a victim.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
My Comment,I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 for the unwanted AND useless AND unneeded sexual content and offensive language. The plot was great! I would have enjoyed the movie much much more without the sexual content and offensive language. The actors in this movie deserve better than to have to stoop to the language and sex in scripts these days! I am a big fan of films like the Matrix that are science fiction; futuristic; and action-packed. This film definitely is action-packed in my opinion and keeps you on the edge of your seat!

It's Camp and I Liked It,"This is a crazy, silly, campy fun movie. Wesley Gibson finds himself and leaves his drone job and enabler girlfriend for some action as an assassin. There is a world wide conspiracy and it's up to him to get to the bottom of things.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted... to get out of the cinema as fast as i can,"To get right to the point i found this movie very distressing to watch, I do like watching action genre films but there's a line drawn where movies is divided by the sense of being realistic which I prefer to enjoy and totally unbelievable, I'll put the movie in the place of being completely far-fetch.Is all that special effects necessary? well watching the film it appears it relies more on effects than the storyline itself's that I really had a problem with. Since we are in the 21th century now and film-makers are looking for new ways of being innovative this is where the problem lies. Too many film makers are using their film budget more on special effects these days, like 'Wanted' it was hard to take notice of the narrative because of the constance special effect. So to answer the question, special effects is necessary in disaster genre pictures such as 'The Day after tomorrow', action films such as 'Shoot em up' and 'Wanted' uses special effects to make it look better when it looks OK on it's own. That is why I prefer The Die Hard, Rambo movies 20 years ago where special effects weren't a issue.I mentioned about it being beyond disbelieve, audiences today aren't considering the logic,but are more being amazed by the slow-motion scenes,fast-pace action and special effects. For example, one scene in the movie Wesley Gibson crashes his car and spins over a limo to shoot the target through the sunroof. Thinking about it if a car spins over this limo it will take approximately one second, in this second the character had time to say the line 'I'm sorry' and shoot the target when the car is spinning. At that point I couldn't bare to watch any more.Final outcome is that modern films are taking special effects as a alternative to make to appear better, which I dislike about action films today. This movie would of been better if the special effects was cut down or taken out, the acting was average and had an interesting story with twists. But unfortunately this year 'Wanted' is the worst movie of 2008 so far...",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wonderfull,"This is not a real review, it should be taken more as a collection of impressions on the film.Film that is a normal action film with hitmen who have to carry out their missions with the strange stuff that the latter are given by a huge loom of destiny that decides for them the targets they have to hit. The film is very nice and really full of action with very compelling and engaging parts and also as a thriller it is really well made with a very well articulated and not obvious plot, but the only thing this film is remembered for is that it is that film in which the characters make bullets curve and it's a shame because the film isn't just that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The worst movie EVER!,"I DID NOT enjoy the movie. The first time the amount of violence brought me to sleep after 10 minutes. The second time I fell asleep immediately. So in that sense the movie served a good purpose. Angelina Jolie looks like she also needs a good sleep. Can't somebody tell her she should eat more too, cause she scares the hell out of me. Maybe time to switch to horror? And James McAvoy, come on man, you can do better then this! Why do great actors often make this same mistake by switching to this kind of genre, while they were doing just fine? Such a shame. And Morgan Freeman - I'm losing respect here, so please do something about it. Hm. I just don't understand. A lots of unnecessary violence for what?

"Continuous, plain fun blast.","Let's take this out of the way: This movie was never meant to be realistic. Not even by far. Is even based on a comic.So, now that we have that clear, we can start talking in context. Wesley Gibson (James MacAvoy) is your perfect loser. Cheated by his girlfriend with his best friend, he has a terrible job and an even bleaker future. That is, until a mysterious woman nicknamed Fox (Angelina Jolie), reveals some facts about his life that will turn everything he knew upside down.While the story might barely hold the movie coherent, it offers some nice twists, and the message it delivers is actually quite coherent. The acting is good (James MacAvoy's specially) and the pacing is great.Special mention are for the action scenes. Absolutely NONE of them are realistic (how about stopping bullets mid air... with another bullet?) but that just makes them the more fun and thrilling ones I've ever seen. If we thought that after the lobby scene from The Matrix there was nothing, well, check the loom scene at the end of this one. It blows any action movie fan mind.The over-the-top bullet-fest, the relentless pace and many hilarious takes, will delight anyone who enjoys non-stop action. But you must always keep in mind: is a movie, enjoy it for what it is. If you are of those who complains about ""unrealistic action"", then save your money and stay at home.

Great film...for single cell organisms,"There is something about this film that makes it not quite the most ridiculous awful film you could watch, its a fun romp with some great names and interesting cast who were made for action films. Everything else is just awful, you could write the script 10 seconds before the characters speak, the writing is that obvious, I never liked matrix, but at least matrix bothered to explain why people could do impossible actions by taking outside a physical world, this writer and director would have you just believe some people are just really ""Duh..Awsome"". Its not possible to write a spoiler on this film, trust me its so clichéd you have seen this film under every action film imaginable. if this film did not have effects and budget, it would be the biggest embarrassment to some distinguished careers.

I can't wait for it to come out on video because I may just watch it over and over.I think that the action was amazing. It is certainly a movie for people who don't mind some violence.

A Movie I can watch again and again!,"Plot: What starts out as a normal cubical working pansy Wesley (James McAvoy).

Now the organization wants Wesley to join to kill his fathers killer.My Spiel: From movies like Shoot 'Em Up, and your normal run and gun movies. This is a step above them from a actual story that you can relate to. With a main character that is wasting his life at a crappy job, and a girl friend who cheats on him with his best friend. Wesley finds out that his panic attacks aren't that at all, but a special gift to enhance and slow down time, And give him special abilities that a small fraction of the world have. A tale of revenge and a lot of sweet death scenes to very cool death shots. The acting in this, I really enjoyed and having Morgan Freeman in this doesn't hurt. I was so glad because at a point in the movie I thought a ""To be continued"" messages was going to pop up. Then we would never know what happened to Wesley and his true enemy.

Better this was never released and strangled at birth,"Aside from a flashy, amusing car chase scene at the beginning, this movie has little going for it. Gotta really suspend disbelief a lot on this one, totally unbelievable. Lots of violence, gun play, graphic, bloody killings etc. Kind of like many games they sell to adolescents. The story is weak, the acting is unimpressive, and is full of empty action. It IS like a ""graphic novel"" (or comic book). If Iron Man can be so much better, this could have been a decent movie. A shame movies like this are being made, that glamorize violence to young boys. Save your money, and rent a good movie you can really enjoy without having your intelligence insulted.

The actors are great. The jokes are not bad. The social message (typical for so many American movies in the last 10 years) is to be mentioned as well. But I leave it all to you.

Can't say it didn't take me out of my humdrum existence for 2 hrs,"This is not a slapped together movie. It's carefully laid out and quite effective. Some of the scenes are spectacular and convincing, others a little less so, but, in general, it's easily worth the price of admission. James McAvoy doesn't seem the type to be dodging bullets but by the end of the movie, you're convinced. There's a little gratuitous sex in places, hardly the theme of the movie, but it spoils it for the younger crowd for no good reason, really. The detailed violence is not so gratuitous. But I liked the integrity of the movie, particularly in the training sequences. There's a nice sense of hard standards displayed that you don't often see anymore. Ms Jolie is not quite the show stopper she's been before, but she's still an enormously interesting woman who seems to have a taste for wickedness and vengeance, and who you don't want to take your eyes off of. Really, who else could you ask to do her part? Morgan Freeman always adds a little something real as does Terrence Stamp and both execute rather effortlessly.

Stylized violence meets nerdy white boy dreams,"The Matrix was a great movie. Why? Because it had a premise we could buy into. Yes it also had a nerdy white boy, but his transformation was to be a sign of a new world to come, now I take no responsibility for the mess that was made of the sequels, but the original was fun. I bring up the Matrix because I also blame that movie for the long litany of movies that came after glorifying violence in ways that make most your people numb and the rest of us just sick. Wanted is another one of those movies. It wants to be taken seriously and yet it gives too simplistic an explanation for what Wesley(James McAvoy) does. For a while I thought that it was going to dwell deeper but then of course the filmmakers pull back and revert again to stylized violence. So to every nerdy white boy who sees this movie and thinks all he needs is his own brand of assassin training, a big gun, some special bullets that shots around things from long distances and I can be in control,treating everyone that I feel wronged me. I say maybe you need to ask yourself that question they kept asking Wesley. Too bad he couldn't figure out a better, more productive answer.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

I didn't care if the action scenes, which made most of the movie length, reminded me of other movies, they were still awesome and i wish i hadn't downloaded it, but instead, enjoyed it on a big screen in a theater.So if you are fond of these kind of movies, the type of Tarantino's late brainless creations, you might as well like this pile of bull@#$% and enjoy it without trying to wrap your brain around the fact that the plot of such an expensive movie sucks monkey balls.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
One of the best action films I've seen since The Matrix,"If you're one of the many IMDb posters who hate this movie, then I can only assume you have no imagination, or you're just too uptight and stupid to appreciate something that dares to bend the rules as WANTED has done. Realism is out the window within the first few minutes of the film, which features some very impressive stunt work and some unique twists on typical action shots. But this film isn't really about realism. It's a cinematic treat that takes near orgasmic pleasure in it's beautifully crafted action sequences. Best of all, you can actually tell what's going on in the fight scenes. There are no traces of sloppy camera work masquerading as authenticity or documentary- style filming.The movie never feels weighted down by it's grim subject matter. It's buoyed by subversive humor aimed at 9-5 stiffs, cheating girlfriends, bitchy bosses and the modern, emasculated man.

"spectacular, but only once","The movie ""Wanted"" was released a long time ago, back in 2008, but somehow I missed it and didn't watch it at the time. And yesterday I switched channels and found this picture on one of them, started watching and even became a little interested.While watching, the thought did not leave me that I had already seen all this in ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch"", only not on such a scale. And no wonder, because ""Especially Dangerous"" was shot by Timur Bekmambetov. The theme is basically the same - fathers and children, crime and punishment, choice. It smoothly flows into thoughts about fate. ""Day Watch"" had the Chalk of Destiny, and ""Especially Dangerous"" had the Machine of Destiny. Thus, a fantastic action movie acquires a philosophical meaning. And this is also not surprising, because the film was shot by a Russian director, and we can't do without philosophy ...I can't say that I liked the plot. Yes, there is one absolutely unpredictable turn in it, but in general everything is quite simple and understandable.I can't say that I was very interested. The film failed to captivate me completely. I rather watched it because of the great special effects. The flying bullet just blew me away. Very realistic and bright.Enjoyed the acting. Especially good is James McAvoy, who plays the main role of the unlucky clerk Wesley, who has turned into a real hero. Only now I constantly imagined Sergey Bezrukov, who voiced this role.""Especially Dangerous"" is a strong spectacular action movie, but I definitely don't want to watch it a second time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
One of the most ridicules yet also one of the best action movies of recent years.,"This movie is just totally crazy and over-the-top. Besides the fact that it features a totally implausible concept it also features lots of over-the-top action sequences, that will take you back to the days that the action from the Matrix-movies was still something new and impressive. Even though it's not original anymore it still works out surprising effective as well as refreshing in this movie.You should give credit for this to director Timur Bekmambetov. To be honest, I didn't though he would be ready to do a big Hollywood production yet, or better said; I didn't think Hollywood would be ready for it. He has a very distinctive fast directing style, that besides can also really be described as weird and different. It makes this action in this movie work out as original as well as truly dazzling. It's mostly its action and the handling of it that makes this one of the better and more pleasant action movies of recent years.It's a movie that luckily doesn't take itself too serious but not by making itself totally ridicules. The movie has plenty of humor and comical character in it to consider this a fun and pleasant one to watch. It's concept may really not let this movie sound like a good or likable action-flick but you should simply give this movie a chance and you will most probably end up liking it. It's an unexpectedly and also unlikely good movie.The movie also features a good musical score from Danny Elfman, who finally delivers a really great and memorable score again for a movie. It had been a while that he composed anything memorable or distinctive from his other work.Lots of big stars were signed up to give this movie a boost but yet the main role is being played by the humble Scotish James McAvoy, who plays a perfect likable, and probably for lots of persons also really recognizable, loser who needs to become an hero and learn to assassinate people with his unique talents. Angelina Jolie also never looked more foxy before in any other movie role. She is one tough chick in this movie, without ever loosing any of her beauty as well. The presence of actors such as Morgan Freeman, Terence Stamp and Thomas Kretschmann also help to uplift the movie.No matter how ridicules its story perhaps is, it still remains a good written, that features a couple of twists in it as well. It's the combination of story, directing and action that the movie works out as a credible and effective one but foremost you should simply enjoy this movie for what it is; a simple entertaining action-flick with some wonderful and original action moments in it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Watch,"The guy who borough you ""Nightwatch"" and ""Daywatch"" has another Blockbuster for you. Unlike the other two movies, this one is shot entirely in English. For his first English movie, he chose this project, which is a free adaptation from the Wanted comic ... I haven't read that, so I don't know how ""free"" the adaptation is.While the better known names are Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, the main actor is James McAvoy. And he's doing a great job. He's holding the movie more than together. Without his more than stellar/convincing performance the movie might have been less enjoyable. There almost too many clichés build into the story and some turns/twists are pretty foreseeable.Apart from the acting, the movie is very visual. But if you have seen the previous movies from the Russian director you might have guessed that. Great effects and (sound) editing.

"Okay if you are just looking to be entertained, but very lacking of quality and originality","I thought that 'Wanted' had an alright basic plot to begin with. This was ruined by a complete overuse of special effects and extremely unrealistic scenes to substitute a lack of imagination in my opinion. Of course 'Wanted' is a much different sort of movie but compared to a movie like No Country For Old Men for example, not one aspect of 'Wanted' could compare with the Coen Brothers script. Rather than keeping the viewers entertained with well scripted, well sequenced scenes, the movie turned from outrageously far-fetched, actually IMPOSSIBLE event to the other, for example TRAINS HANGING OFF OF BRIDGES!I think if you are going to stretch reality THAT far your might as well put wands and potions in their hands and make it a fantasy. I'm sure that some people like that kinda thing however and I wouldn't say the movie is boring. It is actually funny at some parts.

Not a movie too impress your Girl friend!,"I took my girl friend to see this action packed movie, staring Angelina Jolie. She was the best part. :-)Within minutes of the start, she (my girl friend, NOT Angelina) was not impressed. Very bored in fact. My girl friend wanted go to sleep, as it was very far-fetched. ""Wanted"", looked liked it was based on the Matrix, style of filming. Not everyones cup of tea!The F word, was used to much too, no point of it. Just makes the movie, poorer.One of the opening scenes, was a far-fetched car chase. The Chase was between a High Power Sports Car, and a delivery truck. The race goes on for a long while. Smashes, bangs, bullet's shot at each other cars, parts falling off. Wish my car was built like theirs. It was well beyond me, how a delivery truck, could keep up with the sports car. Absolute rubbish!!!!!!If you managed to sit through the car chase, WELL DONE!!We stayed for almost 30 Min's, until a scene was showed of young man, having the S**t kicked out of him. This was our final straw. The film did not need that clip. Complete, unnecessary violence. If it was dropped, we would have probably stayed till the end. Unfortunately, or fortunately we did not! We up and left, the cinema.If your girl friend is sweet, gentle, caring and emotional like mine, DON'T take her.

OK yeah,"Well this is another classic example of a screenplay with potential that was ruined by a director that wants nothing more but to make formula films for American teenagers. The only positive piece of work that the director may have contributed was the subtle left-wing propaganda that placed into certain parts of the film. Aside from this the film did a good job in disgracing the great actor that is Morgan Freeman, making Angelina Jolie look even less serious than she was taken before, especially when they had to milk her death when it really was only necessary because of her A-list star status, and taking away most of the quality actor credibility that John MaCovoy had built up with Atonement. This film had a chance to get a point across but instead it was buried under Hollywood's need to make money by using sex and violence to draw out the younger demographics of the U.S. today.

The problem lies in that most of the action scenes involve the heroes fighting one enemy and that isn't interesting. This limits the action considerably and the final action scene is just bad. There is no tension since you don't care about anyone. If like your action films filled with unlikeable characters, lots of swearing, breaking the forth wall (that really annoyed me) and CGI, then you will like this film.The visuals are really good though. There is a action scene with a train, which was the best thing about the film. Everything else just fell short. James McAvoy's character Wesley is really unlikeable from the start. You never like him once throughout the film and that will stop a lot of people from enjoying Wanted.Rent this film if you are interested in seeing it or if you have read the graphic novel, otherwise unless you are interested if hearing the cool sound effects, you may want to miss this.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Rubbish,"People who rate this movie high, they should only watch cartoons.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Noisy, loud, shrill, full of unrealistic action... and little else.","This action film is one of those films that is difficult to judge. After seeing it, I felt that it has a lot of satire and criticism in the way it tells its story. The problem is that it has little story to tell and makes up for that failure with tons of action, a fast pace and a lot of money, as teenagers and younger audiences generally like.The script tells us the story of Wesley Gibson. He is not happy and lives a mediocre existence where he is nothing more than a failed office worker, under the orders of an overweight and overbearing boss. He lives in a hideous apartment and has a beautiful girlfriend who ostensibly cheats on him with his best friend, who also works in the same office. The fact is that Wesley has little hope of improving his condition, so he ends up enduring mediocrity until he meets a beautiful woman who tells him that he is the son of a murderer who has just been killed. Although it is hard to believe, he decides he needs to know more about it and, realizing the reality, he throws his life in the trash and leaves with a bang. Now it's time for him to follow in his father's footsteps, become an almost infallible killer and avenge his death.It is not the first time that cinema brings us the story of someone who, living in a mediocre and unhappy way, finds a way to ""break the dishes"", turn around and taking control of his life. About that, some people remembered ""Matrix"" and, in fact, that film does just that, although similarities with this film don't go beyond that. In spite of all the social criticism about our way of life and the people who settle for the sensuous everyday life, the script is rather weak in that it is unrealistic and the plot looks thinner than the cotton cloths in that lom factory. The story of the Destiny Loom, then, sounds stupid or childish. If the fraternity were librarians, would they kill based on the height of the spines of the books on the shelves? The strong point of the film are the high doses of action, sometimes very unrealistic, with incredible fights and breathtaking chase scenes, where everyone escapes unscathed by a hair.Timur Bekmambetov ensured an average direction, giving us a coherent film that could have been much better in the hands of a more demanding and detailed director. James McAvoy is a good actor and has proven himself in previous films, but has little to do here but being beaten, run, get angry and look confused. The film never gave him a chance to show what he was worth. Angelina Jolie has one of the most important roles but what she does is, quite simply, copy much of what she did in ""Tomb Raider"", ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" and ""Salt"", in an uninteresting and lazy performance that adds nothing to her career but must have filled her bank account in some millions. Morgan Freeman didn't seem like anything special to me either, but he still stood out positively, given that most of the cast gave us bad acting or lazy versions of work previously done.Technically, it is a very visual film, betting on a fast pace for the audience to get carried away and not to think too much about the plot. Cinematography is essential for this purpose, with short and fast scenes, constantly moving from one camera to another, from one point of view to another. The use of light and shadow seems appropriate to me. Sound effects are strident and, when combined with a very rock soundtrack, make the film a little loud and noisy. CGI and slow motion help in the action scenes but, from a moment on, everything seems so fanciful that we disconnect from it and wait to the end.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Rats! I was hoping it would be better.,"I watched the beginning 8 minutes or so and the wife said she ""wanted"" nothing to do with it but I was intrigued so now 6 months later I resumed watching to an unsatisfying conclusion. It's a real toss-up as to who's more off-putting, James McAvoy or Dane DeHaan. That can be determined later. Just how many times can opposing bullets run into each other? You know, Robin Hood only split one arrow and that was one to many. It seemed be that by the end of the movie collateral damages were inconsequential, not to mention our closest 4 legged relative the rat. I must listen to my wife more often. Absurd action sequences abound. Horrible waste of Jolie and Freeman. The story plays out better in dozens of action and sci-fi movies of the past 50 years.

At least Death Note had a plot.Where to begin in criticizing this film? How about the completely unnecessary and exaggerated use of bad words? I mean, I couldn't find a SINGLE LINE that didn't use f**k or s**t. Or how about McAvoy's performance? Halfway through the film, his high pitched voice and constant yelling really got on my nerves. Finally, the whole movie's just really exaggerated and surreal (are we really supposed to believe that he could curve bullets AND still hit the bullseye? Or that they obey a loom?)I knew the movie was gonna be violent, but I expected something more like Guy Ritchie, with elaborate plots and effective black comedy.

"God, what a horrid piece of crap","This movie is, frankly, terrible, and this is from a guy who enjoys Uwe Boll if he's drunk enough. The bullet-bending thing is about the only original bit of action; most of the action scenes rip off better action movies (with The Matrix and Equilibrium being the most notable, but it hardly stops there), and instead of enjoying them for the cheese they are, I just want to watch the better movies they're ripping off.The characters, though, are the worst part, the protagonist in particular. Wesley is the most unsympathetic character I believe I've ever seen in a film, bar none. I had more pathos for Hitler in Der Untergang than I did for this guy. For 99.9% of the movie he is an absolute sociopath, lashing out violently at a world he thinks has wronged him when, in fact, his own behavior was the problem to begin with. Also, Angelina Jolie gives her usual sterling performance--I swear, they could've replaced her with a rock and you couldn't tell the difference. Except maybe the rock wouldn't look like a meth addict.There are three good things about this movie. One, the Russian guy from Night Watch is in it, and that's pretty cool, even if he doesn't have much of a role. Two, Morgan Freeman says the f-word. Twice. It's kind of like hearing your kindly old grandfather curse for the first time in your life, both horrifying and hilarious. Yes, I have to scrape that low in the barrel. And third, this movie eventually ends, leaving you to weep for the two hours of your life you will never, ever have back.God help us all if they make a sequel.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Read the Graphic Novel Instead,"Look, I know that most big summer blockbusters go light on the plot and heavy on the slick special effects, but 'Wanted' didn't really have either. Every review I read raves about the action sequences, but I'd seen it all before. Seemingly the only special effect that they use over and over is the curving bullets thing, where our assassins can someone get bullets to travel in arcs instead of straight lines. When this happens, the camera artfully pans around a CGI bullet as it slices through the air in slow motion. How revolutionary! I mean, the only other time I've seen a camera pan around an object frozen in time was in The Matrix...and every movie, video game, TV show, and commercial made since the Matrix came out, A F*CKING DECADE AGO! And as for the plot, I won't drop any spoilers, but if you have more than three functioning brain cells you'll start seeing obvious plot holes about 20 minutes in and continue to see them right up to the film's unsatisfying conclusion. I don't like to be the ""The Book Was Better"" guy, but in this case I'll make an exception. You can tell that the screenwriter read up to about page 30, then decided that a secret society of assassins with the most useless super power imaginable would be a lot better than an action-packed, yet highly introspective look at the corruptibility of man, the nature of freedom, and what happens if the bad guys actually win.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Bullets over (and under and sideways) Broadway,"I'm not familiar with the source comic book but after two hours of this blockbuster I'll not be subscribing anytime soon. I know that films like this aren't really aimed at my age-group, but when done really well (""The Matrix"", Avengers Assemble"") even I can get it.The movie starts with a bloody bang, literally, as we're introduced to the main trick employed throughout, a slow-motion bending bullet, something we've already seen before in ""The Matrix"", and which gets done to death (no pun intended) as the movie progresses.If I was trying to be positive, I could say it's fast-moving, flashy and expensive-looking. It's much easier though to say it's relentless, trashy and ultimately empty. I didn't like the constant profanity, I felt the blood and guts gore was overdone and the sex scenes, whilst brief and usually involving ""worm-that turns"" James McAvoy's boorish, bullying so-called best friend banging his girl-friend, crude and gratuitous. There's precious little leavening humour, the body count is massive and accelerates as the finish approaches plus I vaguely mind seeing good actors like McAvoy and Morgan Freeman wasting and hardly extending themselves in easy pay-days like this.McAvoy as the central character undergoes the biggest metamorphosis since Dr Jeckyll drank his potion, going from put-upon office nerd to a pumped-up killing machine who even gets to snog fellow-agent Angelina Jolie along the way. There's a biggish plot-twist of the Luke Skywalker variety and a massive SFX episode involving a train crash but for me the latter wasn't as big as the movie itself from which I found myself derailed very early on and never climbed back on board again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
OK if you like this kind of film.,"So this is a movie about an cult that claims ancient origins and divine purpose. Nothing out of the ordinary there, all cults claim ancient origins and divine purpose and with the same amount of evidence, id est none whatsoever. This particular cult also kills people and bends space and time with their mind, which is slightly less common.Naturally there is a renegade from this cult, who serves as the antagonist, and a clueless newbie: Wesley Gibson, who serves as the protagonist. I definitely wouldn't call him a hero, the only provably heroic thing he does is kill a guy who kills people for profit. Gibson also kills a bunch of innocent people and bystanders, so definitely not a hero.Speaking of Gibson, I keep wondering if I'm supposed to relate to him in some way; like him or identify with him? I never do, but I usually hate protagonists these days so maybe I'm out of touch.The cultists randomly select people to kill, by picking names out of a hat. Well, not really, they have a big random number generator set up, clouded in mysticism and holy. But it's apparent that they could just as easily have chosen names at random out of the phone book.The renegade left the cult because one day one of the cultists thought: ""Hey, why not chose our targets to make the world a better place? (While pocketing some cash for ourselves.)"" . Gibson wavers a bit between the camps, but that is fortunately the closest we get to soul searching.Despite the mumbo jumbo death list generator, there isn't enough mysticism in this movie. Just having the assassins carve runes into the bullets to make them curve and some mystic read the psycic aura of the spent bullets to track the enemy would have made those aspects easier to swallow. Even a lame ""Use the force, William!"" is more than we got.On the other hand, sometimes the lack of explanations is a good thing. For instance, had Gibson's wavering between the two camps of the cult been made any clearer, he would have been forced to make an explicit choice and it would have been a stupid one. Too much explanation and we get idiocy like: ""the robots are using humans as batteries"".Ignoring all story, there are some nice action scenes. Even in the obligatory knife fight Gibson isn't dumb enough to drop his guns, which is uncommonly sensible. There is also a brief glimpse of Angelina Jolie's backside.Bottom line if you want action similar to ""Matrix"" or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and are quick enough to make up your own story, so you can ignore the mess that comes with the film, ""Wanted"" can serve as a diversion for an hour and a half.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Spider-Man uses magical ring to escape from matrix,"Read ""Wesley"" for ""Spider-Man"", ""bullet"" for ""ring"", and ""fraternity"" for ""matrix"", and you've got ""Wanted"".

This one is no different. I mean, of course she looks hot with her big hair and pushed-up boobs and tight outfits, but that's because half the budget was spent on hair and make-up. The other half went to special effects and extras. As a result, both Angelina and Chicago look more dramatic than ever. But what's next in a movie that opens with a showdown? Blood, sweat, and tears mostly, especially for Wesley Gibson, a hapless nobody who discovers he has superpowers and gets entangled in a global (counter-)conspiracy of epic proportions. Sort of like Peter Parker. Or Frodo. Or Neo. And he doesn't even get the girl. Think ""Charmed"" minus the witches plus a lot of pointless violence and even more pompous sermonizing, especially by Morgan Freeman's character Sloan. Visually impressive though.

"Ridiculous stunts, Glorifies Assassins! Stunts salvage the movie!","Going by the promos, this was supposed to be a decent action movie, especially since it starred credible names like Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman. But, little did I expect ridiculous action stunts on bending bullets in a non-‘matrix’ environment! And then there is the hackneyed plot of treachery and deceit with an unsuspecting protagonist. Saving this movie is its high octane action that may also sometimes seem improbably comical.Wesley (James McAvoy) is frustrated weakling who on one hand is beleaguered by his fat shrewish boss and on the other hand swallows his pride as his girlfriend is busy sleeping with his best friend. His life is all set to change when babe Fox (Jolie) takes him to Sloan (Freeman) head of a thousand year old secret society of expert assassins who take orders from names of victims that come up from a code of the loom in the fabric.Just before he can go on assassination assignments, Wesley is put through conditioning that involves being beaten up, broken bones, getting stabbed and all injuries getting cured in a bath of liquid. Wow, if that were true, these spas could do better business than hospitals. Oh yes, and then there is a philosophy that they kill people because they can save the world from the damage that the victims could do if they were alive!Be prepared with suspended logic for the action sequences.

Laughable but fun. Sort of. Hmm.. is 'fun' too strong?,"This is a movie that falls firmly into the category of '(Quite (Not Very)) Entertaining Garbage'. It might have had something going for it if we hadn't seen The Matrix ... all those years ago. But what the hell, put your mind on 'coast' and sit back for a (kinda) fun hour-and-a-half you'll never get back. For me the inclusion of the name 'Angelina Jolie' in a cast list is a near-guarantee of poor quality. On the other hand, 'Morgan Freeman' usually has the opposite effect. Maybe Morgan is saving up for his divorce or somebody's been stepping on his chlorpromazine, but either way his presence is something of a mystery. I can understand how films like this get made I just don't know why. Maybe it's because we're alone in an endless, silent, eternal emptiness - an emptiness we try to fill any way we can... oh now I think someone's been stepping on m y chlorpromazine",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A sack of absolute trash,"Today's comic book movies are supposed to be gritty and dark. But there's a difference between that and this particular film. The film ""Wanted"" is about a young man, Wesley (James McAvoy), who is going through a mid-life crisis and can't figure out what his purpose is in life. That is until he runs into a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie), who brings him into a secret society of assassins called ""The Fraternity"". Just to point out by the way, that ""The Fraternity"" is the LAMEST name of a group I have ever heard!! Why not just call it ""The Group"" to be even less specific?What I could not believe right off the bat was how low the vocabulary level was for this film. What were the scriptwriters doing...pretending they were teenagers again? Practically every sentence drops the F-bomb, how does this enhance the film any? Yes, sometimes the F-bomb is dropped but not every sentence. That's just being crass. Every character in this film has no dignity whatsoever...not even the main character's boss!Then we have the issue of characterization. James McAvoy's acting is offensive and insulting to all actors in Hollywood. What appealed to him in the script? The fact that he got the chance to curse his mouth off? Yeah real professional. Oh and he also says ""I'm sorry"" way too often and makes a lot of distorted faces which makes me hate him that much more. Not to mention for the first half of the film, he's a crying sack of crap just like Shia LaBeouf from Transformers (2007). Either grow up or go home McAvoy.Even Angelina Jolie's character was weird. Sure Jolie's always sexy but supposedly she based her character off of Clint Eastwood. So tell me where any of the scenes she played in resembled that. I didn't see one. Plus the laws of physics really don't seem to apply in this film. I can see maybe someone curving a bullet path, but jumping off a building onto another building 500 yards away AND MAKE IT WITH NO INJURIES? These are assassins, not superheroes. Mark Millar and J.G. Jones I think have too many screws loose in their deranged heads.Oh, let's not forget the special effects! There's plenty slow motion if you're into that kind of stuff. That is unless you don't like seeing it every 5 minutes in every scene. Seriously folks, slow motion is good when it's time for the audience to focus on something and this kind of event rarely occurs. It doesn't occur that often here either, but for some reason the filming crew felt it was necessary for EVERY cotton- picking scene!As for action goes, there's plenty of bloody gunshots. Not that that really made the viewing experience anymore exciting. It felt more numbing than it did entertaining. There was actually one point where two people were having a gunfight but it wasn't going anywhere because they were trained so well that their shots kept clashing. How dull. Why don't you shoot TWICE? Idiots. Even Danny Elfman's score provided little propulsion in this film. It wasn't engaging and it was thrilling. Thumbs down Elfman. And then to top it off with the greatest insult to all, at the end of the film, James McAvoy has the guts to ask the audience, ""What the f*** have you done lately?"". I tell you what Mr. McAvoy, I've wasted two hours of my time watching you play the most annoying character I have ever seen on screen!I had WANTED this film to be cool but in the end, I WANTED to beat the hell out of my TV screen. Timur Bekmambetov's film is the perfect example of what film trash really is. It needs to be buried in the Earth's core.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Extremely impressive, but incredibly stupid","It can't be denied that wanted has some merits. Wesley is a likeable character that the audience can easily root for, in no small part thanks to James McAvoy's performance. And he goes through quite some development as the movie progresses. He starts off as a pure loser. His girlfriend is cheating on him with his best friend, his boss is a disgusting monster that terrorises him whenever she gets the chance, he suffers from panic attacks and his daily routine makes that of Edward Norton's character in Fight Club look exciting. Then he finds out he - like his father who adandoned him as a baby - is a naturally gifted assasin, their ""superpowers"" are a result of the huge amounts of adrenalin his body can produce. Consequently, he transforms from loser to hero, though things aren't that simple.The main selling point of the movie are the overly stylish and impressively filmed action scenes.On the other hand, it can't be ignored how stupid the plot is and how unrealistic pretty much everything that happens here is.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Ridiculous,"First let me state that I'm all for the ""implausible-but-fun"" movie genre. Transporter 1 & 2 are good examples of films of this genre that work. They were fun to watch, and they didn't try to hard to ""sell"" the completely implausible plots and physically impossible action sequences. Who cares--they're fun to watch!Not so with Wanted. First of all, the implausibility level rises past ""implausible"" and crashes right through ""ridiculous"" and into ""time-wastingly bizarre"" territory. What's worse, stupid dialog and over-obvious camera shots try too hard at every turn to sell what can't be sold. Doesn't the director get it?? We don't *want* to be sold--we'll go with your plot if you just deliver the action.It starts in a promising way with some ""Office Space"" references. Wesley, a hapless office drone is henpecked by his annoying overweight female boss, who looks quite like the ""Looks like you've got a case of the Mondays"" lady. His cube-mate is taking a lot of time off for 'dentist appointments' to screw Wesely's girlfriend. Then one day he's saved by Angelina Jolie from what she says is an assassination attempt on him. OK, we can go with that......until she further explains that the attempt was by a rogue member of an assassination fraternity, of which his estranged father was the top member. This fraternity apparently exists only to do battle with another assassination fraternity. How they get paid is unknown, but they seem to have unlimited funds. They also carry out assassinations to ""preserve order"", but it looks a lot more like these two fraternities just run around killing each other.The orders for whom to kill are delivered by a bizarre encryption method consisting of slight imperfections embedded into weaving patterns made by an ancient loom in their front-business--a textile mill near what looks like Goose Island in Chicago. They could have just said a secret ""Mr. X"" tells them who to kill but I digress. I would've bought the weaving-code thing if they hadn't spent so much time trying to explain it. Again--with movies like this they should just let it go and get on with the action--don't bore us with trying to explain how ""if the vertical thread misses the weave and goes *over* the cross thread, it's a zero, and if the horizontal thread goes *under* the cross thread, it's a 1"" or some such nonsense. I would've bought the stupid plot-point but it was oversold. Just get on with the action.I could go on and on with the bizarre ""initiation"" process, where he's beaten up daily by ""The Repairman"", then covered in Krispy-Kreme glaze to 'accelerate the healing'. He learns how to curve a bullet so he can shoot around obstacles. That's where I almost fell asleep. Too much time spent on selling us on how he has to go through all of this to prepare himself to do this ultra-high-priority kill. And of course there are ***SPOILER ALERT*** ridiculous twists upon twists, where everyone he thought was bad was actually good, and vice versa. Or were they? Oh, who cares.

wow this was a let down,"This is my first review ever posting on IMDb although i read many. What inspired me? This movie was such a let down i just had to write on it. In fact, I can say this was one of the biggest let downs i've seen since ""nothing but trouble"" in 1991 when with the star filled cast i wanted to walk out of the theater. It was one of those movies that you could guess everything that was going to happen next and didn't even care what was going to cause the plot was so stupid and left you no reason to care about the fate of the protagonists whoever they might have turned out to be in this ""jumbled"" sh*t show of Benedict Arnold like characters. The only part of interest was the beginning which would lead one to believe the movie might be interesting and then it quickly spirals downhill. The movie sucked. FLat Out! I only gave it 5 stars cause the special effects deserve merit...otherwise a 3 would have been in order. Jolie's character is just plain boring... and Morgan freedmen seemed almost, and i really mean this, almost as if he was making a mockery of himself. His character was the same one he always plays... wise older black man, but this time he he left me saying, ""seriously?"". DOn't bother watching unless you want to watch just so you can sh*t blow up or so you see just how badly a movie execs will do anything for a blockbuster that will appeal hopefully to everyone at the end.

Like superhero movies, it's when the hero first discovers his powers that are the most fun as we can identify with him. However, once Wesley learns his trade and turns into some kind of cross between Superman and James Bond that it becomes a bit tedious.Angelina Jolie adds the requisite hotness. Morgan Freeman adds the requisite gravitas. Neither of them break a sweat. Angelina in particular manages to maintain the exact same face for the whole movie which is quite an achievement.There is also too many slow motion exploding heads for my liking.

Basically a boring movie.,"Movies like this are the result of Hollywood embracing the world of comic books. I liked to read comics when I was around 10 or 11 years old, for a time, but comics are no substitute for having friends. In a way this is a superior film-if you are the type of person who likes to escape into a world of super hero's-like a 10 or 11 year old might. For an older crew I think it leaves much to be desired. It simultaneously supports the notion that all people in their 20's are talentless losers who have to rely on their father's reputation of they want to get anywhere in life and additionally supports the notion that older staid type are endowed with super powers-as if 'Daddy knows everything.' Its a quick study. I think it actually does a disservice to the actors involved with projects like this-because at its heart films like this are seriously sappy. Minus all the little jokes. Which only support a larger nihilistic premise. Plus bullets can't go around corners. Even if you wish it your very hardest.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Pretty pathetic,"As much as I hate Angie, I hate it even more when she plays a bad- ass, 30 kilogram tiny woman playing a bad- ass assassin?!But OK, let's get to the point: this movie is childish pathetic peace of crap.Everything is so stupid, but not funny stupid, jest plain ol' stupid. Apparently if your heart beats 400 times in a minute you can slow the time and that helps you maneuver the bullets, and of course, that makes you a great killer. We all know that reflexes don't have anything to do with heart rate, and you can't fire bullets that don't fly straight unless you have hands faster then the bullet itself, and hearth can't pump blood 400 times a minute. There is so much stupid things happening that it's hard to keep track, lets just say that action sequences are more pathetic and gay than in fast and furious, at least there you can laugh at the over the top crap, here it's just sad.Couple of times they put the obligatory 3D crap ""in your face"" scenes that don't help this movie look like a real movie instead of crap. This much stupid should make a comedy, but this travesty tries to be serious movie at some points, what nerve! What nerve!?I wouldn't recommend it, it isn't fun even for a first time viewers.

"Half and Half for me, but at least it throws out most of the bullshit from the comic...","""Wanted"" has a lot of cool action sequences and there are a lot of iconic moments in it, but the tone is uneven. If you're a fan of the comic book it was based on this is one of the least accurate adaptations I've ever seen. The film follows Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), a nobody loser. He has no money, no future or aspirations and worst of all, has no will to do anything about it. Everything changes when he crosses path with Fox (Angelina Jolie). She tells him that he is the son of one of the world's greatest assassins and that his panic attacks are actually his superhuman abilities trying to break out. Daddy's been murdered and only Wesley can avenge him. Leaving his cheating bitch of a girlfriend, his crummy job and the boss he hates behind, he begins training and prepares to take his revenge.This movie is a mash up between an action movie so stupid that it revels in its idiocy and one that just tries way too hard to be cool. When it goes completely dumb is when it works. ""Wanted"" begins by throwing physics on the ground and shooting it eighteen times with a scene that I thought was pretty awesome. Moments like this where the picture says ""yeah I know that makes no sense, but isn't it amazing?"" are when it works. We've seen movies about leather-clad assassins. They're always being played up as ultra-cool killers that somehow never get hired to kill nice people. I say if you're going to make an unrealistic film about assassinations, go all the way and make it the most improbable movie ever. We've got people driving at ridiculous speeds, making cars flip into the air so they can shoot at their targets, people jumping on trains, shooting each other from miles away, shooting bullets with their bullets and a terrific gag where someone gets hit in the face with a keyboard that will have you cheering.What doesn't work with the movie is that about 50% of the time it doesn't go all the way. This movie is rated R, there should be a scene where Wesley has just collected a big bounty on a criminal mastermind and he rewards himself with a weekend in Vegas where he drives nothing but solid gold limousines and pays two bikini babes to lick peanut butter off of each other. It should also have been much gorier than it is to capitalize on the ""fun"" aspect of butchering bad guys. Think of another film that's ridiculously violent to the point where it becomes hilarious like Paul Verhoven's ""Robocop"". That movie went all the way in satirizing violence; this one does it... half of the time. When it isn't a dumb, loud action movie, the story is still plenty ridiculous, but the movie doesn't want you to think it's absurd.The Fraternity (the league of assassins that Wesley is recruited into) takes its orders from get this... a loom. Sloan (Morgan Freeman), interprets chunks of the tapestry it weaves and reads errors in the way the fibers are put together, translating it into binary code that gives the assassins their next targets' names. What?! The weave is always correct and if you don't go ahead with its orders, bad things will happen. What I wanted to see was Wesley realize that this whole thing is absolutely ridiculous. I wanted a revelation that all along these people were killing random strangers for no reason. He would have had to go all badass and take down his mentors because their next target was the Pope or something. That would have hit the perfect note.I've always proclaimed that books and movies are very different forms of storytelling and those directors and scriptwriters should feel free to interpret the material differently to make it work for the screen, but ""Wanted"" takes it on a whole new level. The book and movie begin similarly, but then they couldn't be more different. There are no supervillains, no plots to destroy the world, no trips to other dimensions, no colorful costumes or massive conspiracies that allow our characters to do whatever they want. I understand why the character of Wesley was changed from an unlikeable anti-hero who kills people who annoy him in cold blood, has nothing but disdain for ordinary people and gleefully rapes women but why even call the film ""Wanted"" if it has maybe 15 minutes' worth of material in common? And of all of the elements you had to retain from the original material, why keep the final line from the book, where the protagonist we've been following insults the audience and berates them for not being as cool as a fictional character? It's not that ""Wanted"" is really that bad, in fact there are a lot of good moments, some of which are really iconic (including some of Morgan Freeman's lines towards the end, which are priceless). The problem with the film is that the target audience, fans of the book will be completely disappointed by the amount of changes made and it doesn't stand on its own very well either. I'm not a huge fan of the book, despite really enjoying the concept and seeing the great parts in it. I just couldn't get over the childish insults and self-hate the author had piled on top of the character I just couldn't cheer for at all. I was really hoping that this would be a chance for a third party to come in and fix all of the problems and make it a really cool film. When I realized that was not at all what I was going to get I was still disappointed that the film chickened out when it really mattered. Since the movie is about 50% awesome stupid action and 50% missteps, the best I can give it is a middle-of-the-road rating of 2,5 / 5. (On DVD, February 21, 2014)",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Matrix meets Fightclub,"I must say i had expectations about this movie. All the buzz about this ""new matrix"" caught my attention. I wasn't defrauded. Wanted is a great movie. It's NOT the new matrix, but as far as attempts go, this is the best so far. There is obviously some things in common. Again you'll see some random looser discovering he has amazing skills and he is not just an ordinary man, and then he struggles to find his path. The thing is, Matrix was not only special effects and slow motion ,the concept was amazing, the duality between real and fiction, and the idea that maybe what we're experiencing is not real was revolutionary and fresh.The Matrix is a mark in the history of cinema both visually and conceptually. Wanted has the visual, but the plot,its just OK, it doesn't blow us away and there are some plot holes along the ride. Still, Wanted is a really good movie,the narration was a good option(Fightclub anyone?)and the dark humor made me crack several times, this is the way to put comedy into action. The special effects are obviously amazing, its all done very stylishly, James McAvoy excels in this role, Morgan Freeman was casted just to draw more people to see the movie because he has like 10 lines, and boy, do i love the new look of Angelina.She looks like a skinny drug addict with huge amounts of eye shadow...but a really hot one! And she has that ""cool attitude"" you just can't get enough. Many people are saying Wanted is forgettable, well probably, but only because the matrix came first. If you are looking for the perfect movie, a masterpiece, this is not for you. This is an action packed movie with great special effects, great leading actor,lots of humor and all this put together very nicely.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Worth a look - that's about it,"I have to say, I thought about this movie for quite some time after I saw it a week ago.The story as I goes, is a very good story (or at least on paper) Let's start with the good. The special effects and chase sequences are eye candy. Jolie was a good choice for the role. Her knack and expertise in playing a seductress and assassin was well done. James McAvoy is an up and coming star. I felt he played his role as a depressed socialite in a tedious environment well.The only thing that lacked was the story development. The first scenes don't relate or fit well, or even explain, what it means to the rest of the story. Without giving anything away, the script tries to make a twist 2/3rds way through the movie - and it is fairly obvious. The movie ended much like it started - vague, and questionable. If you like to judge a movie by it's replay value - it doesn't have any.Another writer mentioned Morgan Freemans role and how he looked like he didn't want to be there - I couldn't agree more. His character is under-used and it appears he wasn't given a whole lot to work with in regards to character development.I think if some of the fight scenes would have been a tad more realistic, (instead of matrix-like) this would have made an average movie into a good movie Take the movie for what its worth - if you like action movies, can over see the obvious plot holes, and want to be entertained, you will enjoy, (maybe not love) but enjoy.Worth watching if you tivo'd and want something to do. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend running to Hollywood Video and renting 4/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
It was fun,I really don't like this kind of action movies. You must explain how did you do that If the bullet moves on a circular orbit. But it was really funny. McAvoy was cute. Tahat's all.,,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Oh, well","I'll start with ""we all like different kind of movies"". But the thing that pisses me off, is how you expect that every movie ever made, has to be some true, ultra-intelligent story, that inspires some profound thoughts and sh*t. As difficult as it may be for you, you have to except the fact that there are some movies, made for the simple pleasure of watching high speed races with beautiful cars, and guns being fired in the background.Yes, it is a nice thing to see a good movie, that will make you think about something important, a movie that's not just some silly story, but can't all of them be like that. Take a break, take a beer, watch a movie, relax. Can't relax to a movie about the meaning of life (; Though I don't see how an action movie can be about the meaning of life, but that's beside the point.And the point being - stop bitching about how unrealistic the movie is, and just enjoy.please, do me a favor and go to you-tube, then search for ""if movies were real"" :D",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The best action movie in years.,"I had been away from movies the whole last year, so just last month, i bought all the good ones of 2008 on DVD (I think so), and watched them one by one. And I thought that ""Wanted"" was the best action film of the lot. Let's start with direction, Timur Bekmambetov isn't the best in business to flesh out characters and stress necessary plot points, its still hard to imagine someone else doing his job though. Had it been an American director in his place (or British), we'd probably be watching this movie through Rose colored spectacles, where everything goes right in the end and the film's hero tells us how sorry he is on his past actions and promises to work hard from than on to save America from an impending disaster in Wanted 2. There is NOTHING like that and director Bekmambetov sees to it. Instead, this is a very nasty movie about a bunch of super-villains (super-assassins for the movie) whose ideas of redemption and right/wrongs differ vastly from the rest of the mankind.Leading the cast is James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson, a loser who's just found out that he is not, after all, a loser and he does a good job. To support him is Angelina Jolie with her ""don't look at me like that"" and ""mind your own business"" kind of attitude, which completely diminishes any chances of a Bruce Banner/Betty Ross kind of relationship. Finally, Morgan Freeman is as good as ever as the cold-blooded and deadly assassin leader. The rest of the cast doesn't have much to do and simply keeps the lead ones busy.The film's main weakness lies in its screenplay which is senseless and leaves a lot to be desired. We're never told how the leadership is changed in the Fraternity and how the leaders know how to work out the Loom of Fate. Nor is it made clear that why a thousand year old society has come to operate in Chicago. The film also throws a ridiculous looking twist halfway through which was visible a mile away. A lot of story elements were compromised to make way for the incredible (albeit physically implausible) action scenes which make up the bulk of the film.Talking about action sequences, Wanted's version of physics would probably have made Einstein cry aloud in hell and left Newton rolling in his grave. What with characters using each other's vehicles as jump-pads, shooting someone in the head from miles away and ,well, bending bullets. That still is no more unbelievable than someone sprouting webs from his hands and someone else flying at super-sonic speeds. These guys are super-villains remember.Wanted's biggest strength is its free spirit which safely guides it through. If you are looking for an action movie with over the top action and some good performances, look no further.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Wanted Review from deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com,"VISIT deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com FOR MORE REVIEWS! Timur Bekmambetov, director of the Russian fantasy 'Night Watch' and it's sequel 'Day Watch', makes his Hollywood debut with the release of 'Wanted', a film loosely adapted from the comic books of the same name. The premise; everyman Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is torn from his monotonous life in order to follow in his fathers footsteps, joining The Fraternity, a league of super-assassins.McAvoy is thrown into action at the deep end, an actor we are used to seeing play mostly strong character roles, at first seems an unlikely action hero. But the Scot embraces it well, his transition from office loser to super-assassin is seamless, a performance we have come to expect from a man destined for Oscar greatness. Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman also provide solid support as Fox and Sloan respectively, adding A-List appeal to the blockbuster. Sadly, however, the casts' strong performances are about the limit to this films believability as the plot becomes so far-fetched that you simply pass caring.Wanted sacrifices a potentially intriguing plot in favour of action, succumbing to the now irresistible urge of a plot twist (and a thoroughly predictable one at that) to give the story any life whatsoever. One cannot help but feel that the film could have been so much more had it struck the balance between it's visuals and it's narrative more effectively. There really isn't much to the story whatsoever, what does exist spirals so far out of control that the final scenes become utterly irrelevant and at some points laughable (exploding rats, anyone?).The film's bias towards action ahead of plot may on the one hand be it's downfall, but on the other perhaps it's saving grace. The film certainly looks beautiful and the action flows flawlessly, each sequence building at a perfect pace with the climax to said sequences never disappointing. Wanted can also boast it's own signature action shots, following bullets forwards and backwards through the heads of the hapless targets is brutal yet brilliant and the 'pulsating camera' is innovative if not slightly headache-inducing.Where Wanted quite clearly would like to be compared to, and reach the heights of a film like 'The Matrix', it really struggles to get anywhere near. It can be more accurately compared to a copy of Heat Magazine; it has the glossy exterior and the big stars, but look a little closer and there's no real substance and will just be tossed aside and forgotten about by next week.Verdict: Whether it be car chases, curving bullets or Angelina Jolie's naked behind; Wanted certainly looks superb. It may not hold your attention to the very end, but a decent, if not forgettable watch. THREE STARS OUT OF FIVE",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Entertaining but not so memorable,"This film is about an accountant who gets selected to join a group of elite assassins.""Wanted"" looks cool. I like the scenes where James McAvoy kills from a moving train, or from a flipped over car. And I was thrilled by the scene where a car smashes into the train. These actions scenes are rather new, and I was pleasantly surprised by them. However, the plot does not make so much sense. Bullets with curving trajectory is too surreal to be believed. In addition, the ending scene that involves many people being dead is plain ridiculous. Though I think ""Wanted"" is entertaining, I cannot help but think that it is simply a vehicle for showcasing CGI effects and senseless violence.In summary, ""Wanted"" is entertaining but not so memorable.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
