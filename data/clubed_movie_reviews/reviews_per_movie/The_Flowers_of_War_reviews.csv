The Best of 2011,"I thought The Flowers of War was one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. Ignore all bad reviews, movies are not suppose to be perfect, there was a point of view, a story and a plot that were all displayed understandably. I have read a few reviews on this film and I have noticed most people saying ''Its too graphic'', it is a war film and the graphic effect was a great way of showing the audience the true form of war and the violence the soldiers/people experienced.The cast was wonderful, I was amazed by the outstanding performance of the young Chinese actresses, I had goosebumps when they started crying or displaying any form of drama. Christian Bale was wonderful, I have always loved his acting and I still do, he portrayed John Miller's character the way I imagined it. He was capable of making me believe that he was an American without any doubt. Ni Ni (Yu Mo) was an amazing character and actress, I have knowledge that it is her first picture and she had shown amazing talent along with all the other Chinese actresses.Over all I suggest you should watch the film, it is great and inspirational and extremely entertaining to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Don't miss.  This deserves your attention.,"Zhang Yimou has crafted a beautifully shot and compelling story set inside horrific events. About all I knew of this movie was it was set in 1937 China and starred Christian Bale. Not knowing much allowed me to be completely open to the journey of the characters. This is an emotionally powerful story about people caught in circumstances for which there seems no hope of survival. The Japanese soldiers are shown as barbaric, but we do meet an officer who attempts to remain honorable though he must do his duty to his superiors. The violence in the movie is brutal, but not graphic or gratuitous. The choices and sacrifices made by the characters never seemed contrived. The arc of Christian Bale's character may seem 'predictable', but it is never false or 'convenient' to the story. All actors are excellent. Because they're foreign to me I had no idea who they are or their other work. At the screening I attended we were introduced to Ni Ni, who said this was her first film. She is both beautiful and compelling. I wish her a long career. Yimou, through his daughter, told us about his journey to make this movie - based on a novel, based on real events. He has told an amazing story that will stay with me for a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good Movie is Like a Mirror,"I watched the movie in Beijing, twice. The second time I liked it more. This has to be one of the best Chinese films yet, if not the best. Some scenes are pretty brutal, but really worth watching, to say the least.The director Zhang YiMou told a powerful, touching and beautiful story, while delivering stunning visual effects as always. All actors from different countries did an amazing job in making so many strong characters in 3 languages, not just the American 'priest', but also those prostitutes, the boy George, all the children, Japanese officers, and the Chinese 'traitor'.Good movie is like a mirror, some people might get upset watching it, while others see love for others, respect for life, and the human spirit of fighting for peace out of tragedy. Each audience's reaction more or less reflects his/her personal value. The storytelling is objective so you can judge for yourself. In front of a masterpiece like this, people who ranked it very low deliberately because of stereotypes against China or whatever twisted reason (I KNOW YOU EXSIT ON THIS SITE), you need to sit down and think what's wrong with yourself, no matter how open-minded you claim you are.Some say it is a propaganda production. I have to disagree here. Almost everything in this movie is based on real history, including how Japanese tortured Chinese war victims, how prostitutes stood up to protect other women during the Rape of NanJing, as well as how some westerners resided in China at the time helped local Chinese. Anyone who can pick up a few books or do a bit of research on internet knows it.English is not my mother language so I can't write an review with big words like those professional critics do. However, this is the first time I feel so moved by a movie that I'd write an English review online to recommend it to viewers outside of China. Simply too good to miss.If any Chinese simply walked out of the cinema cursing Japanese, I'd say the movie failed big time. However, both times I saw people left quietly, some still sobbing, and heard them saying how lucky they are to be born in this era and how precious peace is. For that reason, I applaud this film.It is what it is. Horrible things happened in history. Hate and anger won't do any good today. Make peace with yourself and move on. Just like what George said in the movie, life is precious, it is not ours to throw away.",10.0,Anonymous,History
a movie definitely worth seeing,"Honestly,I am not the kind of people easily being touched so deeply as to cry, and I didn't cry much during the movie indeed. I just walked out the movie theater,took a bus,got off the bus,bought a piece of bread, walked home while eating the bread,then all of sudden burst into tears.Till now I still haven't walked out of it. There is so much to say, yet you don't know what to say nor how to say it. My only advice: you walk into the movie theater, forget whatever people said on the Internet, and just watch it with your own heart.It is a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Unrealistic View of the Rape of Nanking,"In 1937, the cynical mortician John Miller (Christian Bale) arrives at a Catholic Church in Nanjing that is under protection of the Red Cross to bury the local priest during the Japanese attack to the Capital of China. He finds only student girls and one young boy in the convent and he decides to spend the night in the church and travel on the next day. Soon a group of prostitutes from the local brothel by the river breaks in the church seeking a sanctuary and they hide in the basement.On the next morning, a Japanese platoon breaks in the Church and when the soldiers see the girls, they try to rape them. John wears the priest costume and poses like a priest to the invaders. He tries unsuccessfully to stop the Japanese, but the Chinese Major Li (Dawei Tong), who is the only survivor of his troop, prepares traps using bombs and destroys the whole platoon. Now John needs to decide whether he leaves Nanjing in the last ship or stays in the church protecting the naive girls.""Jin líng shí san chai"" is an unrealistic view of the Rape of Nanking in 1937. The plot has the usual exaggeration of blockbusters that spoils the film. John Miller is a cynical mercenary that refuses to escape with his compatriot in the last ship to stay with the Chinese girls in an unbelievable redemption of a character. The two prostitutes leave the shelter to bring a pair of rings and a string for her liuqin is also a ridiculous situation. The attitude of the prostitutes switching places with the student girls is also hard to believe. The best film about this shameful invasion is ""Nanjing 1937"". My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Flores do Oriente"" (""Eastern Flowers"")",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A glimpse of WWII in China through one fallen city, Nanking","Please watch this movie to get a glimpse of what it was like during World War II in China. My grandparents were in a different part of China that also got occupied where similar tragedies occurred. Though much much worse. Babies would be thrown in the air and caught on the bayonets as a game. There were killing games. My grandma can never tell her story without crying. The Japanese government deny this ever happened, they never apologized, and payed for their war crimes. They do not even have it written in their history books. All my grandparents want is for their story to be recognized as well as a formal apology. Thanks for reading.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Emotional and heart-warming.,"With ruthless Japanese soldiers killing everyone in sight, a group of students hides inside a church. An American, John Miller (Christian Bale) is a mortician who must go to the church for the Priest's funeral. However, arriving there he finds there is no body. George (Tianyuan Huang), who was raised by the Priest, tells John there is no money to pay him.Unwilling to leave without payment, John decides to stay a bit. A bunch of prostitutes - who were promised refuge at the Church - also arrives, to John's delight. What follows, is excellent character study, with great character development, and tales of heroism.'The Flowers of War' disturbingly depicts the inhumane deeds of humans during warfare. During war, some soldiers, it seems, believe they have the right to completely abandon morals, and act selfishly, tormenting innocent victims. The film is very emotional and heart-warming in equal proportions. This is an outstanding film, focusing mainly on characters and their actions during times of desperation. The action sequences are awesome.Based on fact, this was captivating. The film slows down significantly during the final act, yet remains interesting. Two and a half hours later, I would have liked the film to be even longer still. Very good performance by Christian Bale.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Great movie, highly recommended","It's a great movie, very touching. The background is Nanking Massacre, at that cruel and desperate history moment, the director finds a special perspective to show us goodness, hope, sacrifice and humanity. Although I've seen so many war movies before, this one is different. I could not help crying through the whole movie, even I told myself ""This is just another war movie, you should control your tears"" But the movie has nothing to do with intendedly giving audience slushy emotional scenes. Even at some dark and sad moments, there is no background music.All the actors and actresses give a stellar performance. Good story, good acting, beautiful scene. My teacher once said ""Audience never cry for tragedy，but they will cry for good things.""Anyway, it's a powerful movie, highly recommended.PS: All the victims in Nanking Massacre deserve a serious apology from Japanese.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Christian Bale in Japanese-occupied China again,"I don't know whether or not you've heard about the Rape of Nanking, but everyone should know about it. Having captured the Chinese city, Japanese forces committed a near genocide against the population and devastated the city. Zhang Yimou's ""Jīnlíng Shísān Chāi"" (""The Flowers of War"" in English) focuses on a Nanking church where an American (Christian Bale) takes up residence and then must protect the inhabitants from the occupying forces. The inhabitants are the schoolgirls, and also a group of prostitutes. Eventually, everyone faces a moral dilemma.There are some very ugly scenes of the occupation. The Japanese occupation of China and Korea has never gotten the attention that the Nazi occupation of Europe has, but it was equally brutal (as was the Italian occupation of Ethiopia). The main focus here is on the events inside the church, but there is ample focus on the atrocities committed by the Japanese. The movie does a very good job in every way. It is always important to tell these stories so that they never happen again. I very much recommend the movie.PS: Bale had previously starred in Steven Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"", about a boy who gets separated from his parents in Japanese-occupied China. I also recommend that one.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Zhang's best work In 10 years,"Someone wrote and I quote : ""there was never a moment of this movie that will bring tears in someone's eyes"". Whomever wrote this is not Chinese for sure! I started crying right after 15 minutes in the cinema .This whole movie's dialog is in Nan Jing Hua (local accent mandarin ). Sounds funny at beginning , but it's more easy to bring audience into the story with characters . Zhangyimou's movie are famous for bright colors and nice view since he use to be cameraman. But this movie is so much more than the visual! Color still pretty though, the paper shop, those QiPao, girls make-up , everything is pretty . I guess to ruin the beautiful things defines the tragedy. My friend who watched it before told me do not watched it in the morning , because it will upset you whole day. So I went to cinema in the afternoon, and I could sleep until 5 am this morning. Comparing to Zhang Yi Mou's earlier work like "" hero"", this is definitely his best work in 10years!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Heroism Borne Out of Brutality,"I am not really familiar with the details of the Rape of Nanking in the late 1930s. However, people from this side of the globe are very familiar with the suffering brought about by the brutal Japanese Imperial Army throughout Asia. In our country, many movies have shown Japanese brutality during the World War II. I thought I would be ready for this movie.""The Flowers of War"" tells the story of a roguish American mortician John Miller (Christian Bale) who was sent to a Catholic church/convent in Nanking to prepare the body of the priest for burial, who was then under siege by the Japanese. When he gets there, he found he also needed to take care of a group of convent girls led by the spirited Shu, a young caretaker boy George, and later, a gaggle of exotic prostitutes led by the classy beauty Yu Mo (Ni Ni). Everyone will go through a touching life-changing story arc that will show how even the most unlikely of people can become heroes in extreme adversity.Director Zhang Jimou returns to form in this movie. He was relentless in the first half we are taken through a continuous barbaric carnage perpetrated by the Japanese soldiers. These parts are reminiscent of the frankly violent blood-spurting ""Saving Private Ryan"" beach scene. The terror is very palpable. While the scenes of soldiers being shot and killed were hard to watch, the several minutes of violence to children was even harder to bear!The second half is more dramatic with a some contrived cheesy moments. The character of the kind-hearted Japanese officer Hasegawa was a nice counter-balance to their other heinous acts of atrocity. I also felt the long sequence when a couple of prostitutes sneaking out to retrieve trivial things in their brothel was a rather unnecessary long detour. There will even be a scene that will remind you of Gwyneth Paltrow's body wrap scene in ""Shakespeare in Love."" However, when the film reaches its climax, everything falls back into place and the noble message is delivered on point. This movie may be difficult to watch because of the scenes of violence, but this is worth watching because the story of heroism and redemption was very good, well-told and well-executed.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful and almost great.,"The opening ten minutes is an amazing sequence that draws you into the streets of Nanking circa 1937. It's clear we are in the hands of a master director, with all the right elements in place, particularly the cinematography. The Chinese have been doing that part at least, better than anyone else for the past decade.So it's quite a surprise to see Christian Bale pop up, speaking English. He's a fine actor and one of the film's strengths though his dialog at times is a little too modern. His character is the centerpiece to the story and it's easy to see why he took the role. It's a solid story set in a maelstrom, most of the drama taking place inside a church, being the literal calm inside the tornado. There are a number of dilemmas which drive the action, the same as all films, yet the incidents that initiate several of these dilemmas feel forced and a little trite. To give more information would require a spoiler and I don't want to give anything away. It's a shame as the situations themselves are dramatically effective and with so many of the right elements in place, they let the film down. It's essentially sloppy writing. It feels lazy which lessens your empathy with certain characters. I'd give it an 8 if it weren't for that.Everything else works very well, the cast, the cinematography and direction as mentioned are the standouts, as well as some glorious sets. Some dialog scenes are too long and Bale's character transformation is a little too sudden and dramatic but the film will stay with you, hopefully encouraging you to research the background to the horror story that was the Nanking Massacre, its effects which still linger today.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Where does the comedy stop and the drama begin?,"Watched this movie last night in a packed Beijing cinema on its opening night. First off, I would like to say that Christian Bale traces perfectly the path of enlightenment that follows Wild-West style bandit obsessed with money becoming priest and father-figure in all but religious training. The film is in roughly 50% English, 35% Chinese and 15% Japanese, so there is a real assimilation of different languages and cultures coming together. However, this unfortunately leads to some moments which seem disconcertingly humorous. For example, there is one point where a Japanese general confesses to priest-figure Bale that he likes music; the triviality of such statement in the midst of mass-murder seems absurd enough, but it is also delivered in a dead-pan way with broken English. I could not help but burst out laughing, even though none of the Chinese in the cinema saw any form of humour in it. Indeed, I think that as a Westerner watching this film, my emotional response is not as visceral as it would be to a Chinese person. That is only natural, but it leads to a completely different interpretation of the movie. Some of the murder scenes are brutally horrific to a Chinese person, so much so that the wonderful filmography which permeates throughout the movie may not be fully appreciated. The hues are brown and green, earthy, rugged and militaristic for the most part. Yet there are occasionally beautiful trims of colour, the church's stained-glass window, the clothes on the washing line left out to dry. A sign, no doubt, of the beauty of humanity in the midst of dreadful war. It has been suggested this movie is propaganda. I don't know if I entirely agree with that. There is no positive way to spin what was a shameful event in Japan's history, and for what it's worth I think that Zhang Yimou delineates well the soldiers occasional insecurity, homesickness, and humanisation brought on by paranoia and pressure from above. A movie well-worth watching, and which I would like to watch for a second time to re- establish which moment are intentionally humorous, which moments are unintentionally humorous, and which moments are tragic. Kudos for Zhang Yimou for tackling such a visited topic (That of the Nanjing massacre) which a freshness, and even more kudos to Christian Bale for stepping up to the plate and giving in a great performance.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Extremely Affecting !,"This is like the Asian Holocaust under the evils of the Japanese during the Sino-Jap war. It will grip your heart, makes it ache and will show you why monstrosity knows no limits when certain elitist races or people (hello Hitler Germany) think they are above mankind. The more shocking and repulsive aspect is, till today, the Jap government has denied the atrocities committed in Nanking and attempted several times to rewrite their school history text books; failing only due to the constant protest of the Chinese government and the integrity of its own purist historians.An amazing movie with a brilliant Chinese cast, under the usual exceptional insightful direction of Zhang Yimou.

Art House Genocide,"The Chinese don't like the Japanese very much . In fact one of the few public demonstrations allowed in China is protests outside the Japanese embassy which are very frequent . The cause of this animosity if you didn't know was down to Japan's war of aggression against China in the 1930s and 40s which involved the same type of brutality the Nazis inflicted upon Eastern Europe . Take "" The Rape Of Nanking "" in 1937 which saw wholesale butchery and a death toll similar to the death rate seen in present day Iraq . Except this fatality rate in Iraq happened in eleven years of civil war while in Nanking this happened in six weeks and in one city . Multiply this by several thousand times and you can just fathom the hatred the Chinese still hold for the Japanese , not helped by a mainstream denial in Japan that none of this happenedOne thing THE FLOWERS OF WAR does do well is showing the brutality of the Japanese and the fear the Chinese civilian population have of their conquerers . The unfortunate thing is it doesn't do anything else very well . Watching it you get the feeling there is several artistic agendas going on such asWar porn that'll appeal to war film junkiesArt house cinema especially to those people who don't like war pornA Chinese version SCHINDLER'S LIST where a flawed human being saves the innocent from evilPeople who enjoyed the BATMAN reboot down to Christian BaleAll these aspects seem to get in the way of one another and cancel each other out which makes for a relatively unsatisfying epic movie .

A major misfire from both Bale and Zhang,"Famed Asian director Yimou Zhang's big budget version of the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 is one of the most baffling and tonally uneven films you ever likely to lay witness to. What we have here is a film that at one moment will be laughably comical and the next deadly serious (and rightfully so for events that occurred during this occupation were truly horrendous). It's also a movie that revels in frequent unbelievably bad character decisions and acts as a showcase for one of famed British thespian Christian Bale's worst screen performances.In a film filled with downright atrocious acting qualities and annoying character attributes Bale comes off worse in his role as unlikeable American John Miller. John is a man that whilst eventually doing good has a journey that is just unable to engage on a level that feels realistic. It's a thankless type of role for Bale but one senses that this was a real showy piece that failed to eventuate into anything outside of the Chinese market. The hardest thing to fathom about this picture is the fact that it should have been so ripe for a heart string pulling look at history.Much of the films failings must be befallen to director Zhang who seems more interested in framing a shot in slo-mo or have one of his character's stand near a multi-coloured glass mosaic for pretty lighting effects than actually focussing on the war that rages around them. It can't be overlooked in analysis also that for a film costing north of 90 million American dollars it's a slight event picture that rarely ventures out from the church in which the survivors of the invasion hold out in, which seems a wasted opportunity considering the stories just waiting to be told outside the churches gates.Obviously striking a chord in its country of origin (where it's one of China's highest grossing films of all time), viewers (who rate it a staggeringly high 7.5 on IMDb) and some industry experts (the film was nominated for Golden Globe) Flowers of War feels like a mighty misstep of a film upon watching now. Much time has passed since Flowers of War was on our big screens and judging by its barely there reputation now it's not hard to argue as to why many have forgotten about it entirely.1 impromptu wig out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",2.0,Anonymous,History

A film of exquisite beauty,"Exquisite. Easily one of the most beautiful films ever made.Moving, riveting, poetic, visually stunning, and dramatically gut wrenching.Absolutely everything you could ever want a movie to be.Poignant, poetic, full of beauty and life.Not without moments of sentimentality, perhaps even, briefly, bordering on the saccharine. Still only those hardest of heart would be unmoved by this visual and emotional banquet.If you are not moved by this film. You quite possibly may not be human.An incredible mix of beauty and tension. Eye-dropping cinematography, heart pounding action. Yet full of life, humour and folly. Plays directly to your heart strings and plucks every chord with virtuosity.In a just world this kind of film would be breaking box office records. But alas we prefer on mass to fix our eyes of adolescent spectacle. Consider how big the box office returns will be when Bale dons a bat suit this summer.It's funny how a human interest story recreating events in history can be of so little interest to so many humans, the very ones who create history. It seems we would much rather gaze in wonder at our fantasies than contemplate our actions.I urge anyone who loves cinema to see this film. It is a work of masterful craftsmanship.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Good setting, less good movie","Producing a movie about sensitive historic conflicts is always difficult, since views on the events are usually written from the point of view of the winners of the war or conflict. In this case, the Chinese victims of the horrible massacre at Nanking of 1937.On the other hand, the losing party (the Japanese in this case) might have difficulties admitting the brutalities and bestialities that happened. Coming to terms with the past is something rarely achieved by movies. Compare this with movies on the Holocaust: there are many, but very few of them capture the real horror. La Vita è Bella is just one example. Same for this movie.In this view, it is already an achievement to bring a ""Hollywood-style"" movie in cinemas about this topic. The horrors that happened are largely unknown to the greater public.However, the movie in itself was a bit of a disappointment. The dialogues were not well worked out. The multiple languages used in the movie (English, Japanese and Chinese) did not interact well, making the chemistry between the actors difficult.The actors did make an effort, although Christian Bale could have done a little more. The Japanese soldiers seemed like caricatures with little character development.The lack of chemistry affected the connection with the viewer. Many clues and scenes were just too obvious and overly predictable, and you never really feel like you're standing in Nanking.However, one good point is the use of light throughout the movie. Also, some scenes were surprisingly good, the battle scene in the beginning is just one example.So this movie is a nice one to watch if you like historical movies, but don't expect to be amazed.",6.0,Anonymous,History
best Zhang Yimou film in the past several years,"Watched ""The flowers of war"" on Dec 19, 2011, the 2nd day this film was released in mainland China. The movie theater is fully packed. This is the best film directed by Zhang Yimou after ""Hero"" in 2002. This is not a surprise because in my opinion all his films after ""Hero"" have very awful/terrible screen scripts, while this one is based on a well composed novel. The story is about how a dozen of prostitutes saved girl students from uncivilized Japanese soldiers during the Nanjing(Nanking) massacre period (starting from Dec. 13, 1937, lasted for two weeks, 300,000 murdered, 80,000 raped). To Chinese, this is the saddest and most humiliated moment in the 20th century. The script is not based on true stories, painfully the true stories are much worse, because there wasn't a savior, there's only constant desperation. The characters themselves are well described. The logic flow and mentality transition in this film are not delineated very well. I still gave it 8 out 10 because I think it's due to the limitation of the film's length. As always, Mr. Bale is good at acting in this film, but definitely not his best character such as those in ""American Psycho"" or ""The Prestige"". The two leading actresses are both new face. They'll become very famous in China after this film, but I don't think their performances are as impressive as Gong Li, who collaborated with Zhang Yimou in many of his early works. Last but not the least, there is a 1-minute romance scene which I think is the worst part in this film, because under such a tragic circumstance it's very unnatural to practice love, and it dampens the character build-up in many ways.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A beautiful but harrowing tale of Japans rape of Nanking,"The Flowers of War (2011) was a film Christian Bale squeezed into the space of The Fighter and The Dark Knight Rises, but have no doubt, this film comes close in terms of quality.The Flowers of war is a beautiful but harrowing tale of a Westerner who finds refuge with a group of women in a church during Japan's rape of Nanking in 1937. Posing as a priest, he attempts to lead the women to safety. During the 2 hours this film displays the horrors that were evident during Japan's rule of Nanking, and the fear and sadness it spread amongst the Chinese.Christian Bale plays a good performance and develops as a character from the start as a money directed man who has no intention of helping others without compensation. As John Miller (Bale) tries his best to direct the students to safety, he cannot stop the force of the Japanese.Yimou Zhang's direction in Flowers of War is 'spielbergian' in it's action scenes, and captures the scale of battle at a realistic level. The script for this film was mind blowingly good with fantastic dialogue that was true and heart draining at times. Without a doubt the dialogue is what makes this film so true and authentic. Flowers of War mixes action and character focus perfectly throughout the film without it getting corny. The audience slowly begins to side with John and believes in him, he's a hero, a saviour, some may say a man sent from God himself.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Not a bad film about WWII China, but not great either","First of all, this movie is very, very violent. War is shown in all its gritty reality. If you're sensitive to that sort of thing, I'd advise you not to watch this.The acting is mediocre. Christian Bale is always fun to watch, but this is far from his best work. He spends much of the film crying, which is understandable given the circumstances. The female lead's acting is very wooden. I wonder if she even understood her English lines.The special effects and sound are probably the best I've ever seen in a Chinese film.

A Great Movie,"It's a tearful experience. So 1937 was such a terror in that Eastern city, the capital of the Asian country. Lives were being destroyed and bodies piled high everywhere. People were in hiding from the Japanese soldiers and here were two groups of people, a group of school girls and a group of prostitutes, vying for a safe hiding place, when they were found by the Japanese invaders, it's death that awaits them...One wonders why they had to do this? Why? --because there was a war! Then why did Japan start the war? For what? This film made me think. It's obvious starting war is a shortcut to the destruction of humanity. The Japanese government has been denying there were 300,000 people killed during the Nanking massacre (well , they are not alone, similarly there are also those of holocaust denial). With that as a contemporary reality, it is a right thing to do to be reminded of this event with movies like this one, the Flowers of War, so that we could do all we can to prevent another war from coming.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Almost there but not quite,"I found the Christian Bale (one of my preferred actors) character role script a bit too stupid and out of place, as is as I found the soldier who revenge, Rambo style, the first Japanese incursion in the church really fun but unbelievable, even more in his last attempt.Don't get me wrong the movie tells a nice story about heroism where you least expect it, where least you can expect integrity and strong, but it really didn't engage me, because forced and flat. The movie tries to move and make you reflect, but it is really too simplistic. I mean, despite the fact that I am a person who is easily moved, this movie let me oddly imperturbable. The only chill on my back was in the final image that encompasses the, already understood, meaning.A couple scenes and message apart, it is a nice try, but some bad choices made of it not really a must-see movie.

Complete and utter rubbish,"Well, where to start on this one. What an execrable mess. This story loosely concerns an American neer-do-well who is inexplicably rambling around Nanking looking for a Church. This guy is apparently a mortician, but where he came from (has he turned up on the wrong film set?) and why he has chosen the middle of the rape and pillage of Nanking to do this is unclear. Inexplicably he seems unconcerned about the several hundred thousand other bodies lying around Nanking, he is fixated on attending to the body of a priest at this church. Given the movie later goes to great pains to show what a dirty rotten scoundrel he is, why he seems honour or duty bound to do this is unclear. It seems he is only doing it for the money but unless the pay for attending to a dead priest is several million dollars you would think he would have been better off staying in his hotel room. While Chinese civilians are being slaughtered left and right our hero is luckily found by the only Japanese soldier that does not shoot people. And luckily, for no apparent reason, a wall falls on this soldier. And luckily, out of the half million people in Nanking he could meet, he comes across 2 girls from the very church he wants to go to. What a guy. Meanwhile a group of girls are fleeing from something - apparently they were out having a picnic when the Japanese inconsiderately decided to attack. A young Chinese man insists on counting them every 10 seconds. Also meanwhile a certain General Li is out there with his men, in the way that Generals always are, right? A soldier says to him something like ""General, we must go, everyone else has gone"" but our heroic general is made of sterner stuff. Another group of civilians is being pursued by Japanese troops, but inexplicably, the Japanese don't shoot at them. We see ridiculous CGI shots of bullets tearing through people, an overhead shot of a ridiculously unreal exploding tank....and on, and on and on.All of this in the first 3 minutes, by which time I was shaking my head in disbelief and started reading a book. I lasted through about 20 minutes before I switched it off. Kudos to those that can sit through more of this debacle.I don't suppose you can blame Christian Bale. I guess he used the script he was given and ""acted"" the way he was told to. I guess he was made an offer he couldn't refuse, took the money and ran.It goes without saying that the Rape of Nanking was a horrific event that everyone should know about and remember. However to use these events as period backdrop to such a ridiculous little pot boiler is shameless exploitation.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Not easy to stomach but a must see,"One of my favorite directors does it again... He creates an emotional roller-coaster that leaves you in shambles when it's over. Beautifully horrific.I want to point out a very interesting thing and the reason I'm writing these comments. I just read Roger Eberts review and I must say that it offended me. Mr. Ebert used to be the the very best at what he did. The one to go to for determining if you did or didn't want to see a movie. I respected his opinions. Yet... Recently, he's lost it. Yes he's been through a lot with his current health and I wish him all the best with this. Regardless, his perception of film has obviously slipped away. Firstly, for this film he missed the fact that Christian Bales character is NOT a priest. He is a MORTICIAN. This is IMPORTANT! A mortician and a man of god are two totally different things and this is critical in understanding the path his character takes (spiritually). He also mentions over and over that a ""westerner"" is wasted on the story and that a Chinese priest would have been more appropriate. DID HE WATCH THE MOVIE??? It's the fact that he's a westerner that keeps the Japanese from killing him in the very beginning! If he were Chinese, he would be the ENEMY! Just like the previous priest.I'm done preaching from my soap box. Forgive me, but when critics are hard on movies and miss the boat, it frustrates me.This is a truly disturbing film and at the same time, it's beautiful. Give it a chance, and trust the storyteller.

a bore-to-death old formatted Chinese movie,"highly expected but then it turned out just flat and boring. we, my  wife and i, never got connected with this pathetically written and  directed movie. for those who played in this movie, i couldn't blame  them did poor jobs since the screenplay, the dialog, the directing  failed to get them connected with the emotion and sentiment that should  be there in this worthless story written by a Chinese female author who  lives in America. there were moments that we all felt the dialog in  this film sounded like translated Chinese. from the very beginning, the  plot already showed its shallowness and contrite of the formulaic way  how the Chinese would make the battle scenes against the marching  winning Japanese military force. there were typical formatted dialog  and scenes that the Chinese communist party would use as a MUST to  describe the kmt party and its army were not enthusiastic to fight  against the Japanese, that's so typical way to fool their own people by  claiming the communist insurgents were the only Chinese who loved their  country, their people and they were the only party that fought the  Japanese. yet the truth was already widely known to the world outside  china, the communist insurgent force rarely engaged to fight the  Japanese but only ambushed the kmt national army whenever they could.  they were just fighting gorilla war against their own people and let  the kmt led army to fight the war. it's just so contrive and disgusting  to hear the similar dialog in every movie out of communinit china that  they were the only people who cared about china's future, they were the  liberator of china, the only hope for the Chinese people. but in the  meantime, soldiers who stayed and sacrificed their lives in this movie  were those from the kmt army, they were the only people who stayed and  fought in vain to stop the Japanese invasion forces.  by mentioning this historical fact, it also reminded me that the  governing Chinese communist party just announced to ban most of the  historical genre dramas related to any former dynasty, because those  dramas only mirror imaged and embarrassed the current regime, not just  on a par with all the corruptions in Chinese history but surpassed them  thousand times.  the other thing that made me feel that in this film, the Chinese women,  young female catholic students or the Chinese prostitutes, they were  just so pathetic in this movie. their country was in turmoil and their  country people were killed by the Japanese, but these women were still  so ridiculously looked down upon each other, they fought their own  worthless social class turf war in a church surrounded by the invasion  Japanese force, even the usage of a toilet got a social taboo.   director zhang seemed to be non-exist in this film, just let the  lifeless storyline to pan out without any personal touch. by signing  c.b. and asked him to play a role in this movie also proved to be  meaningless but wasted a lot money.  from the very beginning of this movie, i never got a chance to get  connected with any character in this pathetic movie. what i got were:  boring storyline, boring scenario, boring characters, boring historical  background, boring directing. there was nothing like watching similar  movies about Jewish people were massacred by the Nazis, absolutely  nothing worthwhile to watching. there was absolutely no emotional or  sentimental sadness this movie ever touched us.",,Anonymous,History

Quietly stirring and immensely poignant drama of unlikely heroism and self-sacrificial love,"Because foreign commentators have not accorded the appropriate significance to the subject of the Japanese occupation of Nanking, there is a certain amount of righteous indignation whenever it is raised amongst the Chinese, whose ancestors had suffered at the hands of the Nippon invaders way back in 1937.It is therefore quite impossible to expect objectivity from any Chinese treatment on the subject- even if it is from internationally acclaimed director and the once-infant terrible of Chinese cinema Zhang Yimou- so the best one can hope for is subtlety, with Lu Chuan's earlier box- office hit 'City of Life and Death' being an excellent example. Fortunately therefore, though Zhang Yimou's take begins on an overtly jingoistic slant, it eventually settles for a nuanced approach that exudes the very humanity at the heart of Yan Geling's story, becoming a moving and poignant account of heroism and self-sacrifice.Opening with the first of just two battle sequences throughout the whole film, Yimou starts off emphasising the heroism of the Chinese soldiers who were outnumbered and outgunned by the invading Japanese troops. Amidst the blatant chest-thumping is a pair of convent girls trying to get back to the safety of their Catholic church, as well as an American mortician John Miller (Christian Bale) sent to attend to the last rites of the recently deceased parish priest. While the church's boy warden George (Huang Tianyuan) and the dozen schoolgirls under his care think that Miller could be their way out of the city, he turns out to be anything but- well at least in the beginning.Content to remain nonchalant to the plight of the girls, Miller instead binges on the communion wine supply in the church's basement and ransacks the church for any money left as payment for his services. Better still, when some 13 ladies from the local brothels seek shelter at the church, he welcomes them as if elated at the prospect of his own personal harem. But transformation is at the heart of Yimou's tale, and even though you know that by the end of the story Miller will rise to the occasion to save the girls, the path to that dramatic character turn is still deeply affecting.Kudos to Liu Heng's elegant screen writing, whose collaboration with Yimou goes as far back as the latter's 'Ju Dou', for crafting a moving character arc for Miller- beginning with an act of admirable courage when Miller puts on the priestly robes one day in a bid to stymie the Japanese from forcing themselves on the underage schoolgirls. Ever so delicately, the movie charts his change of heart from a once self- centred opportunist to a Fatherly figure looking after both the convent girls and the courtesans and eventually turning into a saviour for the former.Just as skilfully, Yimou also charts the transformation of both groups of ladies. At the crux of it is a truly outstanding act of self- sacrifice on the part of the courtesans, as their egocentricity slowly but surely gives way to empathy and culminates in an extraordinary gesture of courage. We won't spoil this plot point for you- suffice to say that Yimou handles it with beautiful restraint, and what could easily have been maudlin melodrama is instead cast as an uplifting testament of the common bonds of humanity that unite us all despite our social backgrounds.Yimou's adroit storytelling is complemented with the stirring performances of a top-notch cast. Christian Bale is perfectly cast, his usual understated but no less powerful acting creating a compelling character in Miller. It also enables him to blend in nicely with the rest of the massive ensemble, despite being the lone Westerner in a cast of Asians. Refusing to monopolise attention on himself or his character, he too strikes up great chemistry with his co-stars Tianyuan and newcomer Ni Ni- the latter of which steals the show with her luminous portrayal of Yu Mo, the pseudo-leader of the courtesans whose radiant beauty masks an equally sharp mind.Evocative too is d.p. Zhao Xiaoding's cinematography, which avidly captures both the sobering horrors of war as well as the cautious moments of quiet optimism between the girls. In particular,mXiaoding also uses the convent's stained glass as a nice recurring motif to signal the omnipresence of God despite the atrocities and bleakness. And despite boasting none of the gaudy excesses of Yimou's previous big- budget extravaganzas (a la 'Curse of the Golden Flower'), production designer Yohei Tanada deserves credit for the visually intricate designs of both the cathedral as well as the war-torn streets of Nanking.Nonetheless, what will likely resonate most at the end of the day are the film's twin messages of courage in the face of fear and humanity in the face of atrocity. Yimou's confident direction also makes for a multi-faceted movie that offers various perspectives on the war through its myriad characters, while placing Miller, Yu Mo and a thirteen-year old convent girl Shu (Zhang Xinyi) at the heart of it. Don't be deterred by its grim subject matter, or its partiality to the matter- just as its title suggests, there is beauty to be found in the unlikeliest of places, and in spite of the inevitable scenes of heartbreak and despair, it is a quietly stirring and deeply poignant drama of self-sacrificial love, especially meaningful with the impending occasion of Good Friday as a reminder of this highest form of love.www.moviexclusive.com",8.0,Anonymous,History
Flowers Indeed,"A mortician called to a church in war torn Nanking finds a group of teenage girls, along with one teenage boy, who are alone, scared and trying to stay alive. Not long after his arrival, a group of ladies from the red light district find their way into the church while seeking safety and shelter. The Japanese soldiers are never too far away and all too eager to violate young girls. The mortician starts out as an unlikeable character, he soon has a change of heart and sets out to try and help the group find their way out of Nanking.This is a good movie. I think that it showed the atrocities of war without being too graphic even in the most brutal of moments. There is a bit of a romantic angle playing out but it is mainly a wartime drama.My disappointment was in wanting more from the ending. I also wished there had been more suspense in the film.

A perfectly balanced movie that hits a target,"This movie sends a very acute message into the heads of any viewer and that is, why hasn't this movie been shown to everybody?!? This movie shows a tragedy that has scared humanity in such a sophisticated way that it is disturbingly captivating.The cast gives this movie a depth that without them would of been another cheesy action gore movie. The young girls show emotion and sadness in a way that seems to penetrate the heart in such a bold way.

The plot sounds very dramatic and tense...the movie just...isn't,"A tremendously important topic. A story incredible as it is brutal...disparaged by the terrible approach taken by the writers and the director.Instead of witnessing an unimaginable horror that Nanjing massacre victims experienced, and in case of lucky ones, survived to be tormented by their whole lives by...end perhaps engaged in nail biting drama of a desperate fight for moral and physical survival...we get a ridiculously slow burning mix of saccharine love story with distinctly Chinese cinematic/theatric flavour to it and awkwardly surreal Marvel-ish action sequences, also a prominent feature of Chinese action flicks. For a whopping 146min!The weirdly narrator or announcer like dialogue that might work in Asian languages or cinema, translates as really artificial and 'on the nose' here. The characters thus come off as ridiculously caricaturised. At the same time the topics that should be the focus of the story - aren't.The film follows an unlikely hero (Bale) stumbling upon a group of girls in a Catholic church in the middle of the Japanese occupation and utter destruction of Nanking. Seemingly immoral and corrupt, Bale's character will end up getting involved into an attempt to save the girls, joined by a group of prostitutes, from the nightmare of Nanking.The premise seems alright, even if fictional. But the execution is not quite. The film is nowhere nearly dramatic as the plot outline.It starts of with this prolonged action sequence that in times looks quite nice, before it dissolves into overly dramatic, nonsensically unrealistic, slow motion infested festival of video game tropes. But alas...the sequence ends with the protagonist, an American coroner on a mission to bury a deceased priest in a local Catholic church, barely escaping mayhem and reaching the church, where a puzzled and petrified group of schoolgirls and one orphan boy turned pastor greet him. They are, despite their unwillingness, joined by a group of prostitutes who escaped the Japanese invaders in the most unrealistic of ways. The best part of the film is thus over.For the remaining 2+hrs we don't get a sense of real endangerment of this little oasis of peace in what was supposed to be a horrific place of one of the worst war crimes of WWII. Apart from a single attack of Japanese soldiers and two appearances of awkward yet tame Imperial Japanese officer, nothing really happens. So much so that the plot needed two characters to suddenly decide on a most ludacrous move in order for the audience to (finally) be exposed to Japanese cruelty.The climax of the film is anything but. Even if on paper it was supposed to be the most dramatic part of the film it is anything but. So much tears and melodrama and the never ending buildup to...a 30 second absolutely zero tension, anticlimactic resolution that left me feeling tricked. I'm grateful I didn't reach for the glass of water otherwise I would've missed the entire thing.What a shame.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Go see it,"I am a Chinese. But I have to admit that I am neither a big fan of Zhang nor of the Chinese cinematography. Except for few excellent works, I found the recent Chinese film industry willingly or unwillingly distances itself from the audience, by making Hollywood-style, big budget, all-star cast, but empty-content and cliché-plot movies. Where are the Chinese movie makers' ideas? Why did they give up finding stories in Chinese history and instead they chase some intangible sci-fis to burn some money? Nan Jing is always a sad place to visit and its history during the sino-jp war is forever a scar in the Chinese. For Jp, an industrialized great power that even beat Russia once, must realize that a fast complete annexation of China is nearly impossible, the huge resistance and a large area of territory that China possessed was way out of Jp capacity. The astronomical Chinese manpower would outrun every Jp technological advantage and eventually turn the table. So the Jp did one thing they could think of - instill fear and horror in the Chinese and wear their resistance down. War crimes - killing, looting and raping could do that and the Jp wanted double of it to get the effect. It is imaginable that the Jp army on one hand would officially blame such behaviors (because of their culture of being respectful and polite) and on the other hand closed one eye for them, perhaps even promoted and encouraged them.That was Jp. Chinese, they were victims. Period.An American in China at that time kind of enjoyed immunity from the brutality and had a neutral status.So these summarized the positions of all people in the film. I can speak for myself, even though I tried to contain my reaction during the viewing I still have been hit head-on by the emotion. It is Chinese Schindler's list. In this case however, those women were more the ""Schindlers"" than Bale's John don't you think, although John also did a great humanitarian deed.Pros of the film. I think first is the story itself. A moving story of those women and girls, a realistic account of the jp war crime and a faithful reflection of the fear during the war. True, some of the elements in the plot are predictable, but not the ending of it. At the end of the day, this work is a movie, and a movie needs something unpredictable out of cliché or Hollywood.Also, the structure of the film is very ideal. Enough time is given to elaborate on the sub-stories, although in my opinion, the ending bit can still be more elaborate.The characters are also very ""human"". They were quite free of the stereotype Chinese film mindset here, which I think is the second good thing about this film. To name two things about that ""free of stereotype"", they showed self-preservation, the girls, the women, Mr Meng and more importantly, John all have it. You know, self-preservation is generally considered as selfishness and one of the personality weakness according to the modern Chinese ideology, which promote the collective greater good is above individual well-being. Being self-preserved at that time is frequently associated with being traitor. And you can expect, self-preservation is rarely seen in Chinese films about sino-jp war. That, in my opinion, is one of the distances I mentioned earlier that the Chinese movie makers created in their ""patriotically educational"" movies. That is simply not very ""human"". But I can find it here and that adds up to the credibility of the account.The second one was the women group itself. They are, because of their profession, always depicted as no soul, no feeling, full of vanity and selfish in Chinese culture, and more, they were non-political. This story also quoted one of the mostly quoted Chinese poems in the end to remind us of that last point. The catch of this film is to challenge that opinion. Like in the La Dame aux camélias, they have emotions, human feelings like you and me, ""they love and hate"". It is overkill to discuss whether they should be patriotic and do something about the war. Simply being themselves (OK, in the film, acting like ones), they can convince the rest of us already.Second, the acting. Christian Bale, in my opinion, is getting better and better since his Batman the Legend begins. True, Liam Neeson is still THE Schindler. But Bale has his shot. John's submission in front of the Jp is very well portrayed by Bale's hard but meanwhile sad face. And Bale also has the eyes to tell those stories when he tried to cover up those women's imminent ""going to hell"" event before the girls. In comparison to the similar looking Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who also associates himself with sino-culture, I think I prefer Bale's a little darker and sadder presence.The women, they deserved three hurra both for their characters and for their acting. A piece of information, the Chinese generally considers women from the vicinity of Shanghai are ""mean"". I am not saying this is true, but it adds to their characters when I looked at them. They were really mean sometimes weren't they? If you think so too, you should realize what these 12 actress have done to you : )OK, some minor cons. Yes, the girls and women played their parts well when the horror kicks in. But remember those scenes from Schindler's list? The trembling teeth of the Jewish youth, the little girl in the s* hole, those widely open eyes in the shower room. Few can convey fear in films like Spielberg. Zhang here is on the right track in the right direction, but not yet close.Also, the young actors and actresses are promising, but still have room to perfect their skill. The depiction of fear, again, still showed some artificiality.Go see it!",9.0,Anonymous,History

A Beautiful Albeit Light Portrayal of The Most Brutal Atrocity in WWII,"Zhang YiMou, through The Flowers of War, made more people aware of a shameful moment in our history. I am surprised at how a gruesome subject was done so beautifully. If anything, Zhang's movie respected well-documented historical facts. But I agree with New York Times critic Mike Hale that Zhang danced around too light, somewhat trivializing the actual gruesomeness. Perhaps Zhang is taking into consideration that average movie goers unfamiliar with that part of history may be too disturbed by the actual level of brutality far worse than what's portrayed in the movie. His worries seem well justified as a good segment of the audience thought even Zhang's light-touched portrayal was too gruesome to be real, therefore a piece of propaganda.Some people went as far as quoting very low post-massacre rape pregnancy/birth rate (vs. Nazi data) as evidence that the Rape of Nanking didn't happen, oblivious of the fact that the civilian population of Nanking was WIPED out by the Japanese. The women who were raped were then killed, with very few lucky exceptions. Dead women can't confirm pregnancy or give birth. The low post-rape birth number shows the Japanese brutality well-surpassed Nazi's.Even as the Japanese WWII veterans went to Nanking to kneel in public for days, repenting for atrocities committed, there are plenty outsiders who simply want or need to deny Nanking Massacre despite clear historical evidence. The Japanese government went as far as rewriting/white-wash WWII history with regard to its brutal invasion and occupation of Asian nations.If German government acted anything like the Japanese in denying history, then the Holocaust NEVER happened.If you dislike China, its communist government, or this movie, if you simply love Japan, that's all fine. But please have the decency to respect facts and history. For making a part of history come to our awareness in such an artistic way, I applaud Zhang YiMou.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Plots,"The only thing I have to say for those of you who like the film is that you people need to watch more movies, other than the special effects, this movie has no highlight.

The movie is based on a book written by an Chinese American author, which you might even catch it from the religious symbols, sentimental Japanese officer, there is a reason behind every detail.And to answer the Bei Jing girl, yes foreigners did save some Chinese, but for more purposes than just benevolent risk taking. There are Japanese who have saved more Chinese for that matter, they offered citizenship and safety to stronger Chinese and Koreans before and during the invasion. If this movie is touchy for you, sorry you only get this much exposure to rationalized fictions, you will find many of these type of stories on American shelves.I love how every time China makes a film or series on Imperial Japan, white people are instantly presumed as allies. The truth was, nobody was on our side, the only few people that got saved got documented and given credit to all foreigners. Lets not forget that it was the British and French that first launched war against us, and set up ""temporary"" colonization in China. IMO, Japan wanted a stronger Asian race, that they took that idea in the wrong way and scarred the inner struggle between all Asians for all history.",7.0,Anonymous,History

This movie has the most whorephobic depiction of sex workers ever: it's the worst kind of whorephobia that masquerades as compassion for prostitutes, all the while pissing all over them.The hookers must wake up extra-early every morning to put on all that makeup and iron their hair into perfect curls, IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR - because naturally, hookers all just wake up looking like porcelain dolls, and would actually need the help of a MORTICIAN to restore a plain-faced innocence: the just-prayed, nunnery look that all hookers secretly crave.Right before they sacrifice themselves - that's when hookers are most sympathetic: when they're about to die. The only thing I learned from this movie is that rape is the only heroic redemption for being a sex worker. All the courtesans are portrayed as dumb, selfish, greedy, cowardly bitches, except for the trafficking victim who was raped at age 13. She's good because she was ""never meant to be that kind of a girl."" And because she reads. Whoa! Imagine a hooker who reads. Blows my mind.I can't think of a worse movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen a lot of movies.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A story about the enduring nature of the human spirit!,"Director Yimou Zhang scores a perfect 10! For someone who is known for the action- choreography in his movies (such as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers""), Zhang keeps the viewer riveted to the seat through the first 30 minutes or so when Japanese forces run through Chinese the city of Nanking, unleashing mayhem and violence.The framing and editing work in tandem to create stunning visuals that convey both the widespread destruction due to the heavy artillery, as well as the intense pain and angst of those hit. I could not help but get reminded of movies like Full Metal Jacket (1987), Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line (1998).The scene where young Chinese soldiers run in an ""in-line"" formation towards an advancing Japanese tank, with the hope that the last man in the formation, who is a human-bomb, will get close enough to the tank and immobilize it, is outstanding. This perhaps captures the essence of the story - which is displayed through out the movie by many of its characters - the enduring nature of the human spirit. The lone surviving Chinese soldier forsaking the safety offered by a convent of nuns and going back to take on the well-armed invaders; the decision of the prostitutes to stand-in for the young and adolescent nuns who are called into the Japanese garrison for a ""performance"" at a celebration party and the young errand-boy at the nunnery making the choice to step in as a substitute to make up for the count for the choir are some great moments.Zhang gets Christian Bale to show his slow but complete transformation from being a drunken mortician with hedonistic leanings to a determined man who sees the protection of the innocent victims (nuns, prostitutes and the young boy) as his calling.The violence and gore notwithstanding, this movie is one emotional roller-coaster that is sure to make you take a pause and think about the casualties of war and the power of keeping up hope when in despair.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Heartbracking  experience,"I admit it took me 3 or 4 times to go watch this movie but I tell you it was worth every penny. I kind of misjudge it because I thought that a drama/thriller about the Japanese invasion over China together with a priest from USA would only show how good are the Americans and how can they save everyday. But it was definitely not like this. Although Bale looks to be the main actor I definitely think that Ni Ni ( Yu Mo ) - this Chinese new actress - on top judging her splendid performance. Regarding the story I think it is flawless and this movie can easily be considered an epic one. The colors of war, the drama of the innocent children, the sacrifice of the ""big sisters"", the cruelty and the low honor of the Japanese soldiers are so intense that it keeps your heart beating as if you were running for an Olympic medal. There is no honor in war, what the Japanese did to the Chinese, in my opinion, it easily tops Hitler or Stalin's behavior towards Lewis people and Russians. Their goal was not only to conquer and to make the enemy capitulate but also to rape every single women soul regarding age and I think that should be one of the things that separate us from the animals; even some animals are smarter than that. On the other hand Bale is playing a perfect role of an undecided man. I mean he's definitely not the hero figure, he's not the ""Bruce Willis"" kind of character or even Oscar Schindler ( remember the one who saved Jews from extermination with his factory ). He has to choose between what's better for him or what's better for some strangers and his decision together with Ni Ni's perfect play as an escort lady adds the perfect dose of romanticism in times of desperation and lack of self confidence. I rate this movie 9 out of then and I tell you that even if you are not a drama fan this will let a good mark in your head.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Touching war piece,"The Flowers of War tells a tale of survival, war time brutality, sacrifice and hope shining from within even the most unlikely source. It tells the tale of John Miller (Christian Bale) and the girls and women he helped to protect and hide during the Japanese attack on Nanking in 1937. Loosely based on real events, it's a movie that's sure to elicit some emotions.First of all, to the movie's credit, it at least attempts to rise above taking sides. It shows that there exists good in both sides, but it also doesn't shy away from the atrocities committed by both of them. Ultimately it's a tale one's willingness to do the right thing even at the expense of one's own life and safety.The film's directed by Zhang Yimou, of House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower fame, so you can bet that the production values are top notch. The actors are also very talented, and not just Bale. Ni Ni, playing the role of a prostitute Yu Mo, received a lot of praise for her performance, and deservedly so.In the end it's hard to say more without spoiling the experience. The Flowers of War is a very good war movie told from the point of view of a survivor. It's quite brutal and straight, but it also shines a light on the best sides of humanity. Worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Nutshell Review: The Flowers of War,"The lead is of course Christian Bale, starring in what would be his first Chinese production, and a major one at that, that both sides can claim a coup, one in having a major Hollywood star be at the centre of one of the most tumultuous times in Chinese history, and the other getting involved in a production that brings him back in touch with his Empire of the Sun days in telling a tale set during World War II. Nanking has always been at the centre of controversy for the Japanese's refusal to admit to the atrocities committed and to downplay the number of casualties involved, and this has led to numerous films from documentaries to Lu Chuan's excellent City of Life and Death to have dealt with the pain and suffering by the Chinese during the Japanese invasion and occupation thereafter.The central character to Zhang Yimou's Nanking tale happens to be a young schoolgirl by the name of Shujuan (Zhang Xinyi), escaping from the soldiers who have come to occupy the city, and seeking refuge at their own church and convent school. She narrates the entire tale as seen through her eyes and experience, and naturally she, and her teenage friends, are targets of the soldiers in their lust, pillage and plunder. But the priest of her church had died, and in his place is a fellow teenage caretaker (Huang Tianyuan) entrusted to protect the schoolgirls, who would have been at wits end if not for the timely arrival of mortician John Miller (Bale), caught up in the city and refusing to leave unless being paid for his trip and unwanted services.Hiding in the same convent happen to be a group of prostitutes from a famed brothel in Nanking, who were promised safe passage and a hiding place within the confines of the church since it's owned by Westerners, and this forces a faction of sorts to emerge amongst John, who sees impersonating a priest to his advantage, the group of working girls, and the convent girls who see the former group as immoral and undeserving to be sharing their hiding place and scarce resources. If anything, this also becomes John's story in keeping things harmonious amongst the groups, and finding it within himself to hold the key to everyone's survival as much as he can, given he's a foreigner and by and large having whatever little influence to keep the Japanese at bay, which is right outside the gated courtyard.Nanking atrocities have been told countless of times through various mediums and through film, and Zhang had probably decided not to overdo, or overly place a focus on the atrocities committed by soldiers, which becomes tempting to focus on the plenty of blood, gore and of course the much talked about sexual violence against the womenfolk in the city, whatever their age. Rather it's a very distinct three separate acts he adopts that provided different focus each, and that had worked while keeping the narrative keenly on target to dwell on the titular characters. Since the tale started with the invasion of the city, Zhang Yimou sees opportunity in presenting a mini war action film, that deals with one small squad's, and then one Captain's, relentless fight against impossible odds to keep the convent girls safe from harm.Then it became John's story-arc in his transformation from uncaring drunkard with his skirt- chasing ways, to a man finally woken to the harsh realities of war, and the atrocities that are being committed from right under his nose should he choose to be passive, stand around and watch, or better yet, escape when being presented a chance to do so. And knowing that their prolonged stay at the church isn't a long term plan, his responsibility laid in getting an unused truck working again for their collective escape, as well as to figure out a way to save the young girls from their summons to the Japanese Imperial Army HQ where a cruel, expected fate awaits, giving rise to the notion that there's no such thing as a free lunch / freedom, but a peace enjoyed that had to be repaid many times over. Bale got to exercise his Mandarin again, which is nothing new to the actor, although here his attempts were confined and limited to keywords rather than phrases, communicating with the schoolgirls, and Yu Mo (Ni Ni) the prettiest amongst the working girls, using English since they have been schooled in a convent.Unlike most Nanking films, Zhang Yimou's film, based upon the novel by Yan Geling, chooses to focus on what would be a great escape, and a singular primary challenge that everyone had to overcome through sheer wit with death as a possible outcome, that makes the film really moving when it broaches the theme about sacrifice. The director's works are commercial fare and accessible compared to his earlier works, and The Flowers of War prove to be no different in offering a big budgeted tale about one of humankind's darkest period in our history. A recommended must watch, although not in the same vein as City of Life and Death which had a more holistic view of the initial days of the Nanking invasion.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"The Flowers of War is a unique and polished addition to the war genre, though a few flaws keep it from achieving greatness","I recently rewatched The Flowers of War (2011) on Tubi. The storyline is set in 1930s China during the Japanese invasion. An American, disguised as a priest, hides out in a church where he discovers concubines and children seeking refuge. He maintains his disguise while trying to find a way to get everyone to safety and away from the war.Directed by Yimou Zhang (Hero), the film stars Christian Bale (American Psycho), Ni Ni (Lost in the Stars), Xinyi Zhang (Better Days), Chun Li (Guilty of Mind), Paul Schneider (Lars and the Real Girl), and Dawei Tong (Red Cliff).This is a unique war movie with a fascinating storyline and somber circumstances. The shootouts and violence are intense, and the scenes depicting women and children being harmed are a harsh but realistic portrayal of war's brutality. The action scenes are top-notch, with realistic explosions and shootouts. The plot is unpredictable, featuring smart twists and turns and a realistic conclusion. However, the acting is hit or miss, with Bale overacting at times, which detracts from the authenticity of his performance. It isn't his best work. The cinematography is polished and clean, making the film visually appealing.In conclusion, The Flowers of War is a unique and polished addition to the war genre, though a few flaws keep it from achieving greatness. I would score it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A tale of tragedy, sacrifice and hope","This Zhang Yimou movie on the Rape of Nanking starts off unevenly, but thankfully, everything begins to fall into place by the halfway mark. At first, it is hard to care about the characters, as they are not introduced properly. However, we get to know each of them as the story slowly unfolds and, towards the end, one might even be choking back some tears. The acting is superb throughout. Christian Bale's casting is meaningful because his first movie was Empire of the Sun, which was also about the Japanese invasion of China. In the space of 25 years, we see him at the beginning of his career in master-director Spielberg's Empire, and as a seasoned actor in master-director Zhang's Flowers. The film is beautifully shot, and the music score also features solos by Joshua Bell. Suffice to say, production values are top notch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent depiction of the horrors of humanity, war and brutality!","This is a masterful portrayal of wartime horrors, told through the eyes of a young girl (for the most part). The images and story shown in the movie are beautifully haunting as I found myself thinking about it even two days after my initial viewing.This story chronicles the lives and actions of a number of people over what appeared to be less than a week: a young commander of the last group of Chinese soldiers left in Nanjing after Japanese occupation, a drifter American mortician, a group of school girls living in a Catholic convent, a Catholic alter boy who was left in charge of the girls, one of the girl's father, a group of prostitutes, a Japanese commander, and Japanese soldiers.Unlike what a lot of critics believe, this story does not have a real protagonist nor a single hero. Rather, the survival of a few is due to the actions of many. This is what set the movie apart from its contemporaries.Aside from the beautiful footages, I have to say the acting in this movie was SUPERB. The writing and direction is also excellent. It is very rare that the English dialogue in a Chinese movie sound believable. This is one such rare case. Christian Bale is excellent as usual, as a conflicted man with a conscience who is stuck in an awful situation (which is, like how he said once in the film, ""a terrible joke""). The depiction of humanity and despair by the child actors were beautifully done. The dedication, courage and determination of the soldiers and of George the altar boy was nothing short of inspiring, and I could not help but to cry for their hopeless situation. Finally, the prostitutes were beautiful, sassy and human; I found myself thinking about them like Shu did at the end and wondering what had happened to them.It's hard to believe that for most of the Chinese actors, this is their one of their first acting job.A few things struck me as refreshing and intriguing: - The homesick Japanese commander who played a folk song (to which his second in command hummed along outside). It was said by the director that this was added intentionally to add dimension to the Japanese characters. This was very nicely done as it's rare for war films to depict enemies to embody any sympathetic qualities (exception: Letters from Iwo Jima). During the war, some Japanese soldiers were discouraged from feeling homesick by being encouraged to rape, pillage and murder. - The fleeting love between John and Mo was heartbreaking. - The very bittersweet ending. We could hope for the best but a google search on ""comfort women"" says otherwise. - I really like that this movie has little to no loopholes and that all the characters, saved for a few, had redeeming qualities that made them human.Also, two things to note: - Nanjing, as the ancient capital of China, was home to many universities, expats and missionaries in the 1930's. Many people in Nanjing who were exposed to these places and people were capable of conversational English. This was explained in the movie so I found it believable because only the children (e.g., Shu, George, Mo, Shu's dad – who's a translator) who grew up in convents knew English but those who did not (e.g., Major Li, the rest of the prostitutes and the Japanese soldiers). - Roger Ebert was upset that John was a Caucasian priest whereas a Chinese priest should have been casted. Yeah, thanks Roger Ebert, try opening a history book next time. At that time, missionaries from the West were very common in China and westerner was given special treatment by the Japanese (who more or less saw all Chinese people as beneath them). There were many instances of Westerners using their status to help the Chinese people. This is a fact.The rape and carnage depicted in this story is horrific. But sadly, it is actually just a small example of what actually happened in December, 1937 in Nanjing (if you are interested, Google Image: Nanjing 1937. Caution: very graphic images.). I suspect most of the critics of this movie have never heard of the horrendous brutality of the Nanjing (Nanking) Massacre. It's a shame because up to 300,000 people died in Nanjing during the events depicted in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"This is a pretty good movie, which is frustrating because it could have been great","It's an incredibly moving story of human perseverance and redemption, set in one of the darkest moments in human history. The cinematography is great. The characters are compelling. The acting is superb, not just the leads Christian Bale and Ni Ni, but I was particularly impressed by Huang Tianyuan, who gave an incredible performance as the deceased priest's adopted son.This movie had every reason to go down in history as an all-time great, but Zhang Yimou pulled his punches in two major ways:First: he did not force the emotional impact of the Nanjing Massacre. There were some sad scenes to be certain, but it's not until later in the movie and the impact is softened by some immediate karmic justice inflicted on some of the perpetrators. The near-superhuman feats of Major Li to defend the girls further distract from the brutality of the Japanese occupation, and the hopeless plight of the Chinese. As a result, the emotional impact of the situation is dampened. For those unaware of the actual history, the film may not leave a real impression.Secondly (Potential spoilers ahead): The sex scene between Yu Mo and John Miller takes a lot of the impact out of both of their character arcs (not to mention, given this film's subject matter, it certainly seems inappropriate for it to devolve into a romance). It is not out of character, per se, but distracts from the otherwise profound development that both of them go through as characters. For Yu Mo, it does not directly detract from the bravery of her actions, but narratively speaking, it transforms her role in the story into simply a reward for John Miller doing the right thing. Her character arc seems to be her evolution from a prostitute and sex object into a heroine who bravely sacrifices herself to save the innocent. But the film still treats her as a sex object anyway. For Miller, his character arc involves him transforming from a selfish man motivated only by money, booze, and sex, into a man who is willing to sacrifice himself to risk his own safety to give even a slim chance of salvation for the schoolgirls. However, turning his relationship with Yu Mo into a romantic one, it seems to portray his transformation from a man motivated by money, booze, and sex, into a man motivated by sex. Hardly compelling. Long story short, this is one of the worst instances of the trope ""the hot male and female leads have to hook up during the movie.""",7.0,Anonymous,History
Dull and contrived,"I'm not sure any film could ever capture the extent of the brutality that occurred during the Rape of Nanking. Only a documentary could do this. This film only touched on some of what was going on. The rest of the movie was a feeble attempt to build a story around an American expat trying to save some girls from a convent. Toss in some unrealistically attractive prostitutes for visual effect, a few action scenes, and you have yourself a movie, not a very good movie, but a movie. Every scene drags on longer than it should. The movie starts off fairly well and then declines to the point where you really aren't interested in what happens next. The acting is weak. Christian Bale goes through the motions, though I did enjoy the stereotypical way he tried to speak English to the Japanese soldiers who had no idea what he was talking about. Actually, the movie is filled with stereotypes and seemed to be made with Western viewers in mind, giving them the stereotypes they feel most comfortable with. The word, pandering, comes to mind. The only scene that matches accounts given at the time is that in which the church is invaded by Japanese soldiers. You can't, and should not, try to build a heartwarming film around incidents such as that.By the end of the movie, I really didn't much care what happened to anyone. The characters acted in their own shells. No rapport was built between any of them. There are some bloody scenes and some scenes that are hard to watch. Troubling as they are, they do keep the film anchored in the reality of the time. It is just that they are not integrated well enough with the rest of the story. I think that is where the problem with the film arises. The immensity of the time, the psychological trauma of it, could not be addressed with these characters and with this plot. The end result is a series of disconnected scenes with nothing to hold them together well enough to make for a satisfying film.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Traumatic and powerful,"This is a war movie that will stick with you and leave a impact. There is so many depressing and sorrowful moments in this movie. The audiences is going to have a difficult time holding back their tears for this one. The main reason I decided to watch this movie is because it has Christian Bale in it cause I might have passed on this one if it didn't feature him in this. But I am glad I didn't let this movie just pass by. This movie takes place in 1937 and revolves around WW2 and Japanese invasion of China with the Nanking Massacre. Although the Japanese government might be trying to cover up a horrifying past and war crimes they have committed in the past. Can you imagine something very terrible done to you and your family and the culprit just denies because of reputation sake? This movie shows the brutality and pain of war, especially when it has invaders that doesn't have a conscience. The Japanese were barbaric and despicable during their invasion, they didn't just shoot people they tortured and raped their victims continuously. And this movie shows a vivid portrayal of so much pain and emotion that a bunch of Chinese women and girls had to go through. That even within the chaos there are people willing to love and sacrifice. In fact this movie has more to do with the emotional part during the invasion over showing a lot of the atrocities committed during the Rape of Nanking. Now Christian Bale was okay in this, he could have done better though in my opinion since I know he has some good acting chops by watching his past movies. He plays a man that may seem like just a stupid drunk at first but deep down he has compassion and morals. He becomes a guardian protector for the weak and oppressed...And no he is not Batman. The plot is basically about a man a mortician pretending to be a priest to protect the female Chinese students and prostitutes. The relationship that builds between the students and prostitutes is touching. Some may look down on prostitutes but the background of some of the prostitutes in this movie, it just hits right at the core of the heart. It's a simple story told in a emotional and powerful way and realistically, none of that Hollywood stuff. Although the production for this movie is really good. By the time this movie and ends and the credits roll I could not forget about this film, it stuck with me for quite a while. I had a difficult time sleeping as well. Overall this is a traumatic and powerful movie that needs to be watched at least once.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

"There are flaws, but still a great film.","The first time I watched this film, I thought it was perfect. Then because of my research, I watched this film a couple of times more and spotted the problematic perspectives of it. The film has indeed presented humanity, courage and love in the anti-Japanese time from a unique and creative point of view, thanks to the excellent story from the original novel under the same name. However, the filmmaker's alleged effort to meet the expectations from the audience at home or abroad seems to be too much, as the 'eroticism'- related scenes are not so compatible or even contradict with the atrocity and cruelty of war and the destructive harm on those innocent souls in the film. Nevertheless, the film is still incredibly powerful. Again, I watched the film with the sound off due to the need of my research, but still I cried many times during the whole time for the heart- wrenching story.

poignant account of heroism and self-sacrifice,"At first,I think this film is not bed.In the view of mine it's the best works of director Zhang. It is therefore quite impossible to expect objectivity from any Chinese treatment on the subject- even if it is from internationally acclaimed director and the once-infant terrible of Chinese cinema Zhang Yimou- so the best one can hope for is subtlety, with Lu Chuan's earlier box-office hit 'City of Life and Death' being an excellent example. Fortunately therefore, though Zhang Yimou's take begins on an overtly jingoistic slant, it eventually settles for a nuanced approach that exudes the very humanity at the heart of Yan Geling's story, becoming a moving and poignant account of heroism and self-sacrifice.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great story with average execution,"Very detailed and comprehensive picture but lacking depth in the dialogue department. A lot of lines made me cringe and took me away from the heat of the moment. Not to mention the exaggeration level was way over the top and totally unnecessary.Certainly not a well rounded movie some areas were very shallow and underdeveloped, but definitely worth watching, because the story is that good! And can make up for the f ups in the other areas. With less exaggeration, some reasoning, better dialogue and better performing by the Chinese members this movie could've been a masterpiece.Bale as usual the man can act his backside off, and never fails to deliver every single time, even though and as you know you're as good as your line; but Bale is one of the very few who can overcome terrible lines and makes it not as bad as it should be.

"Profoundly powerful epic for human virtues versus evils, and the unsung heroes and heroines","I am not an expert in Greek Tragedy or Shakespeare. But in my opinion, the profound power of this tragic drama should at least rival those of the classics. In most of Greek Tragedy or Shakespeare, the tears originate from human jealousy and greed that went out of control. This movie leaves the audience with shaken hearts that drips not just tears, but blood. Why? Because against the ghastly backdrop of the most savage violence and despicable evils in the history of war crimes, emerged divinely pristine virtues of human courage, compassion, altruism, and sacrifice.John, the American ""priest"", was not actually a true priest to begin with. Having worked as a mortician for 5 years, he was trying to deliver something to the reverend of a church in Nanjing, but got stuck in the hellish crossfire of the chaotic street battle. After wading through stretches of rubble and and piles of dead bodies of civilians, many of whom naked women mangled after gang raping, John ended up a refugee in the church. Having learned that the reverend had passed away, he was forced to play along as the reverend in charge to avoid Japanese suspicion, and to protect a bunch innocent teenage girl students seeking asylum there.Meanwhile, fourteen local prostitutes forced their way into the church to seek asylum, too. They occupied the basement, depriving the girl students a crucial hideout. The two incompatible groups scorned at and bickered with each other, until the church was raided by the Japanese soldiers one day, resulting in the death of one girl student who fell off the balcony during a chase. Just as the prostitutes started to feel guilty about their occupancy of the basement, and held sympathy for the girl students, something worse happened: the Japanese commander issued an ""invitation"" for the girls to attend their celebration party for capturing Nanjing. A ""no"" reply was not an option. And everybody knew the real destiny for the girl students was sex slavery in military brothel euphemized as ""comfort women"", or worse beyond imagination.When the girl students lined up to commit group suicide by jumping off the bell tower of the church prior to the date to be taken away from the church, the prostitutes could not suppress their conscience any more. In a desperate attempt to persuade the girls to back down from the edges, the prostitutes offered to disguise themselves as the students and volunteered to substitute them for the dooming invitation. The night before the departure was most touching. It was a bit metaphoric to The Last Supper before the crucifixion of Christ. The prostitutes performed singing and dance to the girls as if for them to remember their elder sisters who will be giving up their own lives to redeem them. Then the tearful hugging with whispering farewells, such as, ""You live a good life for me"", reminding the viewer of what captain Miller whispered to private Ryan before passing away: ""Earn it"" in the movie Saving Private Ryan.The love scene between the lead prostitute and John was not as contemptuous to Christianity, or insulting in the solemn context of Rape of Nanjing, as some critics might have suggested. Upon closer scrutiny, the viewer can easily tell it had nothing to do with carnal desire and sensual satisfaction. Rather, it was a genuine thirst for one last taste of human affections as part of the last wish by the lead prostitute. From psychological perspective, John simply served as a substitute for her real old flame. Nonetheless, this ritual brought a closure for her unfulfilled love, before facing her dooming destiny with dignity and serenity. Such substitution can also be found, for example, in the movie The Summer of 1942.The final ritual late in the night before departure was hair cutting and makeover to disguise the prostitutes as teenage students. Here came an opportunity for John to use his mortician skills. Yet the way he did it was spooky -- he made the prostitutes lie down in a row like the dead bodies he used to work on. It was as ominous as The Schindler's List, in which the Jewish women were shaved off their hairs to get ready for the gas chambers. But the director created this eerie scene for another unique purpose: to project a strong symbol that these women, although biologically existed, were about to be deprived of their souls.But these brave prostitutes did not submit to their fates without putting up a final fight. Each of them made a dagger out of broken mirrors, wrapped it up with cloths, and hid it inside their robes, readying for the final showdown and martyrdom.This is a tremendously powerful movie that transforms an extraordinary war crime story into a heroic epic with religious metaphors about human virtues and redemption. It deserves a place in the movies' hall of fame, side by side with masterpieces such as The Bridge on the River Kwai.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good Movie,"I do not understand why anyone would give this movie a negative review.I never write reviews, but after watching this, and reading some of the negative comments, I had to. It is a very touching and sometimes brutal movie. It is definitely worth a watch. The cinematography is great, the storyline does not drag, and the characters develop enough for anyone to become involved emotionally to the movie. The person who wrote the review that said ""he took his Asian lady-friend to watch this, and after it was over she regarded it as garbage."", must have some personal issues, or is just so stuck up, that she can't face the reality of horrific events that could happen in any society during the tragedy of war.

"Good Story, Weird Script","This movie is tough to review. While the story itself was intense, emotional, and interesting, the script had me scratching my head at times. I found there were some awkward moments where Bale was forced to make awkward dialogue that did not fit the environment. I also didn't find this to be one of Bales best performances. I am not sure if the awkwardness of his role was on purpose but I found his entire character not matching the emotional energy of the movie. Regardless, being based on a true story, the movie was emotional and intense just like most war movies but had a layer of uniqueness due to the circumstances. I thought the directing was great as well as the story told through the camera was emotionally gripping.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Yimou Zhang Is a Master Storyteller,"If you know anything about Master Zhang's films you understand he focuses on life as a chain reaction of good decisions and bad and also how sometimes a helpless situation turns on a dime. I suspect he has experienced too many changes of fortune under turmoil that makes him bent on making films to show awful human behavior but also the fallen characters who redeem themselves. One of my favorite of his is ""To Live"" and here we have a similar anxiety induced story.
It's fairly simple...the Japanese in 1937 have sacked Nanking. And as Catholic girl students attempt to hide in a church/convent, in drops an American mortician tasked with burying a priest. He discovers that there isn't enough of the priest to bury but by then it's too late and is trapped with the schoolgirls. A few moments later a group of prostitutes from a local brothel decide to hide out there as well. The Japanese post up there with a more devious plan for the girls. The plan is to sneak them out, past the Japanese.
Without getting too much into the twists and turns...I need to warn viewers this film is brutal. I mean...just awful violence bestowed on everyone involved. Children and women are not spared. And the violence, while shocking, seems to be tame compared to the real stories of Nanking. China's version of the Holocaust. It is ugly, mean and most likely accurate. To the Japanese, most likely shameful. Which seems to be why we've glossed over its history.
But this is about redemption, goodness through dark and...digging deeply for humanity in absolute chaos. In this type of war, the casualties are endless and every body counts. The Japanese are portrayed as ugly screaming monsters, but that would be the perspective of a 13 year old girl recounting the events.
This is a very haunting film and sometimes, it really makes you search your own humanity to learn from hate and anger and find...salvation.

Over-rated,"I've seen nothing but positive reviews for this film, so I checked it out. Well, you may have noticed my opinion is not so supportive.The brutality of the Nanking Massacre has been considerably saturated in recent years, particularly by Chinese cinema. Frankly, this massively fails in contrast to 'The City of Life and Death', which presented a much fairer perspective and made a whole-hearted effort to be comprehensive in its representation of all sides. 'Flowers' is not so objective, nor does it attempt to be. Its purpose is to pull your heart- strings, and seems to have succeeded with the majority of the audiences that watched it; albeit, it achieves this through a relatively skewed and subjective presentation.The combat, for instance, is arguably a case in point. Historically, the battle for Nanking was marked by an overwhelming failure of leadership on the part of the Chinese command; and indiscipline and understandable cowardice on the part of the Chinese soldiery. Thousands of Chinese soldiers deserted their posts and donned civilian attire, helping to create the conditions that partially sparked the massacre in the first place. Chinese soldiery was largely composed of poorly-trained, illiterate peasants who had little or no stomach for the kind of warfare they were thrown into, and understandably ran. The aforementioned 'City of Life and Death' went to considerable lengths to demonstrate the plight of the Chinese soldier. 'Flowers' represents the entirety of the battle (yes, it was a massive battle!) with what appears to be an overly-equipped platoon of the German-trained 88th division,which certainly does not represent the majority of combatants in Nanking. Even notwithstanding, The heroism portrayed is flawed because the film almost reduces it to almost cartoon, comical proportions.Of course, 'Flowers' does not profess to be an objective portrayal of the events of the massacre, but a human story set against the backdrop of these historical events. But the need to incorporate (admittedly well-executed) action elements into an already charged human drama detracts from the emotion of the film. Frankly, the battle scenes, while juvenile and reminiscent of 'Commando' comic books, were some of the best parts of the film, and felt like they belonged in another movie.The cartoon-like parameters of the films character portrayals do not end with its portrayal of violence. Overall, the acting is taut and crisp, but the decision to portray the atrocity almost entirely through the eyes of a group of school-girls arguably leaves a lot to be desired. The image of almost saintly feminine faces against a backdrop of evil only serves to present a glossy fantasy and in my opinion does nothing to fairly represent the true humanity of the event. Furthermore, while Christian Bale is on traditional form, the need to tell the story through the eyes of a westerner is arguably a marketing ploy ( I appreciate that the film is a literary adaptation). The overall need to categorically contrast innocence versus evil detracts from the true horror of the event.Perhaps I should not have seen any other movies depicting the tragedy of Nanking before seeing 'Flowers'; and if this is your first cinematic experience of the subject matter, you may well find it deeply provocative. My advice is to do yourself a favour, and watch 'City of Life and Death' first, and then see this if you still care to. frankly, and unlike most other reviewers, I was simply left mildly entertained. I shed no tears, because the characters never became more than caricatures.",3.0,Anonymous,History

A Masterpiece,"The Flowers of War is a 2011 Historical drama war directed by directed by Zhang Yimou, starring Christian Bale, Ni Ni, Zhang Xinyi, Tong Dawei, Atsuro Watabe, Shigeo Kobayashi and Cao Kefan. It is set in 1937, Nanjing, China, during the ""Rape of Nanjing"", at the time of the Second Sino-Japanese War. A group of escapees, finding sanctuary in a church compound, try to survive the plight and persecution brought on by the violent invasion of the city It was named the top-grossing Chinese film of 2011. It was selected as the Chinese entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but did not make the final shortlist. It also received a nomination for the 69th Golden Globe Awards. The 6th Asian Film Awards presented The Flowers of War with several individual nominations, including Best Film and one will understand why all the hype and the nominations. This is the best historical drama that doesn't take sides of the war, who is far or who isn't, who started what and who didn't like any other war dramas we have seen. It doesn't try to justify it but it shows the evil and the results of war. This was a tearful experience both from an older kind (the prostitutes in the movie) as well as the children (the kids in the movie). This makes you ask the question on the subject of war, Japanese and Chinese war in this case or any other war you have heard of: One wonders why they had to do this? Why did Japan start the war? For what? Its obvious starting war is a shortcut to the destruction of humanity. The Japanese government has been denying there were 300,000 people killed during the Nanking massacre (well, they are not alone, similarly there are also those of holocaust denial). The Flowers of War does a great deal in reminding is of these events so that we could do all we can to prevent another war from coming. The actors and the actresses were great and I applaud Christian Bale for his role, yet again he proves he is undisputed in the way he takes his roles and make them comes to life. The graphics awesome and characters superb, script well executed to such an extent you can hardly draw a line or separate the comedy and drama in it. Go hire this it is worth your time and it is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Beautiful Portrayal of Humanity,"""The Flowers of War"", a film by an acclaimed Chinese Director, Zhang YiMou. Although I have not seen much of his films, but I have learned from some of his movies that they are visually captivating. This movie is no exception. But it offers more than just that.It tells of a story during the Sino-Japanese war, where the Japanese took over Nanking. A group of convent girl students took shelter in the church after failing to leave the city. And later joined by a group of women from the brothel. It is a story of their survival.Christian Bale starred as John, a mortician, who came to the church intending to prepare a burial for the church's priest. Acted like a jerk in the beginning, John was later caught in the situation and realized that he could not afford to just leave the church, the girls and the women behind.The movie brilliantly captured the emotions of the people, of them trying to escape from the Japanese soldiers. The feeling of fear grabbed us through the heart, their fear of being captured, being raped, and being killed. And all they could do was run and hide.It also blatantly showed us the strong contrast of cruelty and humanity. On the brink of a situation, you could either be downright heartless, or you could show the human side of you. After all it is inside everyone of us. We would have found ours if we sympathized the characters and if we stood by justice. But yet the story slapped the truth right in our face that there are still bad apples in this world. People who would brutally do whatever they like to fulfill their desires.The acting throughout the movie was beyond amazing. The director must have pushed the actors (especially the young ones) to a point that they were showing true feelings, so believable, and every detail of their acting and emotion was accounted for. I was truly impressed, especially by the little girls.This is a truly amazing film. And an important one. Reminding us about the unforgettable event taken place in Nanking. And reminding us to cherish and to love. And there is a human in everyone of us. Easily one of the best films of the year!My Rating: 10/10 Status: Extremely Highly Recommended",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great-looking movie,"Another great movie from Zhang Yimou, who seems to go from strength to strength as time goes on. THE FLOWERS OF WAR feels like it should be a true story, a kind of Chinese version of SCHINDLER'S LIST if you will, but despite the fictional nature of this production it proves to be a heartwarming and moving tale of courage and bravery in the face of oppression.We're back in Nanking and the invasion of the Japanese in 1937. The film starts out on a strong footing as a traditional war movie, with some excellent action sequences taking place in the ruins of the bombed-out city. Yimou is able to capture the nature of modern warfare just as well as the more stylised and fantastic historical combat of, say, CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER. Soon, though, the film veers off on a tangent and instead introduces to a cast including a gang of prostitutes, a female choir and, most unlikely of all, an American mortician.Christian Bale headlines the cast, and he's a revelation. I've got used to him being good, but not this good: it's one of the finest performances I've seen him give yet, and he displays a remarkable talent for comedy that was previously only seen in flashes of American PSYCHO. The rest of the cast equal him, and despite the lengthy running time the film never stalls or feels dull. Yimou tells an interesting, engaging tale and one that will keep you watching until the hard-hitting ending. I was caught up in it from the start, enjoyed the way it deliberately avoided cliché, and had a ball with it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Maintaining Humanity in Time of War,"The gruesome realities of the Japanese invasion and conquering of the city of Nanking, China in 1937 have been brought to the screen on a regular basis: In The Name of the Emperor form Christine Choi and Nancy Tang in 1998, Nanking form Bill Gutentag and Dan Sturman in 2007, City of Life and Death form Chuan Lee in 2009 and John Rabe from Florian Gallenburger in 2009, and now come THE FLOWERS OF WAR from Yimou Zhang in 2011. Though the story is based on facts, the various movie versions vary considerably on what really happened. THE FLOWERS OF WAR is based on Geling Yan's novel '13 Flowers of Nanjing,' the story gathers an improbable collection of people -- Bale's freelance American mortician, a group of convent schoolgirls and the women from a local brothel -- in the nominal refuge of a Catholic cathedral as the capital falls to Japan's Imperial Army. There are so many sidebar stories and characters introduced that the enormous impact the other films created is somewhat diluted here despite some quality direction from Yimou Zhang. As the LA Times critic stated, 'The Flowers of War has broken new ground for China's movie industry: It's among the first domestically financed films to star a high-profile Hollywood actor (Christian Bale), and its reported budget of close to $100 million makes it the country's priciest production to date. But when it comes to storytelling, Zhang Yimou's 19th feature is decidedly backward-looking: A lavish period weepie set against the atrocities of the Nanking Massacre, ""Flowers"" abounds with well-worn movie archetypes and slathers on schmaltz.'Briefly stated, in 1937 China, during the second Sino-Japanese war, a mortician, John (Christian Bale) arrives at a Catholic church in Nanjing to prepare a priest for burial. Upon arrival he finds himself the lone adult among a group of convent girl students and prostitutes from a nearby brothel. When he finds himself in the unwanted position of protector of both groups from the horrors of the invading Japanese army, he discovers the meaning of sacrifice and honor. Innocence-vs. -experience is an undeniably strong theme. The girls' tender adolescence heightens its impact, especially given the historical facts. The Nanking Massacre is also known as the Rape of Nanking, and it's more than a figurative description: The Japanese invaders committed horrendous sexual assaults against the female population. In ""Flowers,"" the girls' safety becomes the paramount concern of the survivors holed up in the cathedral.Christian Bale seems to struggle with this character and his performance is not particularly convincing or moving. The aspect of this film that overcomes the over-production qualities (hiring Joshua Bell to provide a violin solo seems a bit much, etc) is the story itself, a bit of history that cannot be replayed often enough to again remind us how war alters man - and that survival, no matter the method, is the laudatory aspect of human caring.Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,History

"So powerful, and sad and emotional, must watch","Powerful and emotionally resonant war drama that leaves a profound impact on its viewers.First and foremost, Christian Bale's performance as John Miller is nothing short of remarkable. He brings a depth of humanity and compassion to the character, portraying a conflicted and reluctant hero amidst the chaos of war. Bale's portrayal captures the essence of a man torn between his own survival and the responsibility to protect innocent lives.The film's setting during the Nanking Massacre in 1937 adds a historical context that is both harrowing and important. Director Zhang Yimou masterfully brings the brutal and devastating reality of war to the screen, creating a hauntingly realistic depiction of the atrocities that occurred during that dark period of history.The film's visuals are breathtaking, with stunning cinematography capturing the beauty of the Chinese landscapes and the stark contrast of the destruction caused by the war. Yimou's artistic direction adds an additional layer of depth to the storytelling.The Flowers of War doesn't shy away from the brutality of war, but it also shines a light on the resilience and bravery of those who dared to stand up against injustice. The portrayal of the young Chinese schoolgirls and their courage in the face of adversity is particularly touching and heart-wrenching.The film's themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the power of human connection resonate deeply. It explores the bonds that form in the most unlikely circumstances and showcases the strength of the human spirit in times of crisis.The music by composer Qigang Chen is hauntingly beautiful and complements the film's emotional depth, adding an extra layer of poignancy to the storytelling.In conclusion, The Flowers of War is a profound and moving cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression. With Christian Bale's outstanding performance, Yimou's masterful direction, and the film's exploration of both the horrors of war and the resilience of the human spirit, it's a powerful and thought-provoking war drama.If you're looking for a film that delves into the complexities of war, human compassion, and the triumph of the human spirit, The Flowers of War is a must-watch.

Christian Bale takes on the Flowers of War,"Asian film market is known for their epic films, but not with A-list American stars attached. In The Flowers of War, Christian Bale jumps into the starring role of a film that is anything but American. Filled with various languages including English, Chinese, and Japanese this film attempts to do something very rare and bring these two cultures of filmmaking together in hopes to create something truly special, through a painful time in history.The Flowers of War follows a mortician who arrives at a Catholic church to prepare the priest for burial, but is thrust into the middle of the Sino-Japanese war, among the convent girl students and prostitutes of a nearby brothel. Now as the unplanned protector of them all, must find a way to help them survive the horrors of the Japanese army. This seemed like it was going to be one of those movies that were more interesting in idea instead of actual execution, but it ended up delivering so much more than you would think. This film takes on some sensitive subject matter and doesn't hold too many punches delivering. Bale gives a great performance, once again thrusting him into something you wouldn't expect. You would never think that an actor with the wide variety of parts he has played with such dedication is the same guy who just finished playing Batman. Here he is forced to carry most of the film as the virtually the only American here in a sea of Asian performers. The rest of the cast delivers some great and powerful performances that are both touching at times and painful. This is one of those stories that doesn't sugar coat the horror of war and delivers some sequences that are a bit hard to take in. While most of the film is more of a drama, there are plenty of action war sequences that are not only important to the story, but also help to break up the slow pace of this heavy story.This is a film that is not only a success in a unique culture mash-up in film, but also one that will pull out an emotional response of some kind. This emotionally charged dark film is way heavier than you may think going in, but is one that deserves to be seen. If you're not a big fan of the foreign film world, this is a perfect film to give a try and discover not only a great film, but the greatness of Asian cinema.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",9.0,Anonymous,History

Nothing to write home about. Just remember that behind all of this are historical facts. Only man, among all the animals, can be the wildest beast and the most merciful angel. Let us be the latter.Highly recommended to everyone who appreciates exquisite film. This is the art of making movies. Enjoy it as I did.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Don't judge by the taglines! This is an 8.5er.,"Honestly, if it was for the taglines and the short description, I would have never watched the movie. They sounded so uninteresting and vague... Luckily, though, I saw the movie before reading those, and let me tell you, I'm glad that I did. The movie is touching to the core. You can trust me, I'm never easily impressed.(Why is it that the best movies are always sad?)Actually, my 8 is an 8.5. I would've given it a higher grade, but Mr. Bale just can't really convince me. Plus that there were a few loose ends that left me with a feeling that the whole picture was not complete. Furthermore, the story is kind of predictable at times. Still, with all these drawbacks, the movie manages to draw an 8.5 out of me, which should say a lot.Really, people, watch it. It stands out from the bunch of crap that's been thrown at us lately by a mile.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Inspired To Warn Others About This Film,"I watched this movie in Beijing on the 15th (day before the official release). I have never written a negative review of a film, but this movie inspires me to do so.There is never a moment in this movie that will bring tears to your eyes. There is no romance except one extremely brief non-nude pseudo-sex scene with Christian Bale that maybe lasted 1 minute (could be a Disney scene almost). The character interaction consists of one liners with a quirky but entertaining performance by Christian Bale. Part of the reason why this movie fails is that there is no other stars in this film. There is Christian Bale and then there are 12 prostitutes taking refuge in the church, 12 young innocent choir girls and 1 boy. Then there are the visitors to the church in the form of Chinese or Japanese soldiers. That's the entire movie. (not a spoiler is it?)The 90% of the movie takes place inside a Catholic church, making this more similar to a play, in my opinion, then a movie. The other 10% of the movie is action scenes on the war torn streets of Nanking.This movie tries to be a grand spectacle Oscar-worthy effort, but fails on all fronts. The direction and cinematography is very sub-par. Action scenes do not flow; there are almost no establishing shots. Character development is non-existent in that the film does not give you reason to care about the characters in this film. Yes there are rape scenes with no nudity that depict girls that we are not given an opportunity to become emotionally attached to. Christian Bale's performance was about the only watchable aspect to this movie, but even that was no where near the caliber of The Dark Night (which shows how much a director can bring out the best or worst in an actor).In conclusion, this is a movie that tries to be something that will create emotion in the audience, which you can't do with comic-book movie style shallow character development. Action scenes are not memorable. Honestly, this has to be the worst movie I've seen Christian Bale appear in. The movie did not provoke any emotion in me or my Chinese companion. The first thing she told me when the movie ended that the movie is ""not good"". I agree with her.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Brutal and Beautiful..,"This is one movie not to be missed ! I don't know why Japanese hated the Chinese so much or its just the act of war and innocents are suffered and killed... I've only heard of the Rape of Nanking in WW2, but to watch its sheer intensity was tossing my tummy quite a bit and i couldn't watch some scenes.. This is a perfect movie depicting the war, love, lust, honor and sacrifice. The war scenes although few can match up to Saving Private Ryan. Those two Chinese stars take your breath away with their beauty and helplessness. Its quite a lengthy movie and the director makes the viewers gasp in awe and admiration in every scene he creates with the ambiance and atmosphere.

"Uplifting, upsetting & visually stunning","All the critics seem to slate this film, but that further cements my belief that they're far removed from what 'real people' think.This film is brutal and tries to tell the story of one of the worst war crimes in living history. It's visually intense and each scene is perfect in terms of how it is delivered.Christian Bale was annoying at first and I questioned his character, but by the end that feeling was gone and it was replaced by an understanding of the character and the choices he faced. His performance wasn't brilliant, but it was acceptable. My wife was also completely glued to the screen and we were both clearly very moved by it.I really don't understand how critics decide what makes a good movie, but to shun this one seems to be a very odd conclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Excellent, high quality production, excellent sound, good cinematography and acting, but...
The screenplay was very shallow, character development almost zero.

Who knew CCP Propagana could be so entertaining!,"Before watching this one should be aware that this is pure Chinese Communist Party propaganda. It deals with the atrocities committed during the r*pe of Nanking, arguably one of the worst crimes in human history. The CCP use this very real historical atrocity to stoke up anti-Japanese sentiment in its own population. To appeal to the international markets they very adroitly had a lot of the dialogue in English and brought in a Hollywood A-Lister in Christian Bale (damn he must have earned a ton to do this!!).Propaganda aside, it's actually fairly entertaining and highlights an important and terrify factor in modern history.

I love it!,"The Flowers of War is a Chinese movie that stars Christian Bale, directed by Yimou Zhang, who is known for his exceptional cinematographic skills. However, the movie does contain several intense and graphic scenes that may not be suitable for viewers who are sensitive to such content.Inspired by true events, The Flowers of War takes place in 1937 during the Japanese Rape of Nanking, a horrific massacre with bodies strewn everywhere. The story centers on a church where 13 schoolgirls, an orphan boy, 12 prostitutes, and an American undertaker must work together in hopes of survival.Christian Bale is a great actor, and he delivers a fantastic performance in this movie. The schoolgirls and the orphan boy are also very talented. The prostitutes are portrayed convincingly, but there's one woman who stands out for me. Her name is Ni Ni, and she plays the leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo. She has a stunning appearance, and her performance is captivating.The movie's production is impressive, and it runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes. Despite the violent and bloody scenes, I found myself captivated by the story. The action scenes were also good, and the shaky cam was used effectively to dramatize the intense combat.Overall, it was a great movie. However, It's the kind of movie that can divide opinions - some may find it outrageous and hate it, while others may find it gripping and love it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
This Confusing Movie,"This movie would have been OK had the people who financed it been aware or cared about the fact that a great deal of the audience would be English speakers.

I would love to give it a good review, however how can I when I cannot review a half understood film. I think Christian Bale is a wonderful actor, so I think this half baked loaf of bread so to speak was a waste of his talent and experience. It amazes me that so many good reviews were posted about this film. I have to guess that the main audience who watched it were Chinese speakers. I am so unhappy I even bothered to watch this movie, I could have been watching reruns on TV if I had stopped viewing it after a half hour.

"Serious, interesting movie all the way through!","I was drawn to see the DVD seeing that Christian Bale was starring in it, but had never even heard of it before. After watching it, I am thinking it should be in the Academy awards top movies category. It follows a very creative storyline of an American mortician finding himself in the position of defending the safety of a group of Chinese schoolgirls in a convent as China is being invaded by Japan. Adding to the improbability, a group of prostitutes seek to take haven in the convent and this is where the storyline proceeds. A contrast of lives of innocence versus lives which have been tainted by exploitation, a jaded man who mocks the church at the onset finds himself in the position of protecting the lives and the honor of the young girls and becoming the father figure and man of virtue himself as he leads them to safety, the atrocities of war in contrast with the humanity of soldiers trying to save lives as their duties are to destroy them. These are a few complexities of the movie. It shows the atrocities of war and the innocence and destruction of those who are caught in circumstances beyond their control. This movie reminds us of the evils of war and the common humanity, desires and emotions that we all share. It was interesting to watch throughout the entire movie. While perhaps, not ""entertaining"" in the sense that it left you with a happy feeling at the end, it was memorable in the sense that it captured the seriousness and importance of war and it's effects on us all, whatever our roles in life may be. I recommend it for viewing for adults, although it may not be appropriate for young children to view due to the violence and serious subject matter.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Acting with true emotions,"This is one of the more interesting movies about the infamous rape of Nanking during the Japanese invasion. In comparison to many other contemporary Chinese history flicks, this one is gladly not so much overloaded with patriotic propaganda aspects apart of a lonesome Chinese solider who easily kills dozens of Japanese soldiers in one scene.The movie focuses much more on stunning costumes, epic graphics and a great camera work. Zhang Yimou is definitely one of the best directors world wide in this category and just this aspect is worth experiencing this film.The film also has a very strong character development. Christian Bale really shines in his role as alcoholic mortician and goes through quite some changes. Another amazing acting comes from the young and highly talented Ni Ni who is not only one of the most beautiful women in modern cinema but also a convincing actress in her role as a tough prostitute with a breakable heart. The acting of Huang Tianyuan as desperate but energizing assistant and protégé of the deceased head father of the convent is also stunning and I hope to see more movies with him in the future.The characters all get some depth and have a quite good chemistry that grows over the movie and makes the heroic sacrifice of the prostitutes for the convent schoolgirls credible in the end. This is where the drama gets really human and touching and you may have a little tear in your eyes by watching the final moments of this film. Despite the dark and desperate historic context and many tension filled moments, this film also some humorous moments that light up the atmosphere and where Christian Bale really shines. Let's also mention that some of the Japanese and especially Colonel Hasegawa who is portrayed by the strong Atsuro Watabe get some depth through this film and are not only represented as brutal killing machines but as cultivated and intellectual characters with a slightly sadistic core which makes them more realistic.Even though this movie has a few lengths, it's strong enough to convince thanks to a very great acting with true emotions. The ending is a little bit too open in my humble opinion and I would have liked something more concrete but this only shows how much one gets to adore all these characters in a little bit less than two hours and a half of running time. Any fan of contemporary Chinese cinema should definitely check this very detailed, passionate and visual movie out.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The other side of  War,"Yimou Zhang (The House of the Flying Daggers, Hero) gets away of Chinese traditional heroes to approach a more serious topic: the Nanking rape massacre, set in 1937 during the Japanese invasion of the Chinese city of Nanking. Christian Bale is cast as an American grave digger that ends up posing as a priest to save a group of prostitutes and a group of former student young girls on a monastery. The camera and photography are very strong, with the mood set in a very sober fashion. Almost no soundtrack accompanies Flowers of War's powerful scenes, belonging to the amazing actors the responsibility of delivering emotions to the audience. The Flowers of War is not a traditional war movie as it focuses on the characters and their specific situation and not the war itself. This is the other side of war, the civilian side. Great performances and once again a stellar Christian Bale make you care for this amazing story that does not try to cheat you with a fake quality seal. The dialog is mainly Chinese spoken, only with Bale left with some room for English, making the Flowers of War very believable and immersive.

"I understand the objections, but still find this powerful and well filmed","The movies I've seen by the brilliant Yimou Zhang tend to fall roughly into two categories; big epics like Hero or smaller dramas like The Road Home. Flowers of War is an attempt to straddle these two styles, with a mix of bravura action and small, intense dramatic moments. It's difficult to pull off, and I wouldn't say it always works, but for the most part, this is a brilliant movie.Flowers of War has received a lot of ""The Color Purple""-style criticism along the lines of, ""some things are too ugly to be made so beautiful."" And while I disagreed with that analysis of Purple, I do, to some extent, agree here.The movie immediately shows typical Zhang flourishes, like a small but marvelous moment where a cart full of fleeing people cuts the strings of a musical instrument as Japanese soldiers are hunting down and killing Chinese civilians in the famous Rape of Nanking.The opening scenes are intense and disturbing. I had no familiarity with the Nanking massacre, and I would have thought it was exaggerated if I didn't spend a couple of hours reading about it. It represents the heights of human depravity. Imagine the horrific events of the movie repeated hundreds of thousands of times over a six-week period.The movie focuses on a white mortician who comes to a girl's school which also winds up being sanctuary for some prostitutes. This leads to a lot of conflict and, in spite of the horrors, a certain amount of humor. There is also a thread running through of the last of the city's Chinese soldiers vainly attempting to stop the Japanese.There is something disconcerting about Zhang's bravura filmmaking in the context of the horrors of this massacre. A rape scene centered around the school's gorgeous stained-glass window is electrifying, but one's enthusiasm for its stylistic grace conflicts with the grim horrors of the scene.There is also a wonderful scene with the final soldier, played brilliantly by Dawei Tong, taking out a slew of enemy soldiers. It's an exciting action sequence full of intense moments, but it feels a little unrealistic and out of place, as though it belongs in a different film altogether.So yes, it's often unrealistic, leans too much on clichés, and is filmed in a way that often seems more about the art of filmmaking than about the content of the movie.On the other hand, there is much to recommend it. First off, the filmmaking really is incredible. Even if you object that it's the wrong style for the subject, there are a lot of moments where you have to be in awe of the artistic vision.The movie also has some terrific performances. Besides Tong's tight- lipped soldier, Christian Bale is excellent, bringing a mix of macho obnoxiousness and genuine feeling to the clichéd role of a cynic finding his soul. Above all is Ni Ni as prostitute Yu Mo, a mix of brains, beauty, bravery, and flirtatious mastery that made me think of Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not.The movie is touching, and funny, and stylish, and thoroughly absorbing, for all its flaws.It's also painful to watch. I know there are movies that are said to handle the Nanking Massacre better than this one, but it's such an overwhelmingly grim subject that I just cannot bear to delve into it again.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Impressively directed and beautifully shot and superbly acted drama!!!,"In 1937, Nanking stands at the forefront of a war between China and Japan. As the invading Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, desperate civilians seek refuge behind the nominally protective walls of a western cathedral. Here, John Miller (Christian Bale), an American trapped amidst the chaos of battle and the ensuing occupation takes shelter, joined by a group of innocent schoolgirls and thirteen courtesans, equally determined to escape the horrors taking place outside the church walls. Struggling to survive the violence and persecution wrought by the Japanese army, it is an act of heroism which eventually leads the seemingly disparate group to fight back, risking their lives for the sake of everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""Sometimes the truth is the last thing we need to hear""","THE FLOWERS of WAR is a disturbing yet touching film that truly captures the horrors of the Japanese occupation of Nanking, 1937. Long, graphically realistic scenes of war violence and carnage, as well as the numerous rapes which often ended in murder. Though the transformation in his character from totally selfish to completely selfless is a little sudden, Christian Bale gives a strong performance as John Miller. Virtually all of the Chinese ladies--both the Winchester Cathedral girls and the courtesans--are similarly well-portrayed. The beautifully peaceful singing by the choir girls provides a believable contrast to the horrors going on all around them. Special mention should also be given to Dawei Tong as Major Li.While THE FLOWERS of WAR puts no blankets over the brutality of this event, it also shows both sides of the Japanese coin. Even at their most barbaric, the marauding soldiers still come across as eminently human. Humans, of course, can be pretty terrible, but regardless, I know of very few western films that succeed so well in portraying the WWII-era Japanese as something other than just faceless, sinister, bestial monsters. The ending is unexpected, heart-rending, but similarly believable.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent War Movie From The East, Bale is Outstanding As Always","The film is based on a novella by Geling Yan, ""13 Flowers of Nanjing"", inspired by the diary of Minnie Vautrin.The story is set in Nanking, China, during the 1937 Rape of Nanking in the Second Sino-Japanese War. A group of escapees, finding sanctuary in a church compound, try to survive the plight and persecution brought on by the violent invasion of the city.I really liked and I did not even seen many from the east, the story is very good, a realistic scenario of war and survival that teleports us into the middle of it, the plot improves the level as time progresses the first hour is the best part of the movie it had a predictable ending, that's right but it doesn't ruin the movie either, despite being a film about something as atrocious as this the 140 min of running time didn't fell that long and never lost interest, Bale also helped a lot with his performance showing why he is the big Hollywood star that he is.The cinematography is quite good, so are the visual effects, the huge budget also helped($90,000,000). My vote is 8.Title (Portugal) - ""As Flores da Guerra"" (""The Flowers of War"")",8.0,Anonymous,History

Emotional end.,"I just finished watching Flowers Of War and I have to say that it is really emotional. At the beginning of the movie, I have to be honest and say that I didn't think it was interesting at all, but as the movie continued I got more and more into it. The acting in this movie was great, the story was great.I must say that most of the characters annoyed me at the beginning, but when I started to reach the end, I saw how beautiful and kind every single one of them were. I would highly suggest you to watch it. I would definitely say that this is a movie you should watch alone like I did. Then you pay more attention and get more emotional with it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best movies of Zhang Yimou,"I wanted to see this movie when it came out, but i saw it just yesterday. At first i only wanted to see this film because i like Christian Bale, i think he is one of the most talented actors of our time. When i saw the trailer, i was not impressed, but when i saw that Zhang Yimou was the director, i decided finally to see this film. Zhang Yimou was the director of many masterpieces, but he directed also some average movies. I have to say that this movie is one of his best works. The images are very fascinating and the plot is perfect. The cast is also good. Beside Christian Bale, all actors are doing a pretty good job. The movie could be a little more violent, but the story is good enough and i recommend it without second thoughts.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The story is amazing. Makes you think! May be there are many movies made on almost similar plot, but this one stands out because of many reasons.The title is so apt. the fragrance is so fresh and soothing, it will linger around you for long.Happy movie watching!

Silent Blooms,"Directed by Zhang Yimou, The Flowers of War transports us to the harrowing events of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, where amidst the chaos and brutality, stories of courage and compassion emerge like fragile blooms in a desolate landscape.At its core, The Flowers of War is a tale of survival and sacrifice, set against the backdrop of one of the darkest chapters in history. Through the eyes of a young girl caught in the midst of the carnage, we bear witness to the unspeakable horrors of war, as well as the quiet moments of humanity that shine through the darkness.The film eschews flashy visuals and stylistic flourishes in favor of a raw and understated approach, allowing the story to speak for itself. It's like a black-and-white photograph, stark and unadorned, yet brimming with emotion and depth. The simplicity of the filmmaking only serves to underscore the power of the narrative, as we are drawn inexorably into the lives of the characters and the world they inhabit.But perhaps the most striking aspect of The Flowers of War is its message of hope amidst despair. Despite the horrors of war, there are moments of beauty and compassion that pierce through the darkness like rays of sunlight. It's a reminder that even in the bleakest of times, the human spirit endures, and love and kindness can still flourish in the most unlikely of places.",8.0,Anonymous,History
This is not a movie for everyone but this is a movie everyone should see.,"First off I'm not familiar with Chinese history especially before WWII, so I had no idea the Japanese invaded the country in the 1930's. This story is about an American mortician John Miller played by Christian Bale who finds himself at a convent in the middle of a bombed out town surrounded by the Japanese. When he first arrives he is the only adult because the Priest died and the staff has fled. He just wants to get paid and leave before he is killed. Then some prostitutes from the local brothel seek refuge in the church. I loved the interplay between the young girls and the pro's. then there is the change in John as he goes from heartless and jaded to the ""hero"" for lack of a better word. I don't want to give any spoilers so I'll stop there. This movie will make you cry for loss and personal sacrifice. It could be a little hard to follow. Half the dialog you need subtitles for which seemed to go fast even for me who is a fast reader. but it is an amazing story that should be told and even if I never watch it again am glad I found this amazing tale.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Ni Ni as a Newcomer she gave a very nice and great performance. Her charms and Beauty shows the real colours of Asia. I don't know much about the Director but he did a great job.

Good history lesson,"Very touching, well-done film. Several very graphic/disturbing scenes, but likely necessary to capture the feel of the time. A piece of history I knew virtually nothing about, so glad to have received my education in this manner.Might have been nice to have sub-titles, though without speaking a word of Chinese or Japanese I could almost always get the essence of the many conversations that took place in other-than-English. I agree with another reviewer who commented that a romantic scene amidst all the carnage and atrocities in the movie seemed somewhat out-of-place. I think I'd have given more points if the screen-writer had seen fit to figure out a reasonable way to avoid going the obvious route in that scene. Kudos in particular to the girl (can't recall her name), who felt her father was a traitor. Outstanding performance from beginning to end!The movie is quite long and I felt it could have been shortened a bit by culling some of the war footage in the early part of the movie. As a result, it took us a bit longer to ""commit"" to the movie. Overall, an excellent movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A nice one to watch once.,"I like war films. And any war film can impress me. And this one was a film on a different subject and kind of like the cold mountain in which also there was a different subject. Christian bale is a fine actor. I liked him in most of his movies. The battle scenes are nice and visually appealing. I found myself not bored at any time, but sometimes I did found myself irritated with the thirteen girls. May it was the Chinese accent or whatever but otherwise the film is a mix of a lot of things including sex, action, story etc. Overall the film is good for a one time watch. But not that important to watch.""A recommended onetime watch.""",8.0,Anonymous,History

War is hell...,"This is NOT an action war movie whatsoever. Not meant to be enjoyable. It's bleak and sad. This is a subtle, yet intense portrait of the pain and courage humans show when they are at risk of dying.This haunting and devastating Chinese world war 2 story is shocking, portraying all the lowest of the lowest evils humans are capable of. War is hell. War makes humans desperate for survival by any means possible and survival of a group of orphan children at a church is what this story is all about. Christian Bale accidentally becomes the saviour of these vulnerable children at the church. Will he be able to protect them from harm from the raging war?Shocking, yet also very touching and inspiring tale about evil and love in desperate times of war.",8.0,Anonymous,History

the review of the flowers of Nankin,"This film review is about <<13 flowers of war>> by Yimou Zhang in 2011. It is a movie based on the Nanking Massacre with a story around soldiers, girls, singing women, a boy and a fake father fighting the enemy in their own way.The movie is 146 minutes long and I cried for 140 minutes. I was touched by those ordinary but great people, those warm and honorable souls. It does not like other movies about war, which are depressive and heavy with lots of national heroes and unforgivable enemies. This movie has many colorful scenes and focus on a special group of victims. The storyline is very clear and attractive.The 13 flowers is not the real 13 women, it is 12 women and a boy. The main character is Yumo, who is the leader and the most popular one in those singing girls. They are also living as whores. But they are not like others; they are pretty, lovely and have elegant looking. Yumo used to be a student of church like the girls do; she could have another kind of life if she was not raped by her stepfather and forced her to entertain the guests. Their body and human dignity are been violated, their job is been spurned. The culture defined their characters. But in the end, the ""humble"" women save 12 lives and sacrifice themselves gratefully. The shine of humanity is pretty dazzling on them. Especially when one of them wants to play a complete song to that injured soldier before he died. She said the young soldier looked so similar to her brother. She went out under the dangerous guarding to find her string in her working place. On her way back, she was found by the enemy and they took her. Because of the beauty she had, she was raped by all of them. How cruel the war is. It is strongly compared with the nicely humanity. The humanity is dramatically performing in this movie. Those people who were supposed to be humble expressed gracious; who were supposed to be nobody expressed like a hero. With no doubt, the gracious people were selfless and kind, the real heroes were brave and sacrificial.As the part of cinematographic style, there are many scenes I fascinated. There is a huge colorful window on the top floor of church; it is so different with the whole background color. The girl who narrated the story in movie always looked out through the window. The beautiful light irradiated on her face and body, it gives me a pure and peaceful feeling. Through the window, she saw the soldier who saved their lives; she saw the enemies who were guarding them; she saw those singing women forcing to come into the church with reckless laugh. Every time her emotion has fluctuated, she must stand in front of the window. Her attitude changed about those women from contempt to dependent, which also reflect the women's gracious humanity. Another great scene is when the enemies coming into the church and wanted to rape the girls, the fake father overcome his cowardice and bravely stand in front of the colorful window with a huge red cross flag and a full of righteous speech as a real father to save the girls. The whole picture is surrounding by a holy light, without national boundaries, without religion, just the compassion, justice and morality in the deep humanity. The other scene is about when the girl was almost raped by the enemy, there was a bullet from the soldier accurately shooting through the window and pierced on his head. The girl was saved. The shot was performed more slowly than the average when the bullet is pierced the window. It seems like the bullet was carrying a strongly power to come to save them, just like God was coming to save them.The ending does not clearly describe the experiences and the future that those women and the boy have. It leaves us a space for imagine. They know what they will face when they get there and they persuade themselves that it is their daily job, if they can hold they may keep alive, but the girls cannot if they go. I was so touched by their action.This film is transferring a spirit, not record of actual events like other movies about Nanking Massacre. This film is also a brilliant gift of tenacious and resilient women with a unique angle of a story in Nanking Massacre. The audience emerges with a sense of varied and gracious humanity in war.",,Anonymous,History
Not the best film on the topic but well worth viewing,"In the winter of 1936-37, the Japanese occupation of Nanjing, then the capital of China, was so unspeakably brutal that it was dubbed the rape of Nanjing. Most people in the West have never heard of the event but, in China, it is still an intensely raw issue. In recent years, two Chinese films have been made about the occupation. In 2009, there was ""City Of Life And Death"" directed by Lu Chuan. Then, in 2001, we had ""Flowers Of War"" directed by Zhang Yimou.""City Of Life And Death"", which is unquestionably the far superior work, made little effort to appeal to a Western audience, although it did have a European character - the real-life John Rabe, known as the German Schindler - as a key character. ""The Flowers Of War"", however, was deliberately pitched at a Western audience: the chosen director had achieved considerable acclaim (and rightly so) for films like ""Hero"" and ""House Of Flying Daggers""; the central character is a (fictional) American mortician played by Christian Bale (echoes of his much earlier role in ""Empire Of The Sun""); almost half its dialogue is in English; and it was accorded a massive budget of some $100M from the Chinese Government and state-backed banks. At the domestic (Chinese) box office, it proved to be the highest-grossing Chinese production of all time but, in the United States, it was a total flop.The story - drawn from a novel - is actually a powerful one: convent girls and prostitutes, with seemingly nothing in common, thrown together as they take refuge from the marauding Japanese inside a Catholic church where the priest is dead and their only hope is a drunken Westerner. While it is an invented tale, the context in which it is told was all too real and nothing that is shown or hinted at comes near the horror of what actually happened. So ""The Flowers Of War"" does not have the strengths of the more realistic ""City Of Life And Death"" but it is well worth viewing and would be instructive to Americans who think the Second World War started with Pearl Harbor.",,Anonymous,History
