"Great scale, action and mystery squares off with bad romance and dialogue","And now, the Darth Vader origin story really begins. In fact, ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" sort of renders its predecessor useless. ""Episode I"" feels like a mostly unnecessary part of the story now that ""Episode II"" gives a better glimpse into the troubled young man Anakin Skywalker – the future Darth Vader – has become.Of course, ""Attack of the Clones"" also has troubles of its own. Although it is quite the grandiose visual effects spectacle – more so than any of its predecessors – it is the smaller, character- driven parts of the story that George Lucas absolutely botches, to almost comical effect.Central to the entire prequel trilogy is the story of how Darth Vader becomes Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire rises to power, which means Lucas has a trajectory he must follow. It's clear in many ways that the story and screenplay is slave to this. Everything must add up to fit with the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and Lucas must connect the dots, even if they don't all want to connect.The dots that are most critical to the story are the ones that trace Anakin Skywalker's (Hayden Christensen) path to the dark side and becoming the father of Luke and Leia. Therefore, he must turn evil – and fall in love – at the same time.Because ""The Phantom Menace"" does very little legwork for Anakin's turn to the dark side, everything falls on ""Attack of the Clones"" to put it in motion. Right away, we are presented with a cocky, reckless young padowan of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) who is nothing like little ""Ani"" in ""Episode I."" He is also extremely forward with Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), because, well, they have to fall in love and there just isn't much time for them to do so in a believable way.Before ripping into this unfortunate romantic subplot, it's worth noting that most else about ""Clones"" is entertaining. Running through the film is a pretty solid mystery thread: As a dangerous separatist movement gains steam in the Republic, now-Senator Amidala finds her life threatened and Obi-Wan and Anakin are assigned to protect her, and if possible, identify her would-be assassin. Obi- Wan traces a poison dart to a mysterious planet called Kamino, where he uncovers a big secret and a conspiracy unfolds.Ever since Alec Guinness' Ben Kenobi mentioned fighting with Luke's father in the Clone Wars in ""A New Hope,"" ""Star Wars"" die-hards have been itching to see the Clone Wars and find out just what they were all about. ""Attack of the Clones"" sets this up an exciting way and introduces some exciting villains to boot in Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) and Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). For the first time, fans can piece together how the Galactic Empire came into power, and that's exciting.Interspersed with this unraveling mystery, however, is the Anakin- Padme romance, a subplot that reveals the most hideous weaknesses of Lucas' storytelling ability, namely that he cannot write good dialogue and he most certainly cannot create a genuine romance.The feistiness of the Leia-Han backward romance accidentally worked out really well for Lucas because of Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford's repartee. This romance, however, is way more dramatic, serious and creepy. For one, the age gap between the two is uncomfortable, and largely because Padme says that she still sees him as a little boy. For another, he comes on to her aggressively and with a stalker-like anger that she apparently doesn't mind after he's persistent enough. And amidst it all, Anakin is having nightmares about his mother and is dealing with feelings of revenge that don't seem to bother Padme. There's just no way it had to be this ugly, but again, Anakin is Luke and Leia's father, and that has to happen somehow.In a film without ""Star Wars"" in the title, ""Attack of the Clones"" would've warranted more scathing backlash, but the romance failure is somehow more acceptable in this instance because ""Clones"" is part of a story and a universe bigger than itself. You just have to brush it off. At least, unlike ""Phantom Menace,"" the film feels more connected to that universe in other ways (and there's exceptionally less Jar Jar Binks in it).With an iconic lightsaber duel at the end to top it all off, ""Clones"" skates by on adventure even though it does make it clear that no matter what happens in ""Episode III,"" the prequels won't have the same heart and same lovable nature as the original films do.~Steven CCheck out Movie Muse Reviews for more",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Looking back this episode is much better,"This episode of the Star wars saga was criticized by some when it came out for having wooden dialogue and too much digital landscaping to be any good. I wasn't overly impressed with it myself, but having seen all 6 films now, AOTC is actually a very important and well done section of the overall series.Lucas has said time and again that this movies are meant to be seen as one long film, not to be taken as 6 individual movies. This particular installment features so much that affects every other episode. The discovery of the clones, the immaturity and arrogance of Annakin, the beginning of the clone wars. All of these events happen in this one movie, which is actually a lot more than what happens in some of the other films. I don't consider this to be the best of all 6 by any means, but it is certainly not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Some moments of inspiration but overall another wasted opportunity,"Set against the background of political conflict, Obi Wan investigates the source of an assassination attempt whilst Anakin and watches over Padme.The film starts off interesting with some scenes of mystery and intrigue that hook the attention. Unfortunately it slows down in the middle with some unnecessary sequences and others with too much static dialogue. When spectacle does occur it is mostly good but nothing interesting links them together other than characters blandly talking. However, It finishes strongly with a sequence of exciting moments and big nod to what is to come.Overall the plot is somewhat better than Episode I, but the mistakes made in the previous film hurt Episode II. Count Dooku is introduced as a new villain, but as good as Christopher Lee is you can't help but lament over the Darth Maul's absence, a missed opportunity to give his character more contribution to the overall story. Lee's presence always feels like a reaction to fill a void, particularly as his character was never referenced in Episode I.That said, the climactic lightsaber spectacle is noted for being the one that shows Yoda in action for the first time in the franchise. It's spine-tingling as you see him limp to centre stage and then explode into action. Unfortunately (and I hate to be a killjoy again) the timing is off. It would have been better to have waited till Episode III to make his duel with the chief villain that much more special.A big positive is the sequence of events shown on Tatooine with Anakin, his mother and the Sand People. This is a pivotal moment in his character arc and is done exceptionally well. The dialogue between he and Padme in the subsequent scene where he confesses his actions could have been better but it is thankfully lifted by another masterful John Williams composition.The films of George Lucas have been widely criticised for bad dialogue and not without merit. The romantic scenes in Attack of the Clones are now infamous for their lack of chemistry and poor dialogue. It probably didn't help that Episode I showed Anakin as a child and Padme as a young woman. If they'd shown us a distinctly more mature and emotionally strong Anakin, perhaps we could believe there is an attraction, but he behaves like a creepy, spoilt teenager, lustfully gawping at the first girl he's ever seen. Soon they find themselves in a sequence of tranquil locations where nothing else actually happens other than bland dialogue over picturesque backdrops. This also hurts the pacing of the film as everything slows down for these scenes to play out. What Lucas should have shown was Anakin and Padme going through something interesting together, then let their love develop out of that. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are good actors but unfortunately have poor material to work with.Other performances are good, particularly Christopher Lee, Frank Oz, Samuel L Jackson, Anthony Daniels and Iain McDiarmid.The special effects as you can imagine are epic and all you would have wanted the Clone Wars to be. The scenes on Coruscant are a welcome change from the type of backdrops seen in the previous four movies.Much like The Phantom Menace there are some inspired moments, but Attack of the Clones was another wasted opportunity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not Bad,"First off the movie had some good aspects about it. For one the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin was phenomenal. They were emotional and comedic at the same time. The second thing is the action. This movie was very action packed and the choreography in the fights were very good. The conflict was nice as well I just wish they didn't have as many sub-plots. I didn't like how unnecessarily long this movie was, it felt like 3 hours. Some scenes didn't need to be included and I didn't like how they made it seem as if Anakin was obsessed over Padme but other than that their romance was believable and cute. The acting was strong although sometimes it came off as bland. The beginning tried to be serious but ended up looking like a joke. The movie was pretty good overall but could've done better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Whats not to like??,"Right this is my first review, so don't slam down on me to hard! anyway... I've read a lot of comments about petty-problems with this film, but couldn't help thing'what the hell!,' this is a fun movie.First, a plot summery, Padme Amidarla is mow a senator for Naboo who deeply believes in democracy, and i travelling to couresant to vote 'no' for a Republic army. After a failed assassination attempt, Obi and Anakin are assigned to protect her. Anakin takes her back to Naboo for safety, while Obi tries to find out who's trying to kill her.Next, the special effects are great, all of it looks real and the detail to attention in superb. The Clone war is amazing, explosions and shooting. And the digital characters don't look fake at all.The plot is good too,it all revolves around the beginning of the clone wars and thats all I'm going to say.The acting is on the whole good, McGreggor, Portman and Lee are all great. Jackson's good. Christen leaves a lot to be desired but i can forgive him just this once.Finally, ignore the haters, this movie's great!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
bad dialog but love Kamino,"The Republic is threatened as Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) agitates for a rebellion. Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) arrives at Coruscant to vote on the creation of the Army of the Republic. After an assassination attempt, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect Padmé. They haven't seen each other in 10 years. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) traces the attacks to bounty hunter Jango Fett and the hidden water planet Kamino.This dialog is horribly flat. It's not simply the stilted awkward romance. The expositions are all done in tired uninteresting way. There is a lot of walking-and-talking and sitting in a circle. It is all terrible and I would suggest fast-forwarding several sections of the movie.On the other hand, the CGI continues to be great. The best is Kamino. That world is sci-fi heaven. I love the aliens. I love Jango Fett and Anakin is nowhere to be found. McGregor gets to leave behind that dead weight. I also like the Blade-Runner-like lower levels of Coruscant although that bar should have been a lot seedier. It has too much of a sports bar feel. The coliseum is good and who doesn't love that outfit on Portman. There is plenty of fun action in this movie but it needs a better writer to punch up the dialog.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The most underrated Star Wars movie,"Let me start off by saying that i don't enjoy the love scenes between Anakin and padme, BUT... Anakin is supposed to be awkward socially. So i guess it's realistic?Besides that... This movie rocks. The story in this one and the clone wars as a whole is my favorite in the star wars saga. This movie doesn't deserve all the hate it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The most underrated star wars movie ever,"The truth is the first time I had watched the movie I wasn't impressed. After rewatches over the years I realised this movie gets so much hate that it didn't deserve. Especially if you compare it to the new movies (episodes 7, 8,9) it is far better in script, character development and battles. Anakin is awesome in this movie and makes you feel totally familiar with yourself the way he acts following your heart instead of cold rules.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I loved it and I think it's getting too much criticism,"I happen to be one of the folks who really has enjoyed these films in the prequel trilogy.  I also can see why people would not like the films and I don't deny people the right to their opinion.  What has been bothering me has been some of the reasons people are giving for hating these new films... they are childish, they have too many special-effects, the acting is bad, the writing is bad, Lucas has sold out and has lost his touch... it makes me wonder if people are actually remembering the original trilogy correctly. Don't get me wrong, I love the original trilogy, but they weren't exactly well-acted or well-written movies.  We didn't love them because they were these great Shakespearian works of art; we loved them because we were little kids totally enraptured by this exciting fantastical world.  It seems that those same kids that loved the films 20 years ago have grown up into stuffy old yuppies that have no idea how to have fun anymore.  Our generation has grown up and it seems that we wanted Star Wars to grow up with us, to morph into some new R-rated grown up version to satisfy our more mature needs. Well, we didn't like the original trilogy because it was all grown up and serious.  We liked it because it was silly and fun and awesome to look at. I am personally glad that George Lucas did not make the prequels into a new grown up version.  I like the adventure and excitement and I challenge the one major complaint that says that they do not live up to the originals. Let's look at what people have complained about when comparing these to the original trilogy.-The new movies are too childish and geared towards kids: So, somehow we're supposed to believe that the droids, aliens, spaceships swamp monsters, and warriors with mystical powers from the original trilogy were of the more mature variety.-The new movies have too many special effects: We're forgetting that the original movies were also special effects laden.  Lucas has always pushed the limits of technology, even inventing new technology all the way.  He has not sold out or changed or just now relied on special effects, he has always concentrated on the effects.  If he had digital technology 20 years ago, he would have done the same thing then that he has now.  That's what he does; he makes up worlds that don't exist and then comes up with a way to put them on film.-The writing has been bad on the new films: Does anybody recall Lucas ever receiving a Pulitzer Prize?-The acting has been bad on the new films: Carrie Fisher???  Mark Hamill??? Harrison Ford???  We're not exactly talking about Academy Award winners here.  Name me one of the original main actors who was actually a great actor (other than Sir Alec).  Now, Harrison Ford has had a great career, but he's no Jack Nicholson.  And where are Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill now?-Anakin is just a whiny little brat: Does anybody also remember how whiny Luke was in the first two movies?  I mean, he did nothing but whine and complain until Jedi.  And how many times did they say that Luke was just like his father?  Should anybody then be surprised that Anakin was a whiny adolescent?I think my point here is that people from my generation have taken something they loved as a kid and put it up on a pedestal so high that they are confused as to why they liked it.  They think the original movies were these serious Academy Award caliber pieces of art and that's why they liked them. In fact, we liked them because they were cool and had monsters and space battles and there were toys that we could play with and have fun.  The new movies are of the same mold as the original, they are unchanged.  WE have changed and we're having a hard time dealing with that fact.  Some would argue that these movies are not true Star Wars movies.  I say, they are exactly the same... that's why I love them.  If I want a serious film, I'll go find somethings starring Daniel Day-Lewis.  I like action and science fiction, so I'll stick to the childish, poorly acted stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Begun, the Clone War has....""","It seems as though there is no way to dispel negative atmosphere once it has been started. George Lucas's STAR WARS trilogy was well-loved by audiences (even though critics were split) but for some reason (and I can't figure it out), the first entry in the prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE, earned a HUGE onslaught of critically divided posts just about everywhere in the world, from the press to the internet to fans in real life. While I do agree that the original trilogy is a tough act to follow, I wasn't as grossly let down by this movie as some were.The same thing has happened to the second of the STAR WARS prequels, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, released in 2002. Many predicted that this movie would satisfy those who disliked Episode I with a vengeance, but alas, such was not the case. Once again, critics damned the movie for one reason or another, and the heated debate on whether Lucas ""trashed the original trilogy"" or not is still going on. I find it very sad that Lucas would still receive unfair critical attack, even after making a much darker, somber, and ominous movie in ATTACK OF THE CLONES. I'm guessing that such naysayers will continue to say nay to Lucas no matter what just like rabid fans of Anime would continue to slam-dunk dubs... even if a lot of them have recently proved to be excellent.This is not to say that ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a flawless film. It actually has its share of problems that THE PHANTOM MENACE didn't have. The dialogue, although nowhere nearly as bad as critics and some disgruntled fans say, lacks the spark of the original trilogy. My biggest gripe with the movie is that it moves at a leisurely pace, with lots of weak, unsatisfying sequences that last too long. Most of these scenes consist of a love subplot involving Anakin Skywalker and Amidala Padme. When not interacting with each other, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are fine in their respective roles. (Christensen's monologue about his slaughtering of not only Tusken Raiders but--horrors!--women and children is frightening.) But there is a sense of awkwardness when they contribute to scenes which involve schmaltzy lines and screen kisses. I'm guessing that they both felt uncomfortable doing these scenes, hence why the chemistry between them isn't as interesting as, say, Han and Leia's from the original trilogy.Only when the movie is in action does ATTACK OF THE CLONES become worthwhile--there's a dizzying chase through Coruscant on floating cars, maneuvering through a dangerous asteroid field near a planet, and a half-hour long showdown that showcases a lot of amazing CG work. Actually, what also make Episode II worth watching are the fantastic set designs. Every location in the movie, from the metropolis skyscrapers of Coruscant to the water planet where prototypes of Stormtroopers are being constructed literally bursts with imagination and eye candy.Of the performers I liked Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) the best; his acting is still a little shaky at times, but here he seems more comfortable with the role. Christopher Lee makes a surprise appearance as the new villain, Count Dooku, and once again he delivers first-rate evil with this character. And it's great to see C-3PO and R2-D2 up to their usual banter again (although sometimes some gags occur when not necessary). Ultimately, however, the film belongs to Jedi Master Yoda, played to perfection by Frank Oz. His appearances in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI featured him as a rubber puppet (and a delightful creation), but in this movie he really comes alive, thanks to first-rate CG effects. His mouth is perfectly in sync with every word he says, and the final showdown between him and Dooku is an absolute highlight.While ATTACK OF THE CLONES is, in some ways, a lesser entry in the STAR WARS franchise, its assets outweigh its weaknesses; most of the questions I had from the first episode seem to be addressed a little bit in this chapter, and, frustratingly enough, provides more questions for Episode III. Flawless or not, this is still a STAR WARS movie, and for what it is, it's still worth a look.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mostly entertaining,"If you listen to some fans of the original Star Wars trilogy, the new one is crap. This is, I've found out, true only with the Phantom Menace, which was very poorly directed and edited piece of film.Attack of the Clones in the other hand is in comparison a superior achievement from PM. But it does contain couple of unnecessary segments, which drag the speed of the film down. And some of the acting is, even in the standard of the Star Wars, pretty horrible. But happily all those under achievers are not in any important roles and seasoned actors like Christopher Lee (Count Dooku) do deliver what you expect of them. others deserving nomination here are Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine.So, the plot. Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are told to watch over senator Padame (Natalie Portman) because of assassination attempts towards her life. This soon leads in Obi in discovery of secretly manufactured clone army. Who is behind all this? Will Padame and Anakin fall in love? When does Anakin fall in to the dark side? Will he become a Jedi before all this? Some of these questions are partly answered in AOTC, but some are left waiting for the third installment of the new trilogy.But as said, this is much better film than Phantom Menace. It's not best film in the Star Wars saga, but in my opinion it does deliver. It's mostly fun to watch, action sequences are good, special effects are even better and despise some bad acting and some pretty horrible dialogs, it wasn't pain in the back side to watch.So, my advise: don't listen to roaring Star Wars fans who claim this movie to be one of the worst things ever and don't listen to those, who claim this one to be best thing since sliced bread.Attack of the Clones is above average, but not the greatest thing ever either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A definite improvement over ""The Phantom Menace"" but still not up to the level of the original trilogy","Episode II of the Star Wars saga, ""Attack of the Clones"" had the misfortune of following the poorly received first instalment. The good news is that it corrected most of the problems that plagued the first movie. While still not in the same league as the original trilogy, it was nevertheless a step in the right direction.Several cast members from the first movie returned and, thankfully, stars Ewan McGregor & Natalie Portman fared much better this time around. Additionally, Christopher Lee provided a strong villainous presence that was sorely lacking from the first movie. Hayden Christensen stepped into the role of Anakin Skywalker and he at least did better than Jake Lloyd, though that's a case of damning with faint praise. Admittedly, though, his character wasn't written especially well, so it wasn't all his fault.Speaking of writing, this time around George Lucas had the good sense to work with someone else on the screenplay. While the dialogue is still a bit stilted at times, the improvement is noticeable. Lucas also occupied the director's chair once again, with satisfactory results.From a technical standpoint, the movie is highly accomplished, even though some of the profuse CGI is overly ambitious. In any case, the visual effects ended up being the source of the film's sole Oscar nomination. As usual, John Williams's score was also a highlight.However, perhaps the most important difference this time around is that story is much more engaging as it really begins to set the stage for Anakin's inevitable transformation into Darth Vader. The movie's romantic elements may be awkward at times but, overall, the script does a pretty good job of balancing action and laying the foundation for the events to come.Ultimately, I think that ""Attack of the Clones"" is underrated. It does have some problems but it managed to set the trilogy back on the right track. Thankfully, the concluding chapter would continue this upward trend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It was very good, unlike what I had heard","It is now 2014 and I finally got to watch both Episode I and Episode II, during a weekend visit to some friends. Since the 3 prequels were released (I believe Episode III was in 2005) I have heard a lot of bad comments for the movies and Lucas specifically. That all he is after is money and franchising, bad director, bad writer and the like.When you expect less, you get more out of it. That is a rule of life. And perhaps this is the reason I enjoyed Episode II so much. Or, more precise, one of the reasons.The other reasons are that it fully immerses you into another world. This is imperative for a movie. I would go as far as saying that movies *are* immersion, above all other things. So this one, in my book, is a successful movie. You do get the feeling of watching a world similar to ours, but orders of magnitude bigger, were countries have been replaced by planets and nations by species. And they, too, have their problems. Politics, war, greed. The political and social references of the movie are not to be taken lightly. They were well thought out and make this movie enjoyable to watch by adults as well.Technically the movie looks fantastic, the plot feels realistic and the dialogs are good. The dialogs have seldom something smart in them, but they work. I would expect a little more humor and punchlines, but anyway, I suppose dialogs are not the strong part of the movie.I could go on for hours but its late. All I want to end up with is that the movie is immersive, has good plot, decent dialogs and does not stall much, at least much less than Episode I.The one thing I did not like and God I don't know how they allowed it to happen, is that Anakin simply can not act.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Terrible script & poor editing make this a poor clone,"I just watched this on DVD last night, having seen it in the theatre. I was very disappointed when I watched the scenes that had been cut, as they fleshed out the story a lot more than the final cut. You learned more about the wasp creatures near the end of the film and why Dooku enlisted their help. Padme's character was a lot more established as well in visits to her parents house and in a confrontation with Dooku.Many people have commented on the wooden acting of the two leads, which I somewhat agree with, but Christensen is not that bad an actor, and neither is Portman.The problem with both this film and Phantom Menace is Lucas' dialogue. He writes lines which no actor, even in a fantasy movie, can say without sounding like they're reading them off of cue cards. This can be excused when the line is SF technobabble, but when it's supposed to be intimate romance it comes off as clumsy, forced, and utterly unbelievable. Considering that we KNOW the ultimate fate of each of these characters, these make scenes where they are put in peril uninteresting, since you already know they'll survive. Lucas really blew the chance at creating highly developed, memorable characters in my opinion.In addition, both this and Phantom Menace sorely miss a solid supporting cast to the two cardboard character leads. Where is the Han Solo/Chewbacca/Lando of these movies? Watching the original trilogy, the chemistry between Han and Chewie gives the movies a much broader appeal than the soap opera Skywalker saga. Imagine the original trilogy with only Luke and Leia as the two main characters -- it'd be far less interesting!!!Ewan McGregor is given a lot more to do in this film as Obi-Wan, and he acquits himself very well, although I think the scenes on the clone world would have been much better if he had been accompanied by Mace Windu. We almost always see Jedis travel in pairs, until Kenobi's solo visit. Christopher Lee does well in the limited screen time he's given. Samuel L. Jackson gives a one note performance as Mace Windu ... we're never convinced that he's as powerful a warrior as he's said to be. And when a CGI Yoda is the most expressive character in the film, you know something's just not right.Lucas has really painted himself into a corner to deliver the goods in Episode III. In my opinion, to tie up all the loose ends he's created between Phantom Menace and this film, Episode III might have to be 4 hours long.In summary, this is a decent film for fans of the Star Wars saga, and certainly better than Phantom Menace, but it still doesn't break much new ground. Compared to the colorful entertaining space opera of the first trilogy it's rather dull and predictable. Hopefully Episode III will give Star Wars fans a movie that can be held up to the high standards of the originals.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The weakest Star Wars movie, but not a total disaster","I do agree that this is the weakest of the six Star Wars movies, but it wasn't by all means a terrible movie. I will admit the dialogue is weak and gets nowhere at times, the plot isn't as well thought out and felt convoluted at best, Haydn Christensen does give a truly abysmal performance as Anakin and although the presence of Jar Jar Binks was toned down here his presence anywhere seemed jarring. Still despite the major flaws, it is a marvel to look at with stunning sets and impeccable CGI. The battle sequences are well choreographed, the pace is somewhat brisker than in Phantom Menace and the performances with the exception of Christensen are very good.Natalie Portman is quite captivating as Queen Padma, and displays a lot of emotional depth. Frank Oz is excellent as always as Yoda, and Ewen MacGregor is more at home here than he was in Phantom Menace. There is no doubt though that the acting honours go to Christopher Lee as the villainous Count Dooku. Then again, Lee is an exceptional actor who can act anything you throw at him. Plus John Williams' music was outstanding. Overall, a decent movie while the weakest of the Star Wars franchise. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"I know most Star Wars fans were thoroughly disappointed with episodes 1-3, but I found the back up of the Trilogy to be great. Sure they weren't exactly the Trilogy, but I don't think I'd love Star Wars as much had the prequels not been made. They provided background and depth to the Trilogy, and they enable the Old Republic Era the evolve. I definitely understand why Lucas made these movies and appreciate them for what they have done for the Star Wars Universe.Attack of the Clones is by far the best of the Prequels.

If only they could have cloned Episode V,"What was it that set Darth Vader off to join the dark side of the force? This film suggests several possibilities: 1) The killing of his mother by Tusken Raiders caused him to channel John Wayne in 'The Searchers.' 2) Getting passed over during the N' Sync tryouts. 3) Discovering the woman of his dreams, upon closer inspection, is a carbonite mannequin. 4) Excess pressure on the back of his head from the so-'90s rattail he wears. 5) The shock of learning his father was evil guy Cole from ""Bachelor Party.""Hayden Christensen reminds me a lot of the character Robert Prescott played in ""Bachelor Party,"" and that's not a good thing. Prescott's supposed to be comically over-the-top in his smugness and arrogance. As I understand the story of ""Attack Of The Clones,"" young Anakin Skywalker is not comic relief. He is challenged by forces within him he can't control, and a sense of outrage at the way things are. He doesn't like being an apprentice, and he doesn't understand why his love for Princess (oops, now Senator) Amidala is not returned. It's a tough part, not Hamlet, but requires a more nuanced delivery than Christensen seems able to provide. Instead he sort of throws up a series of Tiger Beat poses. He sneers. He smirks. He seethes. Petulance is not a trait that makes one like a character. Before this film was over, I felt like yelling ""Hurry up and turn to the dark side so I can feel better about hating you!""Christensen is just one actor, but he is required to carry ""Attack of the Clones"" in a way no actor has before in the ""Star Wars"" series. So it's impossible to look past him and say something akin to ""Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?"" Here Christensen is the play.Getting another actor would have improved things a little, but not too much. The acting in ""Attack of the Clones"" is across-the-board abysmal. We lose the best in 'Phantom Menace,' Liam Neeson and (except for an embarrassingly clichéd death scene) Pernilla August. The remaining actors, Ewan MacGregor and especially Natalie Portman, slide into a state of near-catatonia. Portman's tight white lycra skinsuit means she's not only sexy but unencumbered by the ornate regalia that limited her projection in ""Phantom Menace."" So how come she's more wooden than ever? Obviously the direction was a problem. Lucas is legendarily weak at providing acting direction, but every one of the ""Star Wars"" films until this had at least serviceable performances. This was one of the worst-acted films I have seen, and I saw ""Manos: Hands Of Fate.""The annoying trait Lucas has of connecting everything with everything else finally comes a cropper here, after threatening to do so in ""Phantom Menace."" The Imperial Stormtroopers, it turns out, are cloned knock-offs of the father of one Boba Fett, future bounty hunter supreme. Why him? And why is the guy moonlighting as an assassin and not telling his boss about his sideline activity? We discover Anakin's mother was sold to some moisture farmers on Tatoonie with a suspiciously familiar love of blue milk. So why does someone get the bright idea of stashing away Darth Vader's offspring with the Evil One's own stepbrother, on Darth's home planet? The problem was the first time Lucas threw a connection at us, in 'Empire Strikes Back,' it was undeniably cool, maybe the best thing in the series. Now he can't resist four or five more trips to the well with each new picture. Meanwhile, his galaxy is becoming more inbred than a kennel of pugs.The story is more a series of set pieces than any in the saga, with no solid ""through line"" as screenwriters call it. Everyone runs off in different directions, and characters act with sudden bursts of motivation ascribed to strange feelings or catch-what-can. Christopher Lee's Count Dooku (or was that Duke Countoo) shows up as an interesting character that Lucas seems to want to make us wonder about, in a scene where he warns an imprisoned Obi-Wan about the influence of the Dark Side at the helm of the Republic and promises to help get him free. In that scene, he sounds like a renegade, even an ally. But then Dooku drops the charade and just sends Obi-Wan off to die. What was the point of having the scene in the first place? And also, if Dooku is a Jedi of such great skill, shouldn't he or someone in his great army have their sensors on when an armada of starships appears in the sky overhead?I like some things in the movie. As video wallpaper, it's kind of neat. The Stormtrooper arrival is fun, and Yoda's light saber battle. But the 'Star Wars' fan in me was bitterly disappointed.I'm sure Episode 3 will explain all these things away, and bring cohesion to Lucas' epic storyline. There's a better way for Lucas to have pulled that off: Stopping the series at ""Empire Strikes Back."" Am I the only one who wishes he did?",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Underrated but not perfect,"Attach of the clones is a very underrated Star Wars movie yes it's not perfect but is it as bad as lots of people say it is no its not. There is a lot of problems with this movie but there is some good things to. There is some great performances in this movie by most of the cast like Ewan mcgregor who gives the best performance in this movie. The villain count doku is great but there is also problems with him. The lightsaber fights are well shot and well made. The music is also great once again by John Williams. But theIr is a lot problems with attack of the clones. The story is all over the place and there is not really a set story with this movie. The villain count doku is a very great villain but the problem with him is he's barley in the movie he doesn't show up until an hour into the film and when he does show up there really isn't no threat of danger or anything by him until he captures Obi wan. The dialog in this movie is very sloppy and just bad from the infamous lines about sand and how anakin hates sand. Let's talk about Handen Christensen as Anakin he's awful as Anakin and he gives terrible performance. The love relationship between Anakin and Padme is also terrible you don't by into these 2 being in love at all because they are not supposed to be together and Padme is so on and off about her feelings for Anakin it's just bad. Overall, attack of the clones is not amazing Star Wars it's mediocre but it's not as bad as everyone says it is. Yes the pros are there but they can't save this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"well, it's a bit better than ""The Phantom Menace"", but that isn't saying a whole lot","""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" was one of the most colossally disappointing films I've ever seen in my life. Now comes the second installment in George Lucas's prequel trilogy to the epic narrative that broke box office records and set standards for generations to come. The second movie detailing the past of Darth Vader, ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is a little bit better, but that's not quite enough to make it a recommendable movie. It's close, but not quite. If it only they had thrown out Jar-Jar Binks (yes, I still cringe every time I think of that bumbling, frog-like freak), patched up some mediocre dialogue, reworked this sappy love story, and captured a better sense of the magic that we require for a Star Wars movie, it would have worked.In this one, Anakin Skywalker is grown up to a young Jedi and played by Hayden Christianson. Since Qui-Gon's dead, he is being taught by Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). While Obi-Wan's out fighting evil, Anakin begins a forbidden romance with Padme (Natalie Portman) and of course, well, trouble begins and lasers are blasting and...yeah....Now, I have nothing against a love story. Some of my all-time favorite movies are love stories. But I require two things: a good story and a conviction that the lovers are in deed, in love. I got neither of those from this. The 'romance' between Christianson and Portman is very shallow with utterly ridiculous and hammy dialogue such as ""to me, you will always be that little boy on Tatooine."" Thus, in the end, this subplot is boring, tiresome, and sappy. Not a good combination and not what we want to see in any element of a Star Wars movie. I thought Jack Lloyd was not a very good young Anakin Skywalker in ""The Phantom Menace"" and Hayden Christianson is awkward and wasted here in a miscast role. Again, with this, we need to have that daunting feeling that Anakin, young, innocent, and loyal to the Jedi will one day betray them and become a cold-blooded killer. We don't get that feeling. Because the original narrative and this new one don't seem to be related beyond plot. The original trilogy was artistic, imaginative, and realized good characters and stories. This new one is just like a hokey video game.Unfortunately, the screenplay entire is crippled by bad dialogue and unnecessary characters. However, I am not going to trash on this movie too much, because I must admit, it was very close for me. There was more of an adventurous sense to the picture, which was absent in ""The Phantom Menace"", and I really enjoyed some parts including a scene where Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan have to fight with three alien monsters in a ring very much like the gladiatorial fights of Ancient Rome. And thankfully, Jar-Jar Binks has a much smaller part in this picture. That's always a relief. Overall, it's not too bad of a picture. It's tolerable, but it doesn't quite deserve to bear the words Star Wars in its title. Thankfully, by the third prequel, ""Revenge of the Sith"", things would improve.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Terrific Addition to the Franchise,"I'm going back and watching all six Star Wars films so I can go see ""The Force Awakens"", and last night I watched ""Episode II: Attack of the Clones"".I have to say that I find this to be a really enjoyable movie. I tried not to like it when it first came out due to its name. Seriously, George Lucas...""Attack of the Clones""? I mean, I get it, but there were lots of options for a better name than that. ""The Clone Army"" would have sufficed. But I digress...Again, I really like this movie. It suffers from a bit of poor dialogue and bad acting between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen--their on screen romance feels very much like a bad daytime soap opera rather than something worthy of the Star Wars franchise.And yet, that bit of dissatisfaction aside, I find this to be a fantastic film overall. The storyline is great. The opening chase scene is great. Obi-Wan's search for the missing planet is great. The final battle is great. Most all of it is great.And, one thing that I greatly appreciate about this film is Christopher Lee's performance as Count Dooku. Funny name aside, Lee turns out a convincing portrayal of a lead antagonist that makes you understand what the Dark Side is all about. I found Darth Maul to be rather lacking as a villain in ""Phantom Menace"", but Lee makes up for this in profound fashion.But I suppose the most important thing that I enjoy about this movie is that it just brings so many pieces of the puzzle together. Anakin's story advances in a way that is plausible and believable, even if Christensen's portrayal suffers at times. This movie sets up his path to the Dark Side in profound fashion, and makes the six films flow together. I like that sense of continuity, and so I'm giving this movie 8/10 stars. Again, the cheesy soap opera stuff between Anakin and Amidala is a major blow to the film--but all in all it's a great movie.Side Note: If I wanted to, I could get really critical about one element of the overall plot here. This whole Dark Side thing and the people involved in the plot to take over the Republic goes completely unnoticed by Yoda and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson). That really cheapens the whole Jedi thing, in my view--the most powerful Jedi in the world are right in the midst of the people who are orchestrating the fall of the Republic, and they can't even sense it. Strange. Same goes for the fact that Dooku's back story is so wrapped up in the Jedi. How could they never sense this disturbance in the force in a way that would root it out?Whatever the case, that does bother me when I think critically about the film. But I try not to do that, but to instead watch it at face value and enjoy it for what it is, and on that merit I give it the 8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great Action, Boring Romance","Ten years after the invasion of Naboo, the Galactic Republic is facing a Separatist movement and the former queen and now Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) travels to Coruscant to vote on a project to create an army to help the Jedi to protect the Republic. On the arrival, she escapes from an attempt to kill her and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned to protect her. They chase the shape-shifter Zam Wessell (Leeanna Walsman) but she is killed by a poisoned dart before revealing the identity of who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover the bounty hunter that has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo.

From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. There are slow spots, but to me the movie is too good to dismiss based on them. Some great costumes and dialog move it all along. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting.

More space wars and the film hints at a darkness in the making.,Star Wars Episode II-Attack of the Clones is a story that continues the journey of the Jedi Knights and their fight with evil of the dark federation. The film picks up 10 years later with now Anakin Skywalker growing up and more yet he's still being trained by Obi-Wan you can see that young Skywalker is stubborn and soon may slip to the evil side of the dark empire as the top Jedi masters can even feel it. However in the current time Anakin has started a romance with Padme who use to be a former senator and things are more complex when the empire puts out an assassination attempt out on her life. The Jedi army then has to take her back to Naboo for her protection.

Nevertheless, I think that it is not worthy of so much criticism, in particular from the West, because both ""The Hidden Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" are really good films for the history of star Wars, and the number of advantages here is a clear plus, unlike the cons.

The musical score was awesome and the ending score of the movie was very well written. I am going to watch this movie again soon but tonight, I am watching SW3 and then back to 5 and 6.

Not Deserving of All the Hate,"Introduction:Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is easily the most despised of the Star Wars films. But does it deserve that title? I don't think so. And I don't care what people claim. Sure, it's on the bottom of every Star Wars movie ranking list, but does that change my opinion? No. Attack of the Clones is a seriously underrated film, and a film deserving of a lot more praise than it gets.Defense:Many people complain about Anakin's characterization, the overuse of CGI, the film's dialogue, and that the film is apparently boring. But I don't think any of that criticism is valid. Now, let me explain it all more thoroughly and debunk the regurgitated arguments against the film.The most common criticism is against film is the performance of Hayden Christensen. I've said this on numerous occasions, and I have to say it again, I think his performance was great. And in the context of the character's story and the way he's written, the performance makes sense. Anakin was born in as a slave, and in the previous film, the Jedi took him out of that slave life. And took him away from his mother. They also forbid him from doing many things, like showing emotion, and they didn't let him interact with Padme, a person he was infatuated with for quite some time. Not allowed to show his emotions, he was forced to bottle up his feelings.And now, getting visions of his mother, who hasn't scene in a while, possibly dying. As well as finally meeting Padme again, for the first time in years. So when people complain about him acting awkward around her, it's because he's talking to a girl he likes, and has liked for years. Also, Anakin never really learned how to talk to people who weren't Jedi. So for people who complain that Anakin doesn't act normal, it's because he never learned how to. With the performance and writing, makes sense for him to act the way he does, all monotone. And him few spurts of emotion make sense as well.And many also criticize the acting of everyone, and I disagree with this complaint. The acting in the Original Trilogy, was quite hokey and doesn't hold up. But people don't hate on that. It's okay to criticize it if you don't like it, you just can't be a hypocrite.Many also hate the apparent ""overuse"" of CGI and computer effects. I never got this criticism. At the time, the CGI looked great and was revolutionary, and sure it doesn't hold up today, but of course it's gonna age. The Original Trilogy had effects that were ahead of their time. But those don't hold up either. And that's fine, those movies are still great. It's just a fact that some aspects of a film will age. Great films coming out today that use computer effects, wait 10 years, they'll age. Avengers: Endgame, a great movie, came out this year, and uses just as much CGI, but do people complain, no. Again, don't be a hypocrite, and be consistent. Apply everything to the same level of scrutiny. And honestly, I like the decision to add as many effects as they did. It gives a film a look that's different from the Original trilogy, but still something that looks like Star Wars film. And it was a bold choice on Lucas's part. Effects age, but do know what doesn't age? Good writing. And trust me this film has it.And most criticize this film's dialogue. Similar to the acting, the Originals had dialogue just as bad. But of course, people forget about that. And I know, many might be asking about the line. ""I don't like sand."", I think the parodies and spoofs of that line, are very funny. But the line is not that bad. Sure it's been made fun of, but it's just one line. That kind of has a poetic meaning to it, as Anakin was born on Tatooine, a sand planet, where he was a slave. Not having the fondest memories from living there, he would probably grow a hatred for anything that reminds him of that planet. And yes, I groan at the line. But it's not as bad as most claim.Another common criticism with it is the apparent fact that the film is ""boring"". Every reviewer on the Internet has vomited out this poorly thought out argument. But, they never explain it. Is it the romance? Is the action? What is it? In every prequel hate video that I've watched, it's never been explained properly, so it's a little hard to rebuttal. I was never bored watching it. Considering the invalid and ridiculous criticisms I've debunked, I think it's boring to them, because they weren't paying attention to the film, which is what all the haters do.Conclusion:Many people believe that it's a fact that the prequels are bad. No, it's all opinion. It's all objective. And if this review didn't convince you to view the film the way I do. That's fine, I don't ask you to like this movie. I just want you to know my opinion. Because I use to hate this film to. Because of what Internet reviewers claimed about it. But upon recent reevaluation. I realized the film is not that bad. So I ask you to think for yourself. Do you hate it because you think it's bad? Or because the Internet told you? I asked myself that, and came to my conclusion, and you should come to yours.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Magic is Gone,"There used to be a time when Star Wars was the best thing since sliced bread. Of course I was about 7 then but nonetheless it was the ultimate for many people of my generation, and then we grew up but perhaps it is that I have grown up that I didn't enjoy this one wanting a film for adults. I entered the cinema expecting some good old fashioned galatic action despite the let down of the Phantom Menace but instead what I got was two hours of largely tedium.At base level all the ingredients were there but there was nothing else, this film was completely empty at heart. What the original movies had in charm, in script and in the endearing performance of their cast (even Mark Hamill pulled it off in the end) was largely lacking here. The two leads of Christensen and Portman cannot act to save their lives, sadly in this movie their lives were saved and we'll have to experience more of their slushy badly scripted romance in the third. They have all the physical chemistry onscreen of a couple of neutered dogs.The depth of their romance which is one of the central planks of the movie is comparable to an infants swimming pool, clearly George Lucas has been reading too much Mills and Boon and spent way too long on his special effects computers to remember just how humans work.The supporting cast headed by Macgregor are patchy too though Macgregor is head and shoulders above the two teenage leads and at times manage to act with some gusto. Much has been said about Christopher Lee and Samuel L Jackson but they are just playing themselves being competent enough actors to just turn up for work and perform regardless of what he director says. Compared to their past performances they are both underwhelming too.I've already mentioned the love aspect of the story, this was also supposed to be a dark plot with plenty of evil and of course Anakin turning to the dark-side. For what is supposed to be the defining moment of the entire series we get a whole three minutes of screentime where he kills people. As to get a PG rating the slaughter is glossed over and barely shown on camera it's left to the actor to communicate what happened but the evil growing in him is completely skirted around with a little bit of sobby stuff that simply isn't convincing - at no time do we see someone being corrupted by power which is really a lost opportunity.Lost opportunities is what this film is full of though, inside is a really good story struggling to get out but the issues are dumbed down to make them suitable for children to understand. The lack of invention in it is also stunning, why introduce Jango Fett at all except to cash in on the popularity of Boba Fett, why have Kenobi hide behind an asteroid like Han Solo does in Empire Strikes Back with a star destroyer? Why did we get those terrible C3PO puns and what was it with Yoda ever having a walking stick if he can fight like a whirling dervish on speed? Why does a changeling keep it's face and not get a new one then try to kill Kenobi.The only part of the script I did appreciate was the ever annoying Jar Jar being the cause of the rise of the Empire, ooh the irony. Script aside Star Wars has always been something of an effects movie but these days it's simply not impressive enough when compared to Lord of the Rings. The saturation of the colours throughout the film make it all look cartoony, and the CGI does look like CGI although it is much improved on the previous film with Yoda at last looking real. I imagine this is where the majority of the work went on the film but it's just not good enough. I do wish that Lucas would get back to the gritty colour tones used in the first two films, they certainly added to the realism but the Disney look seems to have infected the franchise too deeply.Not only are many of the effects lacking any believability but Lucas can't direct action, something that is a major flaw in a film that has perhaps half of it as action scenes. We get lasers zapping everywhere but there is no coherence with the editing and it all ends up a bit confusing with none of the excitement that should be there.The problem with editing recurs throughout the film with the love story intercut with the discovery of the clone army badly done, why do we keep coming back from an interesting story to one that just turns people off, something that was obvious in the cinema as you could hear people groan everytime the teenage lovers were on.The sound though is superb, watching at home on my Dolby 5:1 did make it a bit more of an experience but if you are relying on technical details to carry a film then you really shouldn't be making it to start with. Anyone can buy a decent sound engineer for a movie, and just be limited by budget but not anyone can get a good performance out of an actor, then the limit is talent.Let's face it that George Lucas is nothing more than a glorified technician being way past his limits is trading on the goodwill of fans from movies he did 25 years ago. He's no great director or writer and should leave that to others, perhaps then we can get the Star Wars movies that we all want, and perhaps he can come to rival the grosses of the old films again but I fear the magic will have gone by then. score - 4/10 for sentimental reasons.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fan Film,"George Lucas has finally done it. He has made a movie for the fans. This ranks as high as my favorite Empire Strikes Back in someways better. I love the themes, the music the plot. A very eree parallel to the same series of events and similar circumstances Luke went through however Anakin is having it a lot worse than Luke did in my opinion. This new kid Hayden Christensen was perfect for Anakin. He played a very convincing person I could forsee becoming Darth Vader. He better be in Episode 3. And Natalie Portman, she gets more and more beautiful in every movie. Ewan McGregor is the best Obi Wan Kenobi. I hope that the actor playing Jango returns as Boba Fett (with some growth acceleration) for Episode 3. This movie was such an excellent parallel to Empire Strikes Back. Episode 1 paralleled A New Hope, kind of their own establishing movies that weren't that in depth. You know they are going to parallel Episode 3 with Return of the Jedi, I forsee Anakin fighting and slaying Dooku taking his place at Palpatine's side.Nice Job George! This film was fantastic.

Episode II  Attack of the Clones - Exhilarating!,"After what many perceived to be a weak entry in the prequel trilogy of the star wars movies with regards to TPM. Lucas still 'did his own thing' and produced one of the most breathtaking, exhilarating and fantastic star wars films to date. In this film we have already established characters thrust upon the cinema screen once again. The opening scroll is simpler than in TPM, it doesn't require us to think, it just puts us into the right frame of mind to pick up the story. As soon as we see a ship gliding through the foggy clouds we see straight away that something is amiss in the republic. The bright and breezy republic in the previous film seems to be bathed in fog. Difficult to see the dark side is. Lucas said these are silent movies and the visuals tell their own story and it happens a lot in this film, like the Darth Vader silhouette that had no digital tinkering whatsoever . The footage of Anakin with his robes on was basically a mirror image of darth vader but without the helmet. The footage of Padme next to him was strikingly reminiscent of Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi. Absolutely everything in this movie is intriguing, Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates a clone facility on the planet of Kamino. A mysterious Sifo Dyas placed an order for the Clone army based on a template of a Bounty Hunter called Jango Fett. Jango Fett states he was employed by a man called Darth Tryannus. We find a former Jedi, Count Dooku knows all about the corruption in the senate, even if the Jedi arnt yet aware and plans to do something about it. Secretly creating a new order with the goal to build an army powerful enough to fight the Republics army. A republic army which was mysteriously started at the Clone facility even though the Jedi Council were not aware! Confused? Nointrigued? Most definitely. Anakin Skywalker also gets given a sole mission on his own. Its here that the much vaunted love story begins. To be honest, it's a bit choppy and seems rushed. Its not a smooth romance like in The Empire Strikes Back, instead it's a romance which reeks of desperation, as if the characters themselves know about their impending doom and they just want to be as one before the inevitable happens. The deleted scenes on the DVD really should have been implemented within the film. They are gold, with regards to character motivations and shows little glimpses of their affection to each other. Would have made the final, declaration of love scene less jarring. In fact, would have been completely smooth and believable. The final showpiece in this film is the Clone Wars, they begin on a planet called Geonosis and this is where the film gives us a scene so wonderful it just keeps on piling the cherry's on top of the cake. A superb full scale war better than anything in any star wars movie happens, its absolute mayhem and its absolutely brilliant. But it doesent end there, we have not one lightsaber fight, not two, but three. With the third being one of the most memorable of all time. Also, a plot point that culminated in A New Hope makes its entrance here and it left me absolutely gob smacked Basically, this film is everything you would want in a star wars movie. Is it the best star wars film out there? Quite possible, difficult to call. Had George Lucas just gone with the flow and put in the Padme/Anakin deleted scenes plus toned down the over bearing nature of Anakin in the fireplace scene (after reading an earlier draft there's some vocal foreplay at the beginning that would have been great to have in the final movie) then this would have been the best Star Wars film without a doubt. We see intrigue, we see action and we see the galaxy begin to rot away in a very obvious way. The beginning of the end.Four Stars out of Five.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The second part of the prequels. What's the verdict?,"Attack of the Clones, the second episode of the prequel trilogy, is the one where the new Star Wars episodes actually started, because the movie still is a Star Wars episode, but it doesn't have that SW feel to it that the original episodes and Phantom Menace had.The story takes place 10 years after the events from Phantom Menace. Anakin (Hayden Christensen)is now a grown up Padawan. He's assigned to protect Padme, after several assassination attempts have been foiled. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan' investigation takes him to Kamino, where a army for the Republic, made entirely out of clones, has been prepared. It also seems that the Trade Federation has a darker power and a wider influence that the Republic could have imagined.The plot evolves pretty slowly from ""intersting, but boring"" in the beginning to "" amazing!"" in the end. The first part is mainly about Obi-Wan's investigation and Ani's ongoing romance with Padme. And I swear, the romance scenes are so cheesy and frequent, they simply get on the viewer's nerves.Hayden Christensen is another hated actor of the series. Yes, he's not convincing or strong, but he does have some moments. I could list other actors that didn't do their best, but I'll just shut up.Attack of the Clones also introduces us to little Boba Fett and his father, Jango Fett, Owen and Beru and a new Sith - Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). He's intimidating, but that's just because of his voice. The battle scenes, which are mainly towards the end are spectacular, we can clearly notice that both the Republic and the Trade Federation got more powerful.Here's another fact: this is the first Star Wars movie in which Yoda is fully CGI. Is that good? He is now more expressive, and he participates in a battle scene, so it is. Imagine a battle scene with puppet Yoda...One more complaint: the droids are in the movie, but R2 is the only useful one. 3PO has absolutely no use! He just argues with R2 and gets himself into trouble, while contributing nothing to the plot. He's the Jar-Jar of the movie (except Jar-Jar did help our heroes). Speaking of him, he's present too, but this time he's barely on the screen, so he's no longer part of the problem.Overall, Attack of the Clones is a step forward, combining a slow, but detailed and well-done plot with excellent effects and average acting, horrible romance scenes and great battle scenes.Final Score: 3.5/5 or 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Lightsabers! Robots! Spaceships! Aliens! Bounty Hunters! Etc! Yes, it's Star Wars.","Stick a lightsaber in a movie and I'm happy. Seriously. Not a biased review whatsoever. 10 years after the battle of Naboo (in The Phantom Menace) Anakin has grown into a talented Jedi, though very reckless. He also has all the traits teenagers have- moody, irresponsible, fancies the pretty senator... that kind of thing. Obi Wan's becoming increasingly concerned over his Padawans behaviour, while the Jedi Council struggle to keep the peace as the galaxy appears to be on the brink of war. Amidala, former Queen of Naboo and now senator, is placed under protection of the Jedi after an assassination attempt- unfortunately her 'Jedi bodyguard' can't necessarily be trusted...Boo hoo if you want to moan about prequels, Ewoks, Jar Jar, Anakins ghost, directors re- edited special ultimate redux DVD editions, whatever. Star Wars rocks. Fact. The film hardly lets up pace from the chase through Coruscant to Obi Wan's Raymond Chandler-esquire investigation into the development of a clone army (the precursor to the Stormtroopers of the original trilogy) to the finale when war is declared and just about the biggest Jedi showdown ever (so far). And I won't even mention what happens when you mess with Anakins mother...Classic tale of good versus evil, jaw dropping special effects, plenty of that'll-tie-in-to- Episode-IV-nicely moments...And you think Episode II was good?

Must be popular to attack Star Wars,"I can't believe the amount of negative press this movie has gotten. But then I'm not a Star Wars fanatic. I loved the first one and enjoyed both Empire and Return of the Jedi. Phantom Menace would have been better without Jar Jar Binks but I would still rate that viewing experience as positive also. The dislike for this film may be explained by the bandwagon effect. It's become popular to bash Star Wars. If you forget the first three films, after all this is a separate trilogy, there is some good stuff. The special effects are superb, the acting salvages most of the dialogue and the plot moves along at a respectable clip. The viewer is left with a sense of foreboding over what is to come in episode three.I thought Hayden Christensen did a good job as Anakin. Admittedly I was in agony when he gave that speech about being in agony but I fault Lucas' screenplay for that not him. Natalie Portman however just didn't cut it as Amidala. She sounded too much like a little girl and not enough a young woman. She was bland in The Phantom Menace and doesn't do any better here. Ewan McGregor is great as Obi-Wan, sounding a lot like the late Alec Guiness.The plot wasn't as slow or confusing as I'd read in other posts. I'm looking forward to the third one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not enough of a Clone of what came before for us to hate it, but still lacking a certain something.","The Star Wars series sputters and stutters into a second prequel here, in the form of ""Attack of the Clones""; an entry which probably improves slightly on the opening episode, but still seems to fall short, often on the basics, for it to feel like it is a proper piece of mythical story-telling.Indeed, after having appeared to alienate audiences with a saggy narrative involving both diplomatic disagreements and political strife in 1999's ""The Phantom Menace"", Lucas is back and daring to re-tread relatively similar ground in his telling of a detective story about why a group of aliens might want to break away from a thousand year old galactic union to form a rival power-block. Told parallel is a more grounded love story between a bourgeoning male autocrat and the queen of a tropical planet which, because it involves that whom we know will become Darth Vader, is probably slightly more interesting, although is not powerful enough to carry the film alone.Suffice to say, Lucas doesn't quite hit either strand out of the park; you wait, patiently, for the spark, urging them both on to get there, but neither quite make it. By the end, the characters feel too much like action heroes, and do not feel like flawed people with problems and emotions.Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are back, ten years after the events of Episode One, and have been brought in by the Jedi council to protect the returning Queen of Naboo, Amidala (Natalie Portman), who is in a metropolis to help prevent the break-up of the Republic - something being brought about by the aforementioned alien solar systems who are leaving en masse. We're told that voting ""to form an army"" is the solution to this.The film opens with the assassination of somebody close to Amidala and omnipresent in the first episode - an attempt at distancing the film from ""Phantom Menace"", perhaps? The Queen suspects somebody called Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), but the rest of the characters dismiss this, so seeding doubt in the minds of the audience. Remarkably for this kind of story, the actual villain does not appear until the final act. Following a second assassination attempt, whereby a hitman oddly hires a hitman amidst the clever backdrop of neon signs that invoke iconography of the sleazy and shady, it is seemingly accepted that Amidala leaving her home was a mistake and she is carted back with Anakin, despite nobody actually thinking he is up to the job. Kenobi, meanwhile, hunts for the origin of these assassination attempts.Refreshingly, the film does not come to a grinding halt like the last episode once everybody decamped to Tatooine. Kenobi's strand, in the spirit of the more popular Star Wars entries, keeps moving and encompasses a series of action scenes, one of which is a neat hand-to-hand combat sequence in a terrific rainstorm upon a flight platform with smoothed-out edges going all the way down to a watery grave. One other sequence in this strand involves a spaceship chase which heads into an asteroid belt, something C3PO stated in ""V"" was practically suicide, but hey-ho. Surely when you chuck a tracking device onto another spaceship, that means you don't have to fly so close to it... I suppose it's good for an action scene when you do, though...Unfortunately, none of it really amounts to anything particularly immersive. I think the conflict was supposed to radiate out of this strand, but there really isn't any - when we finally meet the villain, his ideas actually sound like common-sense: what if there IS a force of great evil, undetected, destroying the Union from within? What if this incognito clone army IS needed to fight off the true enemy? There is a terrible moment when Kenobi, unbeknownst to the bad-guys, overhears precisely what he needs to hear in the form of a plot, purely for the benefit of the film's progression, as the villains congregate to discuss details they would all have already known by now. The scene is needed for the benefit of the audience because it wasn't set up properly in the first act.The other half, as stated, is a little more substantial. Where Kenobi's strand is full of special effects and green-screen technology, and is telling a cold, hard story of investigation, the segments involving Portman and Christensen's characters' love story is about emotions; blooming feelings and unfolds amidst the beautiful true-to-life backdrops of Italy. While this contrast works better than it has any right to, the tale itself just doesn't quite blow us away; Amidala's behaviour is inconsistent, maintaining that, as a senator, she cannot get involved with a Jedi one minute, but is seemingly happy to strip to some leather nightwear in a warmly lit bedroom scene with him the next.Meanwhile, whilst their political views seem to clash in a later scene in a meadow, her response to Anakin's newfound love of the violence which came with an act of revenge seems to sit quite easily with her. While the dialogue is generally pretty bad (""A poisonous dart!""), one decent aspect of this strand is the emphasis on how Anakin feels for Amidala through what he says: the feelings of sickness and the missing her, etc.Alas, and already worn down by a coliseum battle, a worthy-enough climax in itself, the film creeps towards a final fight which, despite its impressive choreography, isn't actually about anything other than said choreography. I think the difference between these prequels and the original trilogy is the fact the first three unfolded during a time of war, so were quite easily afforded a sense of conflict: Empire v Rebels might be simplistic, but it is effective. Here, the conflict is either interior, which means working damn hard to bring about something of some substance, or is with characters (trade organisations; faceless Counts, etc.) which are just not very threatening. ""Clones"" works in places, but too often feels like not very much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Big Steaming Pile of Dooku,"Can you follow moving objects with your eyes? If that's all it takes to thrill you, then watching ""Attack of the Clones"" may well be the most titillating experience of your life! The barrage of mobile things on the screen just doesn't cease. There's even something here for the audio buffs...plenty of those signature rumbling ships, whizzing lasers, and humming lightsabers. Pair up those noises with the visuals, and you have a summer blockbuster!George Lucas is back, all right...with the second worthless Star Wars movie in a row. I can't understand the ridiculously effusive praise that the majority of reviewers here seem to be heaping upon this stinker. I can only hope that most of the people who hated it felt no inclination to review it at all. I especially love the masterminds who proclaim, ""If you don't like it, don't go see it."" Yeah, thanks. So we're supposed to walk into the theater with a pre-formed positive opinion? Morons!If I plunk down $10 for a widget that I soon discover doesn't work, am I not entitled to get a refund or at least a replacement? Of course! Warranties and the Better Business Bureau were created for precisely this purpose! Well, I paid money to see Episode II, and I was extremely disappointed. So why is it that I'm somehow not entitled to criticize Lucas?George Lucas is just plain lazy...a lazy director and a lazy storyteller. And audiences are lazy for letting him off the hook so easily. Incidentally, Lucas himself deserves absolutely no credit for the ""incredible"" CGI. His studio paid other people to do that. You will probably never know their names. And I'm positive that Lucas is profiting far more from this venture than all of them combined.Look, Lucas has countless millions at his disposal. He damn well should shoot for an Oscar-caliber film! Or maybe he's just too afraid of the challenge, so he rests on his laurels and hides behind the brand-name of this movie franchise. And when the critics come out of the woodwork, he can babble on about how it's ""not supposed to be great filmmaking"" or some other lame excuse. Lazy, lazy, lazy.A few others here have panned the lifeless acting, glaring plot inconsistencies, and general lack of true Star Wars atmosphere more eloquently than I could, so feel free to comb through the effluvium of laudation below to find the few precious gems of honest criticism.Never mind the absurd Yoda fight scene, which will only appeal to those who can't let well enough alone and who demand that every movie character be proficient in some martial art. Why, why, why must every big budget sci-fi or action movie nowadays give a nod to ""The Matrix""? Can't Yoda just remain a gentle, wizened teacher?The only thing I really liked about this movie was the Tusken Raider encampment. It wasn't overdone or garish, just very Star-Wars-ian. Of course, it was quickly ruined by Schmi's hilarious death scene. In reference to Anakin, a little boy sitting behind me in the theater said, without a trace of irony, ""What's he so sad about?""

All in a piece of fruit.,"The fundamental flaws in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones are pretty much summed up in a single scene in this film. Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala are sitting at a dinner table (?), and decide to share a piece of fruit. And during this entire scene, the piece of fruit is completely computer generated, and it shows. It's horribly obvious when Anakin slices it in half, and becomes downright inexcusable when Padme takes a bite of it. We can see the actors are just miming the motions. God has killed a kitten because of this.That piece of fruit symbolizes everything unholy about this film.It symbolizes the hollow acting Lucas deliberately set out to draw from each performer. We have talented actors here, we know they can do better than this because we've seen them do better than this. Well, except Hayden Christensen. A friend's mother really gave an accurate assessment of him when she said that he was really good at what he did: going berserk and then crying about it later. ""I don't wanna fight."" His performance was as forced as everything else in the film.The script? Don't even get me started. People who defend this film from its detractors as saying ""Star Wars never had good dialogue, that's not the point"" are certainly semi-justified, but what they aren't realizing is that there was at least a small standard of quality in the first trilogy. There's a reason The Empire Strikes Back is actually considered a good film. No, the dialogue and acting were never really that great, but they were tolerable, and light years ahead of this dreck. Every plot development seems forced, every line cliche. The worst part is that this is even a step backward from Episode I, and is liberally sprinkled with painful one-liners that are supposed to be witty exchanges. Folks, when I want one-liners, I'll watch Army of Darkness. If this is going to be a serious film, they need to take a hiatus.Perhaps the piece of fruit is most symbolic of the film overall in that the film, like the fruit, looks beautiful but somehow horribly false and impossible to believe (the CG looks like a step DOWN from Phantom Menace, I swear), and is ultimately nothing but air. It's hollow, there's no substance here. The sense of fun present in the original trilogy, and even a little in Phantom Menace, is totally gone. It looks and feels like it was a chore for everyone involved to make, including Lucas himself.I suspect Star Wars fans will finally wake up to this one like they did to Episode I and it will plummet off the top 250 here. The reality of it is that the only true Star Wars films are the original trilogy, and this senseless new trilogy will probably ultimately be disowned like Alien 3, RoboCop 3, Halloween III (noticing a pattern?), and other poor sequels. ...all in a piece of fruit.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Multiple viewings only make it more obvious what a wasted opportunity this series is getting to be.,"** out of ****My interest in Star Wars is rather casual. I'll watch the movies in theaters, but not with the massive expectations so many people have. Truth be told, the only film in the series to truly impress me on virtually every level was The Empire Strikes Back (Star Wars was great fun as well, though with weaker dialogue and acting than ESB). But movies like these are rare, these big-budget slices of escapism that harken back to the old days of Saturday matinee serials, only with (much) higher production values and (in this case, marginally) better acting. Damn, I seriously can't wait for Indiana Jones 4.I actually looked forward to Attack of the Clones. The premise offered more opportunities, the special effects would be slicker than ever, and surely, even George Lucas could have improved his writing skills after the results we saw in Phantom Menace. But in the end, it's not much of an improvement over Menace, in fact, I'm not even sure it's an improvement at all. Despite the occasional energetic effort behind the camera, Attack of the Clones is mostly lifeless, pedestrian, and boring.It starts off quite well, with a failed assassination attempt on Senator Amidala's (Natalie Portman) life. For protection, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned as her bodyguards. If you'll recall, Anakin had a bit of a crush on Amidala in Phantom Menace and nothing has changed the ten years since. Anyway, another assassination attempt on Amidala fails yet again, with Kenobi and Anakin hot on the heels of the would-be assassin. This leads to a spectacular speeder chase that puts the similar sequence in The Fifth Element to complete shame. So far, so good.But whatever hopes I had for the movie were shattered soon afterward, when the film's core plot, the love story, became the central focus. I'm actually a sucker for a good ""forbidden love"" romance; I loved Titanic, enjoyed Sabrina, and even found myself mildly won over by Fools Rush In. But the love story here is so dull, it bears nothing in the way of vitality or genuine chemistry. It's like watching a brother and sister kiss (disturbing memories of Leia and Luke's kiss are all flooding back in).Though Christensen and Portman fail to strike any sparks, it's not entirely their faults. George Lucas and Jonathan Hales' dialogue is horribly silly, there's actually a scene where Anakin compares and contrasts Amidala with sand, of all things. The culmination of Amidala's declaration of love for Anakin doesn't feel right, especially since it comes so soon after his murderous actions, which she apparently forgets almost immediately after he confesses to her.Christensen is an actor with maybe a kernel of potential. I've never seen Life as a House, but I keep hearing a lot of good things about him. As Anakin, he displays many of the qualities we expect: he's arrogant, hot-headed, rash, and temperamental. Christensen's delivery of the dialogue could easily lead one to assume that he's a no-talent pretty boy actor, but it's a bit more complex than that. Lucas' dialogue almost never does him any favors, even if the script does give him the opportunity to expand his ever-growing hostile personality. That the Jedi council doesn't pay more attention to him is a bit of a mystery, they know the kid's got potential (that's an understatement if I ever heard one), but even when he slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken raiders, he's not even berated for such actions (to be fair, it's not like he told anyone, though Yoda clearly sensed his feelings during the massacre).Natalie Portman is a proven talent, but much like Christensen, you could never guess it from her performance. She gives it her best try, but to no avail, coming off as one-dimensional, basically a perfectly safe role model for young girls everywhere without the slightest hint of flaw in her noble personality. It's a portrayal of cartoonish decency, written as only George Lucas could have.Like The Empire Strikes Back, the story splits into two narratives. Sharing screen time with the love story is Obi-Wan Kenobi's investigation of the assassination attempts. Hercule Poirot (or Indiana Jones, for that matter, who proved quite the clever historian at putting together clues to find his sacred artifact), he is not. Piecing together clues is obviously not Kenobi's forte. The script goes out of its way to make him look like an idiot (and the people he's investigating even bigger idiots!); take for instance, the scene where he finds no trace of a star system in the planetary archives, and has to inquire Yoda and a class of padewan learners why it's not on the map (duh, it was removed).His investigation leads him to the water-logged planet of Kamino. This is by far the most visually stimulating of the film's newly introduced worlds (too bad it's all glanced over). The Kaminoans live on ports supported in the same way an oil rig would be, only presumably in a far more complex manner, given the size of these habitats.  Kenobi discovers a clone army that was apparently ordered by a Jedi master named Sifo-Diyas, except the guy's been dead for ten years. The army was cloned from bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), whose New Zealand accent leads me to believe there's a planet full of Australians somewhere in that galaxy.This converging storyline is only somewhat more interesting than the love story, but at least it sets up a couple of reasonably cool (albeit very short) action sequences, including Kenobi's hair-raising battle with Fett and an asteroid chase that'll remind many of The Empire Strikes Back. Ewan Mcgregor is a fine actor, easily the best of the film's leads, so you at least get the joy of watching this guy emulate Alec Guinness almost perfectly.Attack of the Clones is a much darker picture than Phantom Menace, but not necessarily any better as a result. The pacing here is almost as weak (in both films, we have fun bookending sequences and an elongated boring middle segment) and the climactic action sequences (six of them in the last thirty-five minutes!) are something of a mixed bag.My attention snapped back when the film suddenly came to life around the hour fifty-minute mark with a knockout battle sequence between several Jedi and hundreds of droids inside a massive coliseum. This setpiece boasts the film's most rousing scene, a scuffle between Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson, one of my faves, but clearly acting from a script beneath his talents), Jango Fett, and a giant rhino-like creature. The creature first charges at Windu, then charges at Fett, and finally there's a spectacularly rousing showdown between Windu and Fett that had my blood boiling. Damn, I wish this film had more moments like that.The succeeding action sequences don't fare as well, particularly the lightsaber duel between Anakin and evil Count Dooku (played well by Christopher Lee), which is quite a few steps backward from the climactic duel in Phantom Menace. Without the athletic moves of Ray Park, it's basically an eighty-year old man swinging a big stick of light at a twenty-year old, pretty boy actor.The film's silly title sparked a lot of arguments from defensive Star Wars fans (one friend of mine actually defended the title by saying it was good because it informed us what the plot would be covering) (that is, without a doubt, the lamest reasoning I've ever heard regarding the quality of a movie's title). But Lucas said he named the movie this way as an ode to the Saturday Matinee serials the film was inspired by. Contrasting this with Lucas' Indiana Jones trilogy, it's quite clear virtually all of that series' high quality was the result of Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, and John Williams. Lucas proves he can't craft a rousing adventure and not even Williams' rousing score can change that.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Weaknesses on the narrative level,"'Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones'. Especially nice is the change of Anakin compared to the first part. In the first episode, you could tell that he was more than just self-confident, but his childlike manner covered that up and you didn't know what direction the whole thing was going to take. Now, as a young adult, Hayden Christensen manages to portray a character that represents a balancing act between arrogance and inner emotional conflicts.He thinks that he is not given the necessary recognition and he tends to have uncontrolled outbursts of rage again and again, although in some places this is portrayed very exaggeratedly. Nevertheless, you can understand his motivation. He's not really likeable either, but he still manages to take the viewer on a journey.But that's also because we already got to know Anakin in great detail in the first part. Otherwise, it would have been very difficult to connect with the Anakin from episode 2.What has actually always struck me as negative is the seemingly non-existent age difference between Padme and Anakin. In the first part, Padme looks so much older than him. 10 years later, Padme doesn't seem to have aged a day and Anakin has ""caught up"" with her. This is not something that makes the movie worse, but it is very noticeable.What makes the film worse, however, is the seemingly endless and schmaltzy love story between the two. Of course, this is important for the overall story and also for the development of Anakin. However, the whole thing could have been presented much shorter and the same result would have been achieved.The entire storyline around the clone warriors is interesting and exciting. Obi-Wan has also managed to emerge from the shadow of Qui-Gon. Visually, the planets, battles, etc. Look excellent across the board. There are also some allusions to future parts, which struck me as positive. Narratively, it hacks in some places, but still a good second part.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Episode II is pure fun with a well-made best laying depth relationships with others (especially with episodes IV and V) and it brings many elements of the series,"After the great box office The Phantom Menace, George Lucas returns to the penultimate part of its hit series, this being the second in chronological order. Lucas back in the direction and the script alongside Jonathan Hales. As a major news, the Episode II, is the first big-budget film to be shot entirely with digital cameras.Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away ... There is concern in the Galactic Senate. Thousands of solar manifested his intention to leave the Republic. This separatist movement, under the leadership of the mysterious Count Dooku, has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy. Senator Padmé Amidala, former Queen of Naboo, is returning to the Galactic Senate to vote on the delicate question of creating a Republic Army to help beleaguered Jedi ... Ten years after an unsuccessful attempt at invasion of the planet Naboo, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Amidala (Natalie Portman) are together again. At this time Obi-Wan went from apprentice to teacher teachings Jedi Anakin, both of which were assigned to protect Senator Amidala now, whose life is threatened by unknown separatist factions of the Republic, which threaten to unleash a civil war. While Obi-Wan takes care of the second mission, finding an army of clones on the planet Kamino, with the passing of time comes a forbidden romance between Anakin Jedi and Senator Amidala, as Jedi Knights are not allowed to fall in love.Lucas and Jonathan Hales absorbed some criticism and corrected some mistakes in The Phantom Menace, again managing to raise the level of the franchise. Completely different climate more childish Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace, this second chapter flirts more with the elements and atmosphere of The Empire Strikes Back.Without any fear of virtually abandoning the lighter side and returning to opt for a gloomy mood. It is curious to see, looking at all the movies, the perfect symmetry created by George Lucas from The Empire Strikes Back and Attack of the Clones, in both secondary reinforces the narrative construction of the personality of the main hero (training Luke in ""Empire"", and dating of Anakin in ""Clones"") and a fantastic scene including a dueling saber light-end. Not to mention the most important: a hand severed works representing the change in the two films.We should emphasize the debut of Hayden Christensen, who got his first chance to play Anakin Skywalker. The actor had just before delivering a great performance in Life as a House (2001) was nominated for many awards, including a Golden Globe for his portrayal. His dramatic appeal suggested that would be the ideal actor to develop Darth Vader, from its rise to its fall to the Dark Side of the Force Natalie Portman, Queen before and now Senator Padmé Amidala, can have much more space on the screen and continues to show why was at the time one of the biggest revelations of cinema. Even the romance with Amidala Skywalker, who works a few times and is too corny in other, ends up working for the good chemistry of the two actors. The problem is that the romance scenes of the two did the pace of the plot falls abruptly. We see here also the first moment of hatred and anger that will make it clear that Anakin is already dangerously close to the dark side. And Christensen does very well on the task.Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan holds a much larger and decisive. If previously he was an apprentice, now he's a Jedi master wiser, experienced and who commands respect. Ian McDiarmid is once again excellent as Palpatine, able to manipulate everyone to achieve their goals.The partnership with Luke Hales made the film darker with less humor, more mature and full of spectacular scenes. The night scenes in cities give a climate futuristic and technological achieve mesmerize the viewer. The dialogues were weak virtually eliminated, although still there, specifically in the romance scenes. The comic relief was a factor corrected. Sai Jar Jar Binks, one of the most hated characters in the galaxy, which has a very low participation in this and Chapter III, and they turn their attention again to the duo R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) .The way the plot is tied to the other episodes is much more noticeable and appeals to everyone. It is interesting seeing the former senator becoming Supreme Chancellor. His rise to power and the consequent fall of the Republic will be increasingly consolidating more. Parts and relations between the films are becoming increasingly evident and will all converge in the third episode Revenge of the Sith. Continuity, incidentally, is what makes fans of the series increasingly passionate universe of George Lucas, to realize that everything is thought out in detail so that everything fits in six films. As an example, the family farm Lars (Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru), first seen in Episode IV, it is shown much younger in ""Attack of the Clones"". The original design of the Death Star appears also being studied as well as the ships, which are starting to look more like those we know from the original trilogy. This concern is evident even in costume and makeup. Palpatine is more pale and thin, as seen in Return of the Jedi. Senator Amidala wears clothes and has hair very similar to his daughter Leah uses in A New Hope. On Kamino, Obi-Wan discovers plans for creation of the clone army, and also discover the array of clones is Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), a bounty hunter hired to kill Amidala. Jango is the ""father"" of none other than Boba Fett (Daniel Logan).The action sequences are excellent. Here we see one of the greatest demonstrations of ""Force"" as present in this universe, with a clash of giants among the former Jedi Count Dooku and Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz). At this point we see an impressive fight and we can finally see the Master apparently quietly, weak and old, showing his power to control objects and mastering the Force as few, plus a stunning agility in fight scenes. This all would be impossible using the puppet animated first trilogy. No doubt this is one of the highlights of the film. The scene of the Jedi in the arena is also exciting with the presence of Anakin, Obi-Wan, Amidala, and Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson). Importantly Natalie Portman in a sexy costume breathtaking, and his daughter Leia (Carrie Fisher) had starred in ""Return of the Jedi"", though well-behaved more.The chase on Coruscant night is breathtaking. It is an exaggerated and prolonged scene, but it would show how good the film. The final part, on the planet Geonosis, where mystery investigated by Obi-Wan, Anakin and Amidala and where, now imprisoned for Dooku, end up meeting again, involving the fight between Yoda and Dooku, and the beginning of the war between clones and droids, is fully satisfactory. A climax as few films.The special effects once again did not disappoint. Never before in the series had been using both the computer graphics for the construction of scenarios and also the characters. The art direction and photography are darker and more apocalyptic the highlight. The decision to show the ships, palaces, and other elements are perfect. Lucas and staff art show and knew a time more technological mastery that after Empire suffers a absolute decay, as shown in the first film of the trilogy. The art is also need to distance each planet / scenarios. The dark storm sequences on the planet Kamino in has nothing to do with the gloomy caverns of Geonosis. The scenarios Naboo appear as well as the arid deserts of Tatooine, they are the scene of a tragic death in the family Skywalker. There is also the striking air traffic and the futuristic buildings of Coruscant, the capital planet of the Republic, full of spectacular ships. The composer John Williams could not fail to mark their presence. Only the scene where Anakin, after suffering a major loss family, is seduced by the dark side for the first time, and we hear the ""Imperial March"" more subtly adapted to that moment, opens a smile on every viewer instantly.The Episode II is pure fun with a well-made best laying depth relationships with others in the series (especially with episodes IV and V) and it brings many elements of the series back.

Not as bad as people say,"While this movie has some serious acting/dialogue problems, the story is very well done. The new worlds, creatures, villains, and heroes bring so much to the Star Wars universe that Star Wars just wouldn't be the same without (for example, the clones). While Anakin can come off very awkward and creepy, and the romance between him and Padme feels very forced. I think the positives of this movie outweigh the negatives.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Stunningly tedious,"Easily the most tedious film of the year and of the series and of the genre. You'd find better action sequences on a cheap games console and better acting in a primary school production of the wizard of oz. And the blame lies squarely on Lucas' shoulders. This kind of dialogue would get you kicked out of film school. Dribbled with strained references to the original series and delivered with the verve of a George W. Bush speech on international trade agreements. The only people who come out relatively unscathed are the traditionally camped-up hammer-horror-style bad guys and Ewan McGregor's continuing pastiche of Alec Guinness. The ""romantic"" leads are like being forced to watch the world's least interesting high-school sweethearts pretending to have a squabble. Wait until it appears on DVD then at least you can edit it down to a three minute Natalie Portman fashion shoot and fifty seconds of yoda break-dancing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Technically brilliant, otherwise OK","As a Star Wars fan, I've often wondered why the latest two Star Wars films have taken quite a beating, and I think part of the reason is this: thanks to the fact that we saw Episodes IV thru VI first, we already know how the story ends, and so much of the suspense is lost, leaving fans with much more energy to expend on their complaints. I mean, let's be honest, the acting and dialog in the Star Wars series has always been more a matter of competence than brilliance, it was the wonderful imagination and groundbreaking visual effects that made them great.That said, my feelings about the new films are thus: The Phantom Menace is definitely underrated, sure Jar Jar is annoying and Lucas was a fool to throw in those references to the Midicloridians sp? and Annakin's `virgin' birth, but these can be easily overlooked (as Lucas himself seems to have done, since nowhere in this film are they mentioned). Phantom Menace has the same epic quality that made the other three great - sweeping vistas, beautiful scenery, and a plot that takes its time developing; after all, there's a lot of background to establish. And when I saw this in the theater, I was most pleased, figuring it would finally shut up all the critics who hated TPM. But, truth be told, after buying it on DVD, my enthusiasm has waned. Giving credit where due, the effects are still outstanding and so are the action scenes, but the `epic' quality is lacking. Lucas seems much too eager to show off his technical skills, and too much effort was put into developing great action sequences at the expense of basic plot and character development. For example, it is crucial for the plot for Annakin and Padme to fall in love, but in this movie they just don't have any chemistry. Put aside the problem of the fact that he ages over a decade while she barely ages at all, I can willingly suspend some belief here, but their basic characters just don't gell. She is dignified and wise beyond her years, and would surely see that Annakin, despite his talents and good intentions, is seriously unbalanced. To be fair, I don't think it's either actor's fault, in fact, the `clunky' dialog between them struck me as refreshingly realistic, the way real first time lovers speak, awkward and tongue-tied as opposed to the usual slick Hollywood product of highly paid professional writers, but no amount of acting or writing can save a romance that seems as forced and unrealistic as this one does.As for the rest, the pairing of Annakin and Obi Wan is quite good; the former clearly respects his mentor but also resents his often-domineering manner and it's fairly obvious that there will be a violent falling out between these two in Episode III. There are a number of memorable scenes, including the one on the water planet where we first meet Boba Fett and his father, a beautifully filmed space dogfight in an asteroid belt, and of course the climactic final battle scene. No question but that Lucas has not lost his touch for SFX laden action scenes, although I personally found the fight between Yoda and Count Dooku to have been a bit silly, like watching an attack hamster on speed. The problem is Lucas seems to have lost sight of the larger story. While Annakin and Padme are frolicking on Naboo and Obi Wan is chasing after a mysterious assassin, in the background the Republic is faced with division as thousands of star systems threaten to secede. Why? Who knows, Lucas is far too busy on scenes like the one in which Annakin and Padme have to fight off a bunch of bug people to explore this seemingly vital matter more fully. And the Clone Army, we are shown in much detail how they are made, but not why, which is surely the more important issue. In short, the problem with this movie is the story simply takes a back seat to the action, and what we get is a highly competent piece of entertainment, but an effort that doesn't quite measure up to the standard of being a truly epic film like the others in the series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Saga Darkens,"While the first two acts play out like a kind of murder mystery in space, entwined in the admitted cheese of the central romantic plot, the third goes above and beyond in providing a sci-fi spectacle the likes of which would never be outdone in the saga's live-action ventures. It does everything a sequel should do, building on returning characters while delighting in walk-on one shotters and bold new additions to the already impressive collection of players in the story; and while some of the romance can fall flat, the raw passion as Christensen captures Anakin's frustration and rage gives Clones some of the more dramatic moments in the saga.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Force is back,"Everything George Lucas did wrong in ""The Phanton Menace,"" the disappointing prequel to his ""Star Wars"" trilogy, he does right - brilliantly right - in ""Attack of the Clones."" This time out, the force is strong in him - in a very big way.This fifth chapter of the sprawling space saga recounts the coming of age of Annakin Skywalker (the Jedi knight who will become Darth Vader) as the democratic Republic is on the brink of a war which will ultimately transform it into the evil Empire.Lucas wisely returns to the elements that made the original ""Star Wars"" such a groundbreaking success: timeless mythological themes; endearing characters; heart-pumping action scenes; and the energetic derring-do of Saturday matinee serials.I promise not to reveal major plot points, but the story begins when Jedi knight Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor, maturing nicely into Alec Guinness) and his protege Annakin (Hayden Christensen) are summoned to protect the regal Padme (Natalie Portman); the former Queen Amidala has taken a Hillary Clinton turn and is now an outspoken senator.The great success of the first ""Star Wars"" was its cunning blend of familiar movie genres - sampling not only science fiction serials but gun-slinging westerns and fantasy classics like ""The Wizard of Oz.""In ""Attack of the Clones,"" Lucas serves up heaping helpings of film genres including the film noir detective, sci-fi paranoia, political thrillers, and action scenes that recall everything from James Bond to ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and Robin Hood's merry men battling it out in Sherwood Forest.Venturing into territory that's totally new to him, Lucas also gives us a classical star-crossed love story between Annakin and Padme (the future parents of Luke and Leia). Christensen and Portman are exceptionally fine actors, giving emotional depth to the two most complex characters in the ""Star Wars"" canon. (And as screen lovers, they make ""Titanic's"" Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet look positively homely.)Seeds are sown of plot developments yet to come as the saga takes on a generational and mythological weight that's worthy of the Greeks. A turning point in Annakin's emotional transformation makes for an unforgettable scene of pain, love and fury, the likes of which we've never seen in a ""Star Wars"" movie.Lucas also recaptures the blend of humor, satire and adventure that seemed effortless in the early films but was nearly absent in the dry, impersonal ""Phantom Menace."" Familiar characters and relationships are in full force here; Obi Wan and Annakin have a loving but contentious mentor/pupil thing going on; C3-P0 experiences a hilarious identity crisis; and in two words: Yoda rocks!Samuel Jackson is on board as Jedi Master Mace Windu; Ian McDiarmid is back as the not-to-be-trusted political bigwig Palpatine; and Christopher Lee debuts as the dark side Jedi Master Count Dooku (at what point can we start to giggle at some of these names?).Jimmy Smits fills out his Renaissance costume nicely as Senator Bail Organa but doesn't get much to do yet. (Oh wait, that was Princess Leia's last name - I see an adopted daughter in his future...)The saga also continues its generational theme with the introduction of warrior Jango Fett, and his son Boba (who will grow into the feared bounty hunter of ""The Empire Strikes Back"").The film is a magnificent thing to look at. From the glittering urban sprawl of Coruscant (think Manhattan to the tenth power) to the red-rock planet Geonosis, and the romantically sumptuous paradise of Naboo, the film's digital artisans break new ground in eye-popping production design.In it's strong storytelling, depth of character and vigorous action scenes, ""Attack of the Clones"" is a mature piece of filmmaking, created by a man who has returned to his creative roots. No more Jar Jar Binks jokes, George. It's good to have you back.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Attack of the Snores,"This is by far the ""worst"" of all of the Star Wars films (including the Animated Clone Wars Movie). I use the term worst lightly as it is an overall good film, it just doesn't hold up to the dramatic standards of the original trilogy or Phantom Menace.I felt while watching this movie that the relationship between Anikin and Padme was not fully fleshed out, and I don't mean in the physical way. As both of these characters were fighting there training, expectations, and duties, neither seemed conflicted enough, nor was there sufficient tension established during their romantic development. This is reinforced when one watches the deleted scenes dealing with some of these issues. Obviously they were edited out for time, and perhaps their inherent sappy quality, but would have made their secret romance far more satisfying to the audience, and Padme's surrender to her feelings more fulfilling.Outside of the lack of depth to the main character's romance, the film was excellent. The chase scene through the air space of Coruscant is just incredible, as is Yoda finally brandishing a lightsaber (if he had a meat cleaver instead, he could also double as a food processor). The special FX are incredible as always with ILM's work, as is John Williams' score. Overall an great movie, and as it is part of a trilogy/hexology, it is somewhat difficult to judge it all by itself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Lighten up folks,"Frankly, I am a little perplexed by most of the negative feedback on AOTC. If you do not like Sar Wars movies in general, don't watch them so you can write crappy reviews (I would write a crappy review on LOTR films cuz I hate that genre so I have not even bothered to watch those).As an adult I watch the original films with a bit less seriousness. They were clearly written for kids (be they 9 or 90) and are therefore campy fun. They were not intended to be intellectual poetry. Neither are the new films. Granted, there was something lacking in chemistry between the two lovebirds. But I thought everything else was spot on in AOTC. Skywalker is supposed to be talented but angry, everyone is supposed to talk a bit stiffly (similar to Roman or Greek plays), there are supposed to be spectacular battles (it's star WARS).Those who are most vocal with their venom do not seem to understand the movies at all. The real plot has nothing to do with the Trade Federation/CIS, everyone is being duped folks! Anyone who understands this and is still angry is just frustrated because they know how everything going to turn out and they do not like how Lucas is piecing it all together. I personally would have introduced Anakin at an older age (9 year olds cannot act) and focused more on the clone wars. But Lucas chose to do it the way he wanted to. Tuff noogies.This one was a lot of fun. The next one will be even better. None of the three have Han Solo, once again, tuff noogies. Lucas is nearly done now, sit down and write a new trilogy yourself and see if he will let you get it made in a few years. There are a lot of possible spin-off stories that could be explored.

"Only Disappointing Star Wars Film, But Still Decent","This was the only Star Wars film of the six in the series that disappointed me. I still like it, overall, but the teen romance didn't do anything for me and took away from the normally more interesting story lines. The romance doesn't take up a lot of time but it features a lot of stupid dialog and leads to a stupid finish in the film.On the positive side, this film offers good action scenes and excellent artwork and special effects. Some of the scenes are just stunning to view. Some, to be fair, look too computer-generated but overall it's a fun movie to look at, as it is to hear with some outstanding surround sound. The better the speakers (and a sub-woofer), the more awesome this movie. I'd like to see this on large-screen plasma set, too, to get the full effect of the visuals. The more the series went on, the better the technology to present them and this was the second-last of the saga.""Attack Of The Clones"" is the only Star Wars episode I have only seen once. Perhaps a second look will bring it up to some of the others, especially now that I am so familiar with the whole story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"CGI is horrible, give me puppets any day!","I am a Star Wars fan. When I say this I refer to the 'original' trilogy (A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi).I am not however a fan of what they are trying to pass off with the 'Star Wars' title these days. These 3 films are terrible (Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith).The Characters are poor, there are too many random characters crammed in. Was this an attempt to make as many toys to cash in on as possible?The computer generated graphics are over the top and obvious, I sometimes feel like I'm watching a computer game rather than a serious film. Yoda is a prime example... what have they done to him!? I'm just glad that his puppet form died before he could see this happen.Everything is too high tech from weapons to Space Crafts, they can come up with all the reasons under the sun of why they are more high tech, but the fact is that the designers were simply trying to be clever and were making 'new' ideas rather than keeping in line with the original trilogy.The script and acting seems to be very forced and weak, you can tell that a lot of the actors are attempting accents poorly.

Weakest of the bunch.,"Disclaimer: I am 18 years old and until now I had never seen Star Wars. While most people's view on Star Wars nowadays is clouded by nostalgia, here is my unaffected take on these 'classics'. I'm watching in this order: IV - V - I - II - III - VII found The Phantom Menace to be quite enjoyable. This sequel feels merely like an extension of it, with similar decent humor, writing and acting. Not a bad by any means, but definitely not an improvement either.If anything, I would actually say that Attack of the Clones is slightly worse than its predecessor. The cast feels like a downgrade. Liam Neeson and (in my opinion) surprisingly charming Jake Lloyd have left the cast and Hayden Christensen has stepped in. Christensen's Anakin Skywalker feels odd, unpredictable and quite confusing. One second he is acting like he is about to turn evil, and then the next I'm supposed to be rooting for him? Maybe that is just how his character is written, with Skywalker being of his rebellious age, but it is not appreciated in my eyes.Also, Yoda seems a bit off. I don't know how to explain it. He was really charming in IV and V, and I hardly payed much attention to him in I. But in this movie, I've noticed that he is not as funny anymore and his knick of rephrasing sentences has really started to wear off as entertaining.Though as mentioned earlier, in almost all other aspects, Attack of the Clones is just a 'clone' (heh) of The Phantom Menace. It is just the slightly weaker cast that drags it down by comparison.Not a bad movie. McGregor, Portman and most of the cast still shine. So does the writing and the action. I did enjoy this movie. But out of the ones I've seen so far, (IV, V, I, II) this is the 'worst' one yet.But being 'worst' is far from being bad in this franchise, needless to say.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Still not good enough,"From the original trilogy to Episode 1: The Phantom Menace this film series has become a roller-coaster of quality. The original trilogy is among my all-time favorites while ""The Phantom Menace"" is one of the greatest disappointments i have ever had when it comes to movies.Some years have passed since the events in ""The Phantom Menace"". Anakin Skywalker has grown and is now training to soon become a Jedi himself. He and Padmé have a secret romance while he is also acting as her bodyguard. There is trouble in the Republic though as separatists are challenging the senate. This causes some worries because there are not enough Jedi to defend the republic against outright confrontation.I can start by saying that this is a clear improvement on ""The Phantom Menace"". Everything is better. The movie still looks like a video game, but a better quality video game... And the pacing is a lot better. There are no scenes like the 20 minute pod race in ""The Phantom Menace"" to completely kill the movie. What still strikes me as abominable though is the casting. Who had the ""bright"" idea to cast Hayden Christensen as Anakin?! There has to be thousands of actors in the right age group that can perform better than him. He sounds like an obstinate child every time he says something. Pathetic! What i feel is still missing is the magic. The little thing the original trilogy had that made it work so beautifully even when it was quite silly (i mean come on, midgets in bear-suits?!). Unfortunately this movie is missing that, and when a scene is silly it has no redeeming features. What the ""magic"" does is make the whole worth more than the sum of it's parts. And i'm still waiting for that to happen.That said, this is still quite entertaining. And i guess it would be a quite decent sci-fi movie if it didn't have the words ""Star Wars"" in the title. But since it DOES have those words, it still falls short of my expectations. I need something better than this. It still shames the original trilogy, and the rating can never be higher than 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than Episode 1 but so is getting kicked in the n*ts,"An attempt on the life of Senator Padmé leads to Jedi knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker being assigned to protect her. Further information on the assassin leads Obi-Wan to travel to a distant constellation while Anakin and Padmé go undercover to travel to her home planet for safety. While Anakin and Padmé begin to fall for each other, Obi-Wan discovers a factory planet producing a clone army for the Republic. With events appearing to be being controlled by powerful external sources the Jedi's find themselves faced with a battle against a further force within the Trade Federation.Basically think of all the areas where the Phantom Menace failed and write them all down  too dry plot-wise, too childish, no comedy or fun, poor characters, no drive, Jar Jar Binks! Now just imagine that Lucas had had a ham-fisted attempt at improving on them and actually did an OK job of it. Where the original Star Wars films got darker with the second instalment so to does Attack of the Clones. This dark element comes through in many ways. Mainly we have Anakin's shift towards the dark side as he begins to wander from the code of the Jedi by displaying anger, arrogance, impatience, lust. His descent into violence due to personal circumstances marks a dark moment in the film. Also we have the Jedi beginning to lose power while the dark side continue to grow in influence. This makes the whole political sub-plot much better than Phantom Menace where it was dull and going nowhere but doing it very slowly. Here you can see the strands come together as Darth Sidious continues to influence events with the help of Darth Tyranus. The fact that all the pieces are being to fall into place makes this even better  we can see actions begin that cause the situation in Star Wars 4, and we have the beginnings to things that will see the downfall of the Jedi in episode 3; this at least makes the narrative more interesting and, because it implies bigger things, more engaging.However this dark edge is tempered by a new concept to those only familiar with episode 1  occasional fun. The romance subplot is a bit clunky and unconvincing but it doesn't slow it down as much as the trailers suggested it may. Although the romance turns dark it makes for a nice contrast with Obi-Wan's more action story that occurs at the same time. The film is funnier for two main reasons  firstly Obi-Wan is allowed to be more relaxed and adventurous, and two  the droid versions of Laurel & Hardy return in the shape of the ever great C3-P0 and R2-D2. The effects and battles are better here too but still suffer from Lucas loving his computer more than he does his characters; however as a summer blockbuster to pack multiplexes, the action works well. There are some bigger downsides yes it all looks good but some of it is a little silly. For example the 'car' chase near the start sees our Jedi heroes falling through the sky for 30 odd seconds just to land on another vehicle with perfect timingI know they have the force but that's pushing it isn't it? Likewise other bits just step over the limit of what is acceptable as 'real' even in sci-fi.The performances and the characters have improved but generally they are still delivering lines as if they were quoting God. MacGregor is better because he is allowed to have a character instead of a totally dry cut-out like episode 1, but it is still a bit of an impression. Likewise Anakin is much better here (could he have been worse?) and Christensen tries hard  at first simmering with arrogance but later letting rage and frustration become his master for the first time; he is still a bit too wooden and a bland actor for me but at least he is better than Lloyd. Lee and McDiarmid make very good puppet-masters, while Jackson clearly enjoys having more to do than in episode 1. Yoda is good (despite looking silly in his battle) and given the part he deserves while Smits is really underused. To continue the 'cool bad guy' strand Morrison makes a cool Jango Fett  as well as allowing the film to carry through the themes of parenthood and family ties through his son Boba. Unfortunately Jar Jar Binks is back in this but at least the film shows some irony in the fact that it Binks that basically opens the door for the creation of the Empire and the fall of the Republic.Personally the main improvement is the linkage are not only being made with the events of part 4 but that they are now heavily up on screen. Although it is all a bit basic and simplistic (no time for complex thematic changes with all that CGI to create!) it still has moments - the most powerful for me is near the end where massive events unfold before the watching Jedi council and the music smoothly moves into the dark Empire theme tune from part 4  showing clearly that this is one of the major leaps towards the breakdown of the Republic and the creation of the Empire. It may feed off nostalgia as much as be a genuine moment, but it did work. Overall an improvement on Episode 1 but still a bit weak in many areas. It all depends now on the final episode (as it always did) to raise the level again and actually make a strong film that really lets the series go out on a bang rather than just making these new films one big bad idea.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Someday I will be the most powerful Jedi ever,"Let me tell you I am not a fan of this movie.

Throughout there are many wonders you can cherish and take with you long after the movie is done. Such as the incredible ending scene on Geonosis, along with the final lightsaber fight at the end with the oh so loved Yoda shining through. Including Jango Fett, which is another treat by himself to come from this movie. From the fights on Kamino to the incredible air scrimmage above Geonosis I am just speechless.

That said, 'Clones' is much better.  Ewan McGregor is fantastic as Obi-Wan, and Hayden Christensen's intensity as the now adult Anakin is stunning. Even though we know how the story ends, we are drawn into the details of a crumbling republic.  The secondary characters are interesting and well played, and we get some history on Boba Fett and the Lars connection.  On top of all that, we get Christopher Lee as Count Dooku.  That bit of casting was brilliant!'Clones' delivers exactly what we expect from a Star Wars film; absolutely stunning visual effects, fantastic cast, great story, and more fun than should be legal in 2 hours. Mr. Lucas has the unenviable task of writing not one but three prequels.  We KNOW what happens to these characters, but he keeps us interested to the point of hoping that the outcome will change; maybe Padme can keep Anakin from turning to the Dark Side, maybe the Republic can be saved.I can't wait for the DVD, so I can grab my popcorn and enjoy this film again at home until 2005, when the last installment arrives and the saga is complete.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

When I looked at imdb after the first few nights in theaters, read about Jar-Jar being almost totally gone and how much better this part was, I was really excited. I so wanted to like this movie.But OUCH. Now first of all, the directing was utterly horrid. It was the worst part of Ep I as well, but Lucas really lost it here. The movie seemed to jump from scene to scene in the most illogical places, action scenes got interrupted, and just when you were getting into a better scene, you get hit with yet another boring ""but I love you, but I am Jedi, oh no, boohoo""-scene.

Attack of the Bores,"Something is really wrong when a video game has more interesting characters and a more intriguing storyline than a film version of the same setting. This actually happened last year when a Star Wars game called, 'Knights of the Old Republic' was released for the Xbox.I recently rented the DVD version of 'Attack of the Clones' and I was surprised at how bored I was watching this film again. I saw it in the theater when it was first released and I thought it was just OK back then. It was better than the very disappointing ""Phantom Menace"" but not by much.It seems like most people here have the same thoughts that I do: There is too much focus on special effects, the dialog is awful and the plot is boring.There are a few bright spots: Seeing Jango Fett was cool and so are the Clone troopersbut the characters in this film have all the depth of paper.What is with the plot here? Why should we be concerned? So some planets want to break away from a large, bureaucratic Republic and want to be independent. Why is this bad? Why should we care? And apparently they want free trade too. Oh, no! This is not an intriguing plot for a Star Wars film.George Lucas does not seem to have a feel for character or plot development nor does he seem to know how to direct his actors. There is no real chemistry between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen and their love story is awkward to watch. In addition, there is no suggestion of the friendship between young Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi that Ben Kenobi spoke of in the first Star Wars film in 1977.Sadly, Lucas seems to think that special effects alone are enough to tell a story.Lucas could have given ""Attack of the Clones"" a great start and set a new tone with the death of Jar Jar. Can you imagine the applause that scene would have generated? But no, Lucas brings back this worthless and annoying CGI thing back. At least with the DVD, I was able to fast forward those parts. All in all, ""Attack of the Clones"" is strike two for Lucas.I am not optimistic about the next Star Wars film, ""Revenge of the Sith"".",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An Entertaining Space Opera with an Amazing 3rd Act,"My 'Attack of the Clones' Review:PROS:
-The Entire 3rd Act is amazing! The Arena, the Clones arrival, the Lightsaber duels!-Ewan McGregor.-Obi-Wan's detective story.-Jango Fett is a Bad Ass!-Seeing Mace Windu in Action!-Yoda finally drawing his Lightsaber!!!-Every planet feels unique. You can tell a lot of thought went into each one.-Obi-Wan vs. Jango Fett!-Anakin and Shmi's final scene is heartbreaking and Anakin's actions after are terrifying.-""Begun the Clone War has.""CONS:
-The Dialogue.-The Romance between Anakin and Padme.-Some of the CGI hasn't aged well.This is the Prequel I'm most divisive on. I really enjoy the Obi-Wan plotline of discovering the Clone Army, battling Jango Fett and discovering the Separatists is a blast to watch! I also like that the supporting characters get more time to shine! Mace and Jango being the standouts! However, the Anakin/Padme love story feels so forced and the dialogue in those scenes is terrible. I'll never understand how Padme could fall for a guy who just murdered an entire village. Having said that, the entire 3rd Act feels like an epic 'Clone Wars' episode! Seeing the Jedi in their prime and what they can do on the battlefield was something to see in theaters in 2002! I'll never forget the audience's reaction to Yoda drawing his Saber for the first time! I still enjoy this movie, however, it's my least favorite of George Lucas' Star Wars Films but it's better than anything Disney has put out regarding the Franchise. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's pretty good, but...","The acting and dialogue is the weakest part of this film. The top cast speak 90% of their parts with no vocal inflection and show little emotion as well.

Brilliant,"How can anybody say this film is rubbish!? This is one of my favourite films of the amazing saga! I'm probably going to get a ribbing for this but i think the newest films are better than the older ones. Critics may disagree but I'm right i know it. The whole Padme - Anakin story is really interesting i love it, i love this film, people thought George Lucas would do bad on these prequels but they blew me away. I love star wars! I think Natalie Portman is a great actress and the best choice for her character, nobody could have acted that role better, she did an amazing job, or am i being biased? Padmé's my favourite character! you may say its my opinion, true, but the Star Wars saga are the best films to hit the big screen. Very well done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Episode I is forgiven...,"I went to the Boston premier of Episode II this morning, and I can truthfully say ""wow."" There is plenty of action, adventure, romance, and character development. You begin to feel hatred towards certain characters, and love some more than you did before. Some characters (one in particular) you hate even more than you did last time around.John Williams provides a superb score, with plenty of use of familiar themes in appropriate places. The special effects are outstanding, especially with one character in particular. The level of detail is incredible.I wish I could tell you more, but I don't want to ruin the many surprises that are in store for you! See this movie ASAP!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A 140 minute computer game.,"Like so many others I hoped and prayed that Episode 2 would turn out to be an improvement over the awful Episode 1 ""The Phantom Menace"" but it turned out to be just as bad.  About an hour into the movie I was already looking at my watch, hardly believing what I was seeing.As it was with The Phantom Menace, there were no interesting characters to speak of and those that did show promise were never given the chance to truly shine, and a movie where you don't care what happens to the characters can never be very exciting.So much of the movie was in C.G.I that it left me wondering why they bothered to have live actors in it, but as with The Phantom Menace, the Special effects are the star and apparently the only thing that mattered to the film makers, since the storytelling is this bad.  Too many action sequences seemed to be just thrown in because they might look good in a computer game (which I'm sure will be coming out) and far too many stupid one-liners which had me shaking my head, thinking ""My God, Star Wars has been turned into an Austin Powers movie"" .... Silly one-liners work for Austin Powers but NOT for Star Wars.Still, it should have been possible for George Lucas to make an entertaining movie using just special effects and a lot of brainless action, but no, he could not even manage that.  A screenplay without characters to care for, and even though the story (as we all know from Episodes IV-VI) is a good one, the screenplay is just TOO awful to make an entertaining 143 minute movie with the first hour being mainly an unbelievable love story.This movie, as stated before, is about two and a half hours long, but it feels a lot longer, and it left me with the feeling that I had been watching somebody playing a computer game for two and a half hours.Unbelievably this movie was worse than a waste of money, it was a waste of time, and I for one will not be wasting time or money on Episode III, no matter how much I love Episodes IV-VI.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Outstanding technically but emotionally distant,"While a outstandingly accomplished film technically, the film suffers from some inconsistent performances from the lead actors leading to a lack of audience involvement with the characters.The story is set ten years after the events in Episode 1, and this affords Lucas the opportunity to make some changes to the characters. Anakin is now 19-20 years old, and he is now a 'rebelling against authority' type character. While in itself not a problem, the decision , for relative newcomer Hayden Christensen to play him as bratty is wrong and leads to the character coming across as unsympathetic , bland, and annoying. Also it seems that Christensen cannot seem to get a clear view of the character's trajectory within the story. As a result, his performance is uneven. In some scenes he is fine (primarily on the scenes set on Tatooine), but his performance seems unsubtle and broad, particularly when in more intimate romantic scenes with Natalie Portman. The decision for the Padme character to play a senator is a much better one, and in that regard Portman's performance is much better this time around and draws an appropriate parallel with Carrie Fisher from the original trilogy. She comes off the much stronger of the two performances when up against Christensen. Unfortunately she is saddled with having to act in a very formal and constrained way, with overtly theatrical and clichéd dialogue that is similar to that of films from the 1930s and 1940s, though in some scenes Portman is clearly trying to bring a more natural take to her character. The decision to move away from the naturalistic acting style on the original trilogy was, in my view a major mistake and alienates an older audience from getting emotionally and viscerally involved in the film. Ewan McGregor's performance this time is less constrained than Episode I, and his character is more central to the story. While not as charismatic as Neeson's performance in Episode 1 it is nevertheless solid. Samuel Jackson has fun effectively playing Jedi Master Samuel Jackson, in a more important and involving role. Temuera Morrison is actually pretty good in a small part as bounty hunter Jango Fett. However, the most impressive human performances are of in two supporting roles, with veteran actor Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, and Australian actor Jack Thompson as Cliegg Lars.It is a relief that Jar Jar Binks character is very much in the background, albeit some of his bungling antics seem to have been transferred to C3P0. Like episode 1, the best performances are digital characters. Andy Secombe is great as Watto again, albeit in a smaller role. However the best performance overall, is Frank Oz , in collaboration with Rob Coleman's ILM animation team in recreating Yoda, now as an entirely digital character. The character is well embedded in the story. His anxiety of what is happening to the galaxy around him is conveyed well, as is the character's growing frustration with not being able to accurate assess who or what is behind the collapsing of the republic. His character's insight in the heat of battle makes him part of the films exciting climax, and a confrontation with Count Dooku, while thrilling, is far too brief.In fact, while the visual effects are for the most part outstanding, lead by Rob Coleman, Pablo Helman, John Knoll and Ben Snow, there are nevertheless a few problems. The digital work in some scenes in my view, goes too far, with sets and whole environments created in the computer when a better balance of digital effects, live action, models, well designed sets and real locations work best. Not surprisingly, some of the Naboo scenes in this film work better because of a better balance between real locations and digital effects (shot in Australia & Italy) and, as per Episode 1, the segment of the film set on Tatooine (shot in Tunisia), while shorter this time around feels more involving because the high quality visual fx, meshing with real locations feels stronger. Interestingly, this part of the story is well written and underpinned by the excellent supporting performances already mentioned, as well as being Christensen's strongest part of the film. Geonosis while very impressive in parts, notably the action sequences, does feel too much like an animation in places. The feeling is that the film was being used moreas a testing of new technology, with filming shot on digital cameras,and Lucas wanting to push the visual effects as far as they can go, rather than trying to optimise the visual effects as part of the overall storytelling experience.As in keeping with the Star Wars films, sound design and effects are excellent, led by veteran Lucas collaborator Ben Burtt. Burtt also served as film editor, working with Lucas. While some of the action sequences are brilliantly edited, most of the dialogue sequences, and some plot based sequences feel pedestrian and un-involving and the pace of the film in these sequences, sadly and unexpectedly for a Star Wars film drags.Production design by Gavin Bouquet is excellent, even if the actual building of the sets is in a computer. As usual John Williams score is first rate, but this time is unable to fully distract or carry you through the less effective parts of the film. Overall, apart from some excellent individual sequences, such as Tatooine and a series of action sequences towards the end of the film, the film makes viewer feel too distant and uninvolved in the proceedings, despite some clever plotting, impressive visual fx and entertaining set pieces towards the film's climax.While the least impressive of the prequels, and weaker than the original series, it is nevertheless more interesting and entertaining than Episode VII, which in my view is, despite the hype and huge box office, the weakest of the saga films to date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Rated after watching the crap rise of the Skywalker,Totally underrated compared to the last episode of the last trilogy...,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Blah,"I consider myself a patient person, I can sit through a lot. This movie, however, was too much. I was at a friend's house and I had not yet seen Star Wars: Attack of the Clones. I was somewhat afraid because I love the original Star Wars movies, and I even enjoyed the third one (though it was not nearly as good as the originals). However, I hated Star Wars: Episode I. As I sat on the couch waiting for the movie to begin, I wondered if I would like it. Little did I know, I would have much rather been in Uganda doing manual labor than having to sit through that awful movie. Here are my reasons:1) The dialog was terrible (I know George Lucas has never been known for great dialog...but this was just unfathomable)2) Mr. Lucas tried to make the movie into some sort of drama (I'm speaking for Episodes I and III also) rather than sticking to the fun originals.3) He tried to make the audience feel Anakin's ""deep inner struggles"" but it turned into a flop because the dialog was such as: ""I...I...I just can't breathe without you."" and ""Where I come from it is so rocky, but here it's so soft and smooth.""4) George Lucas had an interesting idea of dwelling on how Anikan became Darth Vader, but he didn't have enough to go on so he tried filling the rest in with bits and scraps that made the movie look poorly put together.After I watched the movie (barely being able sit through it at all) I went and did something productive like renting the ""The Grapes of Wrath"" which is actually good. I understand that if you're some sort of Star Wars fanatic you'll think me an idiot and you'll say this is the best movie that' s been made in the past 10 years. That's why I didn't aim this review at people like you because you're just stubborn mules with no taste and you take offense much too easily. I aimed this review at those of you who aren't Star Wars fanatics, because if you haven't already seen it...just skip it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fantastic follow up to an okay movie.,"Watched as part of a Star Wars Marathon, hence the shorter review.This took everything that was good about the first film and made it great, and it cut almost everything that was bad out. Set and especially environment designs were still phenomenal, scene transitions still slapped, fight choreography was still smooth, the memes were still fun to quote, and Ewan McGregor was still Ewan McGregor. Where this film changes most is in the story - it feels much more mature, and less like a kids film. The way it managed to create a creeping sense of dread, like something big is coming, was very impressive. Some scenes stood out as a stark contrast to the other films - a certain character's death being a highlight. Other moments, such as the Geonosian Arena battle were just pure cinematic entertainment. There was less Jar Jar too, for any Jar Jar haters. But the film still had some glaring negative points. Hayden Christensen's acting was horrific. The CGI was somehow worse than the first film's. The story, while entertaining, wasn't watertight. Yet, despite all this, it was a genuinely well made, engrossing experience.77/100--Admin--

The Force is strong(er) in this this one,"Well, what we can we say about The Flanel One's second part of the Prequel Trilogy?First of all: It's a heck of a lot better than TPM, even though that's not really any standard to go by (In Star Wars terms).Secondly: We've got an interesting lead character this time...two even! Unlike TPM, where we saw an annoying little farm boy that couldn't act (Mark Hamill in A New Hope, anyone?) and an aging Irish bloke that can only act like...well, an aging Irish bloke, we have some acting power this time around.The dialogue is corny and badly written, as we expected, but Hayden Christensen and Ewan MacGregor actually succeed in delivering their bad lines in a way that's not too disturbing. Although ""I wish I could just wish my feelings away"" sent a shiver down my spine, and not in something even closely resembling a good way. *Leave the romantic scenes to the professionals George, I beg you!*Ewan's lines range from funny ""She seems to be on top of things"", to Sir Alec Guinness like ""You will learn your place young one."" And he delivers each and every one of them with total conviction and an absolute belief that if he screws up his lines, he screws up the movie *It's not about the lines Ewan, but thanks anyway*Hayden is something of an enigma to me when it comes to Star Wars. He steals the entire movie (and so far the trilogy) with the so-called ""confession scene"", which, imo, is the best piece of acting I've seen in a long time, a very long time. Compare that with his ""romantic"" scenes together with Natalie Portman, where he stumbles over words (maybe intentionally) and just acts awful, and you'll begin to understand my confusion.Which brings us to the very lovely Ms Portman, who is undoubtedly a great actress. She proved herself ten times over in Leon (The Professional), but just seems lost here. The biggest contribution she makes here is showing off her well-trained abdomen. And even though it is truly a sight to behold, I expected much more power and on-screen presence from her.The entire film builds up to an extreme climax that is, in the end, rather disappointing. The huge battle (without wanting to give everything away) between the Republic forces and the Separatists, is confusing, brutal, and entirely CG...it looks awesome. In sharp contrast to that, is the inevitable light saber duel, between Ewan, Hayden and the marvelous Christopher Lee. This is the only point where the film is surpassed by it's predecessor, because it just never really takes off. Where the duel in the end of TPM was acrobatic, spectacular, and filled with energy, here it's more like ballet, and bad ballet at that. *Look out for Yoghurt though...I mean Yoda, off course*In the end, not a bad flick, but it could have been so much better. It sets everything up for Ep III (Revenge Of The Sith), but remains anonymous save for the fact that it's Star Wars. I don't know which is worse: To have a bad SW film I'd never want to see again, or a film that could have made it, but crashes in the corny one-liners, the terrible dialogue, with only occasional moments of greatness. Maybe Lucas has finally lost ""The Touch"" *Say it ain't so George!!*Good Points: Almost no Jar Jar *Yay*Cool new lead, who can go anywhere in the futureSome amazing effects *Hails ILM*Natalie Portmans belly *What? I'm a guy!*Less Points: Living Jar Jar *Boo*Threepio with ""a sense of humour"" *Shakes head in despair*Yoda on stimulants *Kinda over the top there, George*Weak light saber duel *The rehearsals were brutal though!*",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A Mixed Bag, But Mostly Good","The Star Wars Prequels are an interesting phenomenon. Never before has an expansion to a franchise divided fans so intensely. Fans started to become disenfranchised with 1999's Episode I - The Phantom Menace (although some would argue it started earlier, with the special editions, or even with the appearance of the first Ewok in Return of the Jedi). But I think it was this movie that truly made the rift irreparable.On the one hand, you had the Prequel Zealots, or Lucas Apologists, those who loved anything with the title ""Star Wars"". They would not dare give this film anything less than a 10. On the other hand, you had the Prequel Haters, or Lucas Bashers, who felt that the prequels were abominations and tainted the sacredness of the holy trilogy. The civil war between these Star Wars fans has been ongoing ever since, with flame wars still popping up on internet forums to this day. It's comical how easy it is to compare this Star Wars fan civil war to the Galactic Civil War portrayed in the films.My stance has always been somewhere in the middle, but I think I leaned more towards the Lucas Apologists' side. I enjoyed the prequels for what they were. I initially reviewed this film when it came out, and my rating was a 9, much higher than the film deserves. But at the time, I had just come off from seeing it for the first time, and I was still on my Star Wars high. Seeing a Star Wars movie for the first time is always very exciting, especially for a fan, and it's easy to overlook a film's flaws while on such a high. But after seeing this film again recently, I've noticed that it hasn't held up as well as I remembered, and I think it deserves a more level headed review.The biggest problem with this movie is the dialog. Sometimes it's good, but often it's atrocious. There are scenes where it's difficult not to cringe. One of the central themes to this film is the love story between Anakin (played by Hayden Christenson) and Padme (played by the beautiful Natalie Portman). There really is no chemistry between these two characters during most of these scenes. The dialog is cringe-worthy at times and really brings the film to a screeching halt.Intercut with these scenes is Obi Wan's plot, which is much more interesting, and Star Wars fans will be given plenty of fan service as he tries to solve the mystery of the Queen's attempted assassin. Ewan McGreggor does an amazing job portraying a young Obi Wan Kenobi, and it's clear that has fit himself into the role nicely since The Phantom Menace. Christopher Lee also does a nice job portraying the mysterious Count Dooku and his scenes with McGreggor are a treat.The film gets better and better as it progresses, and even Anakin's and Padme's scenes start to become much more interesting. There is one scene with Anakin and Padme on Tatooine that is very emotionally powerful and nearly makes up for the previous weak scenes between them. This scene redeemed Christenson for me, who, until that point, I felt was not well suited for the role.All of this eventually culminates to a giant battle at the end that probably is a little bit too giant for its own good. It goes on a little too long, and involves too much special effects and cgi that kind of detaches the audience a little bit. Still, it looks quite impressive (especially at the time it was released), and it is cool to see a large scale war in Star Wars once again.This movie's a little darker than the other Star Wars movies and there are some scenes of violence that may not be good for kids. I would wait until they're a little older to show them this, maybe 8 or 9. Also, the love story may be hard for them to stomach, but then, it was pretty hard for me to stomach as an adult as well.Overall, there's good and there's bad in this movie, but mostly, I enjoyed it. And I still enjoy it, but, like Episode I and unlike the original trilogy, it doesn't hold up as well on repeated viewings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Send in the clones...,"Sitting in that darkened cinema, a bag of popcorn in one hand and a cup of cola in the other, I desperately tried to hold onto the bitterness and cynicism that the awful billion-dollar-toy advert of Episode I had hammered into my brain. But it was no good. John Williams' score sent those delightful shivers of nostalgia up my spine and by the time the familiar yellow scroller had faded into distant space I was lost in a heady mist of fanboy love.Sadly, it was not to last. After a brief set-up, we got our first glimpse of Anakin mk. 2. No longer the irritatingly chirpy Jake Lloyd, our Vader-in-making had transformed into the charisma vortex that is the supremely untalented Hayden Christensen. Consistently out-acted by the logs of wood burning in the fireside scene, Christensen walks around with an expression that says nothing more than ""I am concentrating very hard on remembering my next cue"". In fact, he's so dismal he even sucks the life out of the usually lively Ewan MacGregor, who seems like he's become as disillusioned with Lucas as the rest of us. Portman manages moderately well, and as Mace Windu, Samuel L. Jackson does the usual badass schtick that we've seen him do in everything else. Even Christopher Lee seems stripped of his menace, possibly because most of his scenes consist of acting against green-screen - a tricky thing for even the most experienced of actors.The direction, too, is lame. Some action scenes (such as the hover-vehicle chase through a futuristic city right at the start) go on too long and become a tiresome showreel for ILM's CGI department, whilst others are cut horribly short (most notably the Obi-Wan/Jango Fett battle scene, something us fanboys were drooling over before the movie). The battle scenes just fling computer animation all over the place and hope the audience will be suitably impressed, though the effect is rather like setting all your fireworks off at once - big bangs and lots of colour, but nothing to focus on.The pacing of the film is woeful too. The romance scenes take up too much screen time - something that wouldn't be quite so bad if the two leads didn't have the chemistry and electricity of wet cement - whilst the potential catharsis of Anakin's slaughter of a Sand People village happens off camera! Unbelievably during this last bit, we're treated to all the other characters talking about how something <i>really really interesting</i> is happening offscreen. Show not tell, Lucas! Even the lousiest director knows that.So many bad things, so few words to say it in: Watto returns, except as an unbelievably offensive Jewish stereotype (big nose, long white hair, a black Rabbi hat). 3-CPO and R2 wander through the film, serving no purpose at all. The dialogue is ATROCIOUS and the jokes are worse. If CGI is so great these days why is it so obvious?Good things? Few and depressingly far between. The ""death sticks"" scene worked pretty well, the floaty thin white aliens were gorgeous and watching Yoda kick all kinds of arse made his battle scene with Christopher Lee the single most satisfying Star Wars moment of all time. Ever. Ever, ever, ever. But the brilliance of that last part (the only truly great bit in Episode II) only highlights the ham-fisted, amateurish trash that is the rest of the movie.I think the worst part of Epsiode II is that it confirms that Lucas really is just a hack. Without a Kaufman or a Kasdan to do all the hard work or a Spielberg to pick up the directorial slack, Lucas is just a big stupid kid telling big stupid stories. If Episode II were some other sci-fi franchise, I would regard it merely as an unbearably awful film. But as it's another step in Lucas' ongoing mission to destroy both his own legend and the Star Wars universe, I can only give it my utter contempt.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Never during any of the previous four Star Wars films had I ever felt bored.  But whenever Anakin and Amidala were frolicking in the meadow, or snuggling by the fireplace, or slow dancing at the Jedi prom, I nearly fell asleep.  God those parts were boring.  You know, Han and Leia sorta just ended up in love with almost no courtship whatsoever, and no one complained.  Why did Lucas bother this time?As best I can tell, anyone who enjoyed this film simply enjoyed the sheer spectacle of it.  The big, loud, expensive, visually impressive spectacle of it.  There's nothing wrong with that; I like spectacle as much as the next guy.  I like watching the fireworks on the Fourth of July, too.

"""Be mindful of your thoughts...""","Perhaps even now, nearly 3 years since this movie first appeared on screens, it may be too early to fairly judge the second chapter of the Star Wars saga, The Attack of the Clones. As the pieces of this awkward jig-saw puzzle that is the Star Wars saga come together, it has become more and more difficult to judge the stories of each chapter. How will it set up the next movie? How much of the first and second movies relate to the last 3 movies? Do we need to care about these characters? After the final movie of the the 6 movie series by George Lucas hits the screens in May 2005, the successes and failures of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones will finally be clear. I say all of this because I have always been a fan of the Star Wars movies, and as excited as I was to see new movies about the time long ago in the galaxy far, far away, it has been hard to say that these first two movies have been what was expected. The original Star Wars movies were full of joy and whimsy, going places we have never been before, battling an enemy we have never seen before, but can identify with. Good vs. Evil is easy to see, and perhaps it's that the early episodes in the saga are murky in who's good and who isn't hinders the films. The Attack of the Clones looks great; we know everything is generated by a computer, but still looks right and good enough that we accept it as real. My favorite scene is how the special effects artists zooms from one passing ship to another, making it look like it was shot with a real camera. The acting is wooden, perhaps encouraged by the dry script. The love story we are subjected to is pretty lame, which for ""forbidden"" love, that's hard to do. Where is Han Solo and Princess Leia's sassy triste when you really need it? Ewan McGregor is good enough as Obi-Won Kenobi, but the other characters are unmemorable and uninteresting. The story itself, I will say this, it does leave a lot of interesting places for the 3rd film to go, assuming of course Lucas does that. I said the same thing after Phantom Menace but Attack of the Clones didn't really capitalize on the openings that were there. Again, the ultimate judge on this film is how it fits in with the other segments of the Star Wars saga. If this was the build-up to a climatic Revenge of the Sith, then it will be worth your time to check out Episode 2. If the third movie veers off into other plot points, then don't waste your time with Attack of the Clones. Just go out and rent The Empire Strikes Back for a well done middle cog to a 3 movie trilogy.Note: After seeing Revenge of the Sith, this movie is almost rendered pointless. It does set up a few plot points in Revenge of the Sith, but nothing that could not be handled through conversations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Clones Are Coming!,"I will start this comment with a thing I didn't like: Hayden Christensen being Anakin Skywalker. I saw one of the producers saying that one of the things they use to choose the actors who would play Anakin and Padme, was their looks: they needed to look similar to their kids, Luke and Leia. Natalie Portman is okay, but Hayden Cristensen doesn't have ANYTHING similar in his looks to Luke Skywalker. So, this was not good at all to me.In the second Episode of Star Wars ''Attack of the Clones '', 10 years have passed since the first Episode, and now we have Obi Wan Kenobi as a master and Anakin as his young adult padawan.Padme, ex Queen, is now a Senator representing her world. Anakin behaves like a rebel, and he is very arrogant because he knows about his own abilities;Sometimes he has lapses and thoughts that will lead him to be the famous Darth Vader in the future.(One thing is true: it's funny to see Anakin saying that he considers Obi Wan as his father..sounds very ironical when you know how Star Wars is going to end).Senator Palpatine starts to persuade Anakin that he is the best of the Jedis, Jar Jar Binks is a member of the council and Shmi, Anakin's mother, dies because she was tortured and kidnapped by the people of the Sand. (We can see the Lars, that in the future will take care of Luke in Tattoine).A planetarium system called Kamino was deleted from the computers.(Only a Jedi could do this) Obi Wan had the information about this planet with a friend, and he is decided to found out what's happening behind all this secret: he rides a ship to Kamino and there he sees a clone army, prepared to serve the republic. The original model for the clones was a guy called Jango Fett, a reward hunter who knows many secrets.The Jedi code forbids romance but this is not enough to hold Anakin: He marries Padmé.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"An improvement over TPM, though the 'love scenes' made me cringe","I'll never forget how surprised I was when I saw this film opening night. I didn't have to line up (like I did with TPM) so that had me worried right there. I was in a theatre with teenagers that constantly heckled parts (mainly those 'love' scenes). So that ruined the experience for me. In terms of action and story, I'd say it was an improvement over TPM. So that's a good thing. The lightsaber duel at the end was pretty cool. Though the one in TPM is still the best (until I see the ones in ROTS of course). Overall, I think it moved the story forward in a decent way. I don't really see Anakin as a pain as most people did. He is a teenager and pretty whiney so that's to be expected. I didn't like his choice of 'lines' to Padme though. I would be pretty afraid to use those lines on a chick :). It reminds me of what Carrie Fisher said in an interview about Lucas' writing: 'You can write/type this stuff out on paper, you just can't say it'. That's basically my feeling about it. Still, I give it a high rating because, as painful as those scenes were.....seeing the action and Jango/Obi Wan scenes (and the arena battle) made up for it all.Bottom line: If you can look past the dialogue in some parts and enjoy this movie for what it is - a nice escape from reality (and I really mean that) then please give this movie a chance. I know there are a lot of people who haven't seen this yet, as TPM disgusted them THAT much. Well, to all of you, come on!!. If you want a thought provoking/change your life experience........why see a movie and expect that to happen?!!.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An Improvement over A Phantom Menace but not too great!,"Attack of The Clones is thankfully an improvement over its atrocious predecessor. However, there were still a lot of problems in the script and some casting decisions.This movie is set 10 years after the events of the previous one. Hayden Christensen plays the crucial role of Anakin Skywalker. His childish and petulant demeanor undermine the character that he is portraying. Considering the fact that Anakin Skywalker will become the omnipotent Darth Vader, I believe a better actor could have been chosen for this iconic character.Anakin Skywalker, who has become a Jedi is assigned to protect Senator Padme (Natalie Portman). Their hardly any chemistry between the two actors and hence the attempt to portray a romance between them fails miserably.There are a lot of unnecessary characters like Jar Jar Binks, who is a constant source of disturbance. A tighter plot would have served the movie better. John Williams is the composer and gives us a moving score.Even though both this movie is decent, it still lacks in quality when compared to the original trilogy. I would say that this is certainly a movie that is worth your time if you don't focus too much on the minor distractions that are present throughout the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Well...it was better than Phantom Menace...""","That's pretty much the general sentiment about the Episode II, but I would have to disagree because that would imply that The Phantom Menace was any good.  A better assessment might be that Attack of the Clone was no worse. It's basically a bunch of long drawn out sequences involving indiscernible politics (except, perhaps, to the fanatics)  and a painfully forced romance, plus another annoying scene involving a fat, four-armed alien in a diner, punctuated by a string of action sequences that just barely save this film from being a total waste of $9.25.But one other thing that kind of spoils Star Wars for me is that Boba Fett is given an origin.  I don't know about anyone else but I thought the one thing that was cool about Fett was that he was just this bounty hunter sent by Jabba the Hutt to capture Han Solo.  Period.  He didn't seem to have to do anything with the Jedi; he only entered the picture because of Solo.  He was a character that seemed to exist apart from the whole Jedi storyline and simply was doing a job for a powerful gangster.  That made the Star Wars mythos richer for me, the idea that the Jedi storyline wasn't the only thing going on in the universe.  Now ATotC has gone and entwined his story with that of the Jedi and it suddenly all seems less plausible.  Now, presumably, Boba Fett will exact his revenge by killing some Jedi or some such but then what?  In eps IV-VI, we see him as *just* a bounty hunter and, considering the import attached to him in ep II, his death in ep VI (falling into a living pit) comes across as anti-climactic.  Just my impression...",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The most underrated star wars movie ever,For years I considered this movie boring and was my least favourite of the series. After rogue one and Solo I did a rewatch to the whole saga and completely changed my mind about episode 2. I has by far the best light saber battles. Great action scenes overall and we see Anakin at his best as Jedi. Also the whole politics plot everyone was hating is amazing after all to see how genius were Palpatine's actions. Comparing to the new awful trilogy this movie seems a like masterpiece now so do your self a favour and watch it again if you ever dislike it.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Cartoons,"It took a while for me to figure out what really turned me off about the last two Star Wars episodes. Sure there are the obvious things like bad acting and go-nowhere scripts, as well as uninspired and unimaginitive dialogue, but there was something else. Then, it hit me.It was the cartoons! Call them CGI, call them what you will, they're cartoons in every sense of the word. There is hardly a scene in the last two Star Wars episodes without some kind of corny cartoonish Disneyesque figure dancing about in some exaggerated way.What's wrong with cartoons on the screen? People don't take them seriously, and when you can't take what's happening on screen seriously it becomes hard to suspend your disbelief.The first three movies relied on human actors, and the aliens were humans in alien costumes, not computer graphics. Conversations between human characters and computer generated cartoons don't work, and come off looking quite silly. I think in a few years we'll look back on the infancy of this media with a touch of disdain. Episode I and II, and probably III will not have the timeless appeal of IV, V, and VI because of it.When I go to see a Star Wars movie I expect to see a Star Wars movie, not Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (Sorry Roger, no disrespect).Bring back the people! Lose the cartoonish ""busyness"" in every shot!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Attack of the digital effects,"Clones is a slight improvement on the previous prequel The Phantom Menace.It is still heavily bogged down by a multitude of factors such as poor scripting,wooden acting and dizzying use of digital effects.Hayden Christensen as Anakin is far from convincing,his petulance makes him more hormonal teenager than potential Darth Vader.His scenes with Natalie Portman are cringeworthy and lack that deftness of touch inherent to a great acting performance.All the technical and creative problems cast aside,the main problem with Attack Of The Clones and the prequels as a whole for that they are redundant storywise.We know what happens.Gone is the tension and revelation of Empire Strikes Back,digital effects have lost their 'wow' factor and the film suffers badly for investing too much in them.Lucas is however, a man who listens to his detractors,the main comic relief of the previous film,Jar Jar Binks, is almost entirely omitted from this film,surely a reaction to the venomous repsone his over inclusion in 'Menace' provoked,proof indeed that the public gets what the public wants.The sad thing about the quality of these prequels is that they will inevitably tarnish the glowing reputation of the earlier films.Financially,George Lucas will have gained imeasurably from legions of fans aching for more from this galaxy far,far away.Artistically,he will be considered a has-been,out of touch with the modern cinema goer.In summary Attack Of The Clones could probably be better names Attack Of The Digital Effects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie is a great addition to the series without a doubt.,"For fans of the original trilogy of films Attack of the Clones is made for you in mind. On that level it is immensely enjoyable. Those that are not interested would find it harded to get involved or wrapped up in because this movie will leave you asking a lot of question while it answers questions for fans. I personally liked this movie and I found the acting to be just fine. Hayden Christensen does a great job playing Anakin. The whole purpose of his character is to show how such a good kid could be swayed to do evil, to commit evil. Those that critizize the prequels do so because they expect it to be very dark and full of mayhem. Those looking for faults will find it because that's what they are looking for. If there is a criticism that I could levy it is these: 1. this movie is not made for those who know little to nothing about Star Wars. 2. the love story did not have to be so thin. As it stands it seems as if Amidala's affections are in response to her and Anakin's dire circumstances. I am a guy and I still thought some scenes should have been left in order to show some of Amidala's passion giving in to Anakin, a tad more teasing from Amidala to Anakin and vice versa. 3. Show a bit more of Anakin's vengence on the Tusken raiders camp. George Lucas intends for this movie to be darker but I believe he shyed away from this key point to Anakin's psyche here. Another theory I have as to why some are thrilled with AotC and some aren't is who you as the viewer identified with as a child watching the movies. As a child I saw the classic triology through the eyes of Luke Skywalker. Those of you who idetified with Han Solo would be hard pressed to find him in these prequels and for you the saga doesn't live up to what you remembered. There is really no skeptic of the 'Force' in these prequels. In these prequels I identify with Anakin and I wonder how he becomes Darth Vader? That to me is the whole point of the prequels and to me I really do want to see how that innocent little boy becomes so supremely evil. In Episode II there are hints to these machinations in Anakin's head. There is still so much ground to cover for George Lucas in the next installment and as a fan of great movies I can't wait to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Attack of Clones Puts Pieces Together.,"I want to say that Star Wars Episode 2 was a great, action-packed movie. It gives perspective to the Trilogy (4,5,6) that episode 1 failed to do. While Episode 1 was setting up at plot, (and doing a very bad job at it) Episode 2 starts to lead you into the originial trilogy with the Death Star Plans, The Imperial Stormtroopers, & the Foreshadowing. Besides from the love scenes (which every ""great"" movie has to have) the movie was awesome: Plenty of Jedi battles, New Planets, The introduction to important characters later on, & even Yoda gets into it with his lightsaber & jedi powers. I liked it & i hope you will too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Cmon it was fun!,"I think people are overly harsh concerning these movies. A lot of people complain about the use of CGI vs. modeling in the original trilogy, but this is a bunch of bull. If Lucas had the capability to use CGI in the first trilogy, he definitely would have used it. The only reason that he didn't use it was that he couldn't, so instead he spent an inordinate amount of time creating set pieces and large-scale miniatures of ships (Milennium Falcon, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, Star Destroyers, the Death Star). This must have cost an absolute fortune, not to mention that the manpower effort to realize his visions must have been staggering. And while I agree that the use of models has allowed those movies to stand up to the test of time (I recently watched the trilogy on DVD for the first time in years), I still think there is a lot of good stuff in this installment. The CGI is amazing, particularly the sequence showing the rescue of Anakin, Obi Wan and Amidala on Tatooine. I thought Yoda's fighting sequence was well-done (he's the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy - why is this so unbelievable?) And the chase with Obi Wan and Anakin trailing the would be assassin through the skyways makes the similar scene in the 5th element look like a coarse little flip-book (a movie which has a higher score on this site). The acting was a deterrent - especially in depicting the love story of Padme and Anakin. Gone is Liam Neeson, but added was Christopher Lee, a favorite of mine. Unfortunately this incarnation of Anakin is highly annoying, much more so than the boy from Ep. 1. I simply could not accept that Amidala would fall in love with this immature, arrogant little punk for a second. Still, I give the movie an 8. People's expectations are way too high for these movies, mostly because of the phenomenon the original series spawned. I think it is unfair to judge these movies in this way, but rather to take them as they are without trying to constantly compare them to the originals. The originals are obviously superior, without doubt; however the originals are also some of the greatest movies ever made, and to expect the same this time around is unfair; it is difficult to catch lightning in a bottle once, let alone 6 times - Lucas managed to do it 3 times with the original movies, and while these are not on the same level, they are enjoyable nonetheless. 7 of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm Going to Pretend This Never Happened...,"I'm 33.  I grew up with Star Wars.  It was an integral part of my childhood.  Heck, I understood the concept of the force before I was able to grasp the religion I was to dutifully learn each weekend.  Now, Mr Lucas has followed up two of the best movies ever made (Jedi wasn't so good) with what should have been a sequel to his ""Howard the Duck"" film adaptation. I'm not sure what caused me more discomfort, the insipid dialogue or the wooden way the cast spewed the insipid dialogue.  Star Wars had compelling characters and a story line that left you begging for more.  This movie, and it's most recent predecessor, left you begging for the end of the movie and of Lucas' career as a writer. Not only was this movie simply awful, with no redeeming value, everyone who grew up loving Luke and hating Darth Vader has been betrayed.

There is unrest in the Galactic Senate.......,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is written and directed by George Lucas. It's the fifth Star Wars film to be released but the second in terms of story chronology. It stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Temuera Morrison & Ian McDiarmid. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography is by David Tattersall. Set 10 years after the events featured in The Phantom Menace, the story sees the Galactic Republic under threat from separatists and a civil war looms. As Naboo Senator Padme Amidala is in danger of assassination, Jedi Padawan Skywalker is assigned to protect her. Meanwhile, Obi-wan Kenobi makes the worrying discovery of a clone army, a discovery that spells chaos for the galaxy.Now that the dust has settled on the prequel trilogy, it seems that Attack of the Clones is the one of the six film's that is most unliked by the fans. Which on structure terms is perhaps understandable given its heavy leaning towards the romantic strand between Amidala and Annakin (they are no Han & Leia that's for sure). Yet for all its problems (script/dialogue/acting/CGI mania) it's a marginally better film than Phantom Menace; nicely whetting the appetite for part three as well. If you can negotiate the mundane periods and accept it's merely the bridge to a better part of the film galaxy? Then it's a more palatable experience.Lucas has thankfully learnt some lessons from his first instalment (for example it's practically bye bye Binksy), but being the episode in which so much has to be set up in the franchise (reasons for love/hate/politics/family ties), Lucas is hand-tied as to how he can please the masses; and you feel that away from blunderbuss action he's not very comfortable directing such dialogue driven passages of play. However, the characters are now better formed, with the likes of McGregor looking more at ease playing such an iconic role, and if it's action you want, then you get payed up in full with colourful carnage: particularly for monster smack down time in a gladiatorial arena. Bonuses see Jackson more prominent as an ass kicker, Lee delicious as the villainous Count Dooku and Yoda (with a digital upgrade) makes a telling mar;, these are things that greatly improve the final third of the piece. While the print (it's all shot on HD Digital) positively sparkles in a way that insists you see it on the best available format you can.After the mixed reaction to Phantom Menace, and with it vying for punters in 2002 with Spider-Man, Harry Potter and the second Lord of the Rings, Attack of the Clones suffered at the box office in terms of financial expectation. For even tho it made around about $500 million in Worldwide profit, it remains (allowing for adjusted inflation) the lowest performing Star Wars film in the series. Revisits to the film show it to still have the same old flaws, but it's far from being a bad film. It has the darker edges that were required (ala Empire Strikes Back) and there's too much high octane entertainment for it to ever be considered dull as a whole. But does the charge of action and effects over script and characters still stick, then? Well, yes, but this is George Lucas after all.....7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than Star Wars,"I'm still deciding whether Attack of the Clones is the best Star Wars movie or the second best.  All sentimentality aside, this movie literally took my breath away, something A New Hope never did.  Before last night my favourite SW film was The Empire Strikes Back, then ANH, Return of the Jedi and finally, Episode I.  Episode II fits either at the start or just after Empire.  I read a few reviews before seeing the film and noted that critics tend to expect any film to be perfect in every way.  Comments like ""terrible scripting"" and ""bad acting"" seem to be thrown around often but I'm sure if ANH was released today it would get just as bad reviews, maybe worse.  In one line Attack of the Clones is as good as The Phantom Menace was bad. The special effects were freaky good and only one or two CG shots (out of hundreds) looked a tad fake.  The rest is worthy of an Academy Award (although it may be forgotten by then).  The sound was equally amazing from the seat rocking explosions to the bustling city of Coruscant to the quite waters of Naboo.  I was especially impressed with the re-introduction of some of the old favourites (read: lasers).  The score was fantastic and added so much to the film, plus picking up on the little themes from the original trilogy (Emperial March etc) weaved into the new score was a delight.  The final shot was almost identical to the final shot in Empire Strikes Back except this time we have Anakin and Padme standing arm in arm while C3PO and R2D2 look on.  Ahhhh, I just want to watch this film over and over again until Episode III comes out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Really not that terrible.,"A huge Star Wars fan myself, I'll always say the originals are better than the PT (except for maybe RotS, which is tied with the originals IMO), but that doesn't mean the PT is utter crap. Like any movie, they aren't perfect and have their flaws. Attack of the Clones is no different. There are definitely some boring scenes, BAD dialogue, crappy editing, so on and so forth... but it's not shite like many other Star Wars fans say.Being a girl, I have to say I like romance mixed in with all the action, which can be found in other movies like ""Sin City"". The biggest problem with AotC is that's exactly what is supposed to happen, and it...does...kind of. The love story between Anakin and Padme was so horribly underdeveloped, or at least executed poorly. How are they supposed to be in love? Because Anakin thinks she's pretty, and she's attracted to whiny men? I don't get it. Lucas really needed some help on that entire portion of the script. If he had accepted help from other screenwriters, maybe a general audience would have believed these two are supposed to be in LOVE. And, as it has been said before, the romantic dialogue really needed tweaking. I won't say it's horrible, but it's far from good. It lacks any sort of real emotional depth or personality for the character.My second problem with AotC is Count Dooku. Who the hell is he? We don't even see the amazing Christopher Lee until the final half-hour of the film. He was another mysterious, undeveloped character in the PT, almost as if he were simply thrown into the mix of things just to be a villain. I must say I really enjoyed his lightsaber duel with Yoda, so at least he had one really good fight scene.The third problem is the editing. Some scenes dragged on way too long, others were cut too short. I also think a few of the deleted scenes should have been left in for the sake of character development. It might have added a longer running time and taken away from the ""action"" Lucas was so obsessed with in the PT, but at least we would have been able to know the characters better.The 4th and biggest problem I have with Ep. II is the MAJOR lack of a good soundtrack. John Williams is my favorite movie composer of all time, and the Star Wars saga would not be the same without his music. I'm disappointed he didn't do better on this installment's soundtrack, save for the ""Across the Stars"" theme, which is absolutely gorgeous. However, it's the only great song on there, unlike the other Star Wars official soundtracks. Sad, really.Despite its' flaws, Attack of the Clones is not an awful movie, and still one of my favorites despite the bad parts. It's a fair 5th installment in the Star Wars saga, and well worth a viewing, maybe even two or three.See it if only for Yoda. In this one, kick major ass he does. =)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!,"Episode II is an absolutely stunning film.  I loved Episode I and was even more impressed with the next installment.  Hayden Christensen does an excellent job in portraying the anger and hatred of a young and impressionable Anakin.  I was truly impressed with him.This film feels much more connected to the original trilogy as well, with much more foreshadowing of events to come and a wonderful score by John Williams that incorporates more of the original music.  You leave the theater waiting for more.  I hope that George Lucas has something great in mind to conclude this trilogy because it will be hard to top the final 45 minutes of this movie.  He does open up a lot of questions and will really need to tie things together with the original trilogy.As far as special effects go, the film is visually stunning.  The effects are much more seamless than Episode I and the final battle is outstanding. Fans of the original trilogy who did not like Episode I will have their faith renewed and those who did like Episode I will like this movie even more.One final word...

Jackson repeated the role he's used to great success in every film he's ever been in; he takes himself far too seriously. And why haven't these brilliant Jedi Knights ever figured out that if they just put wrist-straps on their light sabers they won't drop them just out of reach every 15 seconds? Yes, the fight scenes and graphics were outstanding. Unfortunately, that's not enough to make a great film. Sorry George, but Elian Gonzales could have done a better job.

What a piece of...,"It is time to set things straight, and bring the true balance to the Force in the field of cinema -- Episodes I and II should forever be banned from being associated to the original triology.  I don't care if they involve same characters with same names.  I don't care if it is set in the same galaxy far, far away that same long time ago.  These two movies have forever marred the legacy of Star Wars.What a piece of junk this one was!  This was worse that Episode II. Okay, I did have a bias going into the theaters -- not that of high expectation, but with a very LOW one.  Alas, those trailers only got me excited about going to the theater with my friends and point out all the hilarious scenes that the previews provided; especially parts involving the absurd ""love"" story. Who wrote this crap?  It was like an unhappy medium between the dialogues in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Spawn"".  And what about direction on acting, or lack there of?  Did George Lucas just let the actors say the line once and finish the rest of the scene in CG lab?  Or did he intentionally direct them to speak in as boring fashion as possible?Anakin Skywalker, of course, was not a flat character, oh no.  He was waaaay too much of a drama queen.  Look, this is someone who, although a teenager, grows up to be the most dark (literally), mysterious, fear-inspiring (and thus, undoubtly coolest) character in cinematic history.  And here he is, 18 years old (or something like that), crying like a baby about not getting any from the former Queen Amidala and crying like a bitch about how Obiwan is holding him back.  What a joke of a character!  I already have less respect for Darth Vader because of what has been done in this movie.  It's like seeing a ""Before They Were Stars"" video on Vader and poking fun at stupid stuff that he used to do before hitting the big time.  Of course, in my universe, I'm still in denial that Episodes I and II are NOT part of the whole Star Wars saga.And there are a WHOLE lot more complaints, but I trust that the sensible moviegoers who post these reviews have done enough bashing on this decrepit piece of turd already.  But before I finish, I must share an Episode II opening night experience that my friend had.The theater was packed with fans watching the movie (many with utter discontent and shock), it reached the part when Anakin was having a little fireside chat with Amidala, crying (like a baby) about love, how horny he is, etc.  He says something like this: ""That kiss that you should never have given me haunts me every night...(sob sob, whine whine)...I'm in AGONY!""

The Best Movie In The Star Wars Prequel Trilogy,"Star wars episode 2 attack of the clones is not horrible. While I'll say that the dialogue is terrible and the love story is worthless, Other than that the story is pretty solid. The worst element of The Phantom Menace was the characters. I am happy to say they are much better in this. (Even though that's like saying a slingshot is more complicated than a rock). The character's in this movie can generate at least a bit of empathy. The acting in this movie is often criticized. I don't think this is fair. You have to remember that the dialogue is robotic and unrealistic that I doubt Malcolm McDowell could have pulled off Anakin, and George Lucas was directing these actors. Samuel .l was miscast and the rest of the actors had no real reason to be cast as their characters. The story in this is somewhat compelling and sometimes even interesting, which is a lot in the Star Wars Prequels. It revolves around Anakin having to protect Padme and Obi-wan having to find the person who ordered her assassination. The beginning is solid, the middle isn't horrible and the end is kind of exciting. The worst element of the movie is it's love story. There's been so much said about this I don't need to add anything, but I concur with those who say it is pointless, doesn't make sense, cliché and dumb. The special effects (which I estimate twenty times the amount of time was spent on than the script) are pretty great. It doesn't really look that real, but it does open a lot of possibilities, like the arena scene and the droid-clone battle. This about wraps it up. It's not The Godfather, but it's a nice, decent Star Wars movie. And Jake Lloyd is gone. Thank Christ.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

One of the best,"When i first saw Episode II in theaters, I wondered what everyone was complaining about. It was very exciting and action packed. There were lots of subtle things going on that people could easily mistake weak plot and bad acting.First, I'll start with the love story. People often said that Christenen was wooden and was a terrible actor. I found him to be very natural and, he had very realistic and human reactions and dialog. Most audiences were expecting a more heroic, easier to relate to hero than Hayden Christensen played. I thought he was very, very good. Natalie Portman was also very good in her role, and was allowed to be more natural than in The Phantom Menance.Ewan McGregor, undoubtedly, carried the movie on his shoulders. He is, quite possibly, the best actor in the entire series. On top of that, he was allowed to be much more active in this movie, speeding around the galaxy and what-not.Temura Morrison was excellent as one of the new villains, Boba Fett's father. While he died anti-climatically, he still was very cool and threatening. It was also very cool to know that the Storm troopers from the end of III, and IV, V, and VI were all based on Jango Fetts clones, who were the original ""Clone Troopers"", who brought back memories of the sterile-white armored Storm troopers from the original trilogy.The special-effects in this movie, like those of the Phantom Menace and the DVD releases of the originals, were absolutely mind-blowing. The backgrounds were incredibly detailed and incredibly realistic. The chase scene through Corusant was awesome, as were all the Clone troopers (who were digitally created) and the end battle scenes. Yoda's end fight was also very fun to watch and visually amazing.I don't understand why people don't like this movie. 'Attack of the Clones' is one of the best, along with 'The Empire Strikes Back', and, my favorite, 'Revenge of the Sith'. While this movie was not perfect, I still give it ****3/4 out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Succeeds in spite of itself,"""Attack of the Clones"" opens 10yrs later and finds Queen, er, Senator Padme Amidala still playing her look alike decoy games even though this surely would've been public knowledge after the events of ""Phantom Menace"". Weak. Then we find Anakin now about 20yo as apprentice to longer haired Obi-Wan but when they meet Padme, love-lorn Anakin goes way off script backtalking Obi-Wan forcing the latter to chastise him in front of everyone. This scene is beyond ridiculous since any such recalcitrant behavior would've been disciplined out of him by this point. So weak. Then the speeder chase scene at night in a lot of multi-level traffic proceeds mishap-free as if there were no other vehicles in sight. Weak. And this is just the opening few minutes! The dialogue is just immature at best, and all Anakin's patronizing ""yes, Master""'ing is so tiresome. When the assailant/fugitive is captured by Obi and Anakin - which btw are neglecting their primary protection duty of Padme - the bounty hunter who hired her darts her dead when he could've as easily darted them! They apparently didn't ""sense"" that danger! There are key story elements that dangle like loose ends. For instance, what is this prophecy of One who will bring the Force back into balance? That was first brought up in Phantom but it's not detailed/described, there's no evidence the Force is out of balance! There's just this unsupported bantering about it. The whole Padme/Anakin dynamic which is supposed to be Jedi protecting a Senator is a dumb romantic courtship. Someone as influential and attractive as Padme would've long been taken by another politician to increase their power structure, but instead we're treated to an adolescent fever dream. The rest of the film suffers from the same half-baked writing and direction, thanks again to an unchecked George Lucas. This is the poor level of storytelling/film-making you get when the same guy is the only executive producer, director, writer, and editor! That's one dude with control issues.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the last episode,The plot line sort of splits apart but still remains cohesive and sort of gels well together in an epic battle.

Does this movie even have a pulse?,"by Dane YoussefUm.... did ANYONE like this movie? Anyone, anywhere... ever? This one seems to be ranking right up there with his ""Howard the Duck.""But at least people had some kind of strong passion for that one. Any extreme movie (exterme in any way) is a likely candidate for the ""cult following."" But this one is just boring.I wanted to kick it as hard as I could, not out of anger, but just to see if it's even alive.If it is, it's flat-lining.I remember when George Lucas announce that he was going to release the last three ""Star Wars"" movies (which ironically were the first three), the whole wide world jumped up.When ""Episode I"" was finally released, it was met with lukewarm reviews (from critics and fans alike). From the fair-weather to the hard-core, industrial strength fans.And everyone in between.Many people ride Lucas and get on his case about his inability to write dialog (myself included).Hey, let's face it. The man couldn't write dialog for a mime. Which is why he always hires a script doctor whenever he makes a film from his own screenplay. Hey, this is just called just plain common sense.Many filmmakers try to re-make the kinds of movies that they first fell in love with when they were young. That not only applies to Lucas, he is the very definition of that. With futuristic Orwell tales (""THX 1138""), period action-adventure summer matinées (""Indianda Jones""), sci-fi space operas (""Star Wars,"" of course) and medieval sword-and-sorcery flicks (""Willow"").His abilities are in composing a movie lie in production values and state-of-the-art, groundbreaking, revolutionary special effects. Bringing everything about a genre together in one film and playing it to the hilt.So Lucas brought on Johnathan Hales (""The Scropian King"" and TV's ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"") as script doctor. Lucas' wise decision helped them take home the 2002 Razzie Award for Worst Screenplay. Hey, f--- the Oscars.This was apparently the very first major-motion picture not to be shot on film, but on a special digital video movie camera that SONY designed specifically for Lucas himself.I saw the movie on DVD, so being shot on digital video and being run on digital video disk, the movie was so sharp and so exact and so precise and so full of detail, I was amazed. When I saw ""Episode I"" in theaters, it didn't stand out this beautifully.However, that momentary feeling eventually disintegrated and I was left with a feeling of indifference, then some boredom, then finally contempt.The first released chapter in the ""Star Wars"" saga (Episode IV: A New Hope) showed a lot of the movie's themes came from old westerns and samurai pictures. In ""Episode II,"" I got the feeling the movie got a lot of it's inspiration from war movies. You know, ""Gettysburg"" and the like.The could make for one hell of a little movie, except for the fact that this one is completely on Valium.Breaktaking visual scenery and first-rate FX (the entire movie was filmed in front of a blue screen) can't compensate for performances by actors who understandably seem have to have almost no love for a script that could have been written by a coma patient and a director who's far too assured that ""it'll all be fixed and filled out in editing and special effects later."" I know damned well Hayden Christensen is capable of acting. I've seen it. He seems to be channeling his role from ""Life As A House"" (no doubt that's why Lucas chose Christensen in the first place.But the script and lack of direction seem to suck all the potential out of him. He never seems to be truly there at all.Nor does scholar and sometimes-actress Natalie Portman. I feel kinda guilty saying this and all, but I never truly believed her as a action movie heroine in ""Episode I."" She just lacks that spunk and fire. You know, the kind that Carrie Fisher really had for almost every second she was on screen, especially when she shared scenes with Ford.Portman simply can't do a Bidget Fonda or Pam Grier or Karen Allen. She's too sweet and vulnerable. Well, at least she seems more at home here. Although as sweet and beautiful as she is, there is no passion. Not in what she says or anything they do together.They never seem to be in love so much as just sitting back practicing Shakesphere-style acting and mood for a theater performance.It's nice to know good IL' Bobby Simone, yes--Jimmy Smits (Of TV's ""L.A. Law"" and NYPD Blue"" fame) is still out there and plugging away as an actor. He gets a bit in here as a Jedi Master on the council.The only action sequences of any interest throughout take place when a Sith and Jedi masters have a powerful duel which leads to further hate and anger.The dark side is claiming more and more Jedi by the second.And all this could've great for another great ""Star Wars"" classics.But the movie is has no life or energy. It seems almost indifferent. Like Lucas didn't have his heart (or anything else in this one).He basically just wanted to get this one out of the way. The only thing he had in this movie is his wallet.This whole damn movie feels like something he had to just something mandatory he had to get out of the way so he could bridge episodes I and III and continue with the rest of the series.With the others, you know the filmmakers are giving it everything they had. Here... no one cares. Not even Lucas.--For Force And Empire, Dane Youssef",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
George Lucas does it again - unfortunately,"Star Wars Episode Two, Attack of the Clowns...  I'm glad I saw it - and I'm sorry I paid for it.  Hell, I'm sorry they didn't pay *me* to see it.  At the end, my only comment was ""thank God"" (as in ""thank God its *over*"").A few million dollars worth of special effects and computer generated characters (which were spectacular, by the way) could not disguise the stilted acting, choppy directing, p***-poor script, teen angst writ large, ridiculous premises providing the foundation for a hackneyed storyline, total predictability of denoument and reascension, and wimpy-cutesy casting. The original Star Wars was at some level a space epic and at others a space opera.  Star Wars Attack of the Clowns was the Backstreet Boys in a 1965 amateur movie script with 2001 CG effects.  At one point a drone sneaks up to Senator Padme's window (she used to be Queen Hairdoo), and in an assassination attempt, drills a hole in the window and inserts a couple of very poisonous centipede-like things.  Why the hell didn't the drone just *SHOOT* her?  And WHY does the drone return to the assassin, instead of just self destructing?The first movie was saved by the acting skills of Alec Guinness, the fresh and optimistic presence of Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hammill, the comic relief of R2D2 and C3PO, and oh yeah, a script and costumes stolen right from Akira Kurasowa's ""Hidden Fortress"".  In Attack of the Clowns I half expected one Jedi to say ""Sure is quiet in here"", and the other to reply ""Yeah, a little too quiet"".   Christopher Lee and Ian McDiarmid weren't bad, but Yoda limped like a crepitous old geezer and then fought like Bruce Lee, the monsters were ridiculous assemblages of teeth and spikes, Samuel Jackson sucked, Jimmy Smits sucked, Ewan MacGregor sucked, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman *really* sucked (and even when they sucked face, they sucked).  C3PO delivered lines that would be appropriate for a Marvel Comic (his head is removed in a fight and is now near his body - he says ""I'm beside myself"" amidst the action of the battle), only Marvel would have rejected the lines.  Oh, and Senator Padme has an insanely intricate hairdo and stunning outfit in each scene - James Bond just has a new suit, Padme is fully accessorized!  And while I can suspend disbelief and allow for a jump to lightspeed, I have trouble accepting a character falling from a vehicle moving at 70mph, going ""oof"", and getting up again with hairdo and/or bones intact.The movie's tagline is ""A Jedi Shall Not Know Anger.

I know, everyone's going to hate me for saying that, but I don't care (why do people think that he sounds Jamaican?; I thought that he sounded Cajun).As for the rest of the characters, they're all doing what they can, but given the epic scale of the story, there's not much that they can do except say their lines.

"Episode II, not strong with The Force","George Lucas's ""Star Wars: Episode II-- Attack of the Clones"" is pretty good, and a theatrical puzzle-- not necessarily in a good way. Episode II has a few things going for it: a talented cast including Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson, is a gorgeous movie to look at, and has a whole mythology which has become part of popular culture. Early on there is breath-taking ""sky diving"" scene in an aerial city with Jedi Padwan, Anikan Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), and his mentor, a now older Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). This is well done-- great pace, action, full of life. The movie, however soon bogs down.George Lucas and Jonathan Hales have constructed a very wordy script that is full of content about the trade wars, the unrest in the Republic, the conspiracy against the Jedi, and a lame love story between Anikan (Christensen) and Padme (Natalie Portman). There is really no context. If the context of Episode II is to illicit pathos for Anikan's journey down the Dark Side of the Force, it fails or is a half-hearted attempt. Rather Episode II shies away from the dark nature of the legacy. There in may lie the problem-- we all know how the story will end. There is a great scene where Anikan attacks out of anger (even though justified), and later vows that he will be all powerful, because he wasn't strong enough. Following this he whines to Padme (Natalie Portman). What is going on? This does not work for the man who will eventually become the evil and merciless, Darth Vader. Hayden Christensen is a good actor and charismatic, but his lines and the part of Anikan were so inconsistent. The dialog in Episode II is horrible throughout. Anikan really comes off as some whiny punk kid, rather than someone threatening and on the verge of malevolence. After all Anikan will become Darth Vader. Once again this is not a problem with the actor, but the story.The love story between Anikan and Padme is like ""Naboo 90210"". It is a given that they will be together. Obi-wan and Anikan are the Jedi assigned by the Republic to protect now Naboo Senator Padme Amidala after a failed assassination attempt on the senator. 10 years have past since they were together in Episode I. Anikan soon falls in love with Padme which is not allowed for a Jedi.Ewan McGregor is good as the now mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. He gives a new maturity and gravity to the character. Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu is kind of the ""Shaft Jedi"". He kicks some butt. There are some great action scenes in Episode II, and there could have been more. The completely CGI Yoda gets to lay the smack-down at the end, as only the Jedi Master can. This is awesome, and almost saves the movie. Almost.I saw Episode II at a midnight showing on opening day with some dear friends-- so I am a fan. I will see it again. And I did wait a while before writing a comment. For me, although the movie looks great and has some awesome things in it, as a whole it lacks a soul. It seems like Lucas did not have the courage to give it a dark one, while providing the underlying context of Hope that we are familiar with in the stories of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Episode II is terribly flat and uninspired.,"Sigh, there are times when you yearn for the glorious victory songs of Ewoks. ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" may have destroyed the glorious Star Wars mythology, and I am not sure whose fault this is.The script is choppy and cheesy. While we are not privileged to see Anakin kick butt in an offscreen maniacal rampage midway through the movie, we are treated to Obi Wan in a stupid intergalactic diner (one-part Mos Eisley Catina, three-parts CGI American Graffiti), Senator Jar Jar Binks getting cheered by his alien comrades in a monumental political speech, and a three-fingered Yoda in a lightsaber duel with Christopher Lee's Count Dooku.The dialogue is at its best times bad and at its worst times filled with cornball jokes by C-3P0 and even Obi Wan. Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman deliver a romance less convincing than a bad daytime soap teen couple, and I cannot begin to decry how terrible the usually brilliant Samuel L. Jackson was.The introduction of Jango and Boba Fett into the film gave the audience its only interesting characters, but Lucas just let us nibble on filler instead of giving their story the meat it deserved. It seems Lucas is treating the prequels more as backstory than story, that he is more interested in showing the latest innovation in computerized special effects than forging a new saga. Sadly, the CGI eye candy does not match up to the beauty of the Holy Trilogy, nor to more recent special effects spectaculars (The Matrix, Spiderman).Ultimately, Episode II does much worse than Episode I in captivating the imagination. The cast does not have the chemistry of Hammil, Fisher, and Ford, and Lucas is content with asserting his new and radically different vision of Star Wars in spite of the protests of the legions of fans he won over a quarter century ago.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'll Try To Be Nice...,"I once wrote a beyond scathing review of this film that compared George Lucuas to a dictator we shall leave nameless, and went on to describe his blasphemous decision regarding the release of only the Special Edition DVD's as a rape of classic film.I'll do my best to be nicer and more focused on the horrid excuse of a Star Wars movie...no...horrid excuse of a movie that is Episode Two. I remember going to the theater, extremely excited, soaking in the nerdy atmosphere of childish bliss, knowing that even if the movie sucked it would still have an awesome lightsaber fight in the end. You can imagine how I felt leaving, provided only with a lame Gladiator/Rancor scene ripoff, an all too brief fight where Obi-Wan gets his butt handed to him, and two subsequent lightsaber fights that could have been great but wound up being trite, meaningless five-second bouts.What was Lucas thinking when he wrote the scene when Anikan and Padme are sitting in the fields talking about politics...and what was he drinking when he wrote the following scene where Anikan rides some bulbous brown alien beast that looks more like something you'd find in an Episode of South Park? The man's talent has been drained by his children, as well as this once well-crafted space opera which has grown far out of his control.He has attempted to put it back into his control, obviously, but it seems now that he's doing everything he wants, he is forgetting all that is good about story telling, dialogue, and action sequences. Episode II is nothing but a filler, a mish-mash of flashing lights and colors that tries so desperately to have validity through a few shadows and dark, brown leather tunics.I almost feel bad for Lucas after watching this movie. Because he honestly seems to think it's good. It is not. Episode II is a yellow brick road that leads nowhere near as cool as Emerald City. It just keeps going round and round with a parade of irritating Munjkin like characters that have no develop, utter the dumbest lines in the world, and ultimately end up being inconsequential.This doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. It seems like a lame TV rip off CBS might do. Even Episode One had a sense of grand epic scope, going from undeniably exciting pod-race scenes to superb lightsaber duels. And at least Liam Neeson was in that one. Schiendler with a Lightsaber is a winning combination.The strongest aspect of Episode Two is Ewan McGregor and Jango Fett. Their battle through the asteroid ring was, in fact, cool. But Obi-Wan Kenobi, the only important character besides Anikan that links the two series', is not given hardly enough screen-time. Lucan has denied this character in both prequals and this is his greatest flaw, not the abysmal love story, not the unending special affects, but his inability to provide us with characters that hold half as much interest as the original cast. Ewan does an excellent job with the little that he is given and if only Lucas has not explored the benefits of developer that character.I have high hopes for Episode III. I will go see it, despite the fact that I once wanted to start a boycott of it. The fact that it's PG-13 and the last Star Wars ever is reason enough to see it. Lucas has a lot of work to do if he is to be redeemed.The Revenge of the Fans will be far worse than that of the Sith if we're given another Episode II.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Natalie Portman In A Tight White Outfit Stands Out!!,"The positives: Ewan McGregor is much better as Obi Wan Kenobi. Samuel L Jackson finally gets to do something as Mace Windu (and who doesn't love his purple Lightsabre??) Janga Fett is a real bad ass, Fett V Obi Wan in the Asteroid Field was great in the cinema and still looks and sounds good. Natalie Portman in the tight white outfit and the battle on Geonosis. As with the first movie, the later half, saves it from being a total disaster. I know a lot of people don't like it, but C-3PO brings some light comedy relief during the last 40 mins or so.The negatives: Once again, like with Darth Maul, they kill off a bad ass bad guy in his first movie, as Janga Fett loses his head. Anakin is annoying as hell, he repeatedly talks back to Obi Wan Kenobi, showing a complete lack of respect, and his creepy lusting over Padme ""she covered the cameras (which were in her bedroom) I don't think she liked me watching her."" Is very disturbing!! Obi Wan jumping out of the window onto the probe was ridiculous!! As is everything that follows in the resulting chase. But at least it was some action in an otherwise slow moving Star Wars movie (Possibly THE slowest moving Star Wars movie) once again there are numerous plot holes, The Jedi are always around the Chancellor, but can not sense he is the Sith Lord, Why are there so few Jedi?? I thought they were The Guardians of Peace and Justice in the Old Republic??! How can that be with so few of them??It's no surprise we have seen so little of Hayden Christensen since these movies as he is awful. Portman looks great in the tight white outfit, but she struggled delivering Lucas's awful dialogue, especially during the scenes with Anakin where lines such as ""I'm haunted by the kiss you never should have given me"" And ""I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life."" are uttered.A few things... R2 D2 can fly??

Almost there to the coolest film in the prequels!,"After the mixed critical response from fans and box office success of STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, George Lucas returned to direct the second film in the prequel trilogy, -- which was released from 1999 to 2005 -- and the second film was titled STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES and it was released on May 16, 2002 to mixed to positive reviews.The film is set ten years after the Battle of Naboo, when the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of renegade Jedi Master Count Dooku, thousands of systems threaten to secede from the Republic. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padme Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo. Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt. Soon the Jedi, Anakin, Padme and Obi-Wan are drawn into the heart of the separatist movement, and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy: the Clone Wars.The story is fast paced, lots of stuff goes on in this 2 hours and 22 minute long film that really makes this movie an improvement over the last film. The thrills in this film are much more awesome.The action is more incredible and I will say, there are more lightsaber duels and big battles. My favorite lightsaber duels are the Jedi and the Droids fighting on the planet Geonosis and the final fight between Obi-Wan, Anakin, Yoda and Count Dooku.I was surprised and this is my only main criticism and this is why this STAR WARS film, along with STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, appeared on my list of Top 10 Underrated Movies on IMDb on my profile: Despite this film being an improvement over the previous film, the ending was confusing for me. I'm not gonna give that away, but I will say that to have this movie end with Anakin and Padme getting married in secret, could have been done a lot more better.From an acting perspective, this film does wonders. Ewan McGregor returns as Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and he does an incredible job this time around, but he has his good parts and bad parts in the film. Natalie Portman returns as Padme Amidala and she does really good in both the romantic and non-romantic scenes, but the only romantic scene I actually have a problem with is her character and Anakin kiss at her home in Naboo. Hayden Christensen may not be good as Anakin Skywalker in a few scenes, but some scenes he does struggle.Frank Oz returns as Yoda, but this time, Yoda is CGI and he does an incredible job with the voice. Samuel L. Jackson returns as Mace Windu and he does an incredible job in the movie, especially having a lot more screen time and is fantastic in the action sequences. Ian McDiarmid is good as Chancellor Palpatine / Darth Sidious. Jar Jar is the one who gives Palpatine emergency powers and this would play a huge part in the next film.The rest of the cast is amazing and Kenny Baker & Anthony Daniels does great once again as C3PO and R2-D2.The other criticism that I have is some of the dialogue. Lucas wanted to make the romantic scenes old-fashioned, but there is one problem: This was in 2002 and no teen could understand this, but I can.His directing is once again top-notch, and this was the film that was the first film to have a turning point in special effects together.My next criticism is that there is just WAY TOO MUCH CGI used in this film. I don't mind CGI at all, but there is nothing practical in this film at all and this film had a $115 million dollar budget and you could not use anything practical.The music by John Williams, is as always fantastic to hear and he was composing Minority Report, Catch Me If You Can and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when he was doing music for this film and my favorite music cue is the romantic ballad, ""Across the Stars"". The orchestra was just amazing for this musical score and the choir in the action sequences were really amazing.I think I have to bring up another criticism, which is gonna be my final one and that is some of the acting: The acting in a few scenes is a little stupid, but it is some scenes in the film where I think the actors tried their best to read George Lucas' poor dialogue. This film is a great improvement over the last film and really intense and fun.Hayden Christensen's performance may have you say something bad about him, but he is a good actor overall.Overall, STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES is really good and my favorite along with EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH and all three films in the original trilogy. The action is more better, the dialogue is still a problem, but works in this film, the visual effects and action sequences is really fantastic and amazing, the music and production values are incredible. It's very close to getting a 10 out of 10 stars, so overall, I give this an 8 out of 10 and definitely something I can re-watch again.I will wrap up my STAR WARS prequel trilogy with the third and final chapter of the prequel trilogy: STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

What on earth are people complaining about?!,"I seriously cannot stand it when reviewers comment on how childish the new trilogy is, the original trilogy was rated a 'U', as in 'viewable for all'. They were never intended to be as gruesome as the 'Alien' films or as dark and twisty as 'Terminator'. Star wars has always been aimed at the younger audience, with a number of adults enjoying it too because it's not so complicated.Attack of the Clones is rated '12', and that does fit. The cast are actually relatively good actors, and i see no need to hate them so much. Hayden makes such a great portrayal of 'Anakin' as he himself can appear as quite dark and troubled, and so he fits the 'Darth Vader' thing perfectly well. The story isn't much of a wow factor in this film, but we're still presented with the epic fight scenes between opposing alien groups and the film is packed with dumb Droids that can be easily swiped down by a light saber. This film, along with the other criticised prequels, is getting too much hate. Some people are just forgetting that they are 'prequels' for a reason. They're not meant to be like the others. This film is somewhat a lot more dark and the CGI is actually quite good. Does it really matter that much that a lot of this film is animated? Look at what Avatar accomplished, the CGI in that film was incredible and it received a lot of both negative and positive reviews. Everything has it's downsides, so this film is really good!

Special Effects Ahoy,"Well, the very disappointing Episode I really got me off wanting to see more new Star Wars, but as I had some free time I watched it on television when it was on.This movie does not show any promise in the beginning, and after the ridiculous chase sequence I already gave up hope. The things that happen in this chase are totally preposterous: after the 'shortcut' Anakin jumps out of his craft and drops a mile and still ends up to catch the one they chased; moments later he loses his lightsaber. But no fear, Obi Wan incredibly has caught up to them and can catch the saber with two fingers. OK, the force is great, but this is stretching it a bit, isn't it?.The movie then splits in two stories (as Empire did): One follows Anakin and Amidala and as the two young ones just need to fall in love, no one bothered to write any interesting dialogue. Anakin turns into a sissy for a while and whines a lot as Amidala wants to stretch the running time of the movie and holds of falling in love proper. Anakin then wants to prove he's not a sissy and decides to go off and rescue his mother, never forgetting that he needs to fall in love by the end of the movie. To makes sure this happens Amidala just tags along not doing anything really.The other story then: Obi Wan leaves the two kids and promptly goes off visiting a lot of special effects. After walking around in corridors for about ten minutes, talking to a few CGI characters, he decides to fall of a roof and then chases Fett Senior and Junior around some more special effects. In the planet he's lead to he then discovers Christopher Lee, also talking to CGI characters. He then gets caught by some more special effects and needs to be rescuedMeanwhile Anakin is getting quite desperate and decides to take Amidala and go and rescue Obi Wan from all the special effects. After being captured and being reunited with Obi Wan, they decide to all fight the same special effects for once. After a while they temporarily turn into CGI characters themselves.Finally, The Jedi and a huge army show up and save the day long enough to warrant a sequel.Oh yes, almost forgot to mention: Anakin an Amadila get married at the end of this part.

In for a ride,"Watching the story/chapters unfold one by one through George Lucas's eyes is exciting. This film is much better than the titular title lets one. Hayden Christensen is one of the down falls as a teenage Skywalker/Jedi in training, the subtle teen angst or puppy love between Anakin /Queen is dismal. The story of why/where the clones actually come to light is enticing and gives the audience a peek into the dark side of the fallen.Now, Christopher Lee, what can one say about such an iconic actor. His performance of Count Dooku is villainous and maniacal. strength in his forthcoming, laid back evil methods is what drives this arc. The fight scenes are spectacular. The last 25 minutes of the film is well worth the 2.5 hrs. Certainly reinvigorates the love of the franchise. I give this a well deserved solid 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very disappointed.  Not a lot of story here...,"I was extremely excited about seeing Episode II, especially since Lucas promised a ""dark"" episode reminiscent of Empire.  Wow, I thought, we could really use a dark episode.  Since Jedi and Phantom Menace were clearly aimed more towards children (in my opinion) rather than the original Star Wars faithful, both had warm and fuzzy endings (and in some cases, characters too).  Well, ""dark"" wouldn't be an adjective that I would use to describe this movie at all.  How about ""hardly dingy"" instead?  I mean, the bad guys just weren't very bad.  I may be mistaken, but I only remember seeing Darth Sidius in costume one time.  If he did appear twice, he obviously didn't leave much of an impression on me, which only proves my point.  Now come on, EVERYONE remembers all of Darth Vader's and Darth Maul's scenes, right? To me, Darth Tyranus actually comes off as a decent guy for most of the movie.It seems that Lucas is more interested in showing off a lot of special effects rather than telling a compelling story.  There just wasn't much material in the script for the actors to be passionate or excited about. Kenobi has a nice civilized conversation with Jango Fett.  Anakin has a calm chat with Palpatine.  Kenobi has an even keeled conversation with Tyranus. Where's the passion and hate?  Where's the fire?  Where's the dark side George?  Since we all know how it's going to ultimately end, I was really expecting some heated emotions in this movie.  You know, Anakin's struggle and all?  I didn't feel a lot of that at all.As an aside, I really noticed a lot of dull filler scenes.  Is it really necessary to show everyone getting on and off transport ships?  I, for one, am willing to make a leap of faith here and take for granted that characters in this universe can get from point A to point B.  If you see them in the next scene on a different planet, I guess they made it.  Right?  Picture this:  The ship pulls up, picks up the passengers and takes off.  It then lands, and the passengers get off.  Sound exciting to you?  If the movie was cut back about 10-15 minutes, I think it would have helped to pick up the overall pace and flow of things.Overall, I think I was disappointed mainly because my expectations were so high.  Hopefully, I just lowered yours and you can enjoy the movie for what it is, rather than for what it is not.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Perhaps the Worst Movie I Have Ever seen,"I saw this movie last night, and, while my expectations were low, my God, I had no idea how truly terrible this movie was going to be. I think it may in fact be the worst movie I have ever seen. Sure, others are technically worse, but at least most of them have ideas, or characters, or something to sustain one's interest. This is an utterly vapid (and LOOOOOOOONG) journey to NOWHERE.Others have made many of the most salient comments, so I'll just stick to these short points:The dialogue is indeed execrable. You will laugh.The acting is hideous.It makes me wonder about this new generation who seem to decide to pursue acting not because they have any talent, but because they're good looking. So we have hundreds of movies filled with young blanks who have never experienced a human emotion in their lives, attempting to portray human emotions. Hayden Christianson is ASTONISHINGLY awful. It's as though he goes out of his way to deliver his lines horribly. Portman is just as bad, with her Vally-teen delivery.The special effects are dull, dull, dull. In the days when special effects folks had to be creative, not just computer button-pushers, you would have a FEW special effects in a movie and they would be spectacular, because they were SPECIAL. Here, it's just one after another, all in your face, so that none of them have any effect whatsoever. I thought at least I'd get some good eye candy out of this, but its all such overload there is No sense of excitement or wonder.I can usually watch special effects movies more than once, just for the eye candy, but there is no way I could possibly endure the experience of sitting through this film again. I believe this one is actually WORSE than Phantom Menace. It would be nice if there were a story of some sort. This thing begins, runs two hours, then ends. I was not engaged with these characters in any way.I was trying to think what I liked about the first Star Wars. For one, the scale was smaller... you had a few characters, who stayed on one planet, then in space, the whole time. The canvas here is just too broad, skipping from planet to planet... with no time taken for anything to develop or have emotional [ or ANY kind of ] effect.One gets the feeling that Lucas is betting a lot on our love of the first films, and seeing pieces fall into place. Well, maybe for some, but this cynicism and EXPECTATION that we love his output is just making me resent the whole enterprise, and feel ashamed for being such a geek to like the first films at all. Many have said that the last 30 minutes are awesome, as they are all action. Maybe, but it is action that doesn't make any sense, and we don't really understand who's who or what's what. Suddenly there's these big armies outside the stadium, and these big spaceships, and these other big spaceships, and these ones are trying to stop those ones... whatever, will it end soon?The scenes REFER to emotions we should be feeling. When Amidala is on the conveyor belt, you get the sense that there should be a title on screen saying ""And now, HERE's the high-flying whimsical adventure you loved from the first films!"" Needless to say... I would like to know who actually had some reaction to this part, or any part of this whole turgid mess.Can Samuel Jackson be someone other than Shaft in some movie, please?Am I wrong, or did Yoda say ""Whassup?"" And by the by, the puppet Yoda was MUCH better than this computer garbage. At least then you're looking at SOMETHING.One senses a Star Wars-type story about Lucas himself here, who began by making this small, ecstatic movie that started so much, and is now chained and enslaved to the continued generation of this massive, ungainly creation. One pities him.--- Check out my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies at: www.cinemademerde.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Special Effects Carry the Film,"Star Wars Episode 2: The Attack of the Clones is brilliantly filmed with special effects filling every scene, ultimately adding a sense of fast-paced adventure and franticness. The last forty-five minutes of the production includes an extremely breathtaking war between good and bad, leading to an awesome fight between Yoda and Count Dooku What I have exemplified in the first two sentences, are the positive aspects of this film: The special effects, and the last forty five minutes. Unfortunately, the negative points (in my opinion) are quite noticeable. The acting is not as effective as it could be, and is inspired by a stilted script which contains only some potential humor and zero possible romance. The love story is too rash and somehow wrong even though Portman and Christensen are apparently good actors. Ewan McGregor is okay as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but could add more emotion into his role. What I thought to have been a big improvement however (which other people savoring the older trilogy may disagree with) is the CGI version of Yoda. He looks less funny than how he did as a complex puppet and has many more kid fans now. Therefore, this second prequel to ""Star Wars"" does have many things to offer, just don't depend on impeccable dialogue and breath-taking amour to decide your satisfaction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars Bores in Attack of the Drones...Wake me Up!!,"I had heard that Episode II was better than the Phantom Menace and I will agree with that appraisal. Unfortunately that is not saying a whole heck of a lot. The first three Star Wars movies were awesome and each one carried it's weight. It is hard to beat perfection and I am afraid that it shows in both of the prequels. I found the acting extremely wooden and uninspiring. I am not a huge fan of the casting in the first place and that is even more obvious in this film. Jimmy Smits?? What the heck were they thinking??!! Samuel Jackson is bad enough. Thankfully they went light on Jar Jar Binks but in all honesty any scene with this annoying character is enough to make one beg for mercy. I was hoping that Jar Jar would meet his end but you will have to see for yourself. I found most of this film slow moving and uninspiring. When you find yourself looking at your watch all the time this is not a good sign! I will admit that the last 20 minutes of the film are very well done. But when a movie has two hours preceeding that said 20 minutes, you get the picture. Don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars but at this point I am wishing George Lucas had only made three films, and left the rest in his imagination. One can only watch so many scenes with strange creatures and space ships and computer generated imagery and this is getting to the point of overkill. I could easily tell what was ""real"" and what was CGI and even Matte paintings. All in all I found the movie a real bore and would not recommend it to anyone. For real action and adventure try SpiderMan or The Scorpion King. Attack of the Clones should have been called Attack of the Drones!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than Episode 1,"After The Phantom Menace I hoped that Anakin would not be a pain in the ass this time. I was wrong to think that.In Return of the Jedi, George Lucas used Ewoks to get children to watch the movies. In Episode 1 he tried this again, this time using Jar Jar Binks and that annoying brat who played Anakin. In Attack of the Clones, Lucas used romance to lure women to the epos... I don't know if that worked, but at least the romance is the only disappointment in this Episode (oh yeah, and Christensen of course). Don't get me wrong, from time to time, romance in a movie is good, but not in a Star Wars movie. At least not this much.Episode 1 was a good movie, but not Star Wars-good. Episode 2 was a lot better. I can't wait to watch Episode 3!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Even worst than ""Phantom Menace""","I saw the movie yesterday night and gosh what a big disapointment! I love the first movies (Episodes IV, V and VI) but this picture is even worst than ""Phantom Menace"". What's going on with Mr Lucas?The love story between Anakin-Amidala is damn unreal and all conversations so silly! Dialogues of Harry Potter's are more intelligent, and they're supposed to be 11 years old. What the hell is that line Anakin says abt ""I don't like sand..."" and so on. There is no way we can believe the love can exists between them, there's no chemistry and they don't even know each other at all. The difference with the interesting love story Han Solo-Leia is amazing.All actions occur without continuity, the characters just appear suddenly in some place. In the previous movies (Episodes IV, V and VI) we see how and why they're doing what they do. ""The Attack of the Clones"" is like a long trailer.The whole story and plot is full of flaws and so many visual effects make the Star Wars world unbelievable. It is like watching ""Final Fantasy"" or some other ""cartoon"" film. Mr Lucas should take a look to the masterpiece ""Lord of the Rings"" and chat for a while with Peter Jackson.The only scene worth seeing is the fight Yoda vs Christopher Lee but I still miss the fight scene in the previous movie with Darth Maul (great Ray Park). A fight with two sable laser could have been spectacular and it becomes boring and poor after all.I don't know how this can be fixed in Episode III but I want to believe there's some hope to improve yet.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Attack of the Reviews,"I hear/see negative comments left and right about this movie and it seems difficult to find someone who has reasons to watch this movie. Perhaps I will share good reasons to watch. (Disclaimer: I will attempt to avoid using spoilers. Therefore, I apologize if I am unclear or mysterious in some sections of my review.)This is hands down in my top three favorites of the 9-movie saga. The main reason why? I will get to later. For now, let me explain the elephant in the room: romance. Whether it will be your first time watching or your seventeenth time watching, you will be bombarded by the level of romance in this episode. Most viewers I talk to find it boring. However, I must say, the romance is actually necessary. It drives an important plot point. If the romance was not included the way it was, viewers would have difficulty understanding the actions and motives of characters. Even more, the romance between characters will segue into the next episode which will lead to the birth of Luke and Leia Skywalker, who are fundamentally the most important characters in the following movies.Now, though they enter the action way late into the movie, the clone army is also important to the plot. Although, the clone army is more important in the prequel trilogy rather than in all the trilogies. I cannot write too much more about them without spoiling information, therefore just note that the clones are and will be very important in the next episode. What I can write is this movie helps set up events for Episode III. There is simply not enough room to fit all of this story into one movie (Episode III is packed full of story as is).Finally, the main reason why I enjoy this movie is simple: I really like the clones. Why? I will keep it short. Their phase I armor is appealing, their voices are iconic, they fight with the good guys, they are an ideal army, and they are given more in-depth backgrounds. None of the succeeding stormtroopers compare to the clone troopers. Not to mention the short-lived but epic battle sequence at the end between the clones/Jedi and the droids. Another reason why I prefer this movie is because it takes place before everything goes down hill within the prequel trilogy. Without writing any major spoilers, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith has a much darker tone throughout the film. Bad events happen to characters I like. It of course helps drive the plot in Episode III but that is not the point because I am not here to critique another movie.As reviews constantly attack this film, hopefully you find this review helpful as to why this movie is worth watching more than once and to appreciate why the movie is the way that it is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Deep down, you must know this is dreadful.","To the droves of Star Wars fans still out there: Please, please, stop fooling yourselves. I know that it is terribly painful to admit, but this film is NO improvement over Episode I, in fact I saw it as yet another BIG slip in the series. The SW films truly ran out of steam with Return of the Jedi TWO long decades ago. Clones/Episode II has the poorest of everything you can think of...direction (or lack of direction), acting (utterly laughable...the actor, Hayden Christensen, hired to anchor the absolute core of the entire series CAN NOT ACT), plot (oh please), effects (yes, even the tired special effects...how many times can you laser blast the enemy and still get the audience to go ""Oooh!""??).

Never has there been a film so over-produced and under valued. In some shots, especially dark scenes, it is obvious that it was ""filmed"" digitally.

Attack of the Clones Retrospective,"Attack of the Clones is another widely disliked Star Wars movie, and until my most recent viewing, it was my least favorite. I've since changed my view, and I actually consider this to be a decent movie on it's own.It fits into a tricky place in the Star Wars series, as this installment has to show us the rise of the Clone Army, as well as Palpatine's further progression towards supreme power. That's not really interesting in and of itself, but Attack of the Clones actually succeeds in developing the overall series plot, while being a decent movie on its own.It does this by telling a much more focused plot than the first movie. Obi Wan and Anakin are tasked with defending Padme. When she is almost assassinated by a bounty hunter, Obi Wan goes to track down the bounty hunter, stumbling upon both the clone and vast droid army on the way. Meanwhile Anakin continues to protect Padme, and their romance drives that particular storyline.This tighter storyline actually works well. Obi Wan tracking down the bounty hunter to Kamino (where he finds a clone army with mysterious origins being built for the Republic) and then to Geonosis (where we get a shoddy explanation of what exactly the separation movement is) makes for an interesting plot where many mysteries are slowly revealed. And we get to see some pretty good action scenes as well.Anakin's storyline is not nearly as good. His character development here is actually great, and it subtly shows his movement to the dark side. Throughout the movie, he embraces of all the emotions that the Jedi warn against. The weak point is in his romance with Padme. Romance arcs require strong writing and acting to make them work, and this movie just does not have those. At all. It ends up being quite cringey.Earlier on in the story the movie also adequately shows the growing rift between Anakin and Obi Wan. They are both very different characters and the movie shows that really well.The film suffers from some of the same flaws as the first one. Clunky dialogue and some poor acting in particular. The villain is once again elusive, undeveloped and his motives unclear. He is introduced to us only by the brief summary of events at the start of the movie. Since we don't know him at all, the final duel between Obi Wan, Anakin and Yoda against the villain lacks is not very compelling. And unlike the first movie, the action is pretty terrible here, almost downright comical.Overall, Attack of the Clones adequately fulfills it's role in developing the series plot, while being better as a stand alone movie than it's predecessor.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent Movie,"The film begins with a bang and continues in the same vane throughout. Obi Wan and Anakin's relationship is better than Qui Gon and Obi Wan's.

Where are critics coming from,"I am going to start my comments with a simple sentence:I Love Star WarsOK on to the important stuff. As I'm sure you already knew, Yoda and Mace Windu are probably the baddest mother****ers EVER and they show this in the movie. The action scenes, in the series that basically invented kickass action sequences, are great, the cgi was probably the best i've seen in a movie, not as distracting as it often is. The acting is hokey, as it should be, and the love story is odd and out of place, but thats what young love is. Now, nobody whose job it is to overanalyze movies seems to like AOTC. even critics who liked The Phantom Menace, the most unfairly hated film EVER. It almost seems that these people have lost their sense of childlike wonder, something key to star wars.

Star Wars: Episode 11-Attack of the Clones,"Good grief,Charlie Brown! Where do we begin? Let's get this straight from the beginning. I am a huge Star Wars fan.

We could just about afford the matinée price for the two of us and for an a little less than two hours,we were entertained and trouble-free. It was a marvelous full-bodied movie. The second and third movies in the then trilogy proved to be just as entertaining. Who can forget Jabba the Hutt? Or the famous bar scene? So many imitators have paid homage in the past 30 years. Some fondly,some badly. THIS movie would have to fall in the very badly category. Note to whomever mucked up this( these) sequels: Special effects can no longer carry a movie . You still need a decent script,interesting characters,lines that make sense,and (now here's the big one) ACTORS WHO WEREN'T PICKED FOR LOOKS ALONE! I refer of course to Anikin and Padme.

This father-son dynamic is later mirrored in Jango-Fetts clone story that I don't want to give away, but it's the purrrfect companion story. This movie also features many great side-plots including a small detour that feels leik a noir detective movie. I'd watch a movie about detective Kenobi! Watto also makes a return, and his character has a great arc, and he is very believable. I leik Watto very much. It's amazing that even though Watto is animated, he feels so alive. I wuv it. There's so much great stuff in this movie. Action, adventure, a father struggling to protect his only son from thottery. I'd wuv to say more, but you really just need to see it for yourself.

Good addition to the story,"Attack of the Clones is SO much better than Episode I, I can not even begin to count the ways.  The first and most important change is the toned down Jar-Jar.  This is without a doubt the WORST Lucas creation, and I was VERY happy to see he didn't have much screen time.  Another change was the use of the Jedi council, especially Yoda.  I was EXTREMELY impressed by the battle between Yoda and Duku.  Although, I would have liked it to be longer, I think it was GREAT to see Yoda in action.  The third good thing about this movie was that it made the plot in Episode I at least marginally understandable.  And the fourth change was the ditching of the whole midiclorian thing.  This was another of Lucas' worst decisions.The first movie was somewhat like Ep. 4 in that it was used to set up the characters.  The second is somewhat like Ep. 5 (though not NEARLY as good as that masterpiece), in that those characters are actually allowed to DO something.  The plot in this movie was understandable and reasonable.  The plot for Ep. 1 was not (at least on its own).BTW people, if you have been one of the 20 or so people who have not seen Eps. 1 or 2, see the original triolgy (Eps. 4-6) FIRST.

"""Lost a Movie George Lucas has, how embarrassing!!!""","Existing among Star Wars non-apologists are subdivisions who realized at different moments that this film was beyond repair.

Nevertheless, few can contradict that the clear point of no return was Yoda, now reduced to a CGI. Decently portrayed in The Empire Strikes Back as a wise teacher, the little green guy here is everything and everywhere at once. First he presides over the Jedi Council (ok, I think the whole council thing has been played out about a thousand times over in science fiction). Next we see him teaching Jedi nursery school, going so far as having his pupils greet Ewan MacGregor with ""Helll ohhhh Mass Terrrr Obeeeeee Wannnnn"" as pronounced in younglingspeak.

Real Star Wars,"This is a true Star wars film in the tradition of the original trilogy. Although in my opinion it is far from a perfect movie, within the context of the Star wars franchise it could not be much better.I have read countless reviews of this film, in which the criic complained that the characters deliver totally unbelievle dialog, that the plot is incompressible and so on. These are all valid points that to be honest hold up if you take this film as a piece on is own. But the whole point of Star wars is that it is not just a franchise; it is a serial that has characters and a plot that are already farmiliar to millions of people.Taken as the second part in a six part story I was enirely willing to accept some of the aspects of the film that in another story would have detracted from the viewing experience. The acting is on a par with anything in the original trilogy, and he action is probably better.Possibly the key to deriving a good viewing experiece from this film is to compare it to the other episodes in the series, and not other films out there. The truth is Star wars never was for everybody; the fact that it has become such a cultural phenomenon works against it more than it works for it.

Surprisingly Competent Film,"Having grown up a skeptic of Star Wars, I recently decided to go back, to the beginning (no, not the Episode IV beginning, the Liam Neeson beginning) and give these films another try. While I was pleasantly surprised by the pure solidity of the first film - I had little to complain about outside of Jar Jar - the second one was frustratingly decent. I use the word ""frustratingly"" because I felt, with a few tweaks, this could've been a genuinely phenomenal film.A sort of oddball detective thriller hidden under George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" behemoth, I thought this was where the film thrived. Anakin and Obi-Wan chase a mysterious ""changeling"" through the skies on an air bike while McGregor's wise character sends quick-witted remarks back at his prickly Padawan? What's not to like!? This part of the plot is paid off effectively, as well, as we are eventually introduced to the straight-up badass in Jango Fett. Side note: As cool as Boba was in the original trilogy, Jango is still my pick for the coolest bounty hunter to ever exist (sorry, Mando).However, once the mystery of the first half is ""solved,"" this is where things start to teeter off in the wrong direction. While getting introduced to the great Christopher Lee's Count Dooku is fun and seeing the likes of Mace Windu and Yoda finally yield lightsabers is proficiently geek-worthy, the film decides, in its latter half, to dive into the romance genre. While Star Wars has proven adequate in performing these sorts of feats at times (I namely think of Han and Leia), Anakin and Padme - portrayed by a very green Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, respectively - have as much charisma as a bit of sandpaper rubbing against a recently-deceased chicken.Now, I have nothing against either of these actors and have come to respect Christensen, in particular, a great deal; but deciding to use this questionable plotline as the device to guide the latter half of your film was bold at best and idiotic at worst.I still think this is a worthwhile film to view for the strong effects, the solid acting, and the exciting plot, but I can't help but feel like this was, in another world, a flawless film.Unfortunately for us, we will have to settle for okay.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm at a loss with the praise this film is garnering...,"I can't understand why people seem to be defending this film so much. I'm all for expressing your own opinions and I totally respect that, but all of the positive reviews I am reading seem to only concern themselves with refuting the points against ""Attack of the Clones"" rather than presenting legitimate reasons to justify the 9 star ratings.I do believe it to be a little ignorant to throw the entire prequel saga under the bus because this film's successor is indeed somewhat of an improvement upon the two that preceded it. However, Revenge of the Sith was far too little far too late because The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones both, for lack of a better phrase.The thing that perplexes me the most is the defence and even praise of the special effects, when the fact is they look terribly dated and far too clean cut to come across as convincing. Not to mention that they are overused to the point that the film basically becomes a live action cartoon.Remember when the light sabre was a mystical device that was only shown in times of crisis or importance, to convey the significance and power of this honourable weapon? Yeah just forget all that and watch 500 Jedi jump into an arena in broad day light and slice a bunch of poorly rendered, CGI toothpick robots like butter with a hot knife.
The point being that the light sabre has gone from being a mysterious and wondrous commodity. to nothing more than a nostalgia prop that hardcore fans / children can drool over while Lucas renders as many as he possibly can into each frame.Do you remember when Yoda was an actual character that betrayed the stigma of the hero being a mighty and strong warrior to convey the message that the force is not about the physical? Forget all that nonsense and watch in awe as he pulls out a mini light sabre and starts barrel rolling more than an attack jet.The issue with poor continuity and overuse of CGI could be overlooked if the story and characters were compelling, which they certainly aren't. I am fully aware that Lucas' script is far from stellar but that can't be used as justification for Hayden Christensen. I'm sorry but the kid cannot act, nothing about his portrayal is convincing and when people say ""he is good at making himself look angry"" I'm afraid that is not even nearly ample enough to forgive the rest of his quite frankly appalling performance. Ewan McGregor is there, and he does things, that relate to the plot I guess. Natalie Portman is there to be eye candy and to ""fall in love"" with Anakin in a less convincing manner than a Primary school adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.The entire final action sequence just blows, it's all flash no substance which quite honestly seems to be what Lucas was going for considering the script.I am not calling this film bad as a hater of all things new. I am not calling this film bad as a nostalgia blinded, fan of the originals. I am calling this film bad as a lover of film, please understand that.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Interesting idea and concept that could have been improved,"Attack of the Clones adds more details and storytelling elements to the Star Wars universe. However, the execution of the film was somewhat problematic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Truly Awful,"This film is without a doubt one of the worst ever made. It doesn't try at all, the scenes are all filler material to get to the amazing special effects. Special Effects can make or break a film, but they can't make it when it's 95% of the movie. Some things that are CGI are upsurd, like Yoda. I'll admit there's no way Frank Oz could have controlled Yoda during his battle scene, but the rest of the movie there is NO excuse for making Yoda CGI. Lucas has developed Gates syndrome, in which he burns money in a fireplace to keep his cats warm.The acting is very bad, the only people shining are Obi-wan, Mace Windu, and Yoda (Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Frank Oz.) Of those three, Obi-wan sometimes has trouble making eye contact. Possibly because he's talking to a pole with a red dot painted on it. Star Wars was built on Puppets, they looked real, they made atmosphere, they acted real. CGI just can't do that. Some acting in this movie is REALLY bad. Hayden Christenson has successfully done the impossible by turning the most badass villain of all-time into a wimp, a whiny teenage wimp. He shows SOME rage, but just not enough for a young Darth Vader. Anakin's mother has a dying scene worthy of 1st graders acting.The action scenes are slightly redeeming, but some are just so atrociously impossible it ruins it. Example: How is it POSSIBLE to mathematically calculate where the ship you are chasing is when you are going the wrong way, losing track of it, dodging traffic, going 9000 MPH, and 1000 feet in the air?The romance is a complete and utter joke. This dialogue is MST3K worthy, at best. This movie holds no rewatchability. If you own it, watch only the special effects. Never see it twice in theaters, as I can tell from experience, it is a fate worse than death.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Finally STAR WARS is back on track!!,"Just saw STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES today in a special screening here in Zurich, Switzerland. First of all I think that STAR WARS is the best ""movie"" and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the best ""Star Wars-movie"" of the series. I also liked RETURN OF THE JEDI, although I (as everybody else) hated the Ewoks. I was dying to see THE PHANTOM MENACE and I even went to the US to see it on its second day of release. The waiting for the film was much better than the end-product itself. Although I kept defending TPM (great pod-race, suberb lightsaber duel, effects in general) I never thought of it as a good film and I truly hoped that George Lucas and his crew will somehow find a way to deliver a better film (story-, acting, humorwise). Now after seeing AOTC I am almost fully satisfied. The actors (especially Ewan McGregor) were more relaxed this time around, the dialogue was way better and even the love story worked for me (on a Star Wars level that is...). But I am not 100% satisfied though - and this never happened before, for my taste - with the Special effects. Some shots looked like matte shots of the eighties. But all in all I think that this is one of the top three Star Wars Films and I look forward to seeing AOTC a second time, seeing it on DVD (again and again) and seeing EPISODE III in May 2005. Another 3 years to wait, damn I'm getting older.My rating is 8 out of 10 (because its good Star Wars)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A visual, imaginative feast","This movie is a treat for the eyes. There are all manner of imaginative aliens and alien animals, who not only look strange, but move and act in strange ways.I found even Jar Jar Binks amusingly novel. The two male leads are unusually handsome. As we move from planet to planet we are treated to completely different stunning landscapes. The architecture is mind- bending as well.There all kinds of different transportation devices, for ground, air and space. The screen is so rich, you only have time to take a fraction of the feast in.In the first half of the movie, there are a few of those boring CGI fights between spacecraft, but most of the action is much more imaginative usually involving falling from great heights.There are a few anomalies that bothered me. How can they have hover cars but still require drivers? How can they have faster than light communication, but still get reception like a black and white 50s TV? Why are they still using light sabres when the weapon has such a limited range? Why can't they vote electronically remotely?The female senator role is a bit sappy. They should have given her a more spunky part. I discovered Frank Oz (Cookie Monster, Grover) voices Yoda. Yoda is a general. He no longer utters mysterious epigrams.Even though Hayden Christensen is one of the most handsome males ever to grace the screen, he is not convincing in his love speech to the senator. She fell for him despite his declarations of love. He was just too wooden.It explores runaway-revenge, rather deep for a Hollywood movie.The movie ends with a clever take-off on the Roman Coliseum run by cockroaches. Then the movie becomes utterly boring. There is a scene that goes on for what seems like 5 hours battling CGI monsters with light sabres, then another 5-hour fight with a giant CGI army where our heroes are never hit by a bullet but manage to kill everyone, Then another 5- hour light sabre fight. It looks like the bad guy, Count Dooku, inexplicably got away at the end in order to make another movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars Episode II:  Attack of the Clones:  Defying the Laws of Cinema,"It is very rare in my experience that scenes in a movie will elicit goose bumps.  It is also very rare, despite seeing movies that I have enjoyed immensely, that at some point I don't glance at my watch to see what time it is.  Well, Attack of the Clones has now been the first movie to not only make me ignore time all together - and wish the movie would go on forever - but to draw out goose bumps on several occasions!If anyone has come to this site to read reviews, you don't need background information on the plot, since it's posted everywhere across the universe. I won't bore you with meaningless details.One thing that is universal for all movie go-ers, is that the act of watching a movie is a very personal experience.  Your reactions to the characters, the plot, the dialogue - all of those aspects that come together to form a movie - comes from within.  Granted, some reactions are the similar among different people, but none will ever be exactly the same. As a result, I ask every person who has read reviews, checked the star-ratings, and been discouraged to clear your mind of all preconceptions you may have about this movie.  In my experience, critics - professional or amateur - are negative.  It is human nature to try and tear down what we know others put on a pedestal.  Star Wars, clearly, is no exception to this rule.  Episode I, despite being probably the least-exciting of the series, is still, in my opinion, a fantastic film.  I will even go so far to say that there are aspects of it that I enjoy even more than the gem I just saw in Episode II! However, critics refuse to allow for even a modicum of positive reactions to it, for reasons that quite frankly are beyond my comprehension.  Jealousy? Who knows.  The fact of the matter is, they are giving the masses something unexpected - a negative review of a movie empire that for some it is absolutely impossible to see as bad.  The unexpected sells.  Plain and simple.Episode II critiques are no different, and I think this would be the perfect outlet to remark on the worst critiques I've read so far.Point 1:  The dialogue.  Everyone whines and complains about the dialogue, that it's wooden, without feeling, and just plain boring.  (Show me a Star Wars film from the original trilogy that doesn't have the same aspects.) However, I think after seeing Episode II, there IS a method to that madness. And it becomes clear with the opening of each movie - `A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.'  I would like any one person to point out a moment in history when someone went up to another individual of the same time period and said, `Yo, wassap?'  History, if anything, shows that educated people were extremely formal and stiff!  This stiffness entered every aspect of their lives, whether it be dialogue, the way they walk, or the way they conduct themselves anywhere!  Star Wars is no different.  We have a young woman brought up to be a Queen and then a State Senator, raised by people who are well versed in proper `etiquette and protocol.'  Amidala, played by Natalie Portman, is a character that will be formal for all of her life. Granted, her stiffness isn't what it was in the first one, but it will never disappear completely.  Notice in the dialogue the almost complete absence of contractions - won't, can't, don't, etc.  This is not the effect of bad writing - but quite the opposite.  This is the tightness of the script that George Lucas writes, effectively giving his characters lines that would seem to stem from their very nature.  Lucas maintains unbelievable control over his characters, and the dialogue becomes only one aspect of this.  Han Solo, a man with absolutely no formal training whatsoever, and Luke, are the very few people who have dialogue that sounds more modern and loose.  Not until Return of the Jedi, after Luke has had much training, do we see his dialogue become formal like the rest of the Jedi.  I think critics who complain about the dialogue need to be shot for stupidity.  Their failure to recognize these facts detracts from everything or anything they might ever say.  If what they call `problems' arise again and again, you would think at some point one might assume that it was intended to be such.  I would hope that those people writing these reviews for newspapers would be educated enough to make these kinds of assumptions, but it appears that is not the case. 'Nuff said about that.Point 2:  Over-use of special effects.  Please.  Please.  Please.  All Star Wars movies utilize the technology of their times to the absolute limit and go beyond.  Even looking at the original (A New Hope), which by today's standards has laughable special effects, George Lucas was unbelievable. The same is true of Episode II.  I've read reviews that say there is too much and that it almost resembles a video game.  Yeah, well, go watch Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.  Episode II creates scenarios with special effects that are necessary for the plot to progress.  It is laughable that people criticize this movie for having too many special effects, or what I would say, too much of a good thing.  Science Fiction is all about the use of imagination, of what we dream about but can never realize in reality - at least, not yet.  This is George Lucas' vision.  It is HIS story.  This is how HE wants it to look.  If you have a problem with that, don't go see the movie.  Or, give George a call and tell him what you think.  I'm sure all of your opinions will carry great weight in altering his intentions for Episode III.Point 3:  Hayden Christensen.  I've read lots of complaints about him, and quite frankly, I'm shocked.  Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader is perhaps one of the most complex and tragic characters ever to grace the screen.  Granted, the abilities of Jake Lloyd in Episode I were, in my opinion at least, not up to par for the first screen appearance of such a legendary character. And he is legendary.  Only 3 characters graces the screen in all 6 of the Star Wars movies (presumably):  Anakin/Vader, C-3P0, and R2-D2. Hayden Christensen plays the part beautifully.  This is a young man raised by educated, strict Jedi; he is very formal - I'm sorry, as the critics would say, he is very wooden and lifeless.  What a load of crap.  Anakin Skywalker is in constant contention with himself.  His internal struggles between good and evil (light and dark) create this very formal, stiff, and tortured character.  We see the beginning of his dark side in Episode II, and as Master Yoda says, `Once you travel the path of the dark side, forever will it dominate your destiny.'  Christensen is brilliant as Anakin in this film. He, like most Jedi, is not permitted to show emotion.  How can we call this bad acting when the very code of the Jedi says `A Jedi shall not know anger, nor hatred, nor love, nor fear.'  These men are TRAINED to be robots - deadly robots.  This is not the inability of an actor the play a part; it is the complete emersion of an actor IN to the part he is playing.  And the death scene with his mother that is so criticized?  I'm sorry, how passionate are you when you're 3 seconds away from dying?  And what do you have to say to someone in front of you who is dying.  These is so much to say, and so much that just can't be said.  Anakin himself is even more restricted by his inability to cope with his emotions.Point 4:  Plot progression.  Darn.  We're not getting a no-brainer movie that any idiot can sit through without having to think.  We actually might have to use our brains while viewing this film.  Woe to the under-educated generation of American movie-goers that will be lost.  The formation of the Star Wars universe took much more than the final 3 episodes (A New Hope - Return of the Jedi) let on.  Hell, the final 3 have it EASY.  It's just a war that is being fought. Politically, Palpatine has already gained total control.  Now he just uses it.   Episode I and II (possibly III) HAVE to focus somewhat on the political motivations behind the events that take place.  I think it would be much worse to have someone explain it to me on screen than to see it happen.  I don't want to be lectured.  Frankly, Episode I and II have the most complex plots of any Star Wars film.  And this aspect doesn't go over well with those people who are going only for special effects and fighting (and then, they proceed to whine about too much or not enough of one or the other).Point 5:  The Love Story.  Well, I've already touched on, I think, why people are calling the love story fake and without emotion.  It all goes back to the characters involved.  A Jedi, trained never to love, and a Senator/Queen, raised to be formal and dutiful.  These are two people who are experiencing these emotions for perhaps the very first time in their lives!  And they are young!  Anakin is only, what, 16-17 years old?  And Amidala?  I think she was supposed to be 14 in Phantom Menace, so that puts her at 24 now.  These are two people conditioned to ignore their emotions, to feel nothing, to be compelled only by duty.  Episode II remains true to this characterization about both of them.  They are both on new ground here, awkward ground, and dangerous ground.  I don't think you're ever going to see the passion that we see in other movies here, at least not in ways that people will expect.  I think that much more will be revealed subtly rather than overtly.  Any idiot can sit through a chick flick and realize that idiot A is in love with idiot B, and heck, they can even have REASONS that they CAN'T be.  But, were they raised never to love?  Never to give in to the human side of emotions?  I think not.  Christensen and Portman again stay true to the characters they are playing in these `unexciting and unimpassioned' love scenes.  Again, must have gone RIGHT over the critics' heads, that little point there.Well, I'm done addressing the critics.  They get too much publicity anyway, as far as I'm concerned.  They also get too much weight.  Forget them.  Go to the movie and make your own assumptions about it.  Here are mine.This is an extraordinarily beautiful film.On a scale of 1 to 5 (for the 5 Star Wars movies thus far) this is definitely the best in my opinion - a 5.  I've been a fan of Star Wars since birth.  I've got all the action figures from the original movies, everything.  I was obsessed with Darth Vader and the power he radiated, and I still am today - and I see it in Anakin Skywalker.  The very way he carries himself, his arrogance, his complete lack of humility, everything Vader becomes is foreshadowed in Christensen's portrayal of the tragic, young Jedi.  For me, all aspects of this movie shine.  Combining the fabulous acting of Christensen, Portman, and Ewan McGregor - who is becoming more and more like the Alec Guinness Obi-Wan all the time, as well as supporting roles of Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Ian McDiarmid, the fantastic special effects, the breathtaking scenery, and blood-racing action, John Williams' brilliant score, and the legendary feeling associated with any Star Wars film, Lucas has created a masterpiece in Attack of the Clones.The best parts of the movie:  Yoda!  I must concede to every other review I've read - Yoda is unbelievable.  I must admit, I questioned his `prowess' as a Jedi Master since Empire Strikes Back, and never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined him with a lightsabre.  Wow!  The duel between Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Dooku is impressive to say the least (though I must admit, I enjoyed the Darth Maul/Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan battle much more).  The cinematography is breathtaking, like in many of the Star Wars films.  John Williams' score is excellent, though I missed songs like Duel of Fates that are just so incredible with the scene.We are experiencing the imagination of a genius embodied in George Lucas. And you know, we're all better people because of it.  By what standards could we hold truly magnificent films to if there were never any Star Wars?I am more than thrilled with this installment, and I wish Episode III would come out next week!  It saddens me that I have to wait until 2005 to see the conclusion of such an awesome (and I mean that in the literal sense: awe-some) cinematic experience.  It's been maybe an hour since I left the theatre, and I think I'll go buy myself some tickets to a showing later tonight.  Actually, I just did.Bottom line - Star Wars is BACK!!!  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Ignore your preconceptions, and go and have a good time.  Go and experience cinematic perfection at its best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not the best Star Wars film but it was ok,"Star Wars - Attack Of The Clones is my least favourite movie out of the entire saga.Did it have its moments?

I think if the whole Droid Factory scene with C3P0 and R2 was cut from the film, it would have made the film better.The acting in this film was far from perfect. Hayden Christensen did an ok job with the script he was given. I think George or his acting coach should have worked with him some more. But he did ok. Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid were brilliant as always.I do like the film. I think Kenobi going on a mission to find Jango Fett was great. I think Anakin looking for his mother and finding her was a great and chilling scene. The romantic scenes needed a bit more work on. It was not very convincing in the least.Christopher Lee should have had more of a role in the film. His character was fleshed our far better in the Clone Wars animated series.

"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is a solid entry in the Star Wars canon and a decent follow-up to ""The Phantom Menace.","Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is a solid entry in the Star Wars canon and a decent follow-up to ""The Phantom Menace."" The film has its strengths, despite feeling rushed and overstuffed at times. Hayden Christensen makes his debut as the more grown-up Anakin Skywalker, and while his performance is commendable, the script and dialogue occasionally falter. The romantic storyline between Anakin and Padmé, which we know is pivotal since Anakin is the father of Luke Skywalker, feels dull and rushed.One of the highlights is seeing Anakin still in training as a Padawan under Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Ewan McGregor, whose portrayal adds depth to their mentor-student relationship. The film's world-building is extensive, introducing numerous characters and settings, which can feel overwhelming but also enriches the Star Wars universe.The action scenes are a standout, particularly the climactic battle at the end. However, the heavy reliance on CGI and green screen can be distracting at times. The cast, including Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, delivers strong performances, making the most of the material they have.While the film relies heavily on CGI, it remains an enjoyable watch.

A Romance in A Galaxy Far Far Away...,"Okay, I can admit that I gave it a higher score it deserves, because too many people are still too harsh on the film. I would give it 8 stars. It comes down to a few things. Anakin is not who they expected him to be, the acting, the dialogue and the amount of CGI used in this film.Let me break a few things down. Anakin is an emotional teenager who struggles through conflicts that would would anyone cry (yes, he does cry at one or two points in the film). He's shown here to be a normal teenager that goes through every life struggles, though also struggles of the life he grew up as. Most importantly he lacks a father-figure that he desires for. Many fans wanted a more edgy, colder, ""badass"" Anakin. The way he falls in love in this film was not what they hoped for in a Star Wars film, which I understand, though don't agree with. This film is heavily based on old romantic Hollywood films, which you can tell by the acting style, the music and more.The dialogue is not the greatest. It was never George Lucas's strongest suit, though people make a very big deal about one life in particular Anakin says and that is ""I don't like sand."". Of course he doesn't. He's from a desert planet where he was a slave.The overuse of CGI that fans complain about is justified, though I respect in what Geoge Lucas tried to do. He's an experimental director, who always tried to push the boundaries. He creates fantastical worlds and creatures through CGI. Even the Clone Troopers are CGI and that certainly didn't age well. You have to start somewhere and I thought they looked quite convincing in the next film. The other reasons why they were made with CGI is because Lucas wanted them to be faster and more dynamic than the Stormtroopers you see in the Original Trilogy because the armour they used wasn't very practical, made them move slow and could be clumsy to use. I can tell because I've worn Stormtrooper armour myself in cosplay.So if you like something different in the Star Wars universe that still feels like Star Wars that contains monsters, great action sequences, fantastical worlds and above all romance then I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the Ewok Disaster,"Sometimes things work sometimes they don't.  Although Episode I was not what diehard Star Wars fans were looking for it did have it's moments.  The costume changes and makeup for Natalie Portman for instance kept people from realizing just how limited she is as an actress.  Nothing in E2 prevented this.I was just disappointed in the way Anakin Starwalker was portrayed. In E2, after 10 years of intense training as a Jedi, the best he can manage is being a whinny brat.  Where is the underlying darkness that should allow him to be turned to the darkside?  I kept expecting him to lie down on the floor and kick his heels until he got his way. It may have been direction or it may be Hayden Christenson is also limited as an actor.In rating among the rest of the Star Wars movies.

A Bad Love Story or A Bad Political Thriller?,"There are so many bad ideas within this movie that they completely overcome the few good ideas seeded with the movie. The acting from incredible actors is wooden due to George Lucas' influence. No emotion is shown whatsoever in their faces except Anakin's whiny anger. Jar Jar Binks is still around to put everyone in a bad mood. This movie has more action than the previous one, but it feels mindless and unexciting. Obi-Wan gets more characterization, but only a little bit. Anakin's only character traits are being disrespectful or being angry at everything. Padme apparently hasn't aged at all since the last movie which makes it okay for Anakin to be a creepy and horny to her. The writing is awful (I wish that I could just wish away my feelings).

can't we all just get along?,"I am a die-hard Star Wars fan (and have been since I was six when I saw the original). Yes, I have a life. No, I don't go to Star Wars conventions or spend paychecks on the toys. And I am quite stirred reading some of the prior reviews to this film from others. I do not disagree about some aspects: the dialogue is painful to hear, and Mark Hamill & Carrie Fisher actually made these actors look good (with the exception of Ewan McGregor & Samuel L. Jackson). I think George Lucas DOES need to hire back Larry Kasdan for rewrites.But yes, this movie IS slower than your average flick you have today. I can thank M-TV, reality shows and drugs for their contribution in the reduction of attention spans in today's society. I had a 55-year-old tell me that this was boring, what does that tell you? Hello? Berkeley, anyone? Lucas keeps with the same pacing he did for ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in 1980. And that was a great film! I'm 30 now and I still enjoy it!My only complaint would be the acting and the dialogue. Hayden Christiansen is not the best actor for the part, but he is certainly better than the little sh*t in the previous film.

My educated comments. ;o),"I enjoyed it...actually saw it twice in the theatres and didn't get bored.+   The special FX were pretty cool (I loved that blue guy with the looooong neck), the music was okay, dialogue could have had some work, and the acting was okay.+   Natalie Portman is a very talented actress, but Hayden Christensen, who has his own style of acting, gets more negetive feedback then he really deserves. If you look into his style, you can see that he's reasonably good, but is kind of ""wooden"" at parts, not showing the emotion that should be there. (Sure, he's sexy enough....) hehe. Had to put that in there.+   Ewan McGregor is also an extrememly talented actor. I thought he was excellent; no flaws there.+   The scenery was AWESOME! Kind of goes along with the special FX, because they used blue screen in almost every single scene, but the natural scenes were fantastic.Bottom line: fun to see.

The Jedi council decide that Padme should be hidden on Naboo while they investigate who is after her, so they recruit Obi-wan Kenobi, now a Jedi master, and his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, now a Jedi Padawan, to help.Anakin is sent to protect Padme on Naboo, where they begin to fall in love, but Anakin's nightmares about his mother force him on his own mission to his home planet where his journey to the dark side begins, and Obi-wan is sent to find the assassin who tried to kill Padme, but instead he finds a clone army being built for the republic...The plot for Attack of the Clones is less political that the Phantom Menace which is nice, but it instead puts a lot of its focus on Anakin and Padme's relationship which results in a lot of awkward dialogue and forced romance, which is why a lot of people consider this film the worst of the saga, I feel there's not enough of this to overshadow the good points.The love plot isn't even that long. Half-way through the story, Anakin decides to head to Tattoine to see his mother after he has a nightmare about her, when he arrives he finds her having been tortured by the sandpeople and she dies in his arms, so he kills all the sandpeople in a fit of rage. The next scene is really cool but spoiled mostly by Hayden Christensen's acting, where he proclaims his hatred for the sandpeople, this is the first glimpse we get of Darth Vader.The other storyline is that of Obi-wan trying to find out who tried to assassinate Padme. I really like this storyline, it has a real element of mystery about it. We also visit many imaginative worlds throughout this storyline, and while there's too much CGI, it at least looks better than the previous film.Let's talk about the cast, Hayden Christensen gives a very forced performance as Anakin Skywalker. Jake Lloyd wasn't exactly Oscar standard but he was competent and knew how to act the lines he was reading, Christensen just reads the lines and hopes for the best, which makes things feel very forced. Natalie Portman is OK but she doesn't do the romantic dialogue too well, almost as if she doesn't know how to act these lines, which makes me think it's George Lucas' writing rather than the acting.Ewan McGregor is naturally the best actor in this film, but his character just isn't there. As for the others, Samuel L. Jackson is great when he's being given things to do, Ian MacDiarmid is suitably mysterious in the role of Palpatine, and Jimmy Smitt does a great job with his small role as Bail Organa. Newcomers include Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett who has a great mysterious presence on screen, and even Daniel Logan as the young Boba Fett isn't that bad, despite being a nothing character. And then there's the main star of the Dark Side, Christopher Lee, as the wonderful Count Dooku, my favourite villain from the prequel trilogy. This guy is so awesomely creepy and gives off this powerful screen presence whenever he's in the shot.This film is heavier on the action than its predecessors, and it's very cool. The hover-car scene at the beginning of the film looks awesome even if I am always thinking of Mega Man X8, and Anakin jumping off the car and skydiving down to the car of the assassin is freaking awesome. I also love the droid factory scene and Obi-wan's fight with bounty hunter Jango Fett on Kamino, it's so fun. The space battle that follows is also really cool, although it lacks the tension of the asteroid scene in the Empire Strikes Back. But it's the Jedi battle on Geonosis that really seals it for me, seeing so many Jedi fighting is awesome, and I admit, I rather like C-3PO's one-liners during this scene.The finale contains a three part lightsaber battle between Anakin, Obi-wan and Yoda against Count Dooku. The Swordplay is really cool, although it lacks the super fast fun of the Phantom Menace battle, but it's very well choreographed. There is however this one awkward scene with Anakin and Count Dooku just sort of waving their lightsabers above their heads, not even hitting each other, it's really awkward, but Anakin fighting with two sabers is pretty cool. Yoda fighting with a lightsaber is really cool too. His constant jumping around make an incredibly fearsome opponent, although the fight is incredibly quick and doesn't last long! The score during this battle is amazing, seriously, watch this with the volume up, the score makes this scene so epic.So... Overall, I really like this film. It's not quite the original trilogy but it's still really cool. It has a better plot that the Phantom Menace, as well as being more interesting and less dull. This is a film that I can actually watch and have a really good time with, unlike the Phantom Menace which I just want to turn off as soon as we reach Tattooine. This film is heavily criticised because of its awkward love scenes, people seem to overlook the really awesome moments this film has to offer, and I don't consider the love scenes to be something that's impossible to sit through, I've seen worse.The only thing left to do was to finish Anakin's story, so in 2005 we got Revenge of the Sith, which is considered by many to be the best of the prequels...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Bores Episode II-Attack of the Yawns!,"* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * BrilliantLast year did not see many, if not any really good summer blockbuster movies. The usual clutch of commercial popcorn movies were hurled at us from those big wigs at Hollywood and one that stuck in my mind was this effort. Not because it was the best. Oh, no. Because it was undeniably in my opinion the biggest load of garbage since 'The Phantom Menace' three years previously.Over the years George Lucas has released wave upon wave of movie as a producer that was not as big as the good yet over rated star wars movies(Apart from the Indiana Jones movies). The 1986 effort of Howard: A New breed of Hero was a huge turkey of a movie that flopped big time at the box office. The fantasy adventure movie he produced which Ron Howard directed, called 'Willow' with Val Kilmer was a better effort but also failed to bring in the audiences.So why people went to see this drivel is any one's guess.Personally I believe they were hoping for an improvement. Don't get me wrong. I was one of them. Having seen both trailers for Episode II for free(I work in a cinema)I was quite hopeful from the look of them. Boy, was I wrong.This segment in the Star Wars saga concerns the young Anakin Skywalker (Played here by new comer Hayden Christiensen). No longer the little boy we saw in Episode I: The Phantom menace, but a nineteen year old Padawan apprentice to now, Master Jedi Obi-Wan-Kenobi(Ewan MacGregor reprising the roll).Ten years have passed since the battle of Naboo and the two Jedi are given the task by the Jedi high council of protecting Padme Amidala (Nathalie Portman), once ruler of Naboo she has now become  a senator to her home world. Her life is being threatened by a separatist movement lead by the enigmatic Count Dooku,(Christopher Lee) a former Jedi Master who detests the ever growing corruption in the galactic senate and plans to put a stop to it by what ever means he sees fit.The reason for the threat on Padme's life is the fact that she plans to put a vote in the senate that will enable the senate to build a grand army of the republic to combat against the seperatists. The Jedi's number are not strong enough to cope against the many that are out there. As Jedi Master Mace Windu states, 'We are keepers of the peace. Not soldiers.'Of course as always things are not quite as they seem and the events of the movie will lead Anakin back to his home planet of Tataooine and the grim realisation of what has become of his mother. Not only that but we witness the first unsubtle steps he will take to joining the Darkside.Sadly however, the promise that the movie had is compeletly lost in a badly written script with characters who are never well enough drawn out. Anakin who is so woodenly portrayed by Canadian new comer Hayden Christiensen does not come across as a idealistic young apprentice coping with the enormity incredible powers, so much as a spoiled brat who forever has a hissy fit when he doesn't get his own way. You constantly wonder why Obi-Wan as he states in the previous trilogy, loved him so much.Ewan Macgregor does a slightly better job as Anakin's supposed friend and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.Now no longer the rebellious apprentice he was in the Phantom Menace he is a wiser more medetive man. However Macgregor can't seem to fully convince as the younger Obi-Wan.He is unable to harness Alec Guinesse's mannerism's voice and the character is so different. Too different from the older man he becomes. Never the less Macgregor does apear to have fun in the roll.Nathalie Portman like Christiensen is undeniably flat in her portrayal. She lacks the charisma to make Padme the fully memorable character that Princess Leia was in the earlier film's. But then that's probably down more to the writing of the script than her boring performance.The rest of the supporting cast with the exception of maybe Christopher lee is absoleutly terrible. A normally reliable Samuel L. Jackson tries bravely to cope with the script but sadly fails while Ian Mcdiarmid as the future Emperor, Chancellor Palpatine fall short of expectations.One of the few wise moves that Lucas makes his decreasing the screen time of one of the most unpopular characters from the first movie. That of Jar-Jar Binks. It's good to see that he at least listened to the fans when it came to this irritating character. Shame he couldn't erase him completly.In surmising Episode II has very slight redeeming features but none to prevent it from being possibly just as bad as 'The Phantom Menace'. Lucas has tried telling a story in at two hours and twenty minutes is just not quite long enough and feels a bit rushed. If you do really want to see this film rent it out. But don't make the mistake of buying it. Robs Rating: *",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The second installment in a new kind of series, but still with a touch of World War II allusions.","Star Wars Episode II is definitely a part of the same series as the Phantom Menace.  I particularly liked this film, but I do not know if it can compare with the original Star Wars Triology.  I'm not saying it is worse, in my opinion it is just as good, but there is a difference.  When Star Wars came out, it was the first of its kind.  No one had ever imagined something like that.  They took the technology of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and added the action of a Western Film, with a touch of World War II evident in battle sequences, technology, and especially the Storm Trooper's Uniforms.Well times have now changed.  Newer films are going more for action and special effects.  The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are a new series.  Most people would not deny that if Star Wars A New Hope were to be released in today's world, it wouldn't get too much attention.  It would be too slow.  Well, many people want Attack of the Clones, I guess, to be revolutionary too, just like Star Wars.  And if you look closely, it is...Look beyond... it is amazing how this was coordinated.  Romance is mixed in to strengthen the original three films, and to show the position of Darth Vader later in his life.  Most Star Wars fans would admit it is quite fun seeing all the allusions to the original three films.  But what I find most entertaining is the allusions to the World Wars.  If you've studied World War II, and I mean really studied it, to the point you can truly call yourself a World War II buff, you'd see what I mean.  I don't want to spoil all the allusions, but just like the original three, so far, all of the Star Wars films have had this element.  If you have recognized some of these allusions and would like to discuss them, or would like to see some of them, feel free to email me.P.S.  I don't think the acting is bad at all.  It is just not what you would have expected in the original trilogy.  But like I said, times have changed, and this is a brand new kind of series adjusted to this time.  This is still a very high quality of work, still monumental, and yes, still a breakthrough in technology and in technique.  It's worth seeing, especially if you're a World War II buff.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The love story feels forced, the rest is astonishing","What a ride of a movie. Episode 2 breaks loose a little bit this time and it gives you an amazing ride, mostly. What is so difficult about this movie's character relationship is that those feel forced, like if they knew already as we do that sooner or later they will end up in episodes 4,5,6. You know that Anakin soon or later will get it on with Padme, and the actors know that and we know that, but most of their scenes feel so forced that i find myself laughing at one of the most corning love dialogs in movie history.Fortunately, the love story isn't everything this movie has to offer. Episode 2 brings you some action sequences that surpass the complexity and excitement of episode 1, including an amazing pursuit on Courscant, a chase on asteroid field, an amazing action sequence on a droid factory, and the last and best thing the start of the clone wars.The visuals on this movie are one of the best thing on this episode, they haunt your eyes and never let you go, showing you some new worlds and old ones but from a different perspective. I have to say that this movie feels long on it's running time, it could've been use some editing here and there, that's because since the last action sequence until the clone wars there's a large amount of time, most of it spending on main plot elements, that although necessary to the overall trilogy plot, they about put you to sleep as they are so unexciting; but wait until the climax with Yoda that scene, steals the whole show and it's worth the admission ticket.A very good episode, as good as episode 1, in some ways better, but not as good as the old ones, that's impossible. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

2 strikes,"I've never had a problem with CGI before but after watching Star Wars I feel like the movie beat me over the head with it and then shoved it down my throat. This movie is just a training exercise for CGI students. The character development? Who cares? I mean who can you actually care for in this movie? The dialogue? Horrible. Serious scenes brought tons of laughter from the crowd. And people were nearly falling out in the aisles during Anakin's bad dream sequence from laughing so hard. I guess they needed something to laugh at because this was the most boring, tedious attempt at a storyline ever.How did the love story end up?Anakin - ""I killed not only the men but the women and children as well...I hate them all"".Padme - ""OK let's get married...fa la la la la"".Lucas spent all his time and energy on a visual accomplishment and forgot that he actually had to tell an interesting story. That was not Star Wars I saw. It was Starship Troopers, 5th Element, Gladiator, and Blade Runner re-mixed with a weak Titanic love story. Lucas slapped a Star Wars label on this mess and the Star Wars fans are eating it up just like they did Phantom Menace. The action had such little payoff after that long, boring setup that came before it. The Gladiator-ish battle was just a repetitive mess of Jedi slaughtering droids over and over and over...and then some more. Yoda's duel in the end gave me goosebumps but it's over before it even gets started and 2 minutes of Yoda fighting is not worth it.One of the great things about the original trilogy of Star Wars was the characters and story came before the effects...the effects were just there to serve the story. In Attack of the Clones the special effects ARE the story. The characters are there to say their forgettable lines and be a backdrop for Lucas's CGI show which looked more like a cartoon as the movie went on. Nothing in that arena battle looked believable. The CGI was so obvious it just took me out of the movie. And losing interest in this movie was too easy. Like I said before, I didn't care for any of the characters so there's no danger factor or excitement factor here. The only saving grace I can take from these new Star Wars movies is it just making me appreciate the original trilogy more and more for how great those movies truly are.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Much Better Start to The Prequel Trilogy,"This film I believe deserves to be the true Episode I than The Phantom Menace and I love how the actor Tamura Morrison portrayed the origin of the storm troopers, which were called the clone troopers in the timeline of this universe that lead to the concept of The Clone Wars that would come much later as an animated TV series during that time in the 2000's.Evan McGregor does a well job playing Obi-Wan Kenobi as the mentor and friend of Anakin Skywalker played by Hayden Chistensen with the love interest Padme Amidala played by Natalie Amidala.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better, but still a poor cousin to the original!","I know that this is not what Star Wars fans would want to read, but it happens to be the truth!

It's got some great sfx, fabulous fight sequences and some really interesting characters, except for the two main leads, that is!! Hayden Christansen is as wooden as they come!!

If wasting time and money while getting bored and giggling at stupid dialogue is your favorite past time - go and see this movie!,"The ""Phantom Menace"" was really very bad, so comments like ""Phantom Menace forgiven"" can make you think ""Attack of the Clones"" has to be really good. Being (as all people of my age) a long time Star Wars fan (but not fanatic), I decided to see it on the first screening at midnight 15/16 of May. It's really a pity I didn't have a bad feeling about this - I'd better to stay at home.This movie was like watching one of those TV Channels that advertise for computer games 24/7, with small exception that on this game we had some real-living-human actors blueboxed into action, which doesn't happen very often in computer games lately. While CGI can really do magic, showing out-of-this-world landscapes (which, by the way in the first part of the movie look very much like Blade Runner meets The Fifth Element), it is just it: computer generated landscape and computer generated monsters. It doesn't come close to the REAL FEEL of cardboard props and rubber puppets we know from episodes 4-6. Real actors just make the CGI look really... erm... plastic.But of course - if you like computer games you can really enjoy the movie, if you don't pay attention to what the actors say. Oh, well - I can forgive the stupid, pointless political part of the ""plot"", but the ""love chit-chat"" of Anakin and Padme... is just hopeless! From everywhere around you you can hear people giggling, laughing, saying ""oh, my god! This is so stupid!"" or ""when will this nightmare end?"" or ""who wrote these dialogues?"", and every time the movie switches from Obi-Wan story to Padme and Anakin you can hear people muttering ""oh, not again!"". If Lucas is planning to make a director's cut of this movie, he should make it a silent movie.To sum it up - see it if you're really a desperate fanatic. Otherwise - wait until they show it on TV, so you can have your remote ready, when you get bored...",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I don't like sand,"Ewan McGregor straps this episode to his back and saves it. Despite the cheesy dialogue and some ridiculousness, this is fun.

Natalie Portman.  All is well.,"I was fortunate enough to see a preview screening of this movie.  I am not a big star wars fan, in fact, i'm not a star wars fan at all.  I do appreciate a good movie though.  And this is a decent movie.  The acting towards the beginning is adequate at best.  I also found Anakin Skywalker to be rather dislikable for the first 30 minutes or so.For me, this movie had two redeeming factors.  One, Natalie Portman is amazing in it.  If she wasn't in the movie, I would truly dislike it, because every other character is hideous.  Ewan McGregor has a nasty looking beard throughout, and Hayden Christensen has some weird rat tails, and behaves somewhat awkwardly.  Portman really smooths over the look, feel, and flow of the movie.Two, Yoda is very likable in this one.  He's not just some guy sitting on the sidelines making backwards comments.  His character is vastly redeemed.A few downright corny puns are to be expected from C3PO, and those are delivered.I guarantee this movie is more popular that it is good, but that's always the case with Star Wars nowadays.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Much Like Jingling Keys In Front Of An Infant,"Excellent special effects! AOTC was certainly a site to behold with its sweeping landscapes, zooming vehicles and diverse alien races. It's truly a spectacle! With that being said, what happens when we look beyond the veneer of pretty pictures and bright shiny objects? To be blunt, not much!As much as I loved the special effects, they were obviously there to hide the fact that there's nothing more to the film. It's like distracting an infant by jingling keys in front of them. The AOTC plot showed great promise, but it fell victim to a hackneyed script which didn't know where it was going or what it was doing when it finally got there. Most of this happens during the ""build up"" of Amidala's and Anakin's ""love affair"" in which there is no build up or real love affair involved. Jingle! Jingle! Look at the ocean swept world of Kamino! Doesn't it look awesome?! Slow pacing is also another of this film's greatest flaws. When a film is 2 hours and 20 minutes plus, pacing should be a real concern. Jingle! Jangle! Look at this! Isn't the ""car"" chase on Coruscant zippy?! Wow! Though a sophomoric script is mostly to blame, the acting came across as wooden and would have been better played by  marionettes. It was imperative that Anakin ""tell"" us on a regular basis how bad he felt and how mad he was when actions would have been much better at driving the point home. The scene at the Tusken Raider camp would have been perfect for that, but it was cut far too short which leads me to believe that the Star Wars franchise has fallen out of the realm of General Audiences and is now the sole providence of children. Jingle! Jangle! Jingle! But check out the monsters in the arena! Don't they look scary?! Look at how the tiger-thingy rips Amidala's shirt just perfectly so we can see her bare tum-tum! Ooo-aaah!If you love special effects, I suggest you catch a matinee of this movie. Much like Centropolis' ""Godzilla"", it's a wonder to behold.

Good and bad,"After the let down on Star Wars I, people once again set the bar of having this movie as great extremely high and once again, let down. But what can you expect? It's very hard recapturing the magic of something you worked on 20+ years ago. But there was something about this film that seemed to skim some new magic, which the first one didn't.While all the Star Wars films have been relatively light, this film heads into some darker places. Shmi and Anakin, Anakin's scene with the Tusken raiders and about what he did to them all reach into our minds and soul, grab us there, and hold us, staring us straight in the face with a cold look, foreshadowing the inevitable fate of Anakin Skywalker, want-to-be Jedi.Hayden Christenen takes on the role of Anakin this time, and we are placed ten years ahead of the first one. The movie does start out better and the story actually has relevance to the series as a whole (which most of the first one did not, except for Palpatine taking over as Chancellor). Hayden is OK with Anakin; not terrible as most people make him out to be, but not so spectacular that you totally believed he would be Darth Vader only three years later.The script is handled much better this time, but does have its share of faults. The good things include a tight script with a great format and it has much more importance to the future events that will shape the fate of the galaxy. It's not as light and happy as Star Wars I but never crosses into serious adultness. Music once again improves the overall quality of the film and so do the special effects (there were too many special effects, but if they're good, who cares?) Some negative notes though make mistakes the first one didn't. The first one had a good story but they told it all wrong, and that greatly subtracted from the first film. The second one told the story very well, but it got boring at times. The whole ""mystery"" surrounding the ""Sith Lord controlling the Senate"" was way too much and took much time. Anakin's story was handled well (excpet for the corny and uncomfrotable love scenes), and Christopher Lee and Ewan McGregor were fantastic.This one made up all the mistakes in the first one, but made other mistakes in its place. The end though, made up for it (the battle of Geonosis, Count Dooku vs. Yoda). Overall, I would say that it was just as balanced as the first one (not very well-balanced, but oh well), but it was just a better film. 7.0/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Possibly in the top ten worst movies,"I loved the first three, and somewhat liked the Phantom Menace. However, this newest movie has proven that Lucas has lost his story telling ability. Myself and 4 of my friends (all Star Wars fans) were extremely let down.There was no plot, horrible acting, criminal dialogue, and sub par special effect for Lucas. C3PO and R2D2 stole the show as the only authentic portions of the movie. Yoda was silly, and the action scenes were not original and usually hokey. The ""love"" dialogue so so cheesy that the theatre was snickering through the whole movie.The only interesting part was when ""Vader"" snapped and went on a violent killing spree, however, they cut the scene after 10 seconds.In fact the directing was amateur. I might have nightmares. I am in total shock that anyone liked it.

Better Than Phantom,"Star Wars Ep. 2: Attack of the Clones (2002)** 1/2 (out of 4)This here's certainly better than the previous installment but it still suffers from the silly dialogue but it isn't as bad. The performances are also slightly better this time out and the added bonus of Christopher Lee also works well. The biggest advantage of this film is the action scenes are a whole lot better, especially the early race scene as well as the final forty-minutes, which are full of excitement.

Could have been better.,"It's better than Episode I but this doesn't mean much. The plot have some substance, it is interesting and add something to the saga, but is bad executed. Whiny Anakin is just too much, i'm not sure if this is Hayden's fault or George Lucas bad writing, the character ended up being unlikable with all that stupid dialogue, this movie could have been better if those corny romance scenes had been toned down.

"Oh no, not again...","I hated this movie.  I thought it had no story - ahh you say, but this is part of a bigger picture.  Drivvel.  All the others (bar ep 1, which I ain't even getting into) have a story in their own right, but add to the whole individually -  the FX were too plastic, the characters went 'bendy' in wide shot action scenes (Jango and Obi-Wan fight, for instance), and all the characters lacked emotion.  Anyone remember the emotion Luke Skywalker showed at the end of Empire Strikes Back?  How about vs Vader in Return of the Jedi?  Is that so long ago, in a movie so far far away?  The fight scenes back then didn't need thousands and thousands of items on the screen all at once.  We had a hero, and the action followed his attempts at thwarting the bad guys..  the near misses on his life, his successes - you were right there with him.  This time, the action breaks from one character to the next, and none were hero worthy..I applaud the technical achievements of this groundbreaking FX movie.  I fully agree with Mr Lucas that the quality of the film reel at the cinema is important, and that digital projection is the way forward..

Shame on you Lucas.,"You've heard people say that Attack of the Clones is like a video game. Well, its not just a figure of speech. This movie actually features characters dodging industrial presses! If that isn't wide screen gameboy I don't know what is. The film also contains horrendous dialogue, and like that video game comment, I'm not exaggerating. There was so many times I just wanted to reach for the screen and smack Anakin on the face for being so insolent and dimwitted. Jar Jar Binks has nothing on this guy. Speaking of Jar Jar Binks. Remember how some Jamaicans were offended by him? Well Attack of the Clones features an alien resembling African chief who communicates via clicking sounds, and an alien member of Senate who sounds like a bumbling Japanese tourist with subpar intelligence. Seriously, I cannot believe this. How could a man who wrote Star Wars Episode IV and Raiders of the Lost Ark produce such a monstrosity? Perhaps it was a fluke - just as the theory goes, a bunch of monkyes with typewriters will eventually produce a good novel. I think George Lucas is a monkey who got lucky with Star Wars IV and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Shame on you Lucas.. BAD BAD MONKEY!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Star Wars Episode 2, Attack of the action Scenes","Star Wars Episode 2 is the bridge between the discovery of the chosen one and his ultimate fall to the darkside. It is the painstaking transition which could be described as the puberty phase of Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). Throughout the film the audience must watch his awkward, forced transition through his emotional struggles of balancing his responsibilities with his awkward love life all while keeping it a secret as the Jedi order is not supposed to form attachments.The movie starts with the classic Star Wars crawl informing the reader of the complicated politics of a new vote to create a real army for the republic in order to not simply continue overusing a peace force with no allegiances. After the iconic crawl, the movie fades in with a few ships coming in to land similar but not identical to how the original Star Wars movie did. It quite literally drops the bomb with an explosive opening paired with poor emotional acting which is sadly a very recurring theme throughout the movie.After the first attack on Queen Amidala, Anakin and Obi Wan are assigned to manage the investigation and to protect the queen form more attacks. Another attempt is made on her life and after a thrilling chase sequence with beautiful props such as weapons, ships, and even costumes the would be assassin is captured in the clubs of Coruscant which surprisingly are very visually pleasing and fit the aesthetic of a futuristic club perfectly. After this attack, Obi Wan sends Anakin, his apprentice, to keep the queen safe by taking her to another planet in order for him to pursue the new lead he discovered in a very odd way with the help of an old comical friend.The movie then jumps between Anakin and Obi Wan's stories. It turns out that Anakin's version of ""protecting"" is flirting with the Queen even though he is not supposed to. Natalie Portman makes a good attempt at appearing to fall in love with Anakin and through the action scenes of them going on supposed ""dates"" it is believable at first that they are actually falling in love. However, after these action scenes showing the audience their love for eachother, the script writing takes a great fall and ruins this impression of their love by creating awkward flirtatious moments and even more questionable arguments between the two destined lovers. One scene where the acting and script written was particularly bad was when he tried to use his hatred for sand in an attempt to flirt with Queen Amidala. This particular scene highlights how the script writing ruins the immersion in their love story. Although it is attempting to do the right thing by showing an emotional moment and a deeper connection to the viewer Anakins (Hayden Christensen) delivery lacks the emotional weight needed to portray the love correctly. With Anakin's back story of being a slave who grew up on a desert planet this conversation makes since but there were much better and pressing issues that could have been used such as the weight of his responsibilities to the Jedi or even how he misses being able to see his mother.This new lead that Obi Wan is pursuing comes to a very surprising discovery and does well to pull the story back to the intro screen crawl. After some more investigating, Obi Wan is lead to a new planet and partakes in a dramatic ship versus ship battle and even though there is no sound in space the score and sound effects are spot on as he out whits his opponent. Continuing following this lead, it leads to him being captured and causes Anakin and Amidala to go against the Jedi foreshadowing how he will eventually leave them one day. This does a magnificent job of portraying Anakin's character and ultimately bringing back together the main characters and tying the two stories together for a very action pack conclusion of the original screen crawl but to the substories within the movie all while preparing keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat waiting for the next episode.I would say this movie is a quality star wars film when it comes to the action and adventure aspects but where it fall from glory is with the poor script writing and portrayal of Anakin not as the future Darth Vader but as an immature boy who is very gifted but being held back and not allowed to grow as he wants to. This also was supposed to be the love story of how the parents of future Luke and Leia fell in love and instead we were given an awkward and forced love story that left us questioning why they ever loved each other in the first place. Overall, If you like Star Wars for what it is meant to be: a thrilling, emotionally packed struggle between good and bad you will love this movie as a build up for the next chapter but if you are looking for a more well structured love story such as twilight this is not the movie for you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
attack of the clones and 2nd star wars trilogy,"I know people love the Star Wars films.I think ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a fine addition. No its not EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. I think in general that people take these films too seriously and want to make them the way they would like or have it done.I hear a lot of comparisons to the 1st trilogy{episodes4,5,6} and how much better the 1st trilogy is to these new films. Yes the Jedi are more amped to do more unbelievable stuff they could have been grounded a little bit more.You have to understand once the director has us he can take us anywhere do anything. Some say JarJar is too much and gets on their nerves and other things that annoys them about the new trilogy. You can say the same of the Ewoks in RETURN OF THE JEDI.I don't enjoy the original trilogy any more or less than the new trilogy. I think they are both satisfying. I seen the original Star Wars A New Hope in 1977 when I was 12 and it is my personal favorite film. No movie will do that for me as far as a movie-going experience again. I think it has to do with being young and something making an impression on you that is lasting. Now that i am older movies don't do that same thing for me even though I would like them to. It happens once in a lifetime. George Lucas has said that he wrote all the Star Wars movies and the Indiana Jones films in the style and vein of the thirties and forties movie serials. He wrote and gave us a big part of himself and made some really great movies. George did have Lawrence Kasdens writing help on EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI that may have given those films some thing that may now missing from the writing in the newer films. Nonetheless, George Lucas has innovated movie-making and entertained us immenseley. ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a great middle film that leaves you wanting more like it is designed to do.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
no soul,"The passion Lucas has for his work is lost on the screen. It is lost by the wooden acting mostly, since they lack any passion in their roles. No doubt acting in front of blue screens hinders their performance, but they should work on it a bit more and not move on till they get it right! At least marginally good! Even if their dialogue doesn't help them.The music, which to me was the best thing about episodes 4-6 (including the original ewok singalong that ended ROTJ), is good, but doesn't seem to push the film like in the original trilogy. There were no moments here for me(like when Luke turns off his computer in the x-wing in ANH) where the music takes you to another level. I think that the lack of a strong storyline really made it impossible for Williams to do much more. Also, the aforementioned bad acting didn't really made me care too much about whether the characters lived or died (in fact, even if i knew they'd be in episode III - and IV through VI- i still wished some wouldn't make it), so the music alone could not make up for that. The over-reliance in cgi makes it difficult for me to believe that the characters are actually ""there"". When Luke was in Dagobah, you could feel he was there, among the trees in the fog. The characters here don't interact with their environment like they should. It is very distracting; it makes you very aware you are watching a special effects scene in a big budget movie and pulls you out of the story. Not helpful at all.I wish I could be more specific about the details, but I saw the movie a while ago. I feel like I'm just restating a lot of the opinions of other users. But I really disliked the film, and I'll probably wait to see it again when the whole saga is available in DVD. Before Episodes I and II came out, I could only imagine what occurred before. I imagined it as a very exiting, magical, and epic tale. I never thought that the events leading up to the clone wars could be so dull. THE CLONE WARS, just that name alone , conjured up so much incredible visions. Now we are getting closer to actually seeing it. I really really hope that Lucas surprises everyone a gives us the best film in the sixology with episode III. Out with a bang not a whimper.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Sam Jackson is a great actor, but he's very boring in this film, but I blame the direction of George Lucas for all the painfully bad performances in this movie.

"Some sci-fi fun on its own; not quite ""Star Wars""","Overall, ATTACK OF THE CLONES is okay. Full of imaginative action sequences and sci-fi environments. But the film, like all the spin-off prequels, doesn't seem to fit with the excellent original movies. It doesn't ""feel"" the same. Still, this movie should be a lot of fun for kids and sci-fi buffs.This, Episode II of the saga, tries to lay the groundwork for the upcoming war and the fall of the Republic. A good amount of time is spent on a sappy romance. But there are enough battles and chases to keep viewers satisfied.As a fan of the original films, I can't quite embrace the prequels. There's just something about them...The Good:A space chase through an asteroid belt, the return of the Tatooine moisture farm, the introduction of the clone army, John Williams's score, Obi-Wan's storyline, and Natalie Portman (she's very pretty).Obi-Wan goes on an investigation into the attempted assassination of Senator Amidala. This story plays out like a Bogart detective noir. He travels around the galaxy, meeting people and gathering information, trying to piece the clues together. Dexter Jettster, an informant in a diner, is particularly cool. A good piece of voice acting. I just thought it was interesting to see the detective-mystery storyline in a Star Wars film.The Bad:The overly sentimental love story, the boring politics, some silly chase sequences, the green-screen sets, and Hayden Christensen's terrible acting. As Anakin Skywalker, the main focus of the prequel trilogy, Christensen is just awful. His performance is wooden and amateurish.. . . . .The prequels just can't live up to the original Star Wars movies. They just don't feel the same. I can't really explain it, but the original movies seemed realistic. War movies set in another galaxy. The prequels are more like sci-fi fantasy adventures.I think part of it is the overuse of CGI. The new movies are created almost entirely in a computer. Most of the sets, backgrounds, creatures, vehicles, and effects, and even some major characters, are created digitally. And as impressive as the technology is, viewers can still tell that what they are seeing is not real.The original trilogy seemed more ""real"". It used models, miniatures, puppets, practical effects, and real sets. The vehicles and equipment looked used and realistic, not polished and sleek and design-oriented.And the stories are different, too. The originals were about a band of interesting characters in a war against a powerful enemy. They were underdog stories. And they had a sort of hokey charm. The recent prequels are grand and operatic space romances. If that makes any sense...Still, ATTACK OF THE CLONES has some fun action and interesting sequences. It's an important transitional film in the series. It's not classic Star Wars, but taken as it is, the movie can be pretty enjoyable.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A very exciting and intense installment of Star Wars...,"Three years ago, I remember the feeling I had while I was waiting to see Star Wars: Episode I. I had hopes of it being as great as the original three movies had been. However, Episode I was a great disappointment. Just today, I stood in line to see Episode II with a very doubtful and cynical disposition. I was expecting that it would be not much better than Episode I. I was very wrong. It is only one of two movies in which the entire audience clapped afterwards, the other movie being Lord of the Rings. This movie is what Star Wars is all about. Episode II: Attack of the Clones has all of the action that The Phantom Menace should have had. The quality of the special effects exceeds that of Episode I by leaps and bounds. The backgrounds are stunning! Without spoiling anything, I will say that this installment has THE best battle scenes of ANY Star Wars movie. The fights are fast-paced and exciting. Although it is quite humorous to see Yoda fight, that scene is simply incredible. If you have any doubts, as I did, about this movie get over it and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!

"Much better than Epi I, a Galaxy away from ""Empire""","After the jar-jarred ""Phantom Menace"", the fifth ""Star Wars""-installment is a huge step in the right direction, but still a long way from ""The Empire Strikes Back"". ""Attack of the Clones"" has lots of action, but it's never really moving in any way. It has lots of visual effects and perhaps the most sophisticated sound effects ever, but the love for details shown in these departments is sadly missed when it comes to characters and story. That's nothing really new with the ""Star Wars""-movies, but it's sad in this case, where beauty and greatness could have been easy to achieve. Part of the reason for that is the shallowness of Hayden Christensen, who doesn't have enough to offer in order to let us believe he's suffering - let alone the ability of sharing his turmoil. Natalie Portman is way over Christensen's head when it comes to acting, and it would have required a really good actor like Tobey Maguire to make those love scenes work.Since those emotional scenes do not work the way one hoped for, the cross cutting between Anakin's story and Obi Wan's adventures doesn't have the zip of the crosscutting in ""Empire Strikes Back"", where you had Leia and Han Solo fooling around on one level, and Yoda teaching Luke on the other. That worked really wonderful. Then again, ""Empire"" still is the only great ""Star Wars""-movie, and therefore I start to wonder whether that film was a ""mistake"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

And yes, the love story is a bit cringe, but that's the way dialogue always work in Star Wars. Don't you dare tell me that the OG star wars have the most deep love stories going on. Luke just sees Leia as a beautiful woman and it doesn't go deeper than that. George INTENDED this kind of wooden dialogue. And I love it.

A Truly Fantastic Final Act At The Expense of The Rest of The Film,"Attack of The Clones is generally considered by most to be the worst Star Wars film and overall just a bad film and while I personally wouldn't go that far I think this is an incredibly flawed film that has a few redeeming features mainly to do with the final 30 minutes. This last act is truly fantastic, not only will an Star Wars fan take joy in seeing the true power of the Jedi but it's also just entertaining, the massive battle that has been built up has been extremely well executed and truly gave us a sense of the power of these two opposing forces. The final lightsaber battle of the film while not very intense internally is still fairly well choreographed and made for a somewhat epic conclusion, all the action sequences are very well done I just wish there had been more of them. The performances in this film are a bit of a mixed bad but the one undeniable positive of this entire trilogy is Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi, he just brings a wise nature yet vulnerability to this already iconic character not only in this film but the trilogy as a whole. However this film still has its fair share of flaws. For one while the last act is riveting and engaging the first two are dull and drab, just dialogue heavy exposition with no real heart or intensity to it, the characters are not built up in any way and the villains are given no motivation or backstory making giving them no really presence. The central romance in this movie just simply does not work mainly because the two actors have very little chemistry due to the poor dialogue and script. Green Screen environments are used frequently in this film and it always shows and comes across as incredibly fake. I really don't like criticising performances but here I have too Hayden Christensen was truly bad in this film, he never really embodied Anakin as a complex character but mainly as just a whiny brat that did not make for a compelling protagonist. This film also sets up some very good ideas or plot lines that are either brushed over or all but forgotten about and came across as lazy at times.Attack of The Clones in my opinion is not an awful movie but far from a great one, while the actual Attack of The Clones itself is very well done the rest of the film has poor characters and dialogue, it fails to be compelling and wastes very good actors that could have made for potentially engaging characters. Despite its serious flaws I still consider this film to be at least a marginal improvement over The Phantom Menace.68%/B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Honestly I don't know what George was thinking,"Honestly this movie is a lot of issues. Sure it has some good parts and stuff, which put at 8th place above phantom menace, but even then that's barely. Let's start off with that the very first part of the film is forgettable because of the senate scenes. I will go back to this later, but for now the the underworld plot thread. It's not that great, it's basically okay on concept and paper, but it's not good in execution because it's so under developed and like it's there but just disappears into another plot. I wished it was explored more. My next point is about the character. It's not that great in individual scenes but in the entire movie it's alright which in itself is bad. Honestly the whole this plot thread and character development connects to the whole problem with the prequels is George sort of forces the world building. We already got the world building in the original trilogy so I don't we need a world building like this but if he wanted to he could've had some of movies feel connected. Which also brings up the concept point that everybody Hass which is that George it's got a concept but bad at execution which is totally true. Now on to the senate scenes. Wow these scenes just so cringe/boring that it really takes away from the underworld plot thread and. The scenes basically just throw politics at you instead of having breaks that really make since and make you invested with the politics. George should've know better. My next point is about the love scenes, they are so cringe. It's basically toxic high school love mixed with childish love as well (I mean high school love is childish whatever). Honestly George should've not forced it at all. This brings me to how he handles anakin. Anakin is very annoyed at the stuff the Jedi council and obi wan do, but it's not really that great and what would've worked us flashbacks that would've gave us skywalkers pad wan years before atoc to see why he is this way. Also could've had padme be like more in a say in stuff anakin talks (yes she sort of dose to an extent which brings me to my next point). I feel padme is a little bit better than phantom menace padme. A lot of people probably disagree with me on this, but I think the acting that natalie Portman has is good, yes it's dry, but it's a little bit better than anakin. It's probably because of George's why of handling dialogue. I think that there should've been flashbacks of qui-gon and dooku sprinkled in in the movie, but mainly have in it in the duel at the end with dooku vs anakin obi wan and yoda, which brings me to my next point, the duel. This duel has a problem it has no good breathing room when dooku, obi wan, and anakin fight expect for maybe yoda vs dooku but still has some bad breathing room. All I think they could've done is have obi wan fight dooku first than have anakin fight next so that we can have a flashback about dooku and qui-gon. Maybe have it in yoda vs dooku as well, which brings me to my next problem, which is the ending of yoda and dookus duel. It felt very rushed and like dooku just run away like a coward which he is sort of a coward but that's not the point. The point is they could've had dooku be like you will see your downfall soon Jedi or something like that just keep the Jedi at edge. Another problem is there's not enough bad guy scenes. All I wanted was more scenes with the bad guys but where we get spoiled of order 66. Honestly that's all of my complaints and stuff. Why I put this above phantom menace is because of the end battle, kamino/clones, and the sith plot. There's one thing I would've is more tension between obi wan and jango but that's it. I think 7 is a fair score since it's still a good Star Wars but had so massive flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A true disappointment,"Although the first film was highly criticized for its mascot injection of Jar-Jar (who didn't actually appear any more than the equally annoying C-3PO of the original trilogy), the second film takes another tone and another turn, attempting to further chronicle the downfall of doomed Anakin Skywalker.Unfortunately in this brave attempt, it falls flat on its face.Lucas's obviously lacking grasp of philosophy and the spiritual practices upon which he purports to base Jedi beliefs make this a true disaster for anyone watching who follows any of these spiritualist practices, because the assertion that these Jedi must be totally emotionless to function is not only ridiculous but also completely not borne out from the actions of the Jedi in the film!That aside, the worst part of the film must be the truly forced, unlikely, and extremely uncomfortable ""relationship"" between Anakin and Amidala.  To be so publicized, it's very forced and unlikely, and honestly it disturbed me a great deal and seemed quite unrealistic.  Judging this by logic and knowing a good bit about relationships from experience, this one was portrayed in the worst way possible, and by two of the worst actors possible.  The allure of Amidala's exotic costumes and accents from the first episode was all gone, leaving the wholly unfulfilling and wooden acting of Natalie Portman, who is at best bland, and of course the almost laughable Hayden Christensen, who does about as well as Jake Lloyd on the belching out of his overly hostile lines.This has all of the glitz of the Star Wars saga but none of the fun or appeal.  Of all the movies in the quintet that now exist, this is undoubtedly the worst.  All the continuity flaws, poor acting, bad writing, and hyped-up nonsense make this the largest disappointment of the entire summer.  Save your money unless you're one of the die-hard Star Wars fans, in which case Lucas could probably scrape up any old garbage on a plate and you'd think it was brilliant anyway.A truly hideous travesty of the sci-fi genre, I wouldn't be surprised if a good many fans of this trilogy stop watching right now.  I certainly won't be packing the theater for Episode III.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Is Episode II worth the Star Wars name?,"""I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.""Both of the first two Star Wars prequels have substantial flaws that zealously try to ruin the un-ruinable, the mighty Star Wars franchise. In Episode I, it was the complete overkill in trying to make the movie appealing to young kids, personified by the much (and deservedly) maligned Jar Jar Binks. There's much less Jar Jar in Episode II, but its biggest flaw is almost as bad: the awful way the blossoming romance between now-Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) and the teenage Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is depicted.Christensen isn't a brilliant actor in the best of circumstances, and whether he makes a suitable Anakin is up for debate. But pairing him with George Lucas's hokey attempts at writing romantic dialogue is just painful. The movie seriously drags when it focuses on the relationship between Anakin and Padmé.But, like Episode I, Episode II somehow manages to overcome its flaws to be a decent entry into the Star Wars canon. The visuals received an impressive upgrade over the first movie (and I don't only mean Portman's increasingly sexy costumes), and there are many breathtaking action scenes and special effects sequences. The story takes the characters to new worlds and involves more mystery and intrigue than the first movie. You get to see multiple Jedi in action in large-scale battles, and who hasn't wanted to see that? Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor seem much more comfortable and natural in their roles, despite the absurdly cheesy things the script often forces Portman to say.Is Episode II an improvement over Episode I? Yes. Is it as good as Episodes III, IV, V, and VI? Nope. Poor writing keeps Attack of the Clones from reaching its full potential.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great FUN! Yoda and Jango Rock!,"I was very impressed with the SFX and the art work in general and this alone would, to me, justify a rating of 8/10..... but seeing Yoda fighting and Jango (plus Boba of course)could bring me to give a 9/10... boring love scenes? so what?!

A return to the Star Wars bread & butter,"I will not attempt to go into a painstaking critique as their others out there more qualified than I to do so.  However, like many I was left a little incomplete in my expectations after watching Episode I.  I am pleased to say that I did not leave with the same feeling of disappointment after watching Episode II.Attack of the Clones sees George Lucas return in foundation to what made Episodes IV & V so fantastic & legendary.  The darkness of this film is something we should have had more of in Episode I, and the development of Anakin's character was so much better weaved into the plot of the film then in the last installment.  Ewan McGregor shines on the screen as Obi-Wan and we get an eerie introduction to the famed Storm Troopers, the Death Star and the roots of Anakin's eventual seduction to the dark side.  Padme's striking similarities to her eventual daughter's are striking and well crafted.  As always, John Williams does an outstanding job with the score - although he did recycle music from Episode I perhaps more than I expected!Looking forward to 2005 and Episode III!John Schmitt PA., United States",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Every time I see this movie, it gets better","Lucas has outdone himself here.  Brilliant, just brilliant.There were a couple of places where the CGI slipped, but generally, the movie was beautiful to look at, which is a big plus.  Hayden Chistensen is a fantastic Anakin--he studied and merges four different performances, along with giving his own interpretation.  Really phenomenal performance (despite being burdened with cheesy dialogue in places).  And I haven't seen a better physical actor in years.  Ewan MacGregor is also a lot of fun, and he has the attitude down pat.The wonderful symbolic imagery throughout this movie is fodder for discussions for years.  I won't get into all of it here; if someone is interested, Paul MacDonald's essays at Suite101 are top notch for critical exegesis.The love story is much maligned, but really very much in keeping with the tone of the prequels--it's high romance, the knight in shining armor wooing the queen.  Both people are appealing, and I buy it from beginning to end. (I do note that it's mainly TPM-bashers who don't buy the romance... they seem to be missing that the groundwork was all laid in TPM, and now you have two people amazed to find that, after ten years, that old familiar friendship was right there waiting to grow.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Romance Focus,"Romance is the basically focus of the movie, Anakin and Padmé falling in love, until Anakin felt his mother in pain, then she died his on hands, those who made here a prisioner are now dead, all of them, Anaikin starts to not pull his words, breaking the Jedi Code, being with Padmé, not respecting his Master, this movie is a bridge to episode 3, wich is not a bad thing, but the movie made this bridge too much that didn't really make a history, different from Phantom Menance, that had a history and told that pretty well, and making this comparasion, Attack of the Clones used his screen time more then Phantom Menance, even if it's still not better than it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This movie does no justice to the series,"Never before have I seen a series fall backwards so hard.  This movie does no justice whatsoever to the other movies in the series.  Episode 1 wasn't hot, but at least it had some logic to this.  This movie has no logic to it whatsoever.First off, the relationship between Hayden and Natalie is without a doubt the worst relationship ever.  There is no proof whatsoever that they show any emotion for the other.  All they do is quote every cliche in the book, Natalie pretends that she hates him, and then he gets all sad.  And for some reason, they fall in love, even though they are always arguing with each other.  And then there is that ""great"" moment when Anakin rescues his mother, only to see her die within ten seconds of taking her off a wooden post.  I guess she can't live long without laying on a piece of wood...And now the story.  God, does the story lack any logic at all.  While the whole clones thing is kind of interesting, the action sequences just aren't interesting and it there is no suspense between all of the battles because all fans no exactly what will happen, and the Jedi's always win, so what is there to be excited about?And for the final fight in the movie, that is without a doubt the worst part of the movie.  It makes no sense whatsoever, and is probably the most stupidest sequence I have ever seen in a movie.  Again, everything seems to happen at ""just the right time,"" and then Yoda walks in and from this point on the movie just abandons logic.This is the worst movie in the series, and I really hope that George Lucas doesn't direct the next one, because at this rate, he is doing nothing whatsoever to show that he still is devoted to this series.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pah!,"I'm sorry but I've got say this is absolute rubbish.  I'm a huge fan of episodes 4 to 6 and even liked episode 1 in a weird kind of way, but this is dysmal.Where to start?  Well (and I may get flamed for this), the special effects are so-so - there's so many films now that seem to use CGI as a replacement for good old-fashioned film making - and this is one of them.  Witness the 'bucking bronco' anakin thing, this is on a par with the Mummy Returns (and that's not good).  Come on Hollywood, CGI is no replacement for 'proper' special effects and to me just exemplifies 'lazy' film making.The story was long and drawn out with some magnificently wooden acting - It's takes some director to get crap performances out of Samuel L, Ewan MacG, Natalie Portman et al - but Lucas has managed to do it.In my opinion, I don't think they will EVER recapture the magic of the first 3 (you know what I mean) - they had a faintly ridiculous (and camp) story line, ahead of it's time special effects and some superb characters.  The interplay between Han Solo and Chewbacca creating some stand out moments. Fast forward to this film, and my god, Anakin comes across as being an angst-ridden, whining, spotty teenager - and we're expected to believe he will become the most feared man in the Universe?  Give me a break.  Obi Wan also comes across as being, well, boring and weak - this is the man who fought Darth Vader and was so strong in the force that he was able to guide Luke from beyond the grave - yet a slight cut on his leg in this film almost kills him!In my opinion, they're seriously jeapordizing the whole franchise and spoiling a wonderful film series ...

"STAR WARS IS BACK. I give it 8 out of 10. Considering Ep. 4 (9), Ep. 5 (10) and Ep. 6(8) and Ep.1 (7)","When I saw Episode 1, I was so excited I didn't see its flaws. I still love it but when I see it I can't help to be bothered by Anakin, the Midhiclorians, and the fact there isn't much feeling with all the force and the jedi stuff. But it's still a Star Wars movie, Darth Maul is great, and the way the introduced the Droids is very funny and even nostalgic, and I can't help to be happy every time I see.Now that I've seen Episode 2 I was glad that my pal George Lucas have grown up a little bit. I enjoyed EVERY LITTLE BIT OF IT. The movie is full of inside jokes that ARE the comic relief this time, without needing Jar Jar to make stupid things in order to make us laugh. It's full of action sequences, and MY GOD, MY GOD, YODA KICKS ASS, everybody was JAW DROPPED during that scene. The romantic story is very cliched, sometimes it seems like a tribute to all the classic romantic movies. The acting (as always) is standard, except of course for Yoda who always takes every scene. I didn't hate Hayden Christensen acting, sometimes is really lame, and sometimes he manages to act as the classic teenager confused and arrogant, but he must put more heart if he is going to convince us that he IS Darth Vader in Episode 3.The Best thing is the special effects (as always) and many of the story plots and revelations. I won't tell you what they are, but I bet you will be excited when you find out many of the reasons why the empire got the be the empire and why the Jedi were beaten in the first place.

Better than TPM.......But !,"This installment of Star Wars was much better than Episode I which in my opinion was shockingly average. I still felt that George didn't learn his lesson about over using computer graphics indiscriminately from Episode I. Although the effects were more realistic, it still looked fake during good part of the movie. Plot line is pretty strained it seemed. Too many elements had to be crammed into 2 hrs. So there was no interesting plot development for the story or the characters (although, part about a 7ft tall gray alien cloning human soldiers was an interesting plot twist, and the battle scene between Obi-Wan and the bounty hunter was one of the few excellent scenes in this movie). Another annoying thing was that there was too many of everything on CG shots. Too many buildings, too many flying cars, too many people, too many weapons, too many animals, too many foot soldiers, they filled the screen, but at the end of the day, they all looked the same failing to give the cue that we're in a different place, situation or a planet. Aliens looked fake, which also was true for all non-human Jedi council members.

it was better than Episode 1,"*May Contain Spoilers* Well first, I'll start off with some good news. Jar Jar has taken the role that he so truly deserves, barely in this movie.

I found the story to be intriguing, especially the whole Master Sifa-Dias deal and when i first saw it, I was shocked about the clones which just makes the story better because it shows how this plan was just so methodically played out. The final battles weren't bad while the light saber battles were entertaining, though I have seen better. I think the best light saber battle was with Yoda and Dooku since it showed that he can still battle it out, despite his age.I felt that this movie was good, not great.

"If you hate it, you haven't watched it correctly...","""I prefer to evaluate a film on the basis of what it intends to do, not on what I think it should have done."" - Roger EbertThis is a kids movie first and foremost. If your looking for amazing dialogue, intricate characters and Oscar-worthy performances, then watch Scorsese or Spielberg. Lucas makes fun, unashamed Star Wars movies for the kids. Always has. Instead of listing the many reasons people who love the original trilogy hate the prequels, I will sum it up like this: They were kids when they saw the original trilogy, now they've grown up and forgotten how to have innocent fun at the movies. The original trilogy doesn't have better dialogue, characters or performances. But in their nostalgic minds the originals are infallible. The series is pretty consistent in quality. If it's good enough for the kids, then it's good Star Wars. This film is definitely the weakest of the saga, but it had to be. Transitioning from the exposition (Episode I) to the rising action (The Clone Wars) with a love story that has to be comprehended by children, is not an ideal foundation for a movie.

Not like here. Here everything's soft... and smooth...That is one major malfunction in the Skywalker Ranch. I can excuse the diner scene (which was completely ridiculous in a sci-fi fantasy film) and the absurdity of Dooku's characters and his cartoon side-kicks, but I can not excuse lousy writing.

ILM's(Ind. Light and Magic) TECHNICAL MILESTONE'  this movie is  !!!,"STAR WARS Episode II: Attack Of The Clones .This is the first ""STAR WARS"" movie I had ever seen! I watched a review on this movie on the TV and heard that it has something got more than special effects - ""Extra Special Effects"". ""What're these Extra Special Effects?.............. something more than 'Lord of the Rings', the massive graphics movie?"", I thought ! I also heard of a ""THX"" sound uniquely used in ""Phantom Menace"" . I was really curious to know what was so special in STAR WARS!So, I walked into a theater to watch this movie .By watching the opening style and opening crawl , I thought it's a remix of some old '70s movie (just hated that ugly yellow color in STAR WARS title !!!) ...... got afraid the whole movie'd be a boredom! But,I was wrong!! Nothing could describe how magnificent the ""royal cruiser"" of Senator Amidala was on a 70mm screen! Everything was magnificent from thereon - the senate architecture, the order in the republic, the ordered star ships in the city! One could also note that in no other space movie( viz. Mars Attack or Red Planet or Star Trek) would the planets ( Geonosis , Coruscant)look that massive and real ! Unmatched is the ship-fight among the meteor-like rocks suspended where Jango Fett's chased by Obi Wan ! Two ""seismic charge"" bombs explode shattering all the rocks in its range......that scene was indescribably massive ! What a superb fight the light saber fight between Yoda and Dooku also is !!Yoda : ""Much to learn.......you still have !"" Count Dooku : ""It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided by our ""Knowledge of the Force"".............. but by our skills of the light saber!!""Sound effects used are ""dts"", Dolby surround, SDDS and above all ,a THX certification as well (is that enough?)! The audio is extremely REFINED and PROCESSED.........distinctly superior ! (On listening to the movie on STAR MOVIES by processing my TV sound in a small 2.1 channel surround decoder , I analyzed that )even minute sounds were distinctly audible in TV transmission sound (of STAR MOVIES) !! I feel this movie is a technical milestone for ILM(Industrial Light and Magic) ! The Low Frequency is breathtaking when the ship of Jango Fett takes off after his fight with Obi-Wan Kenobi. The highlight of this movie is the clone war- superb weapons and ships deployed.The clone-war is impressive and breathtaking! All in all this movie incorporates superb special effects....I mean Extra Spl Effects! The guys at ILM still maintain their supremacy in Sci-Fi movies' Spl-Fx! Credits to George Lucas' SFX style......still maintaining his supremacy in special effects through 'Skywalker sound' and 'ILM' . The Arena of Geonosis is a place which I'll remember every day of my life because I felt myself tied as one of the Jedi and Queen about to be executed amidst the Geonisians!! ( The Separatist screaming ""Let The Executions Begin"" outclasses Gladiator and its Roman Execution manner). The SFX would have been still better had the movie been processed on Blade Servers as was Lord Of the Rings done.Despite possessing all this superiority, the movie failed to make it to the top 10 grosses of all time( unlike Harry Potter or Lord Of The Rings episodes)or to create a great impact like Phantom Menace. A parallel release by Spiderman crushed its tread into the top 10 zone. Also, the screenplay of this movie is as that of an art movie and too much of importance for romance between Anakin & Amidala in Naboo. Dialogues are irrelevant in many places. All in all it's a very very good movie technically , a good one on other basis ! It would have been a more memorable experience if I had watched this movie on an IMax screen and in a THX certified theater.........I still dream of watching the movie in IMAX and THX certified theater.

"George Lucas made mistakes, but learnt from old ones","In 1999, the long awaited prequel came out of Star Wars and to many, it disappointed. The film was not like any other Star Wars films, it had the comic relief character of Jar Jar Binks and many overlong scenes like the race scene and the Political Debate.But when this one came out, there was the promise that fans would like this one and it would make up for the first one, but alas, this was not the case as fans still heavily criticized the movie.In my opinion, I thought the movie was A lot better then Episode 1, George Lucas learnt from his mistake of overlong scenes and, to my delight Jar Jar Binks only had a very small cameo in the movie and he only appeared for less then 5 minutes.On the Dark Side of the film, it had too many one liners (I did like the mind reading scene though) and it kind of got boring while leading up to its final conclusion. The film was quite interesting though and it did not take very long for it to get out of its uninteresting slump.I am still yet unsure whether fans don't like the prequels because of heavy expectations, respect to the originals, whether they actually hate the movie or they just want to agree with people and try to make some semi real friends.Overall, this film is a great watch for fans of the original trilogy and to all fans who ACTUALLY hated the Episode 1. I rate this film 73%.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"As Emperor Joesph said, ""Too Many Notes""","When a movie has so many CGI effects that it starts to look like a Playstation video game, you know it's not convincing. This is one of the problems with George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" prequels, and it certainly shows in its middle chapter, ""Attack of the Clones."" The final battle on Planet Geonosis is indicative of this problem, as we watch hordes of Storm Troopers flying in spaceships blasting away at the enemy's spherical vehicles, resulting in bright, fluorescent explosions. It was just too much for my senses to take in. Models and puppets were far more interesting to watch than this.The plot, unfortunately, also suffers from the same problem of the special effects: to many things going on at once that the audience can't keep up. Lucas should definitely have hired a brilliant screenwriter to cut away the byzantine political intrigues and tortuous plot turns that hamper the action and flow of the movie. Lucas should have stuck to a more linear and straightforward plot line that followed in the footsteps of the original ""Star Wars"" movies. A talented writer could have made the prequels truly epic and worth the hundreds of millions that they made.The acting, in contrast to the storyline and special effects, was rather dull. Hayden Christensen, as ""Annie"" Skywalker, seemed rather bored with his role as the main protagonist. Natalie Portman, as beautiful as she is to behold on the screen, is also deadpan and flat as Anakin's love interest, Queen Amidala. The chemistry fails to fizzle, and, as many others have commented, Lucas simply did not write good dialogue for the love scenes between Anakin and Amidala. Ewan McGregor is a fairly better actor than either, and does fine as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but is not as good as he would be in the final ""Star Wars"" movie, ""Revenge of the Sith."" We hardly see any of Ian McDiarmand as the Evil Emperor, so we miss his potential as a compelling villain. One bright note is Christopher Lee as Count Dokoo. He seems a bit deadpan, but his magisterial British accent and snide sneers at a captive Obi-Wan Kenobi are fun to watch. Thankfully, Lucas took a hint and cut the execrable Jar Jar Binks character to nothing more than limited cameos. A few good scenes include the speeder chase in Coruscant and the arena battle with the computer-generated monsters, which seem like a direct homage to Ray Harryhausen's creations. The latter brought a melancholy hint of nostalgia to me, as it seems fantasy movies have declined rapidly since Harryhausen's day.This movie is nowhere near as brilliant as ""Empire Strikes Back,"" the best overall ""Star Wars"" movie; ""Return of the Jedi,"" which had the best settings and special effects; or ""Star Wars,"" the original, with brilliant acting by Alec Guinness and Harrison Ford. In short, ""Attack of the Clones"" is a baroque, garish light show which has little to recommend to it save for a few choice, disconnected scenes. It's not too terrible, but it's not that good, either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Horrible, Overdone, Pathetic, and above all else predictable.","People are praising this film as the greatest thing since the invention of the movie projector.  I'm sorry you want a great film watch ON THE WATERFRONT, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, THE GODFATHER, THE GODFATHER PART II, or even THE MATRIX.  This film is horrible.  Here's why.First off someone needs to send Hayden Christensen to an acting school. Too bad Lee Strasburg is dead because anything he would have told this kid would have been a MASSIVE improvement.   This ""actor's"" (I used the term very loosely) idea of rage comes off as more of a ""hissy fit"" or five-year old temper tantrum.  His idea of sadness takes so much away from the emotional impact that some scenes are supposed to have.  Most notably when he goes back to Tattoine.  I cannot blame him 100% as much as I would like too however.The dialogue is awful!  I swear if I heard Obi say ""My young padawon.""  I would have KILLED HIM TOO!  Annakin got some of the world dialogue portraying him more like the ""spoiled rich kid"" arrogant punk type that you just want to smack around and say ""SHUT UP!""  The dialogue and the script make the ""love story"" seem something like some really bad teenaged chick flick than a serious movie.The Story:  Okay this could have been good but unfortunately it's predictable (which I can't really fault anyone for) but Lucas writes the Jedi Knights to be the DUMBEST order in history.  Homer Simpson's StoneCutters order would have been one up on these guys.  If there was a competent military commander on EITHER side this war would have never started.  The forshadowing is lame, odvious, and comes off poorly.  And the Stormtroopers/Clones well lets just say Boba-Fett has a reason to work for the Empire in Episode V.Editing:  Some scenes needed to be longer and two scenes could have been shortened by about 4 minutes apiece.The good:  The Special Effects and Yoda.  This one lacks a serious ""back guy"" like Darth Maul was in Episode I.  HELL JAR-JAR-BINKS WAS BETTER IN THIS ONE!

Sand...,"What is worse, Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones? This question has plagued my mind since finishing Episode 2. Both have redeeming qualities, but they are also highly flawed. The story in Attack of the Clones is more coherent than Episode 1, but the acting and dialogue are painful.The foreshadowing and character depth, specifically with Anakin, is excellent. Though immature and whiney, the viewer is able to (somewhat) understand his fall to the dark side. From Obi-Wan's constant belittling compliments ""well done, my very young apprentice"" to his personal tragedy on Tatooine, it is reasonable to see why Anakin is so moody. The kneeling moment over the grave is one of the best scenes in the movie and Anakin's pain is truly felt. Unfortunately, the dialogue makes all these heartbreaking moments seem shallow. From the sand monologue to his temper tantrum about Obi-Wan being jealous, all of Anakin's emotional depth is undermined by a poor script and mediocre acting.The action sequences had a few standouts. The colosseum scene is memorable, the battle with Count Dooku (from all three opponents) is solid and I really did enjoy Yoda with a lightsaber. Every Star Wars movie has a killer third act, and this one is no different.The biggest problem with this story is on the central romantic relationship. How in the world does Padme fall for Ani? Is it the trauma that she sees? Is it his chiseled looks? Is it the fact that he's fascist bad boy? Honestly, I could watch this movie 100 times and not understand their relationship. I don't know what's worse, flirting and long-staring Anakin or Jar Jar Binks.To answer the question, is this movie worse than Episode 1? Yes, yes it is. This has been the most painful Star Wars to watch. There are moments of re-watchability, but as a whole, the film is lackluster.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
How a trilogy masterpiece turns into an ordinary blockbuster.,"Star Wars is the very first movie I saw in a theater when it was released in 1977. The movie is really my first cinematic experience and since then I am a Star Wars fan. The movie became mythical with the Empire strikes back (1980) and the Return of the Jedi (1983). But then the myth was not resurrected with The Phantom Menace. The Attack of the Clones seems to be George Lucas second attempt to resurrect the legend created 25 years ago. Let's try not to be lenient and understand why this second attempt is in fact a second failure.This prequel (The Attack of the Clones) starts 10 years after the Episode 1 and is built around 3 major dynamics: - A love story between Anakin Skywalker who has become the `arrogant' Padawan (Jedi apprentice) of the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and shares a forbidden love with Padme Amidala who has given up her throne for a senate seat. - A political intrigue: A mysterious separatist movement (born in Phantom Menace) and led by Count Dooku is threatening to start a civil war and to rebel against the Republic. - Finally, we witness the beginning of Anakin turning towards the Dark side of the Force.The scenario in `Attack of the Clones' has some inconsistency but is still very decent and overall in line with the Star Wars heritage. This scenario is very well supported by the special effects, which I have to admit are among the best yet in the Star Wars saga. Some of the scenes are amazing. To note the very well built and beautifully shot scene when Obi-Wan lands on the clone planet and then meet the cloners as well as Jango Fet who served as a model for the clone army. Also the space hunt when Jango Fet is planing to reach Geonosis, while Obi-Wan is tracking him down is just a formidable piece of work. However Episode II demonstrates that fantastic special effects and a bunch of well built and well shot scenes are not enough to resurrect a Myth, not even to do a good movie.1. The first point and the least important is that Attack of the Clones has too many characters. Each of them has very little to say. As a result none of the characters has real depth. The movie is already 2 hours and 23 minutes long, therefore it was practically impossible to have strong personality/charismatic characters displaying a full range of feelings and emotions on screen; as a consequence and almost from the beginning the movie characters turn out very much flat. 2. The flatness of the characters is (I believe) not the only mistake in `Attack of the Clones' and sometimes the structure of the movie, meaning length and choice of scenes seems to me very wrongly thought through and often lacks of imagination. As an example the chase of the terrorist in the beginning of the movie if, I acknowledge is very well done, I also think is way too long comparing to the length of the whole movie. From a scene choice stand point Anakin Skywalker is suppose to show his dark side when his mum dies in his arms but we don't really see him turning to the dark side since George Lucas decided not to show us Anakin's cruelty annihilating the entire tribe of the sand people. It seems to me that such a scene would have been much more essential (and not necessarily gory) than watching him riding his cheesy `motorbike'. The battle scene when the clones eventually attack is very well done (from a computer generated picture standpoint) but remains very much confusing. Not to mention the lack of strategy (at least in the shown scenes) which is flabbergasting and below the standard of `The Empire strikes back' in which we had an idea of what the strategy from both side was. Finally Samuel L. Jackson closing slowly on Count Dooku on the balcony of the arena made me think of `Conan the Barbarian' when Conan is carefully walking on Thulsa Doom at the end of the movie. And you know what, Mace Windu chopped off the head of Jango Fet as Conan the head of the villain. I thought that George Lucas had more imagination than that(come on !!!). 3. That brings me to one of the main problem of the movie: `acting'. Sorry for all the lovers of Natalie Portman (Padme Amidala) but she is so stiff and her play so wooden that C-3PO and R2-D2 seem to be more human than she is. When Natalie Portman falls out of the chopper like ship when trying to capture Count Dooku a clone soldier comes to her asking if she's hurt and all of a sudden after a crappy statement she is completely fine back on the chase(Nooo). More than that I don't see love during love scenes, I don't see passion during passionate scenes, she looks a little bit `teenagy' during the action scene, the only credit goes to the cameraman as well as her make-up artist who really make her look very good and even gorgeous sometimes. Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) is not a mature actor and does not embody the `Jedi Spirit' that Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) carried in `The Return of the Jedi'. His love looks fake when he talks to and looks at Padme. His sadness looks fake when his mother dies. His anger looks fake when he explains how he wiped out the sand people tribe. And he is lacking of energy when he fights with the lightsaber. Samuel L. Jackson (master Mace Windu) can not really do something with the little he has to say. Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Christopher Lee (Count Dooku) are doing a decent job. The best actor of all is Yoda (Frank Oz voice) who is a computer generated character (come on !!!???). 4. Bad acting is not only the actors fault: Dialog/script is the second major problem in this movie. We saw that the characters don't have much to say but on the top of it what they say is pitiful. That was one of the strength of Star Wars trilogy (mystical dialog, good sense of humor). Here the dialogs are set up as for a drama play (this is a motion picture not a play in a Theater!).  I am passing on the love scene script (remember the story of the coarse sand), which is really poor but even the confrontation's scene are awful with no imagination, so flat and sometimes ridiculous. For instance when Anakin talks to Padme about Obi-Wan: `It's all Obi-Wan's fault! He's jealous. He's holding me back!' (what kind of reaction is that???) or Obi-Wan and Dooku: `I will never join you Dooku!' (come on, don't play it like in a Shakespeare play!!!). 5. My final point and to my opinion the most important one is that the prequel does not convey the mysticism that the trilogy is all about. The `Force' appears to be just a tagline `may the force be with you' and (just like a bad advertising line). The bad guy (count Dooku) is not that scary, and the Jedis are not very wise. Some scenes are not consistent with the trilogy for example when Obi-Wan entered Count Dooku's fortress, he is not detected by Dooku who is suppose to have mastered the force and should have sense a disturbance (remember the Trilogy). Where is the fear, where is the thrill, where is the feeling of power/weakness, and where is the feeling of destiny/fate?George Lucas said that he did not do `The Attack of the Clone' (and `The Phantom Menace') for the fans. I can understand this statement even if the very reason he can do `The Attack of the Clones' it's because of those very fans. Maybe each generation has its own movie. Maybe Star Wars Trilogy belongs to the 80s whereas Episode I and II to the `new millennium'. That might be the explanation, but I thought that George Lucas did re-invest his own money to build his own movie in order to escape the dictatorship of Hollywood. However what he delivers is a typical Hollywood blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Feel the Force!,"Star Wars Episode II was released in 2002 and is a great edition to the Star Wars Saga. Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christen shine as the films stars although all the actors deliver strong performances. Episode II as Episode I is visually stunning with great special effects. Episode II also has great fight scenes like Obi-Wan vs. Jango Fett and the area scene, and of course Count Dooku is a great villain. We also finally get to see Yoda fight in a amazing battle. This movie is fantastic when you watch this movie you feel the force! Episode 2 was also nominated for an Oscar and is number 17 on the all time U.S. box office. Despite Episode 2's greatness it is still slightly underrated. I give Episode II a 9.0 out of 10 which is 2 points higher than IMDb's 7.0.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not quite the worst,"This is not the worst ""Star Wars"" movie. That would be ""Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" simply because it's impossible to ignore how irritating Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd are. ""Attack of the Clones"" isn't very superior to ""Phantom Menace,"" but at least Jar Jar only has a cameo.As it is, this is a very unbalanced film. The action scenes are superb. There's a spectacular chase through the city-planet Coruscant in flying cars, a battle in an asteroid field, Ben Kenobi versus Jango Fett, and a colossal land battle between the Jedi, their clone army, and a horde of assorted battle droids. If you can overlook the flat CGI nature of most of this, it's great fun. The only action scene that doesn't work is a sequence on the assembly line of a robot factory, because it's unnecessary and exactly like a level in every video game ever made.So that was the good part. The bad part is that the middle third of the film is almost entirely given over to a romance between Anakin Skywalker and Padme, played respectively by Hayden Christiensen and Natalie Portman. I can ignore the shallow acting in the action scenes, because it matches the Flash Gordon-serial quality of the whole thing, but the romance depends entirely on its actors, and it falls flat. We know they'll fall in love and produce Luke and Leia, so it's a bit of a fait accompli with no energy in the writing.The best way to watch this is with a book in hand, so you can mute the TV during the romantic twaddle, and come back for the good bits. If you let yourself enjoy the eye candy and don't expect anything truly rewarding or memorable, you'll have a good time. As the middle section of a trilogy that was already fairly redundant, ""Attack of the Clones"" serves to set up the next film, but doesn't really have much meat of its own.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Better than the first prequel,"Lucas's first prequel let audiences down due to the lack of characterization and good dialogue. This one is much the same but the battle scenes are more exciting and the story is starting to emerge in its connection to the originals. The battle scenes are fun to watch and the romance scenes on Naboo are great, but the characters are simply not as inspired as the first trilogy. The film seems personal but the characters seem rather impersonal. Some of this is good and some is dull, but Lucas does manage to keep us wanting for his third installment somehow. I hope it will be better than the first two films in the prequel trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Chinless George strikes back,"I have this vision of what George Lucas must be like as a director. It's 4 in the morning, the lights are hot, everyone is wearing too many robes, and have been doing the same scene for 22 hours straight. Sam Jackson looks like he's about to pop a cap in someone's arse, but he's trying to be cool, look centred and all Jedi -- like in the last scenes of Pulp Fiction.George has no where to go. Unmarried geek freak, he's capable of making money but never getting a stone's throw near actual art. ""Okay people, one more time...and remember, more VIDEO GAME."" It's not hard now, when lines too pedestrian to even laugh at are recited for the tenth, twelfth, twentieth time. Samuel L. Jackson has transitioned: from the mushroom cloud layin mutha, to all the dramatic power of a sleepy janitor leaning on his broom at the end of his shift.I wonder if fans at Star Wars conventions will hold contests, to recite lines from this film with less feeling than the original actors. ""That's possible..."" is my favourite line (Jackson); though most any of Portman's and any of Christensen's will do. I won't say much about teen-Vader, his performance speaks for itself -- I can't fathom why an actual actor wasn't hired. Whatever the case, this film does make an excellent text for authors on how NOT to write dialogue.Star Wars was never particularly impressive under close scrutiny. It's science fiction without science; general consumption space-opera. It works with plot, with character, with action. That Joseph Campbell informed mythopoetic tradition is nowhere to be found in this film. Under the thumb of toddler TV direction, it becomes tedious and silly. Characters do not bleed, their hair does not ruffle in the strongest wind. No one vomits over the outrageously distasteful subplot with teen-Vader openly lusting over a woman who helped raise him. When confronted, the princess tells him ""it makes me uncomfortable."" It makes EVERYONE uncomfortable!What force does Lucas wield that allows him to wring all of the life out of even the best of actors? To stray so far from entertainment, or good taste? Perhaps he is a clone....",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Watchable as a Star Wars film, but that's it","POSITIVES:1) I like the character of Count Dooku a lot, Christopher Lee adds necessary gravitas to the role and, ultimately, Count Dooku is right about everything. He is the only character other than Sidious that knows the truth about the Emperor and his plot. The fact that he tells this to Obi Wan and tries to get the two of them to join forces is very interesting
2) Anakin's mother dying, as he had foreseen, followed by him slaughtering the sand people is actually a strong and dark part of the film. Also, it plays a lot into Anakin's turn in the next film
3) Honestly, that's pretty much it as far as positives go. But because it is a part of the Star Wars franchise you can watch it as such and get some enjoyment out of it that wayNEGATIVES:1) The CGI is even more prevalent in this film and it's terrible
2) The love dialogue between Anakin and Padmé is the worst of any film ever made
3) The storyline of Jedi Master Syfo Dias creating the clone army is never touched upon again so why bring it up in the first place?
4) I don't fully blame Hayden Christensen for this but it is undeniable that Anakin just comes across as a creepy and whiny brat for the entire film; not anywhere near as menacing as the future Vader should be",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A GREAT improvement on ""The Phantom Menace"".","""The Phantom Menace"" was, without a doubt, the worst Star Wars movie, but it still wasn't bad. ""Attack of the Clones"" is MUCH better. Let's list the reasons, shall we? 1- It has MUCH more action, partly because it has the beginning of the Clone Wars. 2- The romance angle, although not as good as Han & Leia's, does what it is meant to do. 3- Obi-Wan goes on a detective spree! Yay! Go Obi-Wan! 4- Not to much Jar Jar Binky! Yes! 5- The visuals! Go visuals! But there are a few flaws. 1- One of the things that made Han & Leia's romance interesting was that it had not much kissy kissy goo goo stuff in it. But Anakin & Padme's does. 2- In this movie, Anakin, like Luke, gets his arm chopped off. When it is cut off, he shows no sign of pain other than a barely audible ""ugh"". 3- Another problem with the romance angle. Anakin is 19. Padme is 24. I'll leave you to figure out what's gross and disgusting about that. 4- Even though he's better than Jake Lloyd (Jake played Anakin in Episode 1, and seemed to be bored in his role. In fact, when I watch him, it makes Jabba the Hutt look like Ob-Wan), Hayden Christensen is awful and thus, he is Gayden Christensen among fans. Overall, I good Star Wars movie I recommend, but still not like the Originals. Watch it if you feel like it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's not terrible per se, but I still found it fairly enjoyable.","After the dog-poo experience that was TPM, I reserved any expectations when I first saw it on opening day sometime in '02. Just don't ask me why.OK, anyway on to the review. Having just seen it again on video I gotta say that although I ""liked it"" at least it wasn't as bad as the TPM, but it's still plagued by a bare-bones plot, wooden acting and writing, plot holes and too much special effects. Despite being the second prequel which is SUPPOSED to show the rise of the clone army and showing the creation of said army, it just feels like nothing actually happening. And lets not forget those god-awful cringe-inducing CHEESY ""romantic"" scenes between Anakin and Padme. Anakin and Padme sittin' in a tree, kiss...oh who the HELL CARES when it's so DOWNRIGHT CORNY!!! I do give the film some credit though that chase scene at the beginning ripped off The Fifth Element (a MUCH SUPERIOR FILM than TPM and AOTC) I admit the fight between Ben Kenobi and Jango Fett on Kamino and in space, the arena-style battle on Genoisis, and the lightsaber duel near the end were fun to watch. The creature designs, spaceships, and planets are impressive; a shame they did little to cover up the glaring problems of the whole piece.What I don't understand is since Lucas obviously isn't a good writer and directer and having labored himself so heavily to try to make AOTC perfect, why didn't he just hire Irvin Kershner, Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett to write and direct AOTC (or even PM)?!?!? Sheesh, there are some things even Lucas can't swallow.When the reviews poured in from various media outlets and word-of-mouth when AOTC was released, I wholeheartedly agreed with them. The first two prequels just weren't well made. None of the magic and intrigue of the originals is here. Sad to say but the series already wore out its welcome after AOTC.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent!,"I unlie 99.9999% of the planet have not gotten around to seeing the original series. It was something that just never caught my interest until the first Prequel came out.

Now I understand! This film was excellent and undoubtedly the biggest surprise of the year to date.John Williams's ""Love Theme"" is perhaps the most beautiful piece of music he's ever composed. This film in no way parallels the first. Many doors are opened. The pacing in the first film was so slow it was painful and there was practically no information about anyone given. Here Anakin is a rounded character and the pace is unrelenting and we're constantly thinking but never bored.This film is thoroughly enjoyable on all levels the two storylines both Obi-Wan's and Anakins are constructed beautifully and converge perfectly.

Needs better direction,"George Lucas rendered a good science fiction movie a confusing mess. He succeeded in bringing out the worst in most of his actors, notable exceptions being the robots, Jar Jar Binx and Bobba Fett.  The wooden readings, considering the history of the actors clearly a product of the direction, ruin the movie.  The terrible scriptings of the romantic scenes rob them of romance and any semblance of credibility, making it impossible to forget the scripted age difference (what is this 30year- old doing with an obnoxious 18year-old?).

Off the Rails,"This is it. This is the worst film in the ""Star Wars"" franchise. I said it. Worse than ""The Phantom Menace."" Worse than ""The Rise of Skywalker."" For either of those movies' faults (and believe me, there are plenty), neither of them compare to the sheer amount of asinine and unbelievable crap that George Lucas crammed into ""Attack of the Clones."" I spoke rather highly of ""The Phantom Menace"" because I feel like it receives too much unjustified hate from fans. I ended up giving that movie a score of 7. But make no mistake, between the boring build up of the plot, the awkward romance butchered by Lucas's screenwriting and Hayden Christensen's acting, and the dumpster fire of a schlocky, explosive, and anti-climactic finale: this one takes the cake.The main two problems with ""The Phantom Menace"", in my opinion, were the pacing and tone of the story, and Jar Jar's annoying attempts to act as comedic relief. Fortunately, Jar Jar has been toned down drastically in this one, probably in response to heavy criticism from the previous film. Unfortunately, other problems take the place of Jar Jar. The use of computer graphics was sort of a novelty that Lucas employed and tested the waters with in the first movie. He cranks it up to 11 in this one. Entire battles are fought solely in CGI, and these effects have aged so poorly. It honestly looks like a modern Pixar movie. Yoda (Frank Oz) fights and flips around like a circus monkey in such a hysterical and comedic way, diminishing the character from his status as the small-in-stature, wise-in-years hermit that we knew from the original films.As for the pacing and tone, Lucas has again outdone himself. I said that ""The Phantom Menace"" was the prequel film that was most similar to the originals. ""Attack of the Clones"" adds one of the most awkward and forced romances in the history of movies into the mix. George Lucas was never known as being a great screenwriter. Even going back to the original ""Star Wars"", actor Alec Guinness said that the dialogue was terrible. So Lucas attempting, for the first time, to take a stab at romance dialogue is just painful to watch. It's honestly like watching a terrible romantic comedy. I get that this kind of stuff is supposed to set us up for Anakin's fall to the dark side in the next movie, but there is just way too much of an emphasis on the romance aspect. What Lucas should have done was just pair them together during intense action scenes. Get them together in a way that was human and believable, like with Leia and Han in the original movies: over the course of the trilogy. Instead, all of the romance is crammed into the middle movie.This one's only worth it if you want to watch through the entire saga. The rather easy corrections that could have been made from ""The Phantom Menace"" have ballooned, and Lucas was then forced to cram all of the Darth Vader development stuff into the last movie. ""Attack of the Clones"" trashes the entire prequel trilogy. The reason I give it a 6 is the fact that it does include some fun action sequences, Ewan McGregor is great once again, and the John Williams score is fantastic, as always.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror...,"Rather than listen to the desperate pleas of millions of Star Wars fans worldwide, George Lucas ploughs ahead with Attack of the Clones in precisely the same manner that made The Phantom Menace a disappointment of star destroyer proportions: there's even more boring political subterfuge, even more dreadful CGI, even more ridiculous OTT action sequences (worst bits being Obi Wan and Anakin in pursuit of an assassin and the very silly droid factory sequence), and even more bloody Jar Jar Binks!!And if all that doesn't make you want to hurl yourself into the nearest available Sarlacc pit in a fit of despair, then the badly written, poorly acted, sappy burgeoning romance between Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala will probably do the trick.About the only things that Lucas does right are to cast Hayden Christensen as the now-grown up Anakin, because his lousy acting perfectly complements the wooden performance given by Jake Lloyd in TPM, and to get Natalie Portman out of those bloody stupid queen outfits and into something a little sexier—I'm not particularly a fan of Ms. Portman, finding her to be 'classically pretty' rather than smoking hot, but I have to admit that she does look rather delicious in her tight white outfit with impossibly toned midriff on display.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The weakest of the trilogy,"In my opinion Attack of the Clones is the weakest movie in the prequel trilogy and the worse Star Wars movie we've had to date, if you discount the Holiday Special.Not because it had any single element in it that was just awful, like Jar Jar or Saint Ani the Precocious, but because it just fails as a basic movie experience. The plot jumps around too much, the characters are the least interesting thing in the whole movie and the middle part syndrome of storytelling hits it quite badly. You've already established the characters in the first film, yet the big climax has to wait until the third. So what else is there to be done except character building. And the movie is awful at that, as already stated.I think that the biggest problem has to be that there is absolutely no chemistry between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, playing Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, respectively. This is supposed to be something huge. A romance that tore the galaxy apart and doomed the entire Jedi Order, yet it feels exactly like what it is. Two young adults, teenagers quite honestly, falling to their hormones. Oh yeah, that has Star Wars written all over it. And I could buy that, possibly, if I could even buy the fact that these two even like each other. But they don't. Especially Padmé spends most of the film being visibly annoyed by Anakin, which I'm not sure was the intention. I think Portman simply had problems with the role, which is a shame because she can be really good in the right movie. I'm also annoyed that Padmé was reduced to this from the tough infiltrating, gun-toting, droid-destroying badass that she was in the first film.But there is some good stuff as well. I still like Ewan McGregor a lot as younger Obi-Wan Kenobi. He has some hokey scenes as well, but I think I'm more inclined to blame the script rather than him in this case. Because in most scenes his dry wit is the only thing holding those scenes together. And naturally we have Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who effortlessly hits just the right amount of over the top to remind us of the original trilogy. Because those weren't serious film, not really. They were deep enough to be taken seriously, but their tone was that of an adventure, of myth.Plus, the special effects are still awesome, even today. The music is very, very good. And it's actually very cool to see the original stormtroopers. Kudos for that.But, when it comes down to it, it's only an average movie at best. It has some really good elements in it, but it also has some really bad ones.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002),"Five movies in, and I think I've finally come to my definitive least favorite of the series. It's not bad, per say, just underwhelming, although it does have an better plot than The Phantom Menace. In Attack of the Clones, the Galactic Republic is on the brink of civil war when several planetary system threaten to secede under the leadership of rogue Jedi Count Dooku. An assassination attempt is made on Senator Padme Amidala, so Anakin Skywalker is tasked with protecting her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi goes to investigate. Luckily, Episode II did deliver on my hope from Episode I in that the plot moves considerably forward, and some of the more notable characters are given more screen time (or less in Jar Jar's case, thank god). Padme and Anakin have a romantic subplot that I didn't mind, and Obi-Wan is always fun to watch, but I thought Anakin's character was much more interesting in this movie. There was quite a bit of foreshadowing of Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader that put the prequels into a better context and made Anakin more intriguing. It'd be nice if Hayden Christensen wasn't so awful in his role. Attack of the Clones does succumb to middle-chapter problems at times. There wasn't anything as memorable as the Darth Maul battle in The Phantom Menace or the speeder bike chase in Return of the Jedi. The fight between Yoda and Count Dooku is pretty cool at first, but watching a little green alien jump around like Sonic got old after a while. Attack of the Clones is still just as entertaining and fun as the other Star Wars movies, even if it's one of the weaker entries.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I think Lucas has learned the Jedi Mind trick,"How else would he have managed to convince the world at large this is any good. The special effects were amazing but we expect that by now, the action scenes were good but once again they always are, the acting was so non-existent I don't think the actors could have been trying, The dialogue was sub-standard even for Lucas and the story was weak. Lucas clearly set out to impress the fans by including R2-D2 and C3PO in much bigger roles even though this throws up huge plot holes like why do none of the characters from the original trilogy remember encountering these droids who help them save the universe, it appears Lucas doesn't realize that you can't make a prequel unless it makes sense of the original in the same way you can't have a sequel that doesn't make sense of the film it follows on from.

3rd Best Movie in the Star Wars Saga,"Attack of the Clones is the Best effort by George Lucas since Empire Strikes back. In fact, in my opinion, it comes pretty close to Episode IV and V. The only problem was the ""love story"" aspect. The unfortunate part is that is an integral part of the movie (storyline), so I know it had to be done. Hayden Christensen (I think that is how you spell it) does an UNBELIEVABLE job as Anakin aka Darth Vader.

Silly triteness spoils the technical effort,"I had the luxury of seeing this film in apparently one of the only theatres playing it digitally in Toronto.  Had I NOT seen it in the digital theatre, there would have been absolutely NO redeeming value to my having seen it at all!The acting made me want to cringe - and, although I have heard much about George Lucas's specific decisions to film the romance segments in what he considered to be an old-fashioned ""Golden Era of Hollywood"" style (quotation not actually a quotation of his, but essentially equivalent to something he said to that effect), it simply comes across as weak writing, poor direction, and, I'm sorry to say it to all those fans of Hayden Christensen (and I must admit that I have NOT seen him in Life as a House), poor execution on the part of the actors (specifically Christensen and Natalie Portman).  Not to say Portman isn't beautiful - she is, and that certainly makes for something good to look at.  But THAT, my friends, is essentially the epitome of this experience - a beautiful film to LOOK at - especially digitally (although I have not seen it projected on film, so I cannot say for sure whether it is better one way or the other, but what I saw WAS really smooth) - and that's it!But SO MANY lines, especially near the beginning of the film, just made me want to cringe!  I couldn't believe my ears!  The writing was just so poor! It's such a shame... I don't know... I have never been the biggest Star Wars fan, and perhaps this IS up to standards for the Star Wars films, but if it is, I'll have to re-assess my opinion of the Star Wars films!I read an article lately that had the opinion that the new films aren't as good simply because they do not have a character like Harrison Ford's Han Solo (PRE-Special Edition Greedo-shoots-first edit) - something to do with the edginess (and Harrison Ford-ness, I would say!)of his character, or something!  Well, I don't know if this is altogether true: Anakin, of course, has a ""dark side,"" although it is marked by a whiny-ness that Solo never had!  But SOMETHING is missing in the new series.  Be it STORY or ACTING, or simply the fact that it is, by definition, a PREquel first of all (already setting it at a disadvantage), and second of all, it is directed by a director who had not directed a single film between the original Star Wars and Episode I!  Why was The Empire Strikes Back such a success?  Many continue to say it was due to the presence of Irvin Kershner as director, and that there were huge fights between Kershner and Lucas.  Well, I don't know if this is true, but if Kershner did challenge Lucas, and what we see in Empire is the result of such a challenge, it certainly paid off, and maybe that is exactly what this new series needs: someone to stand up to Lucas, and FIGHT him!  Not physically, but with the guts to tell him that what he is doing is WRONG, and his product is simply POOR!  There is a rumour that nobody at Lucasfilm says ""no"" to George Lucas.  Well someone ought to -- maybe that's what it would take to at least allow the third movie to make up for the previous two!  How CAN he get better if no one is willing or prepared to give him the news?  And if he HAS listened to negative reviews, it's important to realize that somewhere along the line even the MOST creative people need to accept some input!  Someone really ought to say something to him... or else the third movie will be just as bad as the last two!

The Force is draining.,"The big question on everyone's lips is could George return from the immature `Phantom' to the traditional and powerful space opera the world had fallen in love with. The short answer is no, `Attack of the Clones' does not live in the shadow of Episode 1, but it fails to deliver. It is basically a children's film and it will most likely please in that respect, but to the more mature moviegoer, it will leave you wholly unsatisfied.Cutting to the chase the overall basic plot is actually pretty good and `cool' in a fan sense, but the dialogue and attention to detail is completely pathetic. I moaned and groaned with every word during the love sequences between Anakin and Padme, which resulted in a totally unbelievable love between the two characters. Several scenes could have been cut without any trouble and several others shortened, Lucas seems to have devoted his screen time to the useless and left the key dramatic scenes to your own imagination. There is a sequence towards the end of the film where Anakin descends into a mad rage, it is probably the height of the films emotion and could of saved it except the scene only received a mere minute of screen time.Which brings me to the screenplay, probably the films worst aspect. George is a visual storyteller and even in `Phantom' his skills in this area were very evident. This time round however there is almost nothing notable about the film as a visual entity. A highflying chase sequence at the start of the film and a few small scenes shoved in here and there satisfy in terms of visual appeal, but overall the scene construction is very poor. There is also nothing notable about the cinematography, which must have been a lost art on this film. It is very hard to do this job when the majority of the actors and sets are placed in the scene after shooting. Several individual shots were so awful that they alone interrupted the flow of the film and distracted my attention.To top it all off the Direction was again, like `Phantom' completely non-existent. There is nothing to suggest that George has done anything more than tell his actors to stand in front of the camera and read the cue cards. The characters were already life-less in the script, but good direction can save them, the actors do a commendable job trying to bring life to them but ultimately George does not seem to have put in an effort. Obi-Wan and C-3PO steal the film and are reminders of what we loved about the original trilogy, Anakin too gives us a great scene when he reveals to Padme that he slaughtered the Sand People, overall however it is far too little to save the film.As usual the visual effects are pretty good, however the film feels far less `real' than the original trilogy. Digital technology still has a long way to go before it can ultimately suspend disbelief. My major problem in this area would have to be that natural motion of living animals and humans is still not convincing in digital form and distracts from the action on screen.My final thought is again on the films construction, which overall skips all the build-up, all the dramatic tension and jumps straight to the action. Unfortunately for George, half the fun is getting there and when the battle sequence suddenly happened at the end of the film, there was no feeling, emotion or tension to release. I was never breathing heavily, gripping my seat, gasping, feeling the force at all and it left me completely unsatisfied. I am sure the ""fans"" will love it, although I honestly used to be one until now. It is clear George is betting on the ""fans"" forking out for the new film and all its merchandise out of pure religious devotion, and he is probably on the money or rolling in it for that matter. I doubt we will ever get another `Star Wars', but God how we all want one!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Oh, so close!","What's not to like about this film? It's compelling, centering on a great political struggle and the unmasking of a galactic conspiracy. It looks terrific, with very good effects and imagery. There's plenty of action with great light sabre duels, aerial dog-fights, and a huge land battle. It even has the poignant blossoming of young love. What else could you want?Answer: A better script, more believable dialog, and (sadly) a different director. The performances given by most of the cast of EPISODE II are so wooden, so stilted, they significantly detract from the enjoyment of the film. The ""fireplace scene,"" for example, between Anakin and Amidala is comically bad. One cannot help wonder that perhaps with a different script and a different director, the entire love story angle of EPISODE II might have had more realism and thus, more emotional impact.It seems as George Lucas becomes more adept at creating incredible imaginary vistas and creatures, he becomes less skillful at handling real actors and producing real moments from them. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are no hacks. They've been incredible in other films. And yet, give them a George Lucas script and George Lucas direction and they turn into pieces of lumber. Sad.EPISODE II has much going for it. With little more life in the script, we may be talking about one of the best of the STAR WARS series. Alas, it was not to be. This isn't a terrible film, in fact if you get past the aforementioned flaws, it's quite a yarn.

Entertaining action film,"Following Star Wars 1, Anakin is played by a different actor, but is still ridiculously annoying!However, that aside, there are good bits that are very entertaining: I found Mace Windu (Samuel Jackson) to be brilliant in the film (his purple lightsaber was a personal request of Jackson's so he could find himself in the large battle, and because purple is his favorite color), and Christopher Lee played yet another brilliant ""baddie"" (loved him in LOTR as well, shame they cut his scene in RotK). The lightsaber battles in the prequel trilogy were much more entertaining to me than the ones in the original trilogy (although VaderVSLuke is still my fav!)I said the same with Phantom Menace: worth watching at least once",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A strictly personal attempt to point out the good and bad things about Episode II :,"Let me start by saying that judging Star Wars is a though call. One half of humanity would gladly see you digested by the pit-monster from episode VI if you dare to say one bad thing about it? apart from ""the dialog will never live up to Shakespeare"". The other half would like to see the first half digested for maintaining their support to a mindless superficial franchise.THE GOOD Attack of the Clones (AOTC) stands somewhere in the middle between the original trilogy and the 21st century-styled colourful look of The Phantom Menace (TPM). It succeeds rather well in combining the polished tabloids of modern CGI with the grim atmosphere of the seventies. Whereas TPM relied too much on weak humour and philosophical talk, AOTC has largely reduced the intentional laughs to the traditional buddy comedy between 3CPO and R2D2 and replaced it with a number of solid action scenes. In chronological order: an entertaining high-speed chase through the higher levels of Coruscant, a showoff between Obi-WAn and the bounty hunter which nicely combines light sabers and conventional laser weapons, a composite battle between Jedi/clones & droids & a classic showdown between the villain and the primary heroes of the play.The ""Jedi battle"" deserves a special mentioning as it continues the gradual display of Jedi fighting power throughout the series. We started off with the senior Obi-Wan and the unexperienced Luke Skywalker. The Only one to reveal a glimpse of a trained Jedi's fighting skills was Darth Vader, but he couldn't release his full potential without depriving the audience of good guys, hehe. TPM gave us the first combat between healthy, well-trained Jedi. AOTC takes it one step further. Although some think politics are out of place in Star WArs, AOTC does manage to put the rise of the Empire more clearly with a minimal amount of senatorial dispute. Besides, the movie as a whole establishes more connections to the later events of the original trilogy than TPM, which got me stuck on the discovery of Anakin. Especially smooth is the use of cloning to explain why the Empire prefers men over robots to do its dirty work, just because the techniques weren't advanced enough to orchestrate massive droid armies.THE BAD The dialog and the acting, although that last part is hard to deliver with some class when you're talking to blue screens all the time. Which brings up the concept of CGI overkill. Landscapes, ships and aliens look beautiful, but when you add a single ""real"" element in the form of a human actor, it always makes me feel like they're humiliated fossils in a computer world. The problem with these complaints is you can't fix them: actors are needed to add something to the graphics, Force philosophy lines will always sound forced, whereas theatrical conversation would look silly.*** In my opinion, Ewan Mc Gregor portrays the evolution of his character nicely (he's grown mature, but has a better understanding of a padawan's troublings than his own master) and Anakin ( sorry, i never memorized the guy) is competent by means of showing how he could transform into Vader at a later age: scared by his youth and the death of his mother, therefor less controlled in using his powers. By nature he does seem to have an inferiority complex and a short temper with attached disbelief in democracy.THE UGLY In spite of the good links in AOTC, i fear Episode III will either display too many or too little events leading up to Episode IV. Samuel L. Jackson is waisted on Star Wars. He never gets to say anything besides simple lines or Force-gibberish a mediocre actor can handle sufficiently. I also pity Christopher Lee getting trapped in this, but then again, he brings his character to life.Grading this wasn't easy, either. Take two points for never being as good as a 50's classic and one point for BAD/UGLY flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The thing with getting older...,"I'm trying not to say anything that must have been said before (but I didn't read all the reviews so....)With regard to comparing the new batch of Star Wars films with the old ones; I doubt the ability of some people to understand the difference in experience between seeing a movie first when you're around 10 and seeing a movie first when you're around 30...With regard to dialog; I'm tired of these over acted stage dramas that Hollywood insist on making of every movie (probably because the old-ones that call the shots have zero imagination.) ""Phantom Menace"" was a breeze in that respect. I really appreciate that. Some dialog is necessary to understand what's going on but after that every minute that a movie/TV-show shows a close up of two heads talking gets deducted from the overall score of the movie. (That's why ""As the world turns"" is at the extreme low end of the spectrum)So Mr Lucas, good going... My humble suggestion; reduce on 'psycho-dialog', let the story march forth at even a higher pace, more detail without explaining (hinting and leaving things unexplained is better). Forget about character development just a few indications of what's going on will suffice in activating the imagination of the viewer. Let's face it viewer imagination is required, don't bother making movies for those people without imagination at all.Thanks for reading",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The most romantic and emotional episode of ""Star Wars""","It seems as though there is no way to dispel negative atmosphere once it has been started. George Lucas's STAR WARS trilogy was well-loved by audiences (even though critics were split) but for some reason (and I can't figure it out), the first entry in the prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE, earned a HUGE onslaught of critically divided posts just about everywhere in the world, from the press to the internet to fans in real life. While I do agree that the original trilogy is a tough act to follow, I wasn't as grossly let down by this movie as some were.The same thing has happened to the second of the STAR WARS prequels, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, released in 2002. Many predicted that this movie would satisfy those who disliked Episode I with a vengeance, but alas, such was not the case. Once again, critics damned the movie for one reason or another, and the heated debate on whether Lucas ""trashed the original trilogy"" or not is still going on. I find it very sad that Lucas would still receive unfair critical attack, even after making a much darker, somber, and ominous movie in ATTACK OF THE CLONES. I'm guessing that such naysayers will continue to say nay to Lucas no matter what just like rabid fans of Anime would continue to slam-dunk dubs... even if a lot of them have recently proved to be excellent.This is not to say that ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a flawless film. It actually has its share of problems that THE PHANTOM MENACE didn't have. The dialogue, although nowhere nearly as bad as critics and some disgruntled fans say, lacks the spark of the original trilogy. My biggest gripe with the movie is that it moves at a leisurely pace, with lots of weak, unsatisfying sequences that last too long. Most of these scenes consist of a love subplot involving Anakin Skywalker and Amidala Padme. When not interacting with each other, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are fine in their respective roles. (Christensen's monologue about his slaughtering of not only Tusken Raiders but--horrors!--women and children is frightening.) But there is a sense of awkwardness when they contribute to scenes which involve schmaltzy lines and screen kisses. I'm guessing that they both felt uncomfortable doing these scenes, hence why the chemistry between them isn't as interesting as, say, Han and Leia's from the original trilogy.Only when the movie is in action does ATTACK OF THE CLONES become worthwhile--there's a dizzying chase through Coruscant on floating cars, maneuvering through a dangerous asteroid field near a planet, and a half-hour long showdown that showcases a lot of amazing CG work. Actually, what also make Episode II worth watching are the fantastic set designs. Every location in the movie, from the metropolis skyscrapers of Coruscant to the water planet where prototypes of Stormtroopers are being constructed literally bursts with imagination and eye candy.Of the performers I liked Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) the best; his acting is still a little shaky at times, but here he seems more comfortable with the role. Christopher Lee makes a surprise appearance as the new villain, Count Dooku, and once again he delivers first-rate evil with this character. And it's great to see C-3PO and R2-D2 up to their usual banter again (although sometimes some gags occur when not necessary). Ultimately, however, the film belongs to Jedi Master Yoda, played to perfection by Frank Oz. His appearances in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI featured him as a rubber puppet (and a delightful creation), but in this movie he really comes alive, thanks to first-rate CG effects. His mouth is perfectly in sync with every word he says, and the final showdown between him and Dooku is an absolute highlight.While ATTACK OF THE CLONES is, in some ways, a lesser entry in the STAR WARS franchise, its assets outweigh its weaknesses; most of the questions I had from the first episode seem to be addressed a little bit in this chapter, and, frustratingly enough, provides more questions for Episode III. Flawless or not, this is still a STAR WARS movie, and for what it is, it's still worth a look",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Prequel Trilogy Improves,"Episode II is an exciting and entertaining continuation of the saga, as an older Anakin(now played by Hayden Christensen in an intense performance) is sent to guard Queen Amedalia( the beautiful Natalie Portman) along with his teacher Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor, even better than before, now sporting a beard) after an assassination attempt is made on her life, a plot that stretches from a breakaway faction of the Republic, all the way back to the Republic itself, and the sinister Chancellor Palpatine(Fine performance by Ian McDiarmid). Legendary actor Christopher Lee is a welcome addition to the cast as the traitorous(?)

Improvement over the first chapter....,"This chapter seems to be an improvement over Phantom Menace. The story was interesting but the story of Anakin being in love with Padme was a no-no. The excitement in this film was not as good as The Phantom Menace. They were many slow paced scenes particularly with the Anakin-Padme scenes . They were boring and stupid . The chemistry was very bad because both performances were awful. The romance has lack of passion. George should use more romantic elements in it both emotionally and passionately. When I thought Jake Llyod's acting was poor , I was hoping Hayden could do a better job but he was just as worst as him. While Natalie Portman's wooden acting is still there except improved . The battle on Geonosis was the greatest field battle since Episode V . Last for not least,the climatic duel between Yoda and Dooku was the most that surprised me .

This movie should've been Episode 1,"Think about it. Attack of the Clones shows what life in the pre-Empire Republic really was like, the charming and near-utopian like place it was, unlike the distant Episode 1.Furthermore, the big plot is really put into motion here, with the rising of the star systems separating from the Republic, setting the pieces for the upcoming war. It is a far more ominous and vital set-up than the ridiculous trade dispute from the Phantom Menace. The only real plot development of Episode 1 was showing how Palpatine became Chancellor. Wasn't it enough just to see him as Chancellor here? His cool, calculating character makes the audience understand how he got there (largely thanks to Ian McDiarmid's talent).The introduction of other characters would've been similarly satisfying had the prequels started with this movie. We believe that the troubled, egotistic Anakin Skywalker would be partial to the Dark Side of the Force if swayed enough. Obi-Wan Kenobi's wisdom and dedication as a Jedi is clear from the onset as well, as is Padmé Amidala's tenacious, wholesome character. Besides, if Episode 1 happened ten years previously, wouldn't we have heard about Syfa Dias's death? The plot unveils all of this very satisfyingly. As Obi-Wan Kenobi tracks the person behind assassination attempts on Padmé, the world of the Republic (including life in Coruscant as well as the Jedi temple) is one he travels through for answers. This is the opposite of Episode 1, where the heart of each place was so distant.Sure, the dialogue between Anakin and Padmé is not the best, especially in the fireplace scene. Hayden Christensen, what's more, hammed up the role of Anakin a bit at times and as such felt unbelievable. However, in spite of that, there is a tangible chemistry between Christensen and Natalie Portman (who here gets much more to work with the role of Padmé).Sure, the Trade Federation plays a vital part in this film as well, but suppose Episode 1 had never been made? We still would understand the history between Naboo and the Federation (whose absurd ability to command an army and have representatives in the Galactic Senate was a hugely missed plot point in the Phantom Menace). In fact, only one thing about Episode 2 really escapes me, and that is how Jango Fett came to be the ""host"" of such a massive operation when he's a bounty hunter. Maybe some light could've been shed on that.Fact of the matter, the story of Episode 2 is very big, and the amount of happenings is gargantuan. A lot more ground is covered than in Episode 1. But it is an entertaining and (unlike Episode 1) fulfilling experience.In conclusion, Attack of the Clones was a significant improvement upon the inadequate Phantom Menace, and is a solid, satisfying film in its own right. It has its dud elements but the ominous story is given good justice. The only pointless scene is possibly the conveyor belt one (which does nothing for the plot other than set up an embarrassing situation for C3PO). Time has been kind to Attack of the Clones, the REAL episode 1.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars is alive,"After a dry and somewhat sterile Episode I which alienated many fans and potential new ones with introducing a character that has becoming much reviled in movie history by the name of Jar Jar Binks, George Lucas finally remembered the formula that made the first trilogy a success. For the first time since the Empire Strikes Back the trilogy really focused on the mysteries of the Force and really gave viewers a gutsy well written story. I have read critics who have lambasted the movie as having campy dialogue and less than stellar acting. I am a regular movie goer and know the original trilogy by heart and if the reviewers that were critical of this movie had actually watched the movie as a continuation of the same story or a preface to the original series, those reviewers would see that this movie comes much closer to the vision of the earlier movies. Lets face it folks, when it comes time for the Academy Awards, the Star Wars movies win on technical merit as well as musical accompaniament. I am sure these same critics are the ones that complained about the Lord of The Rings as a chase movie. Well duh, if they had read the book, they would have known that.Episode II is a fantastic glimpse into a universe and history that anyone familiar with the Star Wars universe would really like to see. Many questions that have caused fans to wonder about have finally begun to be answered. The movie does a good job dropping your jaw at how various characters from the Old trilogy are related to people and events in the new trilogy. Origins of some of the conflicts and characters are explained in greater detail, helping fans to better grasp the vastness of the storyline laid down by Lucas. Many people, myself included have felt that Episode I really seemed disconnected from the original series as it seemed more like a fantasy film gone amuck.Even some of the humor in Episode II which does contain plenty considering some of the darker nature of the subject matter is amusing and is capable of introducing irony into the sequence of events for those viewers familiar with the events that take place in the old trilogy. Lucas is not afraid to have a character make a comment which is funny but at the same time carries a much deeper meaning to it. There is one scene where Obi Wan Kenobi is chasing after Anakin Skywalker and makes the statement ""why do I feel like you will be the death of me someday"", for the ironic twist is that Darth Vader ultimately DOES kill Obi Wan Kenobi in the original Star Wars. Episode II recaptures the magic of the films and left me hanging on the edge of my seat to see the third installment which hasn't even begun filming yet.My children are 9 & 4 and between the three of us we thoroughly enjoyed the movie and left feeling excited. Even my 4 year old was left staring at the screen being caught up in the action sequences. There were only a couple of times in the movie when dialogue that was intended for more mature audiences left the younger kids antsy and a bit bored. Thankfully these scenes while important to the story do not last very long between the action sequences.I would like to tell any of the critics of this movie that those criticisms are unfounded and they need to rethink their concept of what makes a movie entertaining. I heard people in the theater cheering and laughing all the way out the door of the theater because they had FUN!

Not as good as Episode 2,"Loved Empire strikes back.Who can compare?If you forget the first three films, after all this is a separate trilogy, there is some good stuff.

The viewer is left with a sense of foreboding over what is to come in episode three.I thought Hayden Christensen did a good job as Anakin. Admittedly I was in agony when he gave that speech about being in agony but I fault Lucas' screenplay for that not him. Natalie Portman however just didn't cut it as Amidala. She sounded too much like a little girl and not enough a young woman. She was bland in The Phantom Menace and doesn't do any better here.

And this is BETTER than Episode 1???,"If that is true, boy, am I glad to have missed that one! Because irritate me beyond belief this movie did, to paraphrase what some people call ´the best character´ in the movie. Good grief, what an amazing snorefest! I had to poke myself in the eye to stay awake, and even that wasn´t always successful. Why do I think it is so bad? Please allow me to explain.1. The Actors: Never have I seen such a clumsy bunch of wooden, nay, leaden, actors assembled in one movie. I couldn´t believe the way they deliver their incredibly stale dialogue. The only escapee is Christopher Lee, whose 60 or so years of experience enable him to wrestle free from...2. The Director: This guy should never be allowed near a camera ever again. Period. He is so terribly unable to get any kind of performance from his actors, or to even keep a story going, that Ed Wood was the Steven Spielberg of his time in comparison.3. The Story: Why the romance? Why? If you cannot get actors to perform with their heart on their sleeves... then don´t do romance! It falls so horribly flat that I don´t know where to begin to describe it. Very flat indeed.4. The Final Attack: It wasn´t entirely clear to me who the titular clones were, but since there were droves and droves of the same fake CGI creatures for the last three weeks of the movie, I guess those were the Clones. And they fought. And they fought. And they fought. And they fought. And they fought. And they fought. And they fought. And they fought. Ad Infinitum.5. The Finale: The most horrible part was the Fight in the Cave, with Christopher Lee and a talking potato named Yoda. Laughing I have been every minute. Way too long that scene was. Way too dark too, as flashing coloured light beams all are I seen have. Stop I must writing like this, because annoy myself I do. This scene was so inapt that I could not stop laughing. Sorry about that.In short: BOOOOOORRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGG!I have read that George Lucas does not listen to critics, or to his audience, for that matter, because Star Wars is his and he can do with it what he wants. That may be so, but he does not have to expect to get one more dime from me. He is not a movie director, he is the art director of a toy catalogue. What an incredible hoot!It is a movie that is absolutely devoid of humour as well. The only jokes come from a robot, mind you, and therefore it does not have to surprise you that they sound totally automatic, as if there was a note in the script: ´please remember to let this character crack a joke every scene he is in´.

the purpose of star wars,"i don't recall any of the previous star wars films being nominated for any acting awards. anyone who knows these films watches them for pure enjoyment. a great story, cutting-edge visuals, complex action scenes and realistic worlds. the amount of creatures, sets and spacecraft created for AOTC alone in staggering. this episode was the most plot revealing of all episodes. sure the acting is flat and the dialog is thin but if i was 14, as i was when star wars came out, that wouldn't matter and isn't that lucas' targeted audience anyway?i found the imax version blurry during some scenes. even though the film went though a conversion process it is unlike a film shot with imax film.i enjoyed this movie from a storyline perspective and i stayed awake during the whole film, unlike 'lord of the rings'",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Some may say that Episode II was not as good as the original Star Wars, but those movie cranks are just being mean.","Episode 2 has been given some pretty bad comments from the critics recently. But why? I understand that some of the script is terrible, and the storyline may be a bit difficult to understand, but didn't the original Star Wars Movies all have the same problems. The Only really convincing Star Wars ever created was The Empire Strikes Back, and George Lucas didn't even direct that one! Still, Attack of the Clones had its good points, the directing was fine, the acting was usually good, and the Lightsaber fight with Yoda was once in a lifetime viewing. So, Just because it didn't quite live up to the original Star Wars movies, doesn't mean it wasn't good. When I first saw Attack of the Clones, I thought it was much better than the phantom menace. Some may say I am wrong, but I always class a film by its ability to excite, convince and influence the viewer.

A Force to be reckoned with!!!,"EDIT: It's 13 years later and I'm older and wiser. Clearly I was caught up in the excitement when I wrote this right after seeing the film. Revised my rating from a 9 to a 7.Still a Star Wars fan, though. Bring on Ep VII through IX and the spinoffs! :-)==================== WOW!I saw the 12:01 showing this morning here on Canada's East coast... Thrilled to be among the first in the continent to see it on official release day! (after my friends in NFLD, of course!)What can I say? George, THANK YOU!!! You have brought us all back to the thrills of the original trilogy. As usual, I had chills down my spine right from the opening drum roll of the 20th Century Fox logo. The action sequences blew me away, and there was so much to see that I just could not take all of that big screen in. The screening I saw wasn't a digital projection, but all the same the clarity and detail of the scenery, blaster bolts, light sabers, etc was amazing - even on film.Hayden Christensen plays a hot-headed Anakin very well, expectedly a much deeper character than his 10-year old former self. Natalie Portman's Padme is one very cool senator/action hero! And no more hiding behind those ridiculous queenly get-ups - we're definitely seeing more of her! Ewan MacGregor is gradually morphing into Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan - very cool. And mercifully, JarJar has very little screen time and dialogue. Meesa so releev-ed!This film answers so many questions we all had after TPM, and definitely establishes ties with ANH. There are parallels with the original trilogy in both dialogue and events, and even casual SW fans will recognize those. However, TRUE fans will recognize the much deeper references. No spoilers! ;-)I must say that this movie contains my new all-time favourite scene from any SW film. Again no spoilers, and most will not be surprised by the scene, but toward the end of the film, there was a point where the crowd in the theatre broke into spontaneous applause! You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.I AM a long-time fan, and my expectations were cautious after TPM. However, I was truly amazed by this film. I walked away at 02:30 (only 9 hours ago!) with a huge smile on my face and a wish in my heart that May 2005 would start now!Full Marks! I will definitely be going again soon!Galto",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Tedious beyond compare,"Perhaps it had a great ending but the stilted dialogue, clumsy structure and mindless use of clever-clogs effects tried my patience so much that I will never know. I eventually snapped during a seemingly endless battle sequence structured mainly around showing us how clever George Lucas and his geeks were to create incredible mega-vistas and lots and lots of very big CG war machines and robots.

One of My Favorite Movies Ever,"this movie would have to be one of the best movies i've seen yet! It's exciting, action packed, surprising in ways, and yes filled with some romance. This was George Lucas's first real romance movie besides all of those action movies this one had a lot of romance. Basically the romance i think pulls the movie together because if the movie was just action and that's it, it would be boring in it own way.Of Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen) otherwise known as the Chosen One starts to show more emotion towards Padme'(Natalie Portman) and he confesses his love to her but she knows they cant have a relationship but it becomes harder as the movie progresses.I would say that Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen pulled it off in different ways like the action scenes and the confusing scenes lol. A lot of people say that Hayden didn't play his character well or that it wasn't convincing when it was he played his character with emotion and talent. He really pulled it off and i couldn't wait to see his performance in Revenge of the Sith.i think this movie shows us Anakin beginning to show some signs that he should be watched more carefully by the council, i mean he shows a lot of hate then usual and Hate Fear Suffering lead to the Dark Side and he shows that quiet often in the movie.i hope this comment helped you with understanding the movie!So go and see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) ***,"(Possible Spoilers)I really had a good time with ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and it was an immense and welcome relief after squirming through THE PHANTOM MENACE. What impressed me right off the bat were the towering galactic cities, and much of the architectural design in general. It also became evident right from the start that we were going to be told more of a direct story this time around, with a plot that was not nearly as impossible to follow as it had been with Episode One. You still may need a score card to keep track of all the oddly named characters, but at least there's more substance to them.Ewan McGregor takes top honors as the best actor this time around, in his role of a more adult Obi-Wan Kenobi. Hayden Christensen is on and off in his so-so rendering of the growing Anakin Skywalker, and while Natalie Portman is still not much of an actress, she's not as bad here as she was the last time and at least we get to see her Queen Amidala fall in love with Anakin. This budding romance is also a great benefit to the film.I enjoyed the action sequences too, ranging from the flying ""space car"" chase to the clone battle scenes, to the varying lightsaber duels. An added treat for an old time horror/sci-fi veteran like me was getting to see film legend Christopher Lee in the villainous role of Count Dooku, trading lightsaber jousts not only with Obi-Wan, but also Yoda! A personal highlight for me, and a moment full of action and suspense.There were some down sides too, though they didn't spoil the overall experience. The film is still a little padded and overlong at two hours and twenty minutes, and while I wasn't bugged out by the over-reliance on computer effects this time, occasionally I had to grimace when ""people"" were animated. It's one things to create a mythological creature on the big screen; it's another to animate the very human character who's riding on its back or being thrown off it.But all this aside, I liked ATTACK OF THE CLONES and I am now poised to make my way to the theatre for the recently released REVENGE OF THE SITH. And may the force be with me. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What a Pile of Dooku,"I had to wait a couple of weeks until all the fanboys entered theircomments and actually see some rational ones from averagemoviegoers like myself.My two cents is that the movie is entertaining. In its genre is morecomparable to box office flop Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within thanto the so mentioned original Star Wars Trilogy.Special FX: The digital actors in the film failed miserably to replacepuppets and guys in costumes we've seen in other sci-fi films. Themix of real actors and digital actors made the movie look like aglorified ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", rather than the realisticeffect they wanted to achieve. That distracted me too much fromreally enjoying the film as it was meant to.The Story: A surprisingly boring plot kept me from enjoying thereally well crafted action scenes. Some scenes didn't ad anythingto the plot.The acting: I praise the actors for at least making the effort to uttersuch terrible lines with a straight face. The dialog is anembarrassment. Specially those written to push forward thenon-convincing love story. I've seen B movies, soap operas,ambulance chaser's commercials and even porn films with betterdialog than some seen in this movie.In all, there are so many better films out there that will never get thehype of this franchise that you won't see. Still, it's not a waste oftime. Most fans say it's better than Episode One: The PhantomMenace. Then again, that terrible movie is not a hard act to follow.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better than Episode One, but plot-holes need to be resolved","Much in the same vein as Episode 1, there were many scenes which, if removed, would've made the movie much better.  However, there were fewer of these than there were in E1, and overall I thought E2 was *much* better than E1.  I didn't think 3-PO was all that funny, but as a forced comic-relief character he wasn't nearly as annoying as Jar Jar.  It's also ironic/very Lucas that Jar Jar is indirectly responsible for ultimately creating the Empire.I liked the little boy who played Boba Fett; you can already tell he's going to be an a$$hole.  And I thought they did a good job finally having (Jango) Fett do something.  And he finally used his flame-thrower! :)Obi-Wan was solid; so was Dooku.  Anakin/Padme were pretty lame, as were all of those horrible scenes on Padme's homeworld.  Take every scene on that planet out of E1 and E2 and both movies are better for it. Anakin almost redeemed himself when he slaughtered those Sandpeople, but the whining afterword kind-of spoiled it.  And what is Padme thinking falling in love with this psychopath?  Yoda, needless to say, kicked a$$.There are still several large continuity plot-holes that need to be resolved between the original Trilogy and the two new movies.Anakin to Padme: ""Hey darling, why didn't you freakin' buy my mother out of slavery ten years ago?""Why do the neither of the droids remember Tatooine, Obi-Wan, or Owen/Bertru Lars?  A memory wipe at some point is really the only answer ...But more to the point, why do Owen Lars/Obi-Wan not remember anything about these droids at the beginning of Episode 4 (New Hope)?  I know it's been a long time between E2 and E4, but c'mon.  Owen could say something like: ""Gee Luke, that's funny, when your father was here 20 years ago, he had two droids with him that were exactly like these two.""  Also, why does Obi-Wan decide to hide Luke on Tatooine knowing full-well that Anakin not only grew up there, but has in fact been to the Lars' house before?I carefully watched (geek alarm) the first hour of E4 last night, and Obi-Wan states that he doesn't remember owning any droids (despite R2D2 claiming to be Obi-Wan's property).  3-P0 clearly says that he doesn't know what planet he's on, that his first job was as a ""botchi translator for binary load lifters"" and that his (and R2's) previous owner was Captain Antilles.  He implies multiple times that he and R2 have been working together for some time.  Also, Obi-Wan is referred to as ""General Kenobi"" by Leia, and Obi-Wan tells Luke that his father ""wanted him to have"" the lightsaber.  Just some things to consider.Of course, my explanation is still that Lucas had no idea he was going to make any more movies after E4 and that therefore everything he's done since then is revisionism ... which of course gets harder to pull off the more you try to incorporate it.  Especially with Lucas' unnecessary style of trying to make *everything* tie together.Finally, I still maintain that the stormtroopers in the original Trilogy are NOT clones.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not good but not terrrible,"There are some good elements in the story.The romance, Natalie Portman is great, Hayden Christensen is OK if you admit his IQ lowers by half when in the presence of Padme, which is not that unrealistic.Storywise the Jedi are incredibly stupid throughout, they don't see the forest for the tree. Some things are ridiculous like the ""execution"" drama on Geonosis. The appearance of the clones is very good and the battle with the Federation Army is OK.Actionwise, there are some very good sequences that are entertaining like the shapeshifter in the beginning and the very good sequence between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett. Others are not so convincing like the factory and the arena showdown on Geonosis. The Jedi vs Dooku battle could have been better as well, although it was nice to see Master Yoda show his stuff.Overall this movie needs a script editor. Too many cringe elements like the banter between R2D2 and C3PO that falls flat every time.It is not too bad and it works well at entertaiment.

A much improve film,Now while I still feel mix about Episode 1 I have to say Star Wars: Episode 2 Attack of The Clones is a much improve film and shows to be one of the best second films in a series.It does have it fair share of highs and lows but it still a much better film in the prequel Star Wars filmsOur three main protagonists are Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Padmé (Natalie Portman).Yoda (Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) also play important roles in the plot of the film along with the mystery around Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid)Our film main antagonist is Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and our second antagonist is Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison)It's hard to explain the plot because it's better if you watch the film to understand it more than I could best explain it but never the less it had a story to go into this film.There is some emotional performances in this film as you can see the cast emotions in their characters as they did a good performance in the film.Surprising that they added comedy into the film but I really got a laugh that I had to pause the movie because I couldn't stop laugh then rewind to laugh again.John Williams once again show case his wonderful talent for making superb music he's a man where anything he touches turns to gold he just knows how to tell a story with his music and this film is no different each piece of music helps tell the story of this motion picture.Also the fight scenes are very well done and they really took the effort to make each battle the most rewarding part of watching this film each battle is just really thought out and keeps you on the edgeThe only draw back is that there are slow down moments in the film and some of the plot is hard to understand but still this film is much improve over the first episodeOverall I really enjoy the film and it shows that with a little work anything can be improve over the last filmI give Star Wars:Episode 2 Attack Of The Clones an 8 out of 10,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""star wars"" does not equal good","I love everything about the world of Star Wars.  I am as huge a fan as the next guy, but I won't let my love for something I've known since I was 2 yrs old blind me to what I experienced when I saw Episode II. I've never believed that Lucas was a great director. Seeing this movie drives that home.  Way back when, in fact, I did not like the idea that he would be directing these prequels.  McGregor, Jackson and Portman are awesome performers but Lucas can turn any talented actor/actress into what looks like an amateur reading their lines off cue cards for the first time. The performances were awful.  (Lucas's fault) I was trying to get into the story, but I just wasn't feeling it.  The screenplay was just totally erratic.  The movie had no flow what so ever. As a fan of Star Wars, I honestly tried really hard to find something in this movie that I liked.  I couldn't.  The only satisfaction I have now is that I'm one step closer in the story to seeing how Anakin comes to be Vader.  I really can't even say this movie had a plot or a story.  It was just a sequence of events.  I think that Lucas takes for granted what the audiences all ready know about the outcome of Anakin's demise.  This is a big mistake on Lucas's part. If you like special effects, you're in for a treat.  The movie was a special effects and CGI overkill.  All I can say to Lucas is...""Get off the Mac and try to develop a decent screenplay first.""

Strong entry in the popular sci-fi saga...,"1st watched 1/11/2003 - 7 out of 10(Dir-George Lucas): Strong entry in the popular sci-fi saga with a good mix of action and romance.  Lucas continues to add more variety and uniqueness to landscapes, creatures, and machinery that boggles the imagination and keeps your eyes open on every frame.  The story is somewhat typical good guys/bad guys Star Wars, but there is an added twist of a romance occurring between young Anakin SkyWalker and the newly elected Senator Nabia of the Republic. Something else that actually is better than the original entries is the acting.  The cast does an excellent job and it is obvious that most of their careers will not be trapped in Star Wars(unlike some of the actors in the original).  Again, because of Lucas's uniqueness in this and every  entry in this saga the much awaited grouping of all of them in their original intended order will be a sight to see once their all done.

Probably the worst piece of trash I've seen in a long time.,"I read over twenty of these reviews and I agree with everyone that did not like the movie, and for every reason they thought of.

It makes more sense now, because we have seen Anakin as a good guy.  And his performance was pretty good, some spots were bad, but mostly he did a good job.  But just wait until they are all done, then it will be good to those who didn't like it now. Do read the book though it is alot better.

Second prequel that improves,"Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones is the second of the Star Wars prequels and one that in my opinion, just about beats that of it's previous film in the series. The story is upped quite a bit from Phantom and much more is going on here and there and everywhere throughout the galaxies, with much more fight scenes, an interesting mystery running through the film and of course, more lightsabers. Overall I felt it was just about an OK movie, and here below is why.The story is fast paced, lots goes on in a quite long movie though and so the film truly gets what it wants to get out in the right amount of time. The thrills are also more abundant than Phantom and rival any of the Star Wars for true thrilling action and big battles. I wasn't to keen on the quite rushed ending though and there are parts of the story which could have been done much better with more added depth and at times, not enough is going on then suddenly lots is happening.From an acting perspective it isn't so bad this but also not the greatest, Ewan McGregor is OK as Kenobi again and is in a much more major role this time around, dealt well McGregor does. Hayden Christensen is not the best person they could have got as Anakin, sure he can do the action scenes fairly well and any fast movements, but his acting is poor here and much work is needed on the character of Anakin. Natalie Portman is much better this time around and the entire supporting cast are fairly good in there roles, even a welcome sight of a CGI Yoda.Lucas and his writing skill suffer once again in this one, it never quite harms the film to such an extent but it does mean certain scenes are left awkward and just strange. His directing is good for this one, he does seem to have worked a little harder for this one and the scenes where his direction is most needed are worked out very well. The effects are shall we say, over used, yet they are pretty good for 2002 and this film will always be known as a turning point in special effects technology.The main criticisms don't just lie in the writing, it's the effects too and of course acting. The dialogue is fairly stingy and Lucas seriously shouldn't have written this second or for that matter the first. I said about the special effects but one major point is there is just too much, the colour can make you feel a bit dizzy and it can seem near every set is made from green screen or has been digitally done. And on to the acting, it isn't just Hayden, not everyone is so comfortable in there role, but I guess that is what you get with such an epic space drama.For Star Wars fans they should prefer this to the Phantom Menace but compared to any other of the movies, they may feel bitterly disappointed, It is a satisfactory film but for the true fans, maybe not so. If you are new to the franchise then I feel you will like it although watching it years after does not help the effects used and can seem as if the producers were pretty lazy. This for me is the Star Wars most kids should enjoy, it has a lot of fighting and big action sequences, not to ruin any but they are spread well across the running time.Overall it is Just About OK in my opinion, many will disagree but some will say it is better, that is for you to decide. I have to admit from watching this when it first came out I did like it much more back then but you see in time what is just about wrong with the movie, but you also keep what is good about it. One more thing, I may criticise Christensen but he shouldn't ruin the movie for you, for the most part he is competent in the role as Anakin Skywalker.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Square Film in a Round Hole,"May the FORCED be with you. That is the guts of this movie; it is not allowed to develop on its own, it is forced. Yes, with the original trilogy establishing already what we know will happen, George Lucas has to set all the pieces on course to get there. But the ways that these characters and plot points set-up to the original trilogy is like forcing molasses to flow as free as water.Stiff acting, again, a casualty of being forced to act with a tennis ball that represents a character that hasn't been created yet with effects. This along with good actors having to believe a line that is more stunted than a thirteen year-old asking out a hot gal on a date.Unlike Episode I where the podrace and final lightsaber duel were the highlights and truly remarkable Star Warsian moments, here we don't have much, save for a surprising entry in the final lightsaber show-down.It has been said that the middle entries into trilogies are the weakest points, both the original trilogy and Godfather disprove this, yet Episode II succeeds in keeping the notion going. With the let-down three years before, the hype around this movie was quite less than before. Yet I remember the biggest hype among my Star Wars friends was that there was no WAY that this movie would fail after the last effort. Thankfully we were right, but not by much.I remember walking out of this movie originally on opening weekend coming to the realization that this new prequel trilogy was going to be a bust. This movie, while SLIGHTLY better than the last, still failed in the same places and for the same reasons. But it is Star Wars and that means spectacle, and that it is, and its only real saving grace.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better,"Like many who grew up privately indulging the mythology of Episode IV, I felt betrayed by Episode I.  Episode II is a redemption of sorts, both artistically and technically.Some have commented that Episode II is marginally better than Episode I. This is not true - Episode II is *much* better.  I boycotted Episode II in the theaters and, having seen it on HBO, regret not being able to see it on the big screen.The story and plot are actually interesting.  There's some intrigue and suspense here that keeps your attention.  Characters, both real and virtual, are actually developed and have depth and complexity.  This, to me, was the most significant improvement.  The acting was better, the dialog - for the most part - was better.  I actually cared about these characters and their fate.  Ewan McGregor in particular honed the art of acting opposite a non-existant player.  Hayden Christensen plays Annikan as a young man struggling with a brewing conflict within.  Fits of rage are matched by a valient struggle at reconcilliation as he slowly loses control to the Dark Side.  Annikan arcs from benign mischief to agregious outrage - we know there is something seriously wrong with this boy by the time the movie is over. Compared to the cartoonish adventures of Annikan in Episode I, this portrayal is far more sophisticated and refined.  There are no Oscar (copyright, tm, etc.) moments here, but this is a real movie with real acting and a real story.The integration of the virtual environment has improved, as well.  The environment manages to serve as a stage rather than a seperate character and it's much easier to believe that these people are in the environment rather than in front of it.  It's less cluttered and old-fashioned cinematography and composition are taken more seriously this time around.  The last 20 minutes or so are astounding.  Curiously, the world of Ipisode II is clean to the point of being anticeptic - unlike the ""lived-in"" feel of the older episodes. At the same time, ILM still manages to indulge itself on occasion and we are subjected to some video-game sequences here and there.  I really with they would avoid these.Another major difference in Episode II is that George Lucas has taken his world more seriously.  The world of Star Wars is still a bloodless one, but combat in Episode II is more brutal, more savage, more violent.  People and creatures actually die.  Warfare is not taken as lightly this time around, despite the insistance on comic relief interwoven during fights.And, a sure indicator that Lucas really was listening and tried to improve: We have a lot less Jar-Jar.  He's still there, but not as much and he talks even less.  Jar-Jar has matured some, too.  He's tolerable at least in Episode II.As those of us who grew up with the Force have matured and moved into the real world, so has Star Wars as portrayed in Episode II.  It's more mature. Some innocense has been lost.  But the spirit is in tact.While Episode I was written for my little boy, Episode II was written for me.  I would have gladly paid 8 bucks to see the real thing.  Probably twice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not a bad star wars,"I actually enjoy this movie, its not a bad movie at all. I understand Hayden can be a bit dry. But I actually feel that it plays well with his character.

"Coulda been better, but the Force is still with it. Or is it?","The second prequel to the original star wars trilogy, is ten years after Ep I, the Phantom Menace. Anakin is progressing well in his studies, and Padme is no longer Queen of Naboo, but Senator and representative of her planet alongside Jar Jar Binx in the Galactic Republic.But there's a lot of unrest. The Seperatist's numbers are growing, and there seems to be some new threats lurking in the dark corners of the galaxy...Overall, it's an OK movie, although almost everyone you talk to will agree that this is probably the worst of all the Star Wars movies. It would definitely have been better, but the actor they got for Padme was just cheesy. She couldn't deliver a line correctly to save herself from a raging Rancor Beast. Also, the movie was 2/3 dependent on its special effects to be successful, instead of also going for the emotion and storyline everyone has known and loved from Star Wars. Or at least, they expect a lot more from them.But don't get me wrong, this is a very good movie. The effects are phenomenal, except for one scene where it looks like a video game. The music is still up to par with all the other Star Wars, and of course, everyone loves seeing Jar Jar and R2-D2.

If at first you don't succeed.,"I'll try to be brief.  As an avid Star Wars fan for years I've always been gun-ho to soak up more and more of possibly the biggest franchise to date. However these new films are like trying to recreate a moment in your life. Like taking your grown children to the place you took them when they were little and expecting the same type of trip with the same magic.Episode One was quite possibly the biggest disappointment to the Star Wars universe and Lucas knows it.  He's trying to get better. I believe I read in Time Magazine that his response was something like he hadn't directed a film in years.  Well, no offense Mr. Lucas, but you never did know how to direct. A New Hope was nothing compared to Empire and Jedi.  Why?  Cause Lucas directed A New Hope but not the others. Same with these new films.  The problem is in the director, not the storyline per say.My biggest beef about both Phantom Menace and Clones is that there's way too much CGI.  What made the orginals so good was because they looked so real. Why?  Because they were actually real things.  They may have been puppets but they were a real thing.  Slight hand movements gave them more emotion than a billion digital effects. It's what made them ALIVE to us.Clones is getting back on track to the storyline. (Which is good) But it's still too fake.  Way to fake.  And that love scene was a joke.  Just cause it's a film aimed at 13 year old boys doesn't mean it can't have meaning. I saw more love in Disney's Beauty and the Beast!I hope Episode 3 is better.  Maybe since James Earl Jones is coming back to voice Vader things will look up for it.Bottom line, wait for it to be on video or televsion to see it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Why I like this movie,"Not only do I personally know the actor who plays Boba Fett in this film, the acting and special FX in this is AMAZING!!! It is a deep movie and it basically leads up the to the Episode 3. The soap opera plots are awesome. Hayden and Natalie are a great on-screen couple. The intensity between them is deep and passionate. Ewan MacGregor is exceptional in these films. He is a great Scotsman actor along the lines of Sean Connery. Sam Jackson in the role of Mace Windu is awesome as well. The fight scene between Yoda and Count Dooku(Christopher Lee of LOTR trilogy) is freaking awesome/hilarious.

"Better than Mencace, but something is missing...","After the global disappointment that was The Phantom Menace, we got ""Attack of the Clones""! And while it's better than Menace, and an OK film overall... The execution leaves something to be desired. The narration is done much better than in Menace, and the acting is certainly better. There is a bit more suspense here as well, but doesn't make up for a half and hour Padme-Anakin vacation. Some of the scenes work, but most of the time the scene is unnecessary. This movie feels much more like Titianic than Star Wars, unfortunately. Titanic was a good movie, but it doesn't really fit into Clones.But the movie has a much more solid plot, and the scenes and lines works much better! There aren't nearly as much plot holes, and there is a very good climax at the end! This movie is kinda' interesting to watch. When you think about the action and execution, you accept it as a decent movie. But the pace is even slower in Menace, and the movie is transformed into an awkward love story.Anakin is a grown man, so it's definitely for the better, but the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen is awful. And the movie is forced to center around these two characters dinner conversations and picnic trips... They should have shown more Obi-Wan!I found the Obi-Wan segments to be quite good. It has a mysterious flow to it, and we feel like we learn some things on the way, as Obi-Wan does. We see more of the new villain Count Dooku aka Darth Tyranus, who is perhaps a more solid villain than Darth Maul. Lee is a golden template on this movie, as he is one the best actors of the whole cast! One of the most powerful scenes in this movie is the showdown between Dooku and Yoda! I gotta' give Lucas credit for filming this scene so perfect! I saw original Star Wars quality there!In the end, Clones is a decent movie, that is quite better than Menace! The movie works better on all premises! But Clones is nothing compared to the original trilogy... Execept for the Yoda vs Dooku scene! That was awesome!6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
this is worst movie of all time,"This the worst movie i have ever seen, i think that the video that my father has of my sister baptism is better than this movie. The actor who represents Anakin, could works in the next Duracell Advertisement, and i'm not pretty sure if that could be too much work form him. What about Yoda, he is always old, except, when he is fighting, and when he need to run to help Anakin, he can´t... And love story, could be part of a Mary Poppin's movie.please you do not go to the theater, the movie shocks, I think that planet of apes and this movie are the worst lost of money i had ever see.

"Great effects, dull plot","I wonder if people will ever learn... This marks strike two for Lucas. The second in his ""prequel"" trilogy represents a triumph of special effects and action but a giant leap backwards in terms of plot and dialogue.The special effects are outstanding, but it would be nice if Lucas actually used some of that money to hire some decent script writers. As it is, the actors flatly speak their silly lines and in the end you're just waiting for the next action sequence to begin. Particularly excruciating is the romance between Anakin & Padme which explores every cliché in the book and drags on and on. Fortunately when the action does arrive, it is very exciting and the ending is pretty good with a nice arena sequence and showdown between Yoda and Dooku.I actually rewatched this movie just recently on TV (a gap of three years since I first saw it) and if anything the acting comes across as even more wooden. The script isn't just bad, it's a rotten egg. With hindsight I see why every scene is filmed with CG eye candy - to distract from the train wreck in the foreground. As with the Phantom Menace, I don't believe the actors are at fault here. You get what you expect when you actors stupid lines to say to blank space in front of a green screen.It is a slightly better movie that the Phantom Menace but nowhere near as good as the original three.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The love scences work well because we know it's going to end badly. Anakin really loves Padme and his master Obi-Wan (AS A FATHER YOU PERVERTS) which makes the knowlege that both characters are going to try to kill each other, sad.

The 1977 movie is still the king,"Hayden Christensen's acting is somewhat wooden in this movie. Although, looking back at Mark Hamill's performance he's probably not too bad. Natalie Portman is somewhat better but not by much. She basically is in the movie for eye candy appeal, which she's quite good at. While the movie is okay to watch, it just does not have the magic of the old 1977 original. That movie was fun to watch because the idea was new and the whole universe Lucas created was great to watch on film. A whole slew of sci-fi and fantasy movies were made over the next few years copying Star Wars. Lucas continued on with his series of movies, but by the third movie, enough was enough. These last recent offerings were made for the sake of money, not art. There are no surprises in the recent movies, they're just completing the story set up by the first three movies. When will Hollywood stop rehashing the same old ideas just for money's sake? There are a lot of new ideas, never put on film, waiting on the shelves of the local library.

Cities look like taken straight out of Futurama. George Lucas' ability to make movies hasn't improved over time - rather the opposite seems to be the case. A cringe fest deluxe.

"Quality Entertainment, in a PG movie","George Lucas is my hero, and he's pretty much going to stay there! I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and I couldn't wait for this movie to come out!  I thought the story line was awesome, and it totally set it up for the next one to be the best one of all. I have to admit, the dialog needed a little help.  Lucas is definitely an action writer, not a love story writer.  Some of his lines were just a little bit sappy (note the sarcasm- you're in my very soul!) However, the movie still rocked, despite the occasional overly corny joke (oh this is such a drag...). I especially admire the way Lucas continues to make quality films that don't require a high rating.  NO sex no swearing no crude language or scenes, yet it's still an awesome movie.  This is truly a rare find in this day and age, I don't think many would argue with that.So despite the somewhat poor dialog, and sappy attempt at romance, Star Wars, with its revolutionary graphics and beautiful plot, will remain high on my list of quality movies indefinitely.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Bridge begins...,"STAR WARS: ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a wonderful romp through the STAR WARS universe. Some of the best overall action scenes in the series take place right here. But the film feels like it was cut in half... because it was. This is not a movie in and of itself: it is the first half of a movie that is *not* completed in the next STAR WARS movie (REVENGE OF THE SITH) -- it is completed in the absolutely fantastic Cartoon Network Clone Wars shorts (both the First and Second series).If you watch the movie, then watch the two cartoon series and think of this as one, very long (approximately 5-hour) epic film, then this probably deserves a rating of 8 (maybe 8.5 overall). But as a stand-alone film, it is just slightly lower -- I gave it a 7.ATTACK OF THE CLONES continues the saga started in Episode I; and begins the real bridge that needs to form from the prequels (I, II, and III) to the original trilogy (IV, V, and VI). In that role, it serves admirably.All of the same problems that exist in the other Star Wars films exist here -- but this is the first time Ewan McGregor really shows that he can play the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi. His performance is outstanding; as is the sheer presence of Samuel L. Jackson.The story line is a bit more evident in this film than it was in THE PHANTOM MENACE. And by the time you see REVENGE OF THE SITH -- if you really examine it, the story line in Episode I becomes more clear. Overall, this is an excellent stepping stone for the STAR WARS saga.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

What is this? A LOTR cover?,"Okay, this was almost painful to watch. I really hoped Christopher Lee would save the movie, by playing the villain. Nope. His lines seemed copy-pasted from The Lord of the Rings. All that ""join me, old friend"" and ""the dark lord"" talk just seemed recorded and re-used. I almost saw his white robe and Gandalf right across the room. The upside is that at least Christopher Lee didn't have to learn new lines. What a shame, for such a good actor. I wonder what Lucas told him when he got the part? ""Hey Chris, look, I've got another villain role for you, don't bother preparing too much for it, just bring the LOTR script with you and cut out all references to the One Ring and Sauron and you've got the job!"" Even the arena scene just looked like Lee's figure has been cropped from The Two Towers and pasted there... I almost heard the words ""leave none alive!""... And then there's the arena scene. It was completely unrealistic. It was like the battle of Minas Tirith... I mean Annakin is fighting an robot-orc on top of a cross between an olyphant and the Balrog. Even the way the thing falls reminds me of the Olyphants...And the sounds it makes. Then, Obi-Wan fights something that looks like the praying mantis with a big aiming problem, and Padme is running away from a super-sized Garfield... But the character that failed completely in this movie was Yoda. Everywhere else he seems this calm little Buddhist with inverted phrases (which become intolerable in this episode), but now he's just this little rubber ball that jumps all over the walls...WHAT?

"While still the weakest after 20 years, Attack of the Clones makes up for the flaws with stunning visual aesthetic, good supporting performances, and great action","Ten years later after The Phantom Menace, the Galactic Republic and the planetary systems join the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by former Jedi Count Dooku. With the galaxy now on a brink of war, Obi Wan investigates an assassination attempt on Senator Padme Amidala thus leading him to a clone army in service of the republic along with discovering the Separatist movement. Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan's apprentice, is tasked to protect Amidala while sharing a relationship with her as the trio witness a new threat to the galaxy known as the Clone Wars.While The Phantom Menace wasn't exactly a perfect movie considering it had a child performance that wasn't very good and Jar Jar Binks was by the most annoying side character out of any Star Wars-related media, it still had beautiful visuals, great action, and the other supporting actors especially Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Frank Oz, and Ian McDiarmid were superb. Attack of the Clones, on the other hand, is by far the weakest of the prequel trilogy. It's not an awful film and it does have some good things in it, but coming from someone who enjoyed this film as a kid (not to mention that I love Star Wars), it doesn't hold up well as an adult.The story has a unique concept, but sadly the execution is somewhat convoluted when compared to the last film as it tries to throw too much at you with little to no impact and the pacing does drag in certain areas, but what really drags this movie down for me is the dialog which is by far the worst written out of all the Star Wars media. The line ""I hate sand"" is filled with so much cringe (yes, even worse than the line ""Are you an angel?"" from the last film) which resulted in Hayden Christensen giving a very bad performance (which is a shame because he's a really good actor).That being said, there are some good things that helps the film make up for it's flaws. The visual aesthetic, much like the last film, is beautiful with a very unique atmosphere especially when we get to see the entire clone army, the costumes are spot on, the supporting actors especially Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Frank Oz, Natalie Portman (who brings emotional depth to Padme), Samuel L. Jackson and the late Christopher Lee as Count Dooku (who makes for a great effective villain) did a great job, and the action sequences are some of the best since the original Star Wars trilogy.Overall, Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones isn't a great movie and doesn't hold up well after 20 years, but it's a serviceable entry of the prequel trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Over hyped rubbish maybe even worse than Episode 1,"I saw an advanced screening of this, and was extremely disappointed. Lucas said that it would be better than Episode 1, but that is debatable.

While the special effects are impressive, its no better that what has been seen many times before, in far better films.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Still Better Than People Will Say,"'Attack of the Clones' has good and bad, and, traditionally, we'll start with the bad.The worst complaint I have is that george Lucas abandoned the 'innocent boy' tagline and had Anakin in love with Padme BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO KNOW WHO HE IS NOW! In his first scene (in an elevator), he's getting pimped up to Padme! This forced love affair naturally taints the rest of the movie with horrible lovelines, 'Sand gets everywhere,' and overall, a horribly done lovestory. Had Anakin developed an interest during the movie instead before it even begins, the story could've had some stronger points. Plus, no offense George, but I tried using the 'You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams' line and got slapped for it. The other bad thing was the acting - particularly the boring tone Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman have concerning things. Uh, hello? At least TRY to look concerned? Plus, once on the small screen, the visuals aren't that great.Now . . . magicially, this film DOES get its audience comfortable with the evironment, and while people criticize this movie as having long, boring scenes, I think the scenes prolong the audience to get involved in the adventure (even if it hasn't really started yet). In short, it develops the story almost perfectly. In fact, very well. Simply put, this isn't the main point of the prequel trilogy. Knowing that, this is part II, the DEVELOPING part. Episode III is (in this case) the EXECUTION, where the author says, 'This is what the story is about.'Episode II stumbles a lot, but, along with great visuals throughout, it gets its audience comfortable with the evironment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie!,"George Lucas returns to his roots and produces the second best Star Wars movie overall (after The Empire Strikes Back).  The action, adventure, sense of wonder and sense of humor which were noticeably absent from The Phantom Menace (except in parts) are all back with a vengeance.  Thankfully, Jar Jar Binks screen time is limited, though oddly enough his time on screen still managed to be so awkward and hackneyed that it made me wince.  By far, however, the biggest reason why AOTC cannot score higher than an 8 out 10 in this reviewer's mind is due to the idiotic dialogue between Amadala and Anakin during their love scenes.  The scripting in these parts is absolutely horrible to the point that my date and I were literally laughing out loud during the scenes.  In some movies if a scene doesn't go over right it can make you squirm or even feel a little embarrassed.  The dialogue and, consequently, the acting in these love scenes was so bad that all we could do was shake our heads and laugh.  From what we could tell, everyone else in the packed theater felt exactly the same way with several people giggling, shaking their heads, or simply resting their heads in their hands trying to hide their eyes.  Lucas is a genius at times when it comes to dreaming up these far away locales and the action scenes in this film are incredible and very impressive.  But he needs to face facts: the guy does not have even a simple grasp of what a love scene should sound like or how two people in love should talk to each other.  Granted, we're talking about a distant galaxy where customs and speech patterns could realistically be quite different than ours, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is that it is just CHEESEY.  Regardless of anything else, you have to be able to appeal to the audience of today...and people today, for the most part, aren't going to take that kind of crap seriously.  When Anakin says to Amadala, ""I don't like sand...it's course...and it gets everywhere.  It's not like you...you're everything that is soft - and smooth"" it was all I could do to keep myself from literally rolling out of my seat.  My girlfriend and I, along with the rest of the theater sat there slack-jawed that the dialogue was that cheesey.  Believe me, there is a reason I have gone off on this one point for so long: it dropped an otherwise ""almost perfect"" movie down a couple of big notches.  If Lucas had any humility and could recognize his weaknesses as a screen-writer he would have brought in some help to re-write those scenes and to try to form a real bond and romance between the two main characters.  It would have made an otherwise very good, very entertaining movie nearly perfect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It's a prime example of more background and stuff happening doesn't necessarily make the film better, just more clogged up and flashy.Acting wise Ewan McGregor is downright fantastic as Obi-Wan, one of the best things of the film and Natalie Portman does a good job. In contrast Hayden Christensen is very poor and bland, robot like (he gets much better for Revenge of the Sith though!). The action is a bit too much as well, slicing through hoards of droids without any peril does get a bit boring after awhile and despite the brilliant Christopher Lee appearing he doesn't have as much screen time as I would have liked and the final lightsaber duel was a bit disappointing to me., although we do get to see Yoda fighting for the first time which is pretty neat!6/10: Very showy and exciting on first viewing but gets gradually worse and worse every rewatch, the plot's just not very gripping and doesn't alter much in the Star Wars universe overall.

Better than Spiderman,"I'll not provide a synopsis as most people already have or will. Here, you'll find what I liked and didn't. First off, I was impressed but there were some things that are still lacking. Thankfully Jar Jar was only in the film just a bit which has been highly publicized. The film had some good action in it, but it still felt like something was missing and I've come up with the answer, which I'll get to in a moment. The revisit to Tatooine was interesting, as was the 'car' chase. I'm a little annoyed with the Anakin/Padmé story though. There was too much about the romance which would've been fine if it had been deeper or better written. As it was, I was moved to boredom during some of it. Also, Christensen tended to overact leading me to somewhat blanch at his acting. If you take out the love story, and bite the bullet on Christensen's animation, the movie is very good indeed. The visual effects are simply stunning. The new digital Yoda was amazing. I would've never guessed he was digital if I didn't already know it. I kept looking for 'proof' and found it only once when Yoda spoke directly to Padmé. I give the movie 9 stars out of 10. I deduct only one star for the writing in the love story. I won't deduct for the overacting simply because it strikes me that the writing is what may have been the cause. Outside of that, it's an excellent film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Good movie,"I don't think it's exactly fair to bash George Lucas. Sure the Original Trilogies were great and you people only expected better and when Lucas didn't meet your demands you were disappointed. If you guys think about it, the story of this movie had to be focused around love or it wouldn't make sense. Now I know it wasn't a stellar performance by the actors but it isn't all their fault. Sometimes the director needs to help that. I must say though I am glad Hayden has moved on from being the whiny teenager in this movie and to a more mature Anakin Skywalker in ROTS.Overall, the special effects team did a fantastic job. It was insane on the things they did. I didn't think it looked like a video game. In my opinion it looked very real. It didn't look animated. They did a nice job with the Clone Wars and such.

I am aware that Lucas had much more money to spend and his company had advanced the CGI thing much further than was available in 1970's. Part of the charm of the original film was that everything looked used and battered- almost nothing in the earlier films looked that way. Hayden , simply, was not up to the job and had zero chemistry with Natalie, though we were told that was the reason for casting them. Ewan McGregor whom I rate as an actor was limited by his need to channel Sir Alec. I have watched these prequels 3 times and find my mind wandering which never happened with the original films. Mind you none of those first three had Jar Jar Binks - a mistake of gargantuan dimensions which seemed impossible for a filmmaker of Lucas' experience to make. Many of the characters had voices where it was difficult to catch what they were saying (Watto and Binks come to mind).

Consumed by grief and hatred Anakin is slipping towards the dark side, but he's still loyal to Obi-Wan and goes to rescue him.They are all captured and nearly killed by monsters in the arena, but the Jedi fly to the rescue led by Mace and Yoda and the clones!! A terrific final battle between Yoda and Count Dooku is one of the best lightsabre duels in history. For those who question this, note Yoda's lightsaber in Episode 5. Anakin loses his arm, but gains Padme, she marries him in secret on Naboo and the fate of the Galaxy is sealed as Palpatine becomes supreme chancellor of the Senate.Marred by an overly long speeder pursuit through Coruscant and a unneeded droid factory sequence, Episode two falls short of the other films, but the John Williams sweeping, romantic score, ""Across the Stars"" and the excellent FX, make this a winner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fabulous Sci-fi,"I enjoy these movies as individual sci-fi pieces and every one has been better than the one before, culminating in Clones. I also feel that the story line has gotten less childish with each new movie.The scenes on Coruscant are compelling. The titanic buildings and endlessly developed surface are alien to our experience and a wonder to behold.The special effects are astounding. In fact, every major chapter of the movie is a work of genius. George Lucas is a treasure to movie making as are Spielberg, Eastwood and Tarantin. What a great time to be a moviegoer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My six year old sister's FAVORITE Star Wars episode,"Star Wars episode 2: Attack of the Clones is an awesome movie which continues 10 years after episode 1: Phantom Menace and a few years before episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. If you like Star Wars, then you'll love episode 2! There are great action scenes , forbidden love scenes , mystery , and a great storyline. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Star Wars fan and who has already seen episodes 4 , 5 , 6 ,& 1 in that order. This movie is great for kids(I'm 13) and adults of all ages but not very young children under the age of 4 (they might get scared). Even my 6 year old sister likes it, especially the ending. I gave this movie a 10 because it is well put together and it me laugh during certain scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Overblown, overhyped and overdrawn; the worst Star Wars yet","While George Lucas's previous Star Wars film, The Phantom Menace, was not without its faults, it at least had its heart in the right place.  It retained some of the sense of fun and excitement the original films had about them, even if it was too childish for most of the series' long-time fans.  The original films were all about the entertainment value, and even in these films' darkest parts during the third acts of Empire and Jedi these films were engaging and supremely entertaining.In his fifth Star Wars film (the second in the story chronologically) Lucas mistakes drawn out melodrama for emotional engagement and replaces entertaining sequences with action that seems tacked on as an afterthought and often feels redundant and out of place.  The romance between Padme and Anakin is downright painful to watch, the Jedi apprentice's first steps toward the dark side are handled in a clumsy manner, and neither Christensen nor Portman connect with the audience - or each other for that matter. This is like a very bad fan-fiction with expensive special effects.The screenplay is rotten.  The charming one-liners of the original trilogy are replaced with lifeless and ridiculous pieces of dialogue Lucas mistakes for wit.  While the lacklustre delivery in almost every scene doesn't help (even the usually brilliant McGreggor is drab and uninteresting), the terrible screenwriting just makes it worse.  ""This party's over"" (Mace Windu); ""This is such a drag"" (a beheaded C-3PO) and the overplayed dialogue between Kenobi and Skywalker during the speeder chase are just a few examples of the supreme cheese this screenplay offers.The effects are good, but used badly.  I love a good special effects sequence as much as the next guy, but I'd rather watch something that's clearly physically real on camera (a good model sequence for instance) augmented by computer effects.  The likes of The Matrix and The Fifth Element and to a lesser extent Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy delivered here where Lucas depends on computers to a fault.  Jackson's films are shot wherever possible in real locations using real actors and excellent creature make up (like the original Star Wars films) rather than horrible clearly computer generated creatures like 'Dex' and 'Jar Jar' and computer generated environments (Geonosis) in Lucas's films.The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, like the recent Matrix sequels Reloaded and Revolutions make the mistake of doing everything with computers and the illusion of a believable world is lost.  It just doesn't look real. The battle sequences at the end of both The Matrix Revolutions and Attack of the Clones suffer from too much computer generated effects and the illusion of a 'galaxy far far away' is replaced by the 'computer game lookalike at the arcade'.At the end of the day though, beyond the special effect-heavy visuals and clunky screenplay, Attack of the Clones basically suffers mostly from poor storytelling.  It's a boring story that's paced badly through Lucas's poor direction and let down by crap dialogue and acting. We can only hope that Lucas responds to criticism and delivers a third prequel that actually delivers on some of the promise created in the original trilogy.  At the moment however, there's nothing to indicate there's anything more on the way than another wooden computer generated feature film to put the final nail in the Star Wars coffin.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

You have got to be kidding!,"Is this really all that $130 million buys these days?  This was junk.  The special effects don't even look good.  The writing?  I beg of you, Mr. Lucas, please PLEASE let someone else write the next installment.  And as for originality, could the movie have ripped off THE FIFTH ELEMENT any more (and done it worse?)? -- I sure hope they forked over some serious cash to Luc Besson, because they are HIS creatures (minus the robots that were borrowed from AI).A year before this film came out, the movie going public punished a film by Steven Spielberg called AI.  People just didn't go to see a film about a robot boy trying to become human.  I guess people would rather opt for ""entertainment"" such as ATTACK OF THE CLONES or THE SCORPION KING, films where there is an abhorrent lack of original thought.  And sure, George Lucas has come out saying that measuring anything against the original three films of the STAR WARS series is unfair because of how good they really are. What does that say?  That now we should be happy enough to settle for something less than great?  That we should be happy forking over $10 so that some centillionaire out in CA can play with digital images and completely forego any script?  Well, Mr. Lucas, your plan would work if not for your friend Mr. Spielberg.  Unlike Mr. Lucas, Mr. Spielberg seems to find new and exciting ways to challenge himself and his audience -- and if one were to go by AIs box office performance, one would say that he is, unfortunately, losing the fight.  To paraphrase ""You are what you watch.""  Keep paying Mr. Lucas for utter crap like this and I'm sure he'll be more than happy to keep feeding it to you.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Attack of the cartoons.,"I have seen this movie many times, and that is a understatement. When my family got the DVD about 8 years ago me and my brother would watch it together. At the time, the movie had enough eye candy visuals to keep us mentally stimulated and fixed to the screen. Well, for me anyways. Sometimes my brother would fall asleep. I really liked the movie then, and now 8 years later, I still like it. I like it still even after reading all the negative reviews I could find out there, including red letter media. I popped the DVD in again after years of watching it the other day, and I was struck with a realization that so many others seemed to have realized long before hand. This movie really is a bad movie. Now this is all subjective how one feels about this movie I understand, but I finally realized personally that yes, this is a bad movie. A bad movie indeed. Most strikingly it was the CGI that I noticed had not stood up well over time. The movie looks almost like a cartoon now. And the movie seems more childish than I remember. That was my initial feeling after seeing this movie after so many years. It simply has not held up well visually. I cringe now at the love scenes between Anakin and Padame. I see fallacies within. Stiff, forced acting. I can go on and on, but other people have reviewed this movie analytically better than I could ever. One thing that was interesting is that I never cared much for the originals growing up. It was the prequels that sparked my interest in Star Wars and then I began to watch the originals. After going back to the prequels I realized how inferior they are compared to the originals. The OT felt real. The PT, more like cartoons, Attack of the clones more so than the others. After it is all said and done, I still enjoy this movie, although I'm still trying to figure out exactly why I do. Perhaps I have an affinity for B movies. Attack of the clones is one of the best B movies there is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good Action, Entertaining, Bad Acting, Terrible dialouge.",Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones made me smile and get pumped up for the third one but then it mad me sick sometimes and it just made me wonder what happened. Now I liked the action a lot in this movie. I mean I've never had one complain over the action. The fights were neat and the battles were energetic. This movie was quite entertaining. It really didn't get you bored until the romance. Now the acting was horrific. Hayden Christensen should be fired. He is so bad at acting and should just call it quits. Ewan McGregor improved but Natalie Portman doesn't pull it off. The dialouge was also terrible. Everything Anakin said in the movie was stupid and just didn't sound good. I hope he can improve in the 3rd film of the Star Wars new version trilogy and the 3rd film better be in equals with the old version.Hedeen's outlook: 6.5/10,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"11/10, a must see!","Personally I've never gotten this whole ""1 2 and 3, 4 5 and 6 wahwahwah"" separation business. Where someone will split it into this ""prequel trilogy sequel trilogy"" crapola and make enemies with episodes 1 2 and 3. And plus, I think prequel is wrong English anyway because prequel means before the FIRST one I believe. It can't englishally be before the 4th one, it has to be before the 1st (like negative numbers). They're all phenomenal and if you don't want to read the rest just read this line: that Star Wars Episode II (2) is easily one of the best in the entire sixtilogy. But they all are at the end of the day.Anyway, I'm not saying if you've seen the movie billions of times you're going to be as thrilled the billion & one'th time, as many old watchers get blanded out at every movie saying ""yeah he flipped over the thing so what, oh he fought the bad guy, movies are all the same..."" This movie is for your prime in life when you're young and kicking. You've got to have the fresh perspective of the 1990s, where everything is gold. I personally get a bit yawny when I watch ANYTHING now because I saw it all too much as a kid LOL.That aside, the movie is flawless. The only MINOR mistakes to note are that there wasn't enough lightsaber on lightsaber candy. But again, that's because I want more after seeing it thousands of times. Everything else is good. Music is good, Story is amazing, flow is perfect, acting is actually phenomenal (I'd like to see you random fat angry hater people act out Anakin without sounding like a complete nerd). People hated this movie for no reason. Poor them, they missed out on one of the greatest cinema masterpieces of the world. Great action, still waters my mouth to this day. Surprisingly good dialogue.But careful, some scenes can induce nightmares! If your kids don't know how to get into 90s' style movies then they'll sit there blankly not getting it (and hence they won't get scared probably). BUT, if they know how to watch movies (the open way), then they may get scared a bit. But it's okay, it all evens out.11/10! Easily one of the best of all 6.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Looks Great! Sounds Awful! (and we ain't talking about the brilliant sound effects),"First off, George Lucas is an elite for having so much influence on the art of movies; and why we go to them. He's put his hard earned millions back into improving the art form, so story tellers can better realize their vision on film (& digital). He constantly pushes the envelope to take the medium into new and wonderful directions. And he has vision!His 'THX' and 'Industrial Light and Magic' companies have elevated films to a brilliant quality thought unreachable. He is unquestionably a movie maker. But recently, he's fallen far short as movie director. And as for writing dialogue...it's spotty at best (even with help).And that is the problem with 'Attack of the Clones'. I so very much wanted to like this movie alot more than I did. And I do like alot of it. It has many, many grand moments. But the problem stems from the fact that Lucas, simply put, is wearing too many hats. By itself, directing is a huge undertaking. So is producing! And so is writing! And how many different companies does he head?? With so many talented directors and dialogue writers...it's not like he didn't have the money to invest in them. It would have been better if he had 'kicked himself upstairs to executive producing'(again), bit the bullet and allowed some talented people who know their jobs to step in to help bring his vision to life.Ya git what ya pay for! And because he took on so many duties himself, he didn't have to pay out the extra money (or points). So his talent is spread pretty thin.Where did the money go toward? The fantastic special effects and the digital domain. The movie looks...stunning!!! The visuals are like a work of art AND a work of genius. Great color spectrum! The sets are wildly imaginative with little dashes of familiar cultures sprinkled through out. 'Star Wars' has always been synonymous with 'eye candy' and 'Attack...' is no exception.But it's hard not to cringe at some of the dialogue that even insults the intelligence of a 12 year old (my 10 year old picked that up on his own). If money was the issue; then Lucas should of sold barf bags during the Ani/Padme love scenes at 10 cents each. That alone would have netted him a billion dollars.Three years ago, I assumed Lucas' administration duties made him a tad rusty for directing (& writing) 'The Phantom Menace'. And that things would improve with the next chapter (and there was alot I liked about '...Menace', and alot I didn't). But the warning bells began to sound during a theatrical preview for '...Clones' in December of 2001 when Padme recited that god-awful line, ""Ani??? My Goodness! You've grown!!"". Uh-oh! Here we go again!'Empire Strikes Back' remains in my top 10 faves! It's a landmark film because: it improves upon the original (arguably); has better special effects than the original; and dares to end in a cliffhanger. Most importantly: the acting; the direction; and the dialogue is more mature and more natural. The actors are also more natural delivering their lines with a more leisurely pace. It bridges that difficult gap of giving equal entertainment to both children and adults. Screen writer Leigh Bracket (for 'Empire...') whose credits include 1946's 'The Big Sleep', is a far cry from choosing a screen writer who wrote 'The Scorpion King??'. The difference in quality is obvious.(A hypothetical example: In 'Empire Strikes Back', Han and Leia are escaping from the ice planet Hoth during the Empire's assault on the planet surface. As 3PO lags behind, Han yells, ""Hurry up, Goldenrod! or you're gonna be a permanent resident."" That line, in the new films are on the quality of, ""Come-on, 3PO! Run faster or they're gonna catch us."" See the difference?)'AOTC' actors have already proven their talent in other movies. But when actors are forced to spout kindergarten dialogue, get substandard direction AND work off a blue screen: it's just too big a challenge that's gonna result in getting them unfairly lamblasted by fans and critics alike. Audiences don't need characters to spoon feed them dialogue that tells them what's going on, while the audience can already SEE what the screen is already SHOWING them what is going on. Too bad the film makers didn't realize that 'audience intelligence' and 'film language subtlety' make a wonderful marriage.And Lucas can be a good director...he proved that with 'American Graffiti' (another movie that broke the rules...successfully). But he's just wearing too many hats of responsibility.AND JUST FOR FUN! What's with that name Count ""DooKu""?? Sounds like a messy case of dog diarrhea left steaming on someone's carpet.Or Yoda's quick wit when he tells Dooku (that name again), ""I sense the dark side in you"". OH REALLY??? Let's give Yoda a gold medal as 'Champion of the Obvious'.And how we're supposed to believe Padme is a great politician, when it seems her biggest contribution to the Republic is breaking the record for the most wardrobe changes in one hour.And speaking of her wardrobe...ain't she 'The Tease'!!! while wagging her finger ""No! No!"" at Ani's advances.And speaking of Annie!!! (I know it's spelled Ani...but still). Is anyone else uncomfortable that there's gonna be an ""Annie"" under Vader's helmet??? Why not ""Gertrude""??? Or ""Patty""!!!The direction the prequels are heading for is turning A New Hope for episode 3, into A No Hope!I, along with millions of movie lovers, am forever grateful for Lucas in providing hundreds of hours of repeat entertainment he has created with the Star Wars universe. This has NEVER been a story of the future (even though it's so often erroneously referred to as a story that takes place in the future). His mythology will continue to entertain generations for a long time to come.As the logo for 'THX' says, ""The Audience Is Listening"". Besides movie magic special effects...the audience listens to dialogue too, something the film makers forgot.The DVD does sound phenomonal! And I'm happy to own it (for the kids sake, of course).For Episode 3...if I hear that line one more time: ""I have a bad feeling about this!"", I may start looking around to make sure I know where the exit signs are.But I still feel indebted for 'Star Wars' for giving sights & sounds never heard before. And love that homage to Ray Harryhausen!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An monstrous piece of rubbish,"This is possibly the worst movie I have seen all year. Although I have enjoyed myself watching it. I mean the acting was truly amazing, but sadly in a wrong way. Anakin's acting was particularly bad.The plotline about a recalcitrant adolescent was simply retarded. Also I couldn't care less if the senator and anakin liked eachother. And what's with this 8 jear old boy who can't get this woman off his mind??? Wasn't he a bit too ,excusez le mot, horny for his age??? Also anakin has no charisma whatsoever. You probably noticed that I really didn't like this guy.Everything was wrong with this film. With the ridiculous title begins it...It was horribly boring. The story is weak throughout the whole movie. The chase in the beginning was laughable (the jogging lady) as was a lot of other stuff in this movie(yoda's fight). The music was incompatible with the daft acting, but did accidentaly add an element of comedy to the movie, which is a little plus for this otherwise atrocious movie. I would say that Episode II is a poorly directed clone of an old shakespeare-play, without the content and the wits of such a play and that it is a direct attack on my intellect and the intellect of many others who payed to see this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Waste of Everything for Everybody,"I've been a Star Wars fan ever since I was a baby, when I was shown the first movie theatrically.  I've seen the original trilogy more times than I can count.  While I was at the premiere of ""Episode I"", I was sorely disappointed, and after the high of seeing a new Star Wars movie wore off, I was even more so.  So it was with great trepidation that I purchased my ticket for ""Episode II.""  What greeted me was one of the worst films this side of ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000.""While I've seen my share of bad films, very rarely have I actually had to suppress the urge to riot (the only other time was during a screening of ""Heavy Metal"").  If you don't know the story, here are the basics: Anakin Skywalker, who we all know will one day become the eeeeevil Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen), and his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are sent to guard now-Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman) from a bounty hunter.  There are vehicle chases, monster battles, light sabre duels, and what I think was supposed to be a romantic interlude but came off like a commercial for feminine hygiene products.Again, with amazing clarity, George Lucas has demonstrated that he is unable to direct anything with a pulse.  We have a group of fine actors here (including Christopher Lee and Samuel L. Jackson) who all come off as wooden and lacking in any depth, although I think this may be Hayden Christensen's natural state of being.  The plot is needlessly complex and illogical, and situations seem to exist only to bring about certain scenes that allow Lucas to say ""Look what I can do! Aren't I cool?"".  The film displays an amount of fan service that would embarrass the animators at Go Nagai (""Cutey Honey"", ""Devil Lady"").  And don't even mention the painful and stilted dialogue that makes me long for when Ed Wood was in his heyday.And the special effects.  Let's not forget those.  How can we, when 80% of the movie is computer-generated, including most of the cast?  Peter Jackson has proven that CGI effects CAN be incorporated seamlessly into a movie with a much smaller and less prestigious studio than Industrial Light & Magic (I dare anyone who's seen Gollum in ""The Two Towers"" to tell me Jar Jar Binks is better).  And ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" proved that digital actors can be even more expressive than some of the flesh-and-blood humans that Lucas directs, so there is no excuse for the static and uninspiring effects Lucas so lavishly fills his movie with.Virtually nothing about this film works.  Not the computer-generated Yoda, not the boy band-castoff looks of Hayden Christensen, not the derivative and painfully stale John Williams score (it's a sad state to be in when you rip off yourself), and certainly not Natalie Portman's costumes, which keep reminding us that she's now of legal age.  Unfortunately, there are enough over-zealous fans of George Lucas out there to ensure that his movies make far more money than they deserve to, encouraging him to make more and more of these mindless, overblown faux-mythological epics.All in all, this experience of this movie is little more than watching a friend play a video game to show you all the cool things in it, but all you want to do is go out to dinner.  I give the movie 2 out of 10, mainly because it's only slightly easier to watch than ""Battlefield Earth.""",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Anakin's Story Continues,"Ten years after The Phantom Menace, Anakin Skywalker is the rambunctious apprentice to Obi- Wan Kenobi. The two of them confront Padme after several years as they are informed that several assassination attempts occurred trying to claim her life. As Anakin is assigned to protect Padme, the two of them are shipped off to Naboo while Obi-Wan tries to track down the ones responsible, leading him to Kamino where a massive clone army is being built. Meanwhile, Anakin continues having nightmares about his mother and heads to Tatooine to save her, meeting his step brother Owen Lars and his step father Cliegg Lars, who informs him that she was abducted by Tusken Raiders. Going to the Tusken Raider village, he talks to his mom for the first time in a long time, just before she dies, sending Anakin in a rage and causing him to massacre the entire village. At the same time, Obi-Wan is lead to Geonosis where he discovers that the wicked Count Dooku is behind the attacks on Padme's life. As Obi-Wan is captured, Anakin and Padme go to rescue him, unwillingly getting thrust into the battle droid manufacturing plant.They too are eventually captured by Dooku's enforcer, Jango Fett (Boba Fett's daddy-o) and are to be executed at the mouths of several wild Genosian creatures. Eventually, the jedi arrive and take on the incoming battle droids, then Yoda comes with the Clone Army, then Anakin and Obi-Wan take on Dooku, then Anakin gets his arm cut off, then Yoda comes in to kick Dooku's tush, then Anakin and Padme get married, then the Clone Wars begin.If the plot of Episode II: Attack of the Clones sounds complicated, that's because it is. I think it's the most complex and befuddling of the saga, but that doesn't mean in the slightest that it is horrendous. In fact, it's a tad superior than The Phantom Menace, at least in my book. It has some of the best oohs and aahs out of the entire prequel trilogy, and seeing Yoda pull out a green saber is enough to make this film worth wild for me. As a kid, I always wanted to see him fight like a jedi, and seeing him do so in this film was like a fantasy come true. Some will argue that him using a lightsaber goes against all the wisdom he spoke of in The Empire Strikes Back, but you gotta remember that takes place many years after Attack of the Clones. Yoda's perspective has changed drastically by that point, and when he says ""War does not make one great"", he's talking out of experience. There are many other things in this film that fill me with glee. Seeing Obi-Wan put up a fight with Jango Fett on Kamino's rainy surface, it was one of Obi-Wan's greatest moments out of the entire saga. Seeing a feisty and ambitious young Boba Fett before he puts on the Mandalorian armor, it added so much depth to his character and made him a bit more understandable in Empire and Jedi, especially after Mace Windu's purple lightsaber meets his father Jango's neck, decapitating him. Seeing Padme in beautiful, revealing gowns, it made many of us guys drool like dogs. Anakin's one lucky dude.Speaking of Anakin, one of the biggest complaints about Clones is that he is too whiny. Hayden Christensen gets picked on by so much by critics and members of the media for his portrayal of pre-Vader. But just stop and think for a while. Anakin is about 19-20 years old in this film. He has grown up, and is dealing with a lot of the things us teenagers deal with in real life. When we first met him in Phantom, he was an optimistic, dreaming little fellow who was looking forward to becoming a jedi. Now, 10 years have gone by, and the life of a jedi has torn him apart. He wants power, he wants to break free from the shackles the jedi have him in, he wants to do things no person has ever done before. Anakin's transformation in Clones really shows how someone can be torn apart by their dreams and want to undo everything they did in the past. Hayden Christensen really hits the nail right on the head, capturing Anakin's innocence, arrogance, and lust for unnatural abilities.But I think that Christopher Lee's Count Dooku really steals the show and comes off as a space version of his famous Dracula character from the Hammer Horror films. I think Dooku is the most wicked out of all the Sithlords in these films, even more wicked than Vader and Maul. He just has that electrifying presence every time he enters the room and when he pulls out that curved lightsaber and shoots his lightning bolts, you can tell he's gonna do business, and that business is not going to be good. I also must praise Ewan Macgregor as Obi-Wan and Natalie Portman as Padme, for their performances have really improved since the last film and they seem to fit more into their roles in this film. And kudos to Samuel L. Jackson for kicking a lot of droid behind in the Geonosian arena with his purple lightsaber.Although the special effects can be rubbery at times, they really look appealing and fantasy like. The effects on the clones, the digital Yoda, the Geonosians, the republic spacecrafts and gunships, they bring in a retro appeal and stick out tremendously among all the other scenery in the film. Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones may very well be the most visually appealing out of the entire saga, and when you watch this film, you instantly get sucked into the film's many environments and become part of the action and suspense.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Something is missing,"Like I said when I did the review of season 1, SW is my childhood and I love every SW movie. However, it is difficult to admit that this is a perfect part. Things started off very promising, I enjoyed the humorous dialogues between the characters, besides the perfect makeup, hair and costumes, the characters in this part are all interesting in their own way. However the storytelling of this part seems to be problematic, every segment is easily cut in the middle, which makes it like we don't understand what the characters are feeling, and the part where Padme confesses her feelings to Anakin because she thought she was going to die, then she quickly untied herself and escaped, isn't this too ridiculous? The character Anakin, who would later become Darth Vader, behaves quite strangely, like a spoiled brat with school problems, a far from Anakin in part 1. And the lightsaber battle as well, not so special, if I don't want to say, boring. Anyway, I'm also impressed with the setting in the movie, the production design, wow I just wanted to say that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"An Underrated Masterpiece, Totally Undeserving of Its Hatred","A year ago, I reviewed Joe Johnston's much maligned ""The Wolfman"", calling it the most under-appreciated film in cinematic history, praising it for its acting, characters and thematic depth. While ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" isn't AS amazing as ""The Wolfman"", it is one of only a handful of films that can give it a run for its money in the underrated department. I will even go so far as to call it one of the top 100 greatest films ever made. An unpopular opinion, no doubt, but one I fervently believe.The characters are the most relatable, deep and interesting that the franchise had to offer at the time of ""Episode II""'s release. Anakin Skywalker, despite his great power and potential as a Jedi, is about as hopelessly dorky as a teenager could possibly be. His passion and love for Padme Amidala is matched only by his total awkwardness around her. Anakin is burdened with heavy responsibility and very little appreciation or love. His identity as a Jedi directly juxtaposes his rising feelings throughout the film of romance, anger, hopelessness and, most dangerous of all, fear. Only around Padme does he open up emotionally. Similarly, Padme tries throughout the movie to give of the impression that she is an emotionally detached professional, putting her career and responsibilities over any attachments or feelings she may have. Even around Anakin, she distances herself emotionally, insisting that she must live a lie for the good of the Republic. Over the course of the movie, both Anakin and Padme learn how to be more emotionally open in a healthy way, and the film does a great job showing both the positives of being open and honest with our loved ones and the negatives of bottling up such strong emotions. (Particularly in a rather chilling scene where Anakin attempts to rescue his mother from the monstrous Tusken Raiders.) Obi Wan Kenobi is also a far more relatable and likable character than he has ever been in the Saga before, a strict, ""tough love"" father figure who struggles to let go of his fear for Anakin's safety. The abundance of fondness yet lack of trust between Anakin and Obi Wan make for a fascinating friendship, an improved Ewan McGregor brings much more warmth and intensity to Obi Wan this time around in a great performance.Hayden Christensen, the subject of much undeserved criticism, is outstanding as Anakin Skywalker. Christensen walks a very fine line between the subtle, restrained (But not at all wooden, despite what some may say) public stoicism and the burning, uncontrollable private passion of Anakin. His more intense scenes, namely his emotional, albeit awkward, confession of love to Padme by a fireplace and his horrified, self loathing confession to the slaughter of the Tusken Raiders (His mother's murderers) are top notch. Christensen's performance here isn't just one of the best performances in the ""Star Wars"" saga, but in the Science Fantasy genre PERIOD.Natalie Portman gives much more depth to Padme's detachment than she gave in ""The Phantom Menace."" Here, we see that detachment as somewhat of a defense mechanism to prevent emotional vulnerability, and while Portman is often subdued in her performance, she makes it very clear in her voice acting and tone of voice that her constant repression of her emotions is killing her. TERRIBLE dialogue (And it IS, admittedly, terrible) aside, her confession of reciprocation for Anakin's feelings in the Geonosian Colosseum is bursting with sincerity.""Attack of the Clones"" was also, in my opinion, the most emotional ""Star Wars"" movie to date until ""Episode III."" Anakin's inner torment over his feelings for Padme is investing enough, but his growing fear of his mother's fate culminating in her horrible death is heartbreaking.The lightsaber duel between Count Dooku and Anakin is both expertly choreographed and thematically fascinating; Count Dooku, an intimidating, ""ends justify the means"" gentleman Sith and former Jedi is extremely similar in character profile to Darth Vader, something conveyed quite well visually as Anakin and Dooku's red and blue lightsaber blades seemingly ""switch"" in the dark hangar where they do battle. It only makes sense that this is the battle where Anakin would lose his hand; the small, first step in his inevitable physical transformation into Darth Vader.Remember in my previously mentioned review of ""The Wolfman"" where I mentioned that I found most Science Fantasy romances to be forced or unnecessary? This is an exception, despite what many critics may claim. There is a genuine and almost ""adorkable"" awkwardness and innocence to Anakin & Padme's relationship, these being VERY inexperienced lovers who have never had these feelings for anyone else. Awkwardness aside, there is genuine sincerity and empathy for one another present in Anakin & Padme that gives their romance depth; these two characters fall in love largely due to a deep understanding of one another, particularly their struggles. Padme sympathizes with Anakin's desire to be loved and Anakin sympathizes with Padme's frustration at being forced to shut out everyone close to her. Portman and Christensen have downright precious chemistry on screen which more than makes up for some more than questionable lines.The imagery in this film is gorgeous, visually it is a work of art. Shots like Anakin racing across Tattoine on his speeder bike, the Clone army's ominous first reveal and Anakin & Padme's wedding next to a Naboo lake illuminated by the setting sun are beautiful and unforgettable. The cinematography brings true romanticism to an already excellent love story.""Attack of the Clones"" is much more than merely an underrated film, it's an outstanding masterpiece of its genre. The borderline obsessive hate that its gotten really frustrates me, as I truly believe it deserves nothing but high praise. Here's hoping it will re-examined over the years and exposed for the gem it truly is. Is it flawless? No. But I can't begin to measure the value I got from it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Lucas improves after ""Phantom Menace""...","I have to admit, George Lucas has done better with ""Attack Of The Clones"" (though the title reeks of cheesy 50's sci-fi). While ""The Phantom Menace"" was style without substance, ""Attack Of The Clones"" delves deeper into the story, with Anakin drifting closer towards the Dark Side.I will start by saying I love the look of this movie. It seems that the darker storyline shows through the visuals. Every world depicted in this film mirrors the atmosphere of the plot. Even Naboo, previously a sunny, colorful planet, always seems covered in shadow, except when Anakin and Padme are growing closer together (moments of happiness in an otherwise dreary time). The world of Kamino, an ocean planet that would normally be a gorgeous blue marble, is constantly racked by raging storms. Its as if even the galaxy seems to predict its inevitable suffering.I wasn't as put off by the acting in this film. While some of it remains very wooden, there were some worthwhile performances this time around. I have come to believe that Ewan McGregor was probably the best choice to portray the young Obi-Wan Kenobi. The best performances in this film come from supporting stars Samuel L. Jackson, Ian McDiarmid, and Christopher Lee. I only have two problems with the casting in this movie: Hayden Christensen and the CGI Yoda. I just can't stand Christensen's acting in this film. While he is supposed to portray Anakin Skywalker as an angst-ridden teenager, he comes off as more of a pouting child. It seems as if he is more suitable for a teen-drama on the WB than as the man who is to become one of the most fearsome villains in movie history. As for Yoda, I just miss the puppet. I understand CGI is needed for scenes where there is a lot of movement, but I think the puppet worked best for close-ups and such. Maybe I am just nostalgic.The plot is thicker in this film compared to ""The Phantom Menace"" and drags at points, but there is always something right around the corner to pick it back up and drag you in. If Lucas keeps improving at this rate, I can't wait to see what happens with ""Revenge Of The Sith"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Oh My God,"How do I put this gingerly?  I'll get the good stuff out of the way first: Yoda kicked ass.  Obi-Wan kicked ass.Anyway, on to the rest.  Hayden Christiansen is a terrible (and I mean loathsome) actor.  He and Amidala have absolutely no chemistry together, and their romance seems to be shoved down the viewer's throat.  Hayden couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Ewan MacGreggor was excellent, however, and managed to play a good Alec Guinness. Back to the abomination of Episode 2, however.  The look of the film was great (visually stunning), but the story was contrived.  I don't get the whole cult following of Boba Fett.  This movie seems like a lot of exposition for a character that gets killed by a blind guy with a stick. I know in the books he has a bigger part, which brings me to the next problem with the whole new Star Wars thing.  I want to be able to pay $7.50 to see a movie and NOT need to spend an additional $30 on merchandise like books and comics to get character development which should have been shown in the film. Let me also say that Dooku was excellent.  Too bad he isn't in the movie hardly at all, and we don't know a damn thing about him -- at all.  I would like to know more about the villain's history, and not the history of the heroes (we already know that from Episodes 4-6). Don't get me wrong, I liked Episode I.  It actually flowed well together and had enough action to keep me occupied for two hours plus.  This failed in that regard until the very end of the movie.

"Blows ""Phantom Menace"" Out of the Water -- Though That's Pretty Faint Praise","This second installment in the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy is leaps and bounds better than ""The Phantom Menace,"" and there are moments in the film, unlike ""Phantom,"" when it begins to FEEL like a ""Star Wars"" movie.The little kid Disneyland quality that figured heavily in the first film for the most part gives way to a darker and more adult sensibility as Anakin grows into a young man. It doesn't help matters that Hayden Christiansen delivers a God-awful performance as Anakin, and that he plays a gradual descent into the dark side of the force like a petulant teenager who's been denied use of the family car. But more pieces of the puzzle that factor into the original trilogy click into place here, which makes it much more fun for ""Star Wars"" fans than ""The Phantom Menace.""

Send in the Klones-again! It's that good....,"I liked this. I enjoyed the big battles at the end, the Ray Harryhausen tribute in the Arena, and of course, Christopher Lee.

All the complaints you have heard-Hayden and Natalie being blocks of wood(yes), flat acting, bad dialogue-sure that is all true. I found it hard to sit thru their lovescenes without wanting to paraphrase what they were saying in a more realistic way. Naturalistic dialogue is prob. harder to write than it seems-but it can be done. Lucas should prob. not write the dialogue and let someone else(Steven S??) direct. It would help.What's good? The Car/chase/city scenes/Jetsons meets Dukes of Hazzard stuff. Very good, fun, roller coaster ride.  Boba and Jango are good. The fight on the clone base is good. Ewen MacGregor is quite good all thru here too; they just needed some equally believable performances from the leads too.There was an attempt to lighten it up-ala the pseudo-Han Solo asides of Kenobi's, more action, and I think that did help out. Lucas spends too much time on the techie side to make the drama work out as well's the action, and w/ the actors all working with blue screen-it prob. does get difficult for them to connect with what he wants.But no matter-more to like here than not.*** outta ****, Yes it's better than Phantom Fink Menace; and prob. better than Jedi too.

"Huge Improvement from Phantom Menace, better Plot and Performances,","Star Wars: Episode II- Attack of the Clones is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a mostly terrific cast. Most Star Wars fans won't consider it a work of art, but it is a huge improvement from the Phantom Menace no doubt, the story is well executed, the character development is much better and the comic relief is great, it was unbearable in Phantom Menace, with new character Jar Jar Binks being the main source of laughs, this time around it is back to C3P0, which made me very happy, his lines were genuinely funny and not just cringe to listen to. There are some poor moments in this film, while I do think Hayden Christensen shines in some scenes, particularly the one with his mother, he is very weak many times, particularly his parts with Natalie Portman, there is no chemistry between either of them, no indication of passion and all of their dialogue is very cliché, I think they wanted Anakin and Padmé's relationship to be the Han and Leia of the prequels, but they didn't succeed. The performances are much better this time around, Ewan McGregor steals the show as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he wasn't worth much praise in the first one, but this time he is playing a much older and wiser version of the character, which he delivered very well and is one of the highlights of the prequel trilogy, Christopher Lee is outstanding as the villain, though this film once again suffers from taking a ridiculously long time before introducing us to its main villain, there are also great performances from Samuel L. Jackson and, of course, voice actors Anthony Daniels and Frank Oz, who is given a bigger and better role as Yoda this time around that is sure to please fans. Though it may still be missing that sci-fi magic that is very evident in the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones is still a very enjoyable movie that should impress fans, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure or sci-fi film.When the Princess is almost killed, Obi-Wan sets out to find the bounty hunter and discovers an army of clones being developed against the Republic, meanwhile,Anakin and Padme start a relationship.Best Performance: Ewan McGregor Worst Performance: Natalie Portman",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Only a few things to say.,"First travesty: It took the sinister character of Darth Vader, the cold, calculating Dark Lord of the Sith, and turned him into Anakin Skywalker, a younger and stupider version of Robbie Coltrane's character from ""The Pope Must Die"".Second travesty: Jar Jar Binks. Again.Third travesty: When the Hell did Anakin Skywalker and Padme have this supposed romance? He went off to study right at the end of the first film, they don't see each other for 10 years, when he comes back they're talking about these feelings they had for each other. WHEN HE WAS ABOUT 8 YEARS OLD?Fourth travesty: It basically seemed less like a film, and more like a filler to explain a few things to us before we hopefully get a film with a plot that lasts more than 20 minutes.Fifth travesty: Anakin Skywalker's hair cut.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I think it's good.,"I think people are unreasonably hard on the prequels.I think people have an idea in their mind what a Star Wars Movie is supposed to look and feel like and because they have so much nostalgia for the originals (often since they saw them very young, before they'd seen many movies) that they subject the prequels to an impossibly standard.I don't want to make a case that they're some intellectual experience, they're the basic blockbuster experience. But so were episodes IV, V and VI. One doesn't owe it to a movie to like it, only to judge it by its own terms and I think, when viewed as a movie by itself or at least as a sequel to Phantom Menace, it brings everything one could have expected it to.The vivid science fiction world -building serves as our back drop to a haunting vision of a man drawn into dark forces by his own desire to protect his loved ones amidst a tale of political duplicity and war.Halliwell's described the romance as ""chocolate box"" and that's fair enough, but in a movie with a light sabre wielding Muppet, is that really that off-brand?With captivating action sequences, fascinating design and technology, a great sense of humor and characters I really do want to follow and cherish, it can be hard for a very serious science fiction/fantasy to judge its own tone well but unlike Lord of the Rings the prequels really come through for us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Proof that Phantom Menace wasn't a fluke,"Easily the worst in the SW franchise. No real character development, for anyone, and all characters are one-dimensional and dull. Even the passion from Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid fails to come through on screen - largely due to a poor script. CGI was unnecessarily forced, and it holds up the least of all the films by today's standards. Anakin's romance didn't hold me, and the film was oversaturated with lightsabers everywhere. In the originals, (and sequels), lightsabers were treats for the audience. Here, the tradition was broken hardest, in having the sheer volume of them on-screen at once.
The film also lacks any stand out moment, that all the other films have: Maul and pod racing from TPM; the transformation scene in ROTS; the trench run in ANH; Vader's reveal in ESB; the duel in ROTJ; Han's death in TFA; and Luke's death in TLJ.

A good film that holds it's own in the Star Wars Saga.,"First of all. In my mind. I don't have an idea of what the next Star Wars movie is supposed to be like. I don't create the movie in my mind and then get disappointed when it doesn't play out that way in the final version. That's one of the main problems with people critiquing these films. They all think they know how a Star Wars movies should be made. I go into these movies not knowing what to expect. I will give the negative critics a few things. Yes, the acting isn't the greatest. Especially Natalie Portman and Samual Jackson. I thought Hayden did an interesting job though. It was an odd performance if you ask me, but it worked. Ewan did a much better job then he did on Episode I. Christopher Lee was as good as always and Yoda rules, also. The computer effects get a little out of control some times. What I've noticed is how most negative reviews seem to only focus on the negative. As if there out to personally get George Lucas for not making the movie there way, but let me take you to the positive side with some questions.Didn't you think it was cool that JarJar Binks was barely in the film? and when he was used. It was in a clever way. Didn't you think Yoda commanding an Army during a battle was very cool? Didn't you think Obiwan investigating where the saber dart came from was fun? Didn't you like the Jedi Library? How about Yoda teaching the younglings? The chase through Coruscant? How about the space battle in the asteroid field? The way when an asteroid exploded. There is a silence for a few seconds. Why? It was strange. How about Wat Tambor of the Techno Union organization. The way he kept turning a dial on his chest to talk. What did that mean? I don't know, but it's stuff like that, that makes Star Wars so cool. They show the Death Star in the planning stages.You didn't think that was awesome? Anakin's rage? Anakin disobeying Obiwan and Obiwan yelling at him to do his duty. All the Jedi's battling at the end? The birth of what will one day become the Stormtroopers. The Clone war battle? Count Dooku? Jango Fett? The Music? Yoda fighting!!!!If you didn't likes these things. Then you've lost your innocence. You've been so bombarded with some many movies. So many images. So much computer effects at this point. That no matter what a Star Wars film does. It'll never satisfy you. Notice nobody mentions most of what I said. They try and take you only to the negative. I'm not saying this is the best Star Wars movie ever, but it was much better then Episode I, because it was closer to the world of Star Wars I grew up with. I enjoyed this film and I can't wait for the next one. The birth of Darth Vader.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Almost good,"For the first two thirds of Attack of the Clones, the film ranges from total mediocrity to passable entertainment to horrific boredom. The dialogue is rather awful, the plot developed in a hackneyed manner. A couple of the early action sequences are fun, especially the one involving Jango Fett, whose young clone is named Boba (Boba Fett fans will be given their money's worth in this one!). The love story with Queen Amidala and Anakin Skywalker is truly execrable. I wouldn't dismiss Hayden Christensen as many have already (Portman is actually the film's weakest link). Just by chance, I saw about 2/3 of Life As a House the night before I saw Star Wars, in which Christensen stars as a troubled teen, much as he does in Attack of the Clones. He's not a bad actor, really. I would more blame the inadequacy of the character on the writing. Lucas has no clue how to develop emotions on screen, at least in this character, without shoving it into the dialogue. The only success that Lucas has in the character is in an homage to The Searchers, where Annie (they really need to stop calling him this; he'll turn into Darth Vader just because everyone keeps insulting his manhood!) goes off into the deserts of Tatooine to rescue his mother from a group of Sand People. Lucas even quotes some of Ford's best shots.After this sequence, Anakin and Amidala are forced to run off to save Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor, who is, btw, much better here than he was in Ep. 1). There is a decent, but somewhat confusing action sequence involving Amidala stuck on a conveyor belt in a robot factory. Amidala and Anakin are captured and thrown into a colosseum and are forced to fight three giant monsters. From this point, Attack of the Clones can do (almost) no wrong. In the most impressive mid-film change of quality that I've ever seen, Attack begins to equal the best sequences in the first trilogy, and perhaps beat most of them. 45 or 50 minutes of straight excitement bring Attack of the Clones to a close, with C3PO's awful action movie one-liners being the only distraction. The obligatory lightsaber duel between Count Dooku and Obi-Wan and Anakin had me gripping the armrests in excitement, and the now infamous lightsaber duel between Dooku and Yoda had me clapping and laughing at the same time. Yoda still ranks as the best character in the series (he's especially great in this film). And then comes the final shot, which will make any Star Wars fan cringe in horror (but this time in a good way!). Fans who hated Episode I will appreciate the fact that Jar Jar Binks is the indirect cause of the Empire's rise to power. I still can't forgive the weakness of most of the film. It pulls itself together so well that it's tempting to let the whole film pass, but I have to give it, at the most, 6/10.P.S. On a second viewing, right after I saw the final installment of the series, Attack seemed quite a bit better, so I raised my score a point.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The worst in the series?,"Yes, of all six. At this point, nothing(or infinitely, insignificantly little) remains ""real"" in these movies. That, in itself, doesn't have to be a problem. But we can tell. It doesn't feel right. Sin City doesn't have this problem, nor does 300. The effects are, technically speaking, amazing, but nothing else in this really goes beyond being ""decent"". The romance lacks credibility(and yes, I am aware that some of it was left on the cutting room floor, but we're going by the finished product, not the intent). The overall story... well, Lucas gives many fans something they may have wanted in spite of there being absolutely no basis for it, and sacrifices it making sense in doing so. This tries too hard to tie in with the OT(which, I should point out so that no one mistakes me for someone who grew up with it, I didn't attentively view until Episode I was out). The dialog gets to be downright painful, with one even contradicting something in the first(written by the same guy, a few years earlier...!). The plot isn't that engaging, and things that ought to be in the next are here(and vice versa). The pacing is reasonable. The light-saber bits could be considerably better(they are particularly unimpressive compared to Phantom Menace), and at times, it's the tamest it's been since Return, although it isn't all bad. The action in general, mostly, it's just overdone, and goes on for too long. There are cool ideas and concepts, but their lackluster execution results in them merely being unable to be used soon by more talented film-makers. The title could be that of a 50's schlocky sci-fi flick. The battles do have notable, interesting aspects... in the editing and cinematography, mainly. The actors have put in solid performances elsewhere, or, at least, less embarrassing ones. Characters could stand improvement, and, you know, consistency. The score is still good. The DVD holds over a dozen(not all more than minutes long) featurettes, deleted scenes, trailers, TV-spots and a commentary.

An entertaining but faulted film,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was derided by fans of the original trilogy for a weakly plotted, childish tale that was George Lucas complaining about his tax bill. Because of this hopes for Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones were low. Luckily Attack of the Clones was a big improvement, but still does not match the heights of the original trilogy.10 years after the events of The Phantom Menace many star systems are attempting to break away from the Republic, led by a former Jedi Knight Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). Because of these events the Senate debate on whether to create a new army. One of the key players is Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), who becomes the target of an assassination. The Jedi Knights are called into action. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is assigned the mission to investigate the assassination attempt, whilst his young apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is asked to act as Padme's bodyguard. Obi-Wan Kenobi quickly discovers a wider conspiracy involving a clone army already been made for the Republic and the hunt for a bounty hunter, Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison). On Naboo Anakin and Padme start to fall in love with each other, despite it is forbidden by the Jedi code. Anakin also suffers from dreams about his mother and on the planet Tatooine explores his dark side. With war edging closer all the Jedi Knights are called into action.There are a number of reasons why Attack of the Clones is better then The Phantom Menace. There is a better plot and much more of a drive in this film, the lead up to a war. There is a hell of a lot of action in the film which will entertain most people with good moments throughout. The humour is better then it was in The Phantom Menace, relying more on witty lines then slapstick. It's basically a fun summer blockbuster. But there are still problems with Attack of the Clones. Whilst the story overall is better, there is no explanation on what the separatists want to achieve or what their ideology was. The dialogue was weak (which has never been Lucas' strong suit.) The love story between Anakin and Padme was not very interesting and disengaging. The acting too was weak and wooden, particularly Hayden Christensen; it seemed like he was casted because of his looks. The film itself is too long when it should be a fast paced adventure and Lucas was too reliant on CGI when the first three films had a more physical feel because they did not have the option of CGI back then.Overall, an entertaining, but faulted film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

If I compare it with the rest of the Star Wars films, this isn't better than the first trilogy, but it definitely surpasses 'The Phantom Menace' in every way, and it's not so childish as the 'TPM' and it stays strong to the story of Star Wars.The first part is not really great, because the love story between Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala is described too extensive. So don't expect much from the first part.The second part, now that's what Star Wars is really all about, laser guns, light sabers, great visual effects and a big pile of action. And you get to know a lot of links with the first trilogy, if you see it, you'll know what I mean.George Lucas did an excellent job with 'Attack Of The Clones', it makes 'TPM' totally forgettable. It's like it never has existed before. And we get to know a few new things, like R2-D2's flying skills, C-3PO his new head and most amazing of all, I'll say it in 2 words: YODA RULES!!!!!!!! I like George Lucas, but if there's one thing he can't do, is making good dialogues. But for the rest of the film, he did everything right what he did wrong in the first. So I thank him for that.

An improvement over Episode I,"Everyone knows that the prequel trilogy in the ""Star Wars"" universe is light-years far from the magical results George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan managed to pull off with the originals. However, I'm not inclined -like many hardcore fans- to completely destroy these movies as if they were some of the worst results in the history of cinema, and with Episode II, which I consider the halfway between the pretty bad I and the pretty good III, I have the chance to explain why. This film starts off as a pretty boring one, making the viewer fear for the worst, but as the plot progresses it shows its interesting political points and some impressive CGI scenes, if you consider that in the early 2000s this technology was the life itself for action/adventure motion pictures. It surely lacks the wonderfully amusing relationships and characters that developed in the originals (except C3PO and R2-D2, who are lovely as usual and are used in a more active way than ""Episode I""), and the ""love story"" between Anakin and Padmé is good only as a script, but fails on the actual complicity between the lead actors, who seem ashamed of taking on a romantic scene. That's one of the big problems here: Hayden Christensen is an awful actor and the single worst choice in the whole series of films also considering the key character he's entrusted with. Obviously he can't take all of the blame, as the man who should have directed him and the others in the right way apparently does nothing to help, with no acting direction at all (I hope!) and uninspired shots. That said, I will save this flick and brand it as an enjoyable one, when not considering the let-down you get knowing what kind of masterpieces George Lucas had been able to invent in the past (with the evidently needed help of his brilliant collaborators).Give up your anticipation for great characters and enjoy the great fights, chases and (titular) wars. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent. One of the best Star Wars episodes.,"I was astonished to see the relatively low rating on this one. I thought it was much better than the 1999 movie. I didn't see the 2005 movie but I'd like to see it. I've seen all the other ones also. I think the story of Anakin Skywalker is very compelling. The young boy who played Skywalker in the 1999 movie really did a good job, and there is some great acting in Attack of the Clones as well. For example, Christopher Lee in a menacing role. Moreover, I think there were some great focus on details and it had the flavor of the real Star Wars merchandise. The assassin-robot is just great. I mean, the mercenary. Moreover, from a science-fiction point of view it is hard to see anything more visionary these days than what came out of the Star Wars saga. George Lucas is a great visionary and has a great imagination which is also evident in the ""Lucasfilm"" computer-games such as Maniac Mansion and Zak McCracken. Games that had an enormous impact on me as a child. Now I look forward to watching the new Indiana Jones movie...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Saga continues in a wonderful dedicated film. (Possible Spooliers),"Even if you hate this film, you have to realize that it follows brillentally with the art of a great trilogy. Howard Stern said it best in his complaint ""It doesn't go anywhere"" well it's not really suppose to really go anywhere it's the second part in the Prequels and second part of the saga. The story evolves the saga into the teenage mood swings of Anakin, his evil and good events along with his lack of control. We also grow into Obi-Wan Kenobi as a more mature teacher struggling to pass on idea's of his old mentor while his student is recklessly pushing him away. There's Padme who is in a life crises, falls in love with a past hero, even though he is bad news and very obsessive. Then there is Y-O-D-A, in need not say more. Attack of the Clones follows the Star Wars formula into a fantastic space fantasy. A movie that has witty dialogue; sometimes it's stall, but that gives it quality. Overall, it is not perfect and it is not for everyone, but it is good clean fun!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but worst of prequels","This is a good movie to watch if your in the mood for a complex story, a lot of action, and great special effects, but it doesn't have as much entertainment as most of the others. The fights are good, like Dooku vs yoda, obi wan vs jango, mace windu vs jango, and anikan vs anikan. But it does have a pretty complex story that can get confusing, it a good movie, but don't try to understand the logic, your brain will explode. Episode 2 is fun, it's a nice ride that can really can make you head spin, for the most part, but the few times its boring, its really boring and almost ruins the film. But it has a good story, amazing special effects, decent acting, and interesting characters. I recommend it, even if your not a star wars fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Somehow Worse Than Phantom Menace!,"This movie is unbelievably disappointing. How can this movie possibly be related to any of the movies in the original trilogy.

Even worse than THE PHANTOM MENACE,"My comment about THE PHANTOM MENACE began thus: ""This movie is so unbelievably bad, it is almost unwatchable."" Upon returning from the theatre on opening day of this execrable fiasco, my friend asked me what I thought of it. I answered, ""Remember when I said The Phantom Menace was the worst movie of all time? Well, we have a new champion."" Lucas seems bent on redefining the movie-going experience as neither entertaining, thoughtful, uplifting nor fun. I have seen both of the first two ""new"" Star Wars movies, and could not tell you right now what the two sides are, or what they are fighting about. He has turned the battle for good and evil into a CGI version of a 3-hour John Kerry lecture about ""nuance."" This leads to the worst sin a movie (which is entertainment, after all) can commit - it is BORING. Where is the genius that brought us American Graffiti and the original STAR WARS trilogy? Gone, most likely gone forever. He will be missed.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Reliving the fun,"Before seeing the movie, I was a little nervous about the mixed reviews. After I had seen it, the negative critiques of the film were laughable to me. That was the last time that I ever took any movie critics seriously again.Don't be swayed by either side of the argument. See it with a free mind and be your own judge.If you haven't seen it yet though, you should try to watch it with a pretty good home theater system and a good size TV set. Because there is so much to seeand hear in this one.I'm not saying it's the best Star Wars movie yet, but was the most fun I had at the movies in some time.I see the whole Star Wars creation as a beautiful sand castle.

It's kind of nice to know that most people have enjoyed these movies, and they will be around for a long time for everyone to admire.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Where is Darth Vader when you need one !,"Simply, Briefly and Frankly..I remember watching it while my studying at the high cinema institute of Egypt. I was at the theater with some of my colleagues, and after we hardly finished it, we were truly angry, to the extent that one of us shouted: ""What a Junk!"".(Ewan McGregor) is no Obi-Wan Kenobi, he is just a modern star who can make money if you put his name on any movie. (Hayden Christensen) is one of the worst, hmmm... but (Ian McDiarmid), the man with the most disgusting performance, was here also, so one of them was the worst actor anyway (if not both!).The most painful thing was that you wouldn't understand ANYTHING. (George Lucas) and (Jonathan Hales) wrote a script that, save them, no one understood (perhaps they didn't either!). So with the weak performances, the huge momentum of CGI, the fast pace, the too serious, too stray, dialogue, and the many many story lines--I felt all the time a nightmarish maze that the movie got lost in it, and forced us to have the same fate as well!Putting in mind that I love the first saga, especially (The Empire Strikes Back - 1980) which was, and still is, one of the greatest action movies of all time--I think that the fans of the 1970s and 1980s trilogy will hate this new one as much as me. In my humble opinion, any lover of at least this prequel (if there is any!) will forget it, because it's adolescently made. Maybe some of whoever watched it while being a kid, will remember it someday, however for sensitive recalling of their childhood, only!Things I loved? Are you kidding me?! Even the climactic fencing was between cool and laughable! But let's say that (Natalie Portman) was the sole real thing in this; she is tender, and talented, though too little reason to face that tremendous stupidity monster, or survive that flood of torrential nonsense!Long story short, Darth Vader should have avenged on the makers of this!",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
the less achieved episode of the saga,"Part of the expectation arisen around Episode II..., is owed to the love story between Anakin and Padmé.  But lamentably, this ingredient of the movie had a so careless processing, that are the texts of the dialogues of the scenes of love, the ones that spoil all the assembly of the movie.  The lines said between Anakin and Padmé since their arrival to the Naboo lake retreat, until their arrival to Geonosis' execution arena, signified an attack for more than one spectator willing to become detractor of the movie. And to think that who did the roles of Anakin and Padmé were destroyed for their work in Episode II...! Their critics forgot that good actors or actresses do not supply what lacks in the script. To us (the spectators) remains the doubt of if we lost of something that remained in the editing room, or we owe to the scriptwriter the do not to have worked better the love scenes as was done with almost all the other ingredients of the movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Goosestepping to Hell,"I have had over a year and a half since I first saw ATTACK OF THE CLONES to process my reaction and try to understand most of the rancor directed toward it.Firstly, I can understand why everyone loves TWO TOWERS over ATTACK OF THE CLONES. In TWO TOWERS, the landscape of the battle between Good and Evil is in black and white.  In CLONES, it is a perfect shade of gray.You have the military/industrial complex (that is, the Trade Federation) attempting to assassinate Senator Amadala because she is the main and most significant opponent to the Military Creation act. You have Greys manufacturing human beings for warfare. You have a duplicitous head of state manufacturing unrest for seizure of power. Most of all, you have the possibility that organization (that being the Jedi council) served to protecting the Republic's interests may be behind the creation of the army.Hmmmm...except for the Grey manufacturing human beings for warfare, doesn't sound like something going on now?It has the first time that I watched a STAR WARS installment and wondered if Oliver Stone have a hand in it.Also, there is something interesting about Annakin Skywalker's descent to hell. The only other movie that comes to mind is AMERICAN HISTORY X, particularly the scene when Eric Vinyard (Edward Norton) kills the black gang-banger. It would be an understatement to say that Annakin's head was in the same place.That's what's disturbing about Annakin: he looks like a Backstreet Boy, but his action scream Hitler Youth.Also, I loved the immediacy Lucas gave the Battle of Geonosis, with swish pans and zooms into the action. The only thing it was missing was imbedded reporters.In short, CLONES excels and it is better written and acted than its detractors have given it credit. It just happens to deal with some things that people don't want to think about: the banality of evil.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
a saga which continues to spin downwards,"what is it with george lucas's direction? he creates overly-unbelievable story and abuse of technology in order to create tasteless characters and plotline. lost was the enchanment of the first star wars trilogy. lucas shows off the advanced technology of lucas film,ltd. making attack of the clones a marketing and promotion ground for it. the set lacks the sense of mythology (compared to lotr), the characters, were under-written. Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, and ewan McGregor are capable actors, pity that they can't show their talents here. I can't understand anekin's infatuation with padme, it seems so underdeveloped and forced. both christensen and portman are rumoured to have a strong chemistry, but i just didn't see or feel it. the ol' rebel-student-versus-teacher conversation is boring, and emotional scenes lack the emotions. There are countless supporting acts, who are mere set decorators. Such a pity.Humour was an important element in the original trilogy. What happens here? I miss c3po and its coutnerpart already, because, without the humour, star wars saga is a dull saga. action scenes were not at all suprising or new, although my chosen scene would be the fight between dokou and yoda.in conlcusion, attack of the clones drags the already-slowdeveloped plot and george lucas needs to review on what he did on the original star wars trilogy that makes it so famous.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Movie of 2002,"For all the accusations that this is just special effects, Attack of the Clones is actually the most emotionally complex Star Wars film yet.  This is not simply a case of heroic rebels vs. evil empire, but flawed heroes becoming embroiled in a conspiracy.Anakin Skywalker, unlike other Jedi, has already formed an emotional connection before he started his training, to his mother and to Padme, as we saw in The Phantom Menace.  His obssessions lead him to good, such as his compassionate defence of Padme, but also to evil, as in his massacre of the Sand People after the death of his mother.  What is interesting is that Lucas has revealed that it was love, not hate, that started Anakin on the path to the dark side.  His love of Padme sets him against the Jedi, and becomes twisted.  Hayden Christensen is perfect in the role, the dark side of the golden boy hero played by Mark Hammil in the original trilogy. Natalie Portman has matured into the incredible actress we all knew she would become.The finale is exhilirating, but it has its own dark edge.  This is no grand victory, but rather the beginning of the civil war that will bring the Emperor to power.  The Jedis are unwitting pawns in their own demise.I loved this movie, and I eagerly await Episode III.  Reading some of these comments, sometimes I think the Mets have better fans that George Lucas.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The weakest of the prequels.,"Overall I enjoyed this movie but much less than the Phantom Menace. What this movie suffers from is weak writing and CGI. The fact that Anakin gets so much character development is essential to his story, but the way that it is done is slow, flat and sometimes straight up weird.The acting in general in this movie is nothing to write home about, but really how can you blame the actors when all they are looking at are green screens for the most part? the abundance of CGI was detrimental to the entire movie. And must've been awful for the actors.The saber duels, especially the ones during the big battle also are just sloppy. Much more sloppy than the Phantom Menace where even though that had its shortcomings.. it at least didn't make using a lightsaber look clumsy and unguided.In general though, I was pretty shocked at how much my memory told me that certain events in the *next* movie revenge of the sith were in *this* movie. I was like ''when is this/that gonna happen'' So its pretty interesting that in my memory these two movies almost merged together. But it makes a little sense as this movie does end on a bit of a non-ending.In the end, this movie suffered from its CGI, weak writing and poor portrayal of the Jedi's and their skill. That said, I still enjoyed most of my time watching it, and certainly isn't ''revolting'' like some others may say.As a side note, the popularization/memes of the bad writing in this film actually made it much more fun to view. And it says something about taking the movie less seriously. I can still understand the hate from the older star wars fans though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Attack of the clichés,"I know it was my own fault that I actually bothered to watch Attack of the Clones. This film was billed as a space soap opera but I had remained foolishly optimistic that Lucas could recapture the awe and wonder of the original Star Wars (episodes 4, 5 and 6). But, alas, I was wrong. Most of the film is basically blue screen replaced by CGI at the back with no story line in front. To top it all, the cheese is spread so thick you expect them to burst into song at any moment.

Take it for what it is...Star Wars.,"I've seen review after review slamming this movie (as well as Episode I)and finally decided I had to say something. Everyone keeps comparing them to the original trilogy.  Has anyone ever went to see a Star Wars film in hopes of seeing Oscar worthy performances? Let's face it...if Mark Hammill was ever anything to write home about, he'd have more work now-a-days, better roles than ""Cock-knocker"" in ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"".  There are a few in the ""Star Wars Universe"" that have had memorable performances.  For example...Ian McDiarmid, Harrison Ford, and Ewan McGregor.  I tend to agree that the rest of the acting is very stale. But in all the films, not just the last 2.I've been watching Star Wars films since I was a child.  And my children LOVE this film.  As do I.  The characters are Star Wars.  Just have to remember, Star Wars is appealing to the younger generation and when viewing any of the films, you have to remember being a child.  I just have to say, that I am anxious to see what Lucas does with the third film.I am wondering how certain things will transpire, but I won't pick apart plot holes until after I have seen the next film.A few things I can criticize, really, really really dumb one-liners on the part of C-3PO, R2-D2's rockets, and the over use of CGI.  This movie might as well of been a cartoon for all the physical sets that are used.All in all I really enjoyed this film, for what it was.  It was a Star Wars movie, exactly what it was supposed to be.Two things I would like to comment on.  Things I've read and heard people say:  1) People judging that this is not the way the pre-quel is supposed to be. - Are you George lucas?  How do you know this is not the way it is supposed to be.  2) People wondering why Owen and C3PO not recognizing each other. - C-3PO is a robot, erase his memory.  As far as Owen, can you recognize the same car you owned as a teenager?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

We get to see Yoda fight for the first time, which was cool. They are slowly building the story of Anakin's rage and move to the dark side. The ending fight was really fun to revisit.

An epic ruined (captivating music though),"Episode II is better than Episode I, but one would have to try really hard to make anything worse than Phantom Menace. Poorly directed, is only saved by the absolutely moving music. For those familiar with the Star Wars saga (who aren't?), perhaps the most touching aspect of the movie is the almost inevitable slip of young Anakin towards the dark side. For me, the last scene only served as a sad reminder that all Anakin has are destined to be lost forever and truly made me look at Darth Vader with compassion.

Ok, ok, maybe i am old, maybe i am high on expectations on Star Wars. My point is, you have reached a level of graphic effects in which you can do ANYTHING (and make do by actors as well). So how comes that Yoda (by far the absolute spotlight) didn't stir in me the sheer delight of when i saw him (it?) in SW5 ? And coming to that, when the best actor in the movie is a puppet-computer effect, there's something to think about, isn't it? The young Anakin is a promise, granted, but i still stay with a sensation of ""too much"" (special FX, noise, graphics, sequences fit for a videogame) and ""too little"" (character deepening, situation exploring, cameos taken and suddenly dropped).

My quick take on Attack Of The Clones.,"Believe it or not, my love for Star Wars began when the first time I watched the over-hyped first prequel of this beloved saga, The Phantom Menace. 10 years has passed since the event of The Phantom Menace, 3 years has passed since the premier of The Phantom Menace. Was it worth the wait for Episode 2? In my opinion, hell yeah!I watched Attack Of The Clones when i was 13 years old. Despite it flaws,noticeably in terms of the duologue's and acting, its still managed to capture the spirit of fun and excitement from the earlier trilogy. The story is good enough, the visual effects are glorious to the eyes while the musics are soothing to the ears. Overall, its not a perfect film, (well there's nothing perfect!) but its definitely a worthy addition to the saga. (^-^)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great movie for fans in the know..,"I saw this movie shortly after it's emergance in theatres.  My fan status required it.  I already knew about where the general plot was headed, but sat happily through the movie to see how it would pan out exactly.  I was impressed, very impressed.  Many of the scenes were more interesting because I understood what a SW fan is supposed to.  I think if some of the people who have shown lukewarm feelings toward Episode II rewatch it after seeing Episode III when all is revealed, they will allow themselves some oohs and aahhs.  There is chemistry between much of the cast, but only for the backstory, the trillogy's plot.  There is much below the surface.. and I can understand why some people think the actors simply have no chemistry with each other... they just don't understand the reasons.I heartily agree that the love story isn't that great.  But if you go back and look at the love story in Episode V, you'll notice that it consisted of Han being rude to Leia and Leia returning the sentiments.  Only when they begin name calling does the relationship advance.  Sure, it's more entertaining than what we see in Episode II, but it also just goes to show you that SW isn't about good love stories.  Otherwise I was very impressed once again with Ewan McGreggor (as always) and even with the new digital Yoda, who displays some personality once again.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Definitely a Star Wars Film...,"I'm a Star Wars fan. I've seen all four previous films for the nth time (yes, even that dreaded Phantom Menace)... and what I can say about Attack of the Clones is it's a fun and enjoyable ride and I will definitely watch it again.You guys might think that I only said this because I am a fan... maybe you're right. But hey, I've also repeatedly seen movies such as Lord of the Rings (which I think is still much better than any of the Star Wars films), Requiem for a Dream, and Hitchcock's Psycho and loved these films for what they are. I just think that sometimes you just have to look at at Star Wars movies for what they are... a kid/teen flick with all the high-tech mumbo-jumbo with not that much of a story.Sure, dialogue's bad... as usual. Love scenes were not that believable but hey... who would believe that a not-that-experienced pilot (who's not yet a jedi) can channel the ""Force"" and shoot down a planet-sized Death Star with his pathetic X-wing?I guess what I'm trying to point out is... I can't believe that people would say that AOTClones is a bad movie while claiming that IV, V, and VI are among the best sci-fi/adventure movies (Phantom Menace is an exception cause it's really bad!

An underrated build-up movie,"Finally some excitement. The Star Wars universe is huge, with plenty of movies, but I was having trouble getting into it. I couldn't find the legendary Star Wars I was waiting for. It should be noted here that I watched the movies in order of their release dates. I mean, yes, good movies, but they didn't excite me or draw me in. Until this movie.I think this is the first movie where things go from private to general and get really excited. I don't remember ever being bored while watching the movie. Of course, there are empty scenes, but the big events behind were enough to keep my excitement alive throughout the movie. Also, seeing the individual stories and character development for the first time definitely impressed me more than other SW movies.Although there is no difference in terms of scene shots, it is possible to see that they have progressed a lot from the previous film. Although I found some of the effects strange in the previous movie, most of the effects in this movie did not seem strange to me. Also, the soundtrack of this movie is really great. This time, after the movie was over, I looked at the music. The movie looks and sounds great.The old time acting is weird, it has to be admitted. It is possible to see how strange some of the acting, which was then called legend, was. It makes people sad to look at face expressions that don't mean anything. And it's even weirder to see this school of acting in the entire movie. It seems childish after a while, frankly. I still don't understand how the acting of old movies looks so weird and nobody says anything about it.This is the best SW movie I've ever seen, it exceeded my expectations for the other movie. I'm excited to watch the movies that make Star Wars Star Wars. See you in the review of the last movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nothing special,"Episode II was better than Episode I, but that doesn't really mean to much considering how bad Episode I was.  AOTC was just your average summer movie with a bad plot and VERY BAD dialogue.  I mean, it seems like the actors half to pause before delivering the next line.  There is no flow in conversation, but then again most of the characters don't have anything meaningful to say.  Example, when Sam Jackson says ""The party is over."" Did a 5 year old write that?I really didn't think the acting was as bad as many people seem to think. I think the dialogue was what made the actors seem so bad.  Hayden Christensen is no Bob Diniro, but I don't think he was that bad. I thought Sam Jackson had the worst performance.I was highly disappointed in the Yoda/Dooku fighting scene after hearing about how good it was supposed to be.  I mean, what did it last maybe a minute.  And all Yoda does is jump around and do little flips in the air.  I thought the Dooku/Obi Wan fight was better.Also, there are too many CGI monsters and backgrounds.  The big battle scene in the coliseum was a poor rip off from Gladiator.  I mean, all those CGI monsters just look to fake and all the robots running around, you can't pay attention to anything because there is too much on the screen at the same time.FINAL VERDICT:  If you want to see a good summer movie, watch Spiderman. You will only like AOTC if you are a Star Wars geek, so don't waste your money at the theater on this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas should stick to SciFi and never try romance,"Attack of the Clones is a typical member of the Star Wars series in the sense that it has all the good ingredients but the common flaws as well. Great special effects, which provides for sometimes astonishingly beautiful backgrounds of the cities in particular (I quite like the retro-inspired design of the spaceships too), the never-ending struggle between good and evil, personalised in the two generations of Skywalkers, and of course the sloppy romantic scenes. AOTC has the best specials effects you've ever seen, but for those who thought that the love-interest between Leia and Han was rather hair-raising, beware, because AOTC sets a new standard in that field too. Anakin is a whiny brat with the emotional capacity of a six year old, who tries to seduce Amidala with lines that have less romantic power than a list of ingredients on a pizzadelivery order form. No blame on Haydn Christensen, for even Brad Pitt couldn't have been interesting for Amidala with this kind of dialogue or role. She's a strong, independent woman, and there's no overwhelming chemistry between them blasting from the screen to give at least the smallest of an excuse for her being attracted to him. It's a shame, because I can imagine a lot of people dislike the film because of this subplot, when for the rest, after the terrible Phantom Menace, AOTC is among the best in the Star Wars series: a more complex plot than the Episodes 4 to 6, which poses intriguing questions and makes one look forward to Ep 3, a dark, gloomy atmosphere, lot's of action-packed sequences, an *ss-kicking Yoda, and, as mentioned before, excellent SE and design. Lucas should have hired a ghostwriter for the romance, for now he missed a chance to make a truly memorable SW-film again. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
George Lucas is just like you and I,"Let's face it. We're angry. We're angry because the bearded one who blessed our childhood with adventure and action figures decided enough was enough. Looking out over his empire/ranch, the bearded one stretched out his hand and said ""And lo! It is time you kids learnt about relationships, politics and stuff."" So yes, we're angry. We want our toys back.But can we really be angry with George? Most kids that play with action figures get to a point where they like to pit them against each other in a fight to the death. Or hurl them off something high. Or strap them to a firework a la Sid from Toy Story. (Despite what Pixar want you to think, Sid is not evil. He's you and I... you know it's true...) Or they build a Lego house and smash the tiny little plastic yellow faces out of it. They do this because kids that like Star Wars have an appetite for destruction. If they didn't, they'd watch Star Trek Voyager.So how are we any different from George? He created a stunning trilogy in Episodes IV, V and VI. Not the most well-written I agree, but one of the most fun! Then he made the prequels, and smashed the stuffing out the legacy and reputation he had made for himself. Because he could. Because he's rich and they're HIS toys!I watched this film at the cinema about 10 years ago. I had convinced myself it was better than Episode I. Until I watched it again last week on the telly and decided it was in my top five worst films of all time. It made me balk and shake my fist. Deep down though, I wonder whether I'd have done the same thing if they were MY toys.But yeah, this film is awful. In every way.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

He did An excellent job as did all the other actors - only a few little dissapointments - for example - Samuel L. Jackson, why was he in it? He isnt really suited for a Sci-Fi movie like this one.. and Christopher Lee wasnt all that good either.. mind you He is an excellent actor.. but too, why was he in it.. he didnt suit the role he played.. otherwise it was great, wonderful scenary , great soundtrack , Fantastic special effects ..it is WELL worth the admission price .. I HIGHLY recommend it , whether your a Star Wars fan or not -- i give it a Ten out of Ten , and Two thumbs up !!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Better Sequel, But Still Flawed","After the disappointment of The Phantom Menace, many people hoped that Attack of the Clones, the second installment of George Lucas' Star Wars Prequel Trilogy, would fine tune some of the issues that plagued the first film. In same ways they got that, in others not so much. While the film improved its storytelling ability and lessened the amount of Jar Jar on screen, fans still moaned over the script's corny dialogue and poorly written romance. And in a way, I'm right there with them, though I think I give this movie a little more credit that others do.First of all, I agree that the story here is much better. While there are still some areas that don't fit very well nor are answered entirely (Master Sifo Dyas, anyone?), I felt that it moved smoother than Phantom Menace's did. It didn't feel like we were jumping from place to place and had less characters and plot threads to worry about. Here we have only two main story lines: the investigation into the clone army with Obi-Wan Kenobi and the romance plot involving Anakin and Padme.The storyline involving Obi-Wan's discovery of the clone army is perhaps the movie's most intriguing plot line. It keeps the viewer's attention (or at least it did mine) and definitely invested us into the mystery of the clone army's origins. Granted, some areas of it were not properly explained (once again, Sifo Dyas, anyone?), but it is at the very least engaging. The romantic subplot also does keep one interested, as well as when it leads to Anakin returning to Tatooine in order to find his mother. However, there's one issue that bogs this part down: the terrible romance writing.This film focuses heavily on the relationship between Anakin and Padme and how they become lovers, despite the fact that Jedi are not allowed to love. And even though I was still engaged in what was going on, there was a lot of it that didn't work. It felt forced at times and it didn't always make sense as to why Padme loved Anakin, especially considering how dark things get with him before the end of the story, foreshadowing his turn the dark side. And of course there is also the dialogue, which is very cheesy during these scenes (and throughout the rest of the film as well).The visual effects are, once again, very impressive, but I've noticed that there are a lot of moments that look fairly dated. There are moments of people walking in different areas and you can tell it is full green-screen. Almost all of the clone troopers in this movie are CGI and you start to notice it more and more as time goes by. Still, most of the visual effects still look good to this day.While there isn't a ton of action in Episode II, when it is there is it entertaining. The final battle especially is pretty fantastic all the way down to the final lightsaber battle. I know many people are split on the lightsaber fight between Yoda and Count Dooku, but I enjoyed it a lot, and despite people arguing that it goes against his character (which it doesn't; he is a jedi so he would use a lightsaber), I think it works for the film. I will say that there were some aspects of the lightsaber battle that happened before this moment that I didn't like. I feel like George Lucas tried to fix the whole ""the lightsaber fights are too choreographed!"" complaint some fans had by slowing it down, and is honestly doesn't work very well. Granted it's not in the scene much, but it is definitely noticeable.Overall, Attack of the Clones is a better movie than The Phantom Menace. However, it still contains some of the same issues that plagued that movie. The writing is still not the best here and really shows in romance section of the story. The CGI isn't quite as convincing, and there are parts of the story that aren't explained very well. However, that being said, I was more invested in this one than I was with the previous outing and I overall I think it is better than the first film, if not only by a little bit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Weakest link,This is definitely the weakest of the three in this trilogy and doesn't really give a lot to the franchise other than an over the top romance and what it says on the tin the introduction of the clone army. The other two in my opinion are really good Star Wars films this not so much.,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
get over yourselves,"Star Wars is what it always has been. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and I will admit, Star Wars is cheesy. It always has been. Anybody who wants to complain about bad acting had best recall the originals. Anyone who wants to complain about cheesy lines had best recall the originals. And if you fell in love with Star Wars when A New Hope first came out, but want to now say that the story just isn't any good, then you are fooling yourself. Nobody loved A New Hope because the story was great. People who fell in love with it in the 70's did so because of the special effects and anybody who says different is either a bad judge of good plots or a liar. I admit, the special effects in The Phantom Menace were, for the most part, not up to par with those of the originals. This movie is different. In this movie, they are better. If you did not like this movie because of any of the above reasons, then what the hell were you doing watching Star Wars in the first place. And if you feel like blaming George Lucas for doing such a bad job, get over yourself, it's not his fault that you are a sucker. Way to go, George! Here's to Episode Three!!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
That's a little better,"This came out in my late high school years and I was so excited. I was looking forward to more movies in the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker saga. After being a bit disappointed with The Phantom Menace I hoped that there'd be a better movie. And you know what? I actually enjoyed this second film of the prequel trilogy. Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Ahmed Best, Samuel L. Jackson, and Frank Oz are all back, along with some new faces. We get to see more new worlds and see what events transpired for a certain war for the dying Republic. Sure, we could have more action and less of the talk scenes, and maybe there could be a more compelling plot, but this did it decently. The alien creatures in the movie really stole the show. They could definitely make Ray Harryhausen blush!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One Thing to Say,"I've heard many people who are disliking this movie, and the Phantom Menace, and I can't understand why!? All you have to remember is that the first Star Wars movies took the movie business and the viewers by storm, and that can't be done again...However, to the movie. A very clean film, all the effects are cool the computeranimations are just ""wow"", but the final argument to see this film has four letters: Yoda. I can't wait until film nr. 3 is released!Rating: 9/10Lucas, you do your thing, and you do it well!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Slick CGI,"Alot pacier than episode 1 a few silly moments, let it down surprisingly some of the CGI is a bit fake looking (only a few scenes) but the elements look lovely, dust, clouds, rain etc, are very believableoverall, very entertaining, even Binks is forgiven!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Attack of the fans,"This movie is usually bashed the hardest of the prequel series. While it's understandable as to why fans were upset with it, I really enjoy the movie. But while Attack of the Clones does have its share of flaws, I wasn't as turned off by them as other people were. For example, a lot of people complain about Anakin being whiney at times, but, strangely, I don't remember them complaining about how whiney Luke was throughout A New Hope and Empire. You can't praise one character while criticizing another for the same thing, that's called hypocrisy.And yes, the dialogue wasn't always the best, and the romance could have been handled better, but you also have to consider the situation and the circumstances. Anakin is a Jedi, and romance is forbidden to him. He has zero experience in the romance department. He doesn't know what to do, he doesn't know what to say. Remember, he's pretty much been in love with Padme since he was a kid. Think back to your first crush, or the first time you tried to ask someone out. I'm sure you said and did things that you look back on now and wince at. Not only did Anakin lack experience, he knew he was doing something that was forbidden to the Jedi, and there was no one he could talk to about it because of this, not even Obi-Wan. So he tried to be completely open and honest, laying all his feeling out and being completely sincere. And yes, the dialogue was cheesy and cringy, but again, consider his circumstances.As for Padme, she's been a queen since she was very young, and then a senator after that. Unlike Anakin, she does have experience in relationships. In fact, she and Anakin even talk about it. But due to her position, she's probably used to all this higher up standard form of courtship, a lot of which probably involved fake things and putting on acts, a bunch of formalities, and a lot of other higher up nonsense. She was probably also put on a pedestal due to her position by a lot of courters instead of being treated like a person. She didn't face any of that with Anakin. He treated her like a person, not a queen or a senator. She always had a lot of affection for him, even when she was younger, and I think she simply responded to his openness and honesty, even if it was cringy. I'm still not saying the romance was handled the best, but seeing as there was a reason behind it, I was able to overlook a good part of what many consider to be some of the movie's biggest flaws.I will admit that there is also an overuse of CGI in the movie, and not all of it is has aged well, as people seem so fond of pointing out how fake something looks. But you know what, I don't recall people complaining about severally out of date special effects for old classics, whose special effects may have looked good over sixty years ago but now look ridiculous compared to what movies are capable of now. You can't praise outdated special affects that look bad now while bashing new, better looking but still outdated special effects. That's not how it works, and it's completely biased.Besides, the effects used in this movie provide some pretty cool scenes. The fight with Obi-Wan and Jango Fett was great, and the whole battle at the end with the Jedi fighting the droid army, and then the clones coming in, come on, that was pretty cool. We even get to see Yoda channel the Force and go all out. And yeah, it may look a little silly, but you have to admit that seeing Yoda turn into a badass Jedi master was freakin' awesome. But yes, the flaws this movie has did lower it in the ranking, but it also did well to keep me entertained throughout it, and that's primarily what I look for in a movie. A movie doesn't necessarily have to be good for me to like it or be entertained by it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Still not as good as Star Wars.,I have to admit that my viewing of Attack Of The Clones was very much spoilt because i watched it on a very poor quality DVD and therefore have a biased view on this film. From what i could see this looked a lot better than the last movie but still did not have the magic of the first three films. My theory is that the last two film have far too much Computer animation which does not have the same appeal as the Models being filmed to look like aliens or space ships as they did in Star Wars. Also i dont like the cast. Ewan Mcgregor sounds naff when he puts on that Alec Guiness accent also i think as Natalie Portman has got older she has got a lot less interesting and less pretty.Samuel L Jackson is good but we see little of him to brighten the film up. What we really need is another Harrison Ford of Mark Hammel. The Story is nothing special but its hard to tell when your watching a cheap pirate DVD. Never again will i buy one. The Kids will love this but as for true Sci Fi fans i would stay stick with Star Trek. 7 out of 10.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Bad Casting,"First off, Hayden Christensen (however you spell his name) has emotional constipation, mixed in with some bi-polar attacks of over-acting. I think he is awful for the part of Anakin, soon to be Darth Vader. First of all, Darth Vader is bad-ass. Christensen is a pretty-boy. It just doesn't work. When Anakin and Padmé are at her hidden place, and they're talking about why they can't be together, the way he acts it out is pitiful. On top of that, he whines throughout the whole movie. Minus 2 stars.Jar Jar is still alive, so that takes off 2 stars right away.Count Dooku is the least villainous villain yet to be placed in a star wars movie. He is a complete disappointment to the movie. Minus 2 stars.Samuel L. Jackson doesn't swear a single time throughout the whole movie, which creeps me out. Minus 2 stars.Darth Maul got killed in the last movie. Minus 1 star.And that leaves 1/10 stars. Enjoy the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Slow Start-Awesome Finish,Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones was boring from the start. Anakin and Padme were doing the hard to get routine while Obi-Wan was hunting down Jango Fett.  But when Anakin went to rescue Obi-Wan and the Jedi Knights showed it was a free for all battle royal.  Then Yoda brought in the clones and the war began.  Clone vs. Battle Droid in an arena setting just plain cool.  Then when Yoda brought out his lightsaber and took on Count Dooku we saw how fast Yoda really could move.  He was jumping all over the place and attacking quicker than you could track with human eyes.  It was great to see little Yoda finally in action!,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"OMG, Someone please end Anakin...","So, I'm going through a rewatch of the entire Star Wars Movie and TV series collection. By far, without a doubt this particular movie was the worst. Nearly half of the movie is unwatchable due to a whiny / angry / self obsessed Anakin. I am totally revulsed by the character, the actor (Haydyn Christensen), the script writer, and anyone else involved in bringing this pathetic being into my existence. How on earth did George Lucas think it was a good idea to make such an unlikeable whinging and whining character ? Who wants to watch some snivelling teenager with no redeeming qualities at all ?

"Prequel's Second Installment Is No ""Empire""","Although debatable amongst Star Wars fans, ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones"" is a step down from ""Episode I - The Phantom Menace."" This second installment in George Lucas' space opera prequel trilogy has more politics, a less consistent storyline, and more gratuitous CGI than its predecessor.""Attack Of The Clones"" opens with an assassination attempt on Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), the former Queen of Naboo. For protection, Padme returns to her home planet with Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) as a bodyguard. Meanwhile, Anakin's master, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) investigates the hit on her life, tracking down a bounty hunter named Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), unveiling a clone army mysteriously created for the Republic, and coming into contact with Count Dooku (Christopher Lee)- a fallen Jedi who now embraces the Dark Side and the wretched Separatists.In this very bare summary, the story doesn't sound too bad. However, Obi-Wan's investigation is contingent on many serendipitous interactions, and while Anakin and Padme hide out on Naboo, they build one of the cringiest romances in all of cinema. The affection between the two characters hardly seems genuine, but rather a painful thing they both must endure. Anakin utters cliché and creepy lines while Padme's romantic interests also feel inappropriate given that the last time she saw Anakin before this film, it was the end of ""The Phantom Menace,"" when he was nine and she was fourteen.Like ""The Phantom Menace,"" George Lucas directed and executive produced ""Attack Of The Clones"" all on his own, and he wrote the screenplay with Jonathan Hales. For this, we can appreciate ""Episode II"" as a rare piece of blockbuster auteur cinema, yet we can't help but think the movie would have benefitted from more people checking Lucas' vision. A dialogue rewrite, for example, could have saved Anakin and Padme's infamous dynamic. Also, moving a few scenes around might have helped the pacing. As ""Episode II"" is, we don't meet the main villain until over an hour into the picture.For all of the flack I am giving it, though, I must admit that every time I rewatch ""Attack Of The Clones,"" it is better than I remember. Anakin and Padme's romance leaves audience with such a sour taste that it sort of spoils the entire film. Therefore, when I go back to ""Episode II,"" I'm pleasantly surprised by its less memorable aspects.First off, Ewan McGregor reprises Obi-Wan with far more personality than he had in the last film. McGregor certainly provides the most iconic performance in the entire trilogy, and despite debuting in ""The Phantom Menace,"" we finally get to see it shine in ""Attack Of The Clones.""Obi-Wan's story is quite interesting as well, as he travels from planet to planet to slowly unravel a galactic threat. In the process, we also get Jango Fett - the father of Boba Fett from the original trilogy. While Boba Fett went tragically underused in Lucas' earlier films, Jango Fett gets two action scenes in this film, both of which deliver in full.On the topic of villains, Count Dooku might not be as cool of an antagonist as Darth Vader or Darth Maul, but Christopher Lee brings a very fitting energy to the Star Wars universe. He's far subtler than most Star Wars villains, but his every word carries a degree of booming suspense that keeps us intrigued.Hayden Christensen, on the other hand, might not be everyone's ideal Anakin, but he at least shows the character in turmoil, split between the Light and Dark Side of the Force. A sequence in which Anakin returns to Tatooine and executes Tusken Sand Raiders is one of the film's most impactful instances. Anakin's transition into Darth Vader should be the prequels' core character arch, and ""Attack Of The Clones"" finally sets it up.Meanwhile, the movie also offers some great action scenes, as we witness the Jedi at the height of their warrior reputation. Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu and even Yoda amongst all the other Jedi wield their lightsabers as the Clone Wars definitively begin in the film's final act.Speaking of Yoda, he is now a CGI being rather than a puppet. Still voiced by Frank Oz, this new Yoda is visually impressive. While he lacks the warmth of the original puppet, we know that the practical Yoda would not fare well in combat, and his appearance would stick out like a sore thumb in this highly digitized film.The visual effects are not bad in ""Attack Of The Clones,"" but rather overdone. Part of the original Star Wars movies' charm was the extravagant puppets and makeup that made the universe feel tangible. Much of this is lost in ""Attack Of The Clones,"" and while its CGI was inspiring in 2002, it has definitely lost its touch for modern viewers.Overall, ""Episode II"" is a weaker entry in the Star Wars saga. Unconvincing romance, a misplaced emphasis on digital effects, and a flawed story mar its reputation. Nevertheless, the film has its overlooked moments. They might not be humorously pulpy moments like the ones defining the early Star Wars movies, but ""Attack Of The Clones"" introduces some good characters, expands the universe, provides thrilling action, and in the end, finally leaves the prequel trilogy where it should have started - in the Clone Wars leading up to the Galactic Empire, and with Anakin battling his inner demons.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than Episode One--but takes itself too seriously,"I actually debated whether or not I would EVER see this film, after the trailers seemed heavily weighed in the romance direction, but seeing an advance screening convinced me that there is still hope for the franchise.Not as weighed down by exposition as was Episode One, ATTACK OF THE CLONES still suffers the great fault of the first film: It just takes itself too seriously. Within ten minutes, I felt as though I were embroiled in some game of Dungeons and Dragons, the techno-jargon and suspicious whispering that have replaced the casual banter of the original trilogy (where, oh where, has Han Solo gone?) were almost enough to make me regret my decision to buckle in for the full two and a half hours. But then, wonder of wonders, I got caught up in a chase scene in which Obi Wan and Anakin get to show off their ridiculously super-Jedi powers and, gasp!, some off-the-cuff chit-chat!In short, the romance stuff is awful, though not as embarrassing as good ol' Jar-Jar, whose cameos are blessedly brief. As you've no doubt heard, it's time for Yoda to shine, and for us to learn about the parts of Anakin's past that are going to get him into the black mask. Sure, a lot of it is heavy handed, but I think all six films fall under that criticism--mythology isn't the most subtle of genres.Be prepared for the appearance of characters you may have been waiting for...and some other surprises (one of which, regarding R2-D2 in a scene out of INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, I found to be something of a cheat). And if the guy sitting next to you is laughing at dialogue you may not find funny, take some advice I wish Georgie Lucas would listen to: Lighten up. It's a movie, not a science.

For a big budget movie like this you would have thought Lucas the creator of one of the best Sci-Fi movies in history could have come up with a better plot and graphics. The clone troopers look crap.Why did Lucas go for a romantic side to Star Wars? It screwed it up. While the actors did a great performance this movie just doesn't fit in with the original films.

Better than I expected,"This movie was a great example of how well George Lucas could juggle a terrific story with astonishing special effects.

I'm sure that everybody is sweating Yoda's lightsaber battle, and with good reason; he was a spunky little fellow.

This movie is the total destruction of the myth that Star Wars once was.... It seems to me George Lucas was trying to make a movie for people under the age of 15, which don't have any idea of the original star wars movies. The real fans can't be satisfied cause there are not enough of them to make the real big money. Episode One was bad, but this movie is even worse. It is just a normal love story accompanied by a few battles, where only lightsabres remind you of Star Wars. Oh yes, and special effects, lots of them, special effects where anyone could live without them... why do there have to be so many (not very good) rendered animals, so many landscapes generated by computers? What about just a bit of the old Star Wars style? The old masks looked far better than most of the rendered people in this movie.... This is NOT Star Wars anymore, this is crap.

A Solid Continuation,"OK, I have to say this - In all of my movie reviews on this site, I'm expressing my opinion, which I am entitled to. These reviews are my opinion only, and nothing else. So let's dig in, shall we? This movie was a solid follow up from TPM. It contained (1) the beginning of the clone wars (Who didn't want to see that?!), (2) it also contained an older, more whiny, evil Anakin. Along with that, (3) we got so see where the Stormtroopers originated along with (4) Boba Fett. Okay, so this movie sounds pretty darn good just by reading that paragraph!(1) THE BEGINNING OF THE CLONE WARS - I'll never forget sitting in the theater in the summer of 2002 and watching the clone wars unfold on the big screen. I don't think I blinked through the whole thing. I thought that the special effects were amazing. To see those giant tanks get blown up and hearing the surround sound of the sequence. It was truly a wonderful, exciting experience. I'm my opinion, the ""Clone Wars"" from Episode II was probably one of the greatest moments in the Star Wars saga (Not the greatest, tho). And to see all the battle droids, destroyer droids, and super battle droids, along with all the Jedi, and the Clone Troopers battle against each other was simply the best. The animators must of spent the better part of a year making this sequence. I thought that the ""Clone Wars"" delivered big-time, and was one of the reasons that made AOTC the great film it is.(2)ANAKIN - Okay, I'll admit, Anakin could have been better in the film. But I still think that Hayden did a great job. I don't think that the reason people hated Anakin was because of Hayden's performance, rather because they were expecting to see an Anakin who didn't care about anything, and wanted to destroy everything in his path. But this is not how George wanted Anakin to be. How on earth could he fall in love with Padme in AOTC if he was evil? Anakin was supposed to be the whiny little brat he is in Episode II. That is how he really became evil. He never woke up one morning and decided ""Hey, I think I'll become Darth Vader today and kill everything I see!"". This was how George wanted Hayden to act the part of Anakin. Anakin was supposed to be whiny. And I agree with it. Anakin had to have feeling and emotional stress in Episode II, that is what the whole saga is about. It is about how Anakin tragically turned to the dark side through his confusion of love and loyalty. It is not about how Anakin 'woke up one morning and decided to kill everything'. How would that work to create and good, solid story? It simply wouldn't. I think that Anakin;s character was great in Episode II, but never the less, he could have been better in terms of his tacky, and cheesy lines. I think that the ""I wish that I could just wish away all my feelings"" line was the worst line in the whole Star Wars saga.(3) ORIGINATION OF THE STORMTROOPERS - I thought that the Clone Troopers were done nicely in this movie. But I didn't like the fact that not one single Clone Trooper costume was created for an actor in the movie. All the clones in this movie was created digitally, and I thought that it never put any feeling in the clones. But I did love the back story of the clones, and it was certainly nice to see the our beloved Stormtroopers originated. Although not all the Stormtroopers in the original trilogy are clone. It says on the Star Wars official website in the data-bank that after the formation of the Empire, recruits were make for stormtroopers along with clones.(4)THE BOBA FETT THING - So Boba's daddy was the person that the Clone Troopers were cloned after eh? And this was all part of George's grand vision that he had back in the 70's and 80's eh? I don't think so. On the bonus disk of the original trilogy DVD's, good ol' George said himself that he never intended Boba Fett to become as recognizable and famous as he did, so how could Boba Fett and his father to have such a dominant role in Episode II? Anyways, all that mumble jumble aside, I think that Boba Fett was only put in Episode II for George and his team to make an extra buck, but I still enjoyed seeing more of Boba Fett.In conclusion, Episode II is probably on of my favorite Star Wars films out of all six. And I think that as time goes on, more and more fans will begin to see the film for what it is, and accept it as a classic, and a rich part of the mystical Star Wars saga.

On C3P0's amnesia and The Beatles...,"Episode II: Attack of the Clones is fine sci-fi entertainment and a definite improvement on its predecessor. But does it deserve the Star Wars brand name?Gone is the bold economy of the earlier works; I am reminded of the scene in the original film in which Moff Tarkin informs Vader that the Emperor has dissolved the senate. One line, that's all we need to know, back to the fun stuff; the background politics are sketched in and give the movie extra weight and character, but they do not intrude upon the central action. It doesn't matter if we miss all mention of the senate, or if we are too young to know what a senate is and understand the effect its disollusion will have - all we really need to know is that a bad guy has a beautiful girl locked up and she needs rescuing. In AotC, there are an awful lot of officials looking very grave and saying and awful lot of things to each other in a very grave and official way. All political manoeuvrings are up there on screen and consequently the entire film is a slave to them. Gone is the gung-ho swashbuckling adventuring of a motley band of rebels - these guys have government endorsments. (And this is significant: George Lucas is no longer the rebel fighting against the rigid and out-dated studio establishment with his low-budget motley crew, he's one of them now, he is Hollywood hierarchy.)The plotting: The original trilogy was an epic tale of good against evil, drawn from myth and legend and ancient tales. It was elemental, it spoke to us all. Every part of it - the characters, the situations, the plot - was an archetype, and that's what made it great, a real feeling of an age-old story playing itself out against the backdrop of space. To be sure, everything about AotC is fine: the characters and story are good, the visuals superb... but it's a TV mini-series. It doesn't speak to race-memory as the original trilogy did, it merely does everything it should to take the story from point A to point B. The overwrought political machinations, the complex character motives, the somewhat lacklustre set-pieces all belong to a 10-part serial explaining to us what happened leading up to the actual movies.The set-pieces: it's all fine fun, but where are the great, indispensable moments? Maybe, at a push, the final duel of the first film and Yoda going nuts in this one, but that is all. Do a couple of poisonous centipedes, a rainy brawl, a dangerous conveyor belt and some gladiatorial action even compare to the trash compactor, the space station which blows up planets, the assault down the trench, the snowy battle against lumbering tanks, the father-son revelation, the Sarlaac pit, the speeder bike chase etc. etc. - indelible scenes which turned cinema upside down and yet at the same time seemed to have been around forever? The original trilogy was teeming with defining, iconographical moments, whereas pretty much everything in TPM and AotC has been... adequate.Add to the plot complexities and diluted pacing Lucas's seemingly compulsive quest for ever-tightening spirals of internal continuity. In the original film, R2D2 and C3PO were the lowly ""everymen"" with whom we could identify and who just happened to be in the right place at the wrong time - they found themselves parties to a magical adventure beyond their wildest dreams. They were merely two droids, any old droids, knocking about the ship at the start of the story but who ended up part of something special. They were proof that any of us could have what it takes to be heroes. But now what? C3P0 was built by Darth Vader and spent 12 years on a farm he had no recollection of sometime later when he just happened to drop by there again by sheer one-in-a-billion chance; R2D2 was in it right from the outset and wasn't in fact lying in the original film when he said that he was the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi in order to get the message to him - it seems that Old Ben (in similar fashion to C3PO) was suffering some form of advanced amnesia when he claimed never to have owned an R2 unit! So in fact, when we join ""innocent bystanders"" R2 and 3PO at the start of the original film, there's a whole lot they're not telling us.In many respects, Star Wars reminds me of The Beatles. Yes, Free As A Bird and Real Love were nice tunes in an airbrushed, MOR kind of a way, but compared to I Am The Walrus, Hey Jude and Strawberry Fields Forever, they are worlds apart. And the reason is the same: like The Beatles in 1995, George Lucas is no longer lean, hungry and desperate to prove himself against the stodgy might of the old establishment with his pioneering spirit of invention - he's middle-aged, comfortable and has the whole world at his disposal... and that means a whole lot of polish for very little wood.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wouldn't hold a candle to any of the original Star Wars Trilogy,"Attack Of The Clones is a film which relies to much on special effects and not enough on dialogue and overall enjoyabilty. The characters are in no way as likeable as Chewbacca, Han Solo and the original charaters. While the original Star Wars Trilogy used modelling and puppet techniques, Attack Of The Clones relies to much on computer effects. Far too much blue screen work. Don't get me wrong, the blue screen is good in small doses. IN SMALL DOSES. But 90% of what we see on the screen are computer effects.The film's battle scenes are well choreographed and prepared, but endlessly boring. The dialogue is wooden and duller than you could possibly imagine. ""Yes master, no master"". And as for the love story, never has a relationship seemed so unconvincing. The story is thrown together with little thought being put into it.All the CGI in the world cannot save it from it's lamentable script. It's minorly better than Episode 1, but still not much to write home about. This one's for Star Wars fans and people with good attention spans only.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""so bad, it's gone past good, and back to bad again""","is a quote from Ghostworld. And it applies here. This movie is badly made. Putting aside the plot. The monsters sucked. The alien designs were lame. The battles were god awful, and most of them were ripped from other movies. And this lame beast of a movie has to limp through two plus hours to reach its Saturday Morning cartoon finale, which has neither drama, nor wit. Lucas reaches new lows, trying to stretch his movie out with scenes of Obiwan going to the library. When I watch Star Wars, I think fantasy, I think exotic. There is nothing exotic about the library. For every place the movie goes right, it takes an inexplicable turn for the revolting.Now the plot. Just because when you write out the political backstory on a paper and read it to yourself it's exciting and intelligent, doesn't mean Lucas sucessfully filmed it that way. In fact he didn't, he just had his characters tell it to you in very non creative new-story style.Of all the crimes I've listed that this movie committed, it's worst was by far this: It's boring. REALLY boring. Even for children and monkeys. There's not a stretch of this movie that's captivating in anyway. It's a strictly pedestrian affair when it should be flying high above us all.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Masterful in places, not so great in others","After Phantom Menace made some wrong turns in setting the foundation for the Starwars saga, Clones has tweaked a few of the blunders of the first movie, and provides plenty of impressive visuals, plot development, and good high-tech action. However, it also encounters some problems along the way.The growing threat of the scheming ""Emperor to be"" with insidious political intrigue is structurally sound, and cleverly written. The gladiator sequence achieves on several levels, and provides a perfect igniting spark for one of the best choreographed massive battle scenes in a long time. Good plot line, well told. The Jar-Jar Binks fiasco was handled in the best way, by subtly pushing him into the background, without killing him off (croaking him would have inspired lots of jokes mocking the franchise). Special effects are uniformly superior.The casting of Hayden Christensen was not a good choice. The pivotal Anikin character is a complex, conflicted, disillusioned hero whose descent into a monstrous about-face is on the horizon. A more emotive actor would have helped; this guy just sounds like a toddler having one long temper tantrum while being potty trained. Natalie Portman is OK, but she and Christensen have as much chemistry as a wet noodle. Other actors do better; especially those in ""Dark side of the Force"" roles. The whole sequence in the droid factory is unnecessary, and reminded me of an old Popeye cartoon.A little better than Episode I, but Episode III was far better than this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

For three years we have waited and today that wait is finally over: We have been absolved with Attack of the Clones. (Mr. Lucas, I never doubted you for a second ;) ""Clones"" is a lightspeed paced dash through the galaxy; it takes us through what should seem like a lifetime in just over two hours.  Compared to the geriatric pace of ""Phantom Menace"", this movie barely stops to breathe.  The characters are lovable in entirely new ways and the FX are awe-inspiring.  The dialogue can be clunky, and at times, downright silly, but there are still parts to be cherished.  I now view Star Wars in an entirely new light...it is all finally starting to make sense. ""Clones"" and ""Menace"" are not like the originals...they are not meant to be. These are not new versions of Episodes IV-VI...they are a continuation of them.

I understand that there are things that are just better with computer animation, but for God's sake, you don't need everything to be done on a computer.

The Force Strikes Back,"The fifth in the Star Wars galaxy blasts into that faraway long ago continuing the tale of the Skywalker clan. The Force strikes back in the extreme. In this the 2nd prequel we are introduced to Anakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader, in his young adult incarnation. His romance with the lovely former queen and present Senator Padme Amidala and his journey to the dark side improve on the juvenile shenanigans of the child in Episode I. The silliness of Jar Jar Binks in the earlier film is also kept to a minimum here.George Lucas, always pushing the envelope technologically, again does so here, filming the entire movie digitally. Visually the images are sumptuous and eye filling. The variety of environments on different planets keeps the viewer engaged and delighted. The story returns to the city planet of Coruscant, the desert planet of Tatooine, and introduces a rain-swept planet where the clones of the title are being grown.Here Lucas begins filling in the gaps leading up to the 4th episode, the original Star Wars film. The relationship between R2D2 and C3PO develops humorously. We find out the genesis of the character, Boba Fett. However, the high points of any space adventure are its action sequences. These are thrilling and more frequent than in the Phantom Menace. A fantastic chase through the skyscrapers of Coruscant gives you the feeling that these characters are really zooming and swooping between the canyons of this throbbing metropolis. A later sequence in an arena that dwarfs those in Gladiator or Ben-Hur pits our protagonists against fearsome creatures which are indescribably ugly and vicious. A final light saber duel brings the audience to applause because. . .no, I won't spoil it.John Williams score is an integral part of Star Wars lore. Here he interweaves themes introduced in the first three films, Leia's theme, the Imperial March and others, with the new music for this opus. In particular, the love theme for Anakin and Padme is moving and effective. It really supports the actors' tentative performances during these scenes. Lucas has never been much of an actor's director. It's in this one area that he has left his two main characters out in the cold. Han Solo and Princess Leia had a perfect chemistry that is not as natural here. Ewan McGregor is evolving smoothly into Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan. Yoda is now completely in the CGI domain. Samuel L. Jackson has more to do than in Menace and always adds that something special to his roles. He even gets to wield a light saber. Wonderful Christopher Lee is the evil Count Dooku. Interesting that his counterpart in so many Hammer horror films, Peter Cushing, was a villain in the first Star Wars film.Star Wars fans will not be disappointed. The romance in the tale will also make the tale much more accessible to women. The film builds to a rousing conclusion making the audience wish that they would not have to wait another three years to find out what events will bring the saga full circle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

However, with the arrival of Episode II, Lucas has made up for Episode I tenfold.

Both Jedi are soon reunited with Anakin's childhood love Padme Amidala (NATALIE PORTMAN), now a Senator for Naboo, as a mysterious and unknown threat makes their move in the galaxy and threatens to crumble the frail Republic in a way no-one can prepare for.

"Keep trying, George","I cannot say this was better than Episode I.  If you like space battles, the one at the end of Episode I is better than anything here.  If you like lightsaber battles, the one between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul in Episode one is more intense and spirited than anything here (Yoda's duel is impressive, no doubt, but lasts nowhere near as long as it should). It is interesting to see a lot of Jedi wielding their lightsabers in combat...but they only chop down those pathetic-looking battle droids. Ho-hum.If you like good dialogue...there is much more in this film that will make you cringe.  Some of the dialogue--especially between Anakin and Padme--is downright embarrassing.  If you like computer-generated effects, yes, there is plenty here...but it sometimes looks fake (I think it's because the lighting on the actors often does not match that of the computer-generated backgrounds well).All is not lost: Christensen is convincing as the troubled young Jedi, and Christopher Lee makes a very smooth villain (although his character seems to come out of nowhere).  The story is somewhat more involving, but it's still hard to get interested in the problems of the Republic.I give this a 7/10.

At some points it seems that he can't remember how to direct real actors either, so caught up as he is in the digital revolution.

"Better than I expected, not quite on par with the original trilogy","I'm regretting my cynicism a little - it was better than I expected. The effects were of course very nice, but this time, they were used for considerably better effect - Lucas' formidable skill with visuals has obviously returned. My favorite scene, cinematography-wise, was definitely the chase scene at the beginning. The digital effects were stunning, and absolutely necessary for a scene like this - the number of speeders, buildings, and people in the scene couldn't have been achieved without CGI. This time, it seems that Lucas' cinematic vision hasn't been outpaced by the power of his computers. I also very much liked the visuals in the scenes on the water planet (can't think of the name). They impressed me a great deal.The dialog was quite poor, though - filled with clichés (Samuel L. Jackson: ""I don't think so!"" being only one of many examples.) The scenes with Anakin and Padme were almost sickening in their sweetness. I'm glad the teenage romance wasn't as important in the movie as the preview I saw made it look because George Lucas at his best is not a skilled director of romance, and here he is positively ham-handed. Leia and Han Solo were funny, had good chemistry, and Lucas used a very light touch. Anakin and Padme, on the other hand, said lines like ""I've been dying day by day since you came back"" (paraphrased) and didn't manage to convince me at all.Thankfully, those scenes were fairly brief, and Jar Jar was also present briefly, although in his perhaps 5 minutes of screen time, he did manage to put into action the destruction of the Republic.The scene with Yoda was, of course, extremely crowd-pleasing, even obsequious - perhaps an apology for Episode I. It was also, however, very well done - although I don't know that it would have the same meaning to those who haven't seen the first three. I wonder about the young folk who haven't necessarily seen the original trilogy. The end of that seen, when Yoda picks up his cane, was a classic moment for the series.All in all, it was a good movie, but it didn't quite live up to the original trilogy. His visual skills are on par with IV-VI, the effects were much better, but the cast was not the equal of the originals, including, surprisingly, Ewan McGregor. The dialogue was mediocre, and the acting was mixed. Definitely a worthwhile addition to the series, but nowhere near its peak. It is sure to please the diehard fan, especially after Episode I, but to someone like myself, who enjoys Star Wars but isn't fanatical, the flaws are visible. I give it 8 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"In the continuation of The Phantom Menace, I liked it a lot.","After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies.

Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace it's now the turn for Attack Of The Clones. I thought the story was more than okay, and that after reading reviews saying the opposite, so no complaint from me here. To me these first two movies were much better than I expected. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. Some people complain about too much CGI's but when it's well done I don't see a problem.

"Trivial convolution, wooden acting, but the effects!!!","One of the problems of Episode II (and Episode I) is George Lucas struggle to support the simple story of the original trilogy with a history. The weak plot  did not bother twenty years ago (the attention was on the effects), since the original Star Wars trilogy was only one step up from other trivial SF movies like Battle Star Galactica. But if you try to give a trivial story a convoluted background, the outcome is trivial convolution. Also, by trying to tie up loose ends, Lucas raises as many questions as he answers.I just read the synopsis on the history of George Lucas Star Wars World, starting several thousand years before the story of Episode I (Origin of the Sith, famous battles between Sith and Yedis etc). I was surprised how simple, banal and totally repetitive the motives of this so called universe are. Although Lucas had decades of time, his universe reaches but a fraction of other fictitious worlds like Lord of the Rings or Neil Gaiman's Sandman Universe. In fact it is about as original and convincing as the background information you will find on any second class PC game like Heroes of Might and Magic or Diablo. The main motive is the constant fight between the good and the bad Yedis. The second motive is the constant conversion of a famous aspiring Yedi to the dark side of the force. So Anakin Skywalker stands in a long tradition of Yedis, and if Yoda is only half as clever as we are to believe he is, the most important lesson to learn at the Yedi school would be how to avoid the temptations of the dark side.The present controversy here and elsewhere, where people like me criticise the acting and story telling can be explained. We are the thirty- or forty year old fans of the original trilogy, who forgot about the lousy acting and trivial story of Leia, Han and Luke. Let's face it, Harrison Ford is a good actor now, but was he a good actor in Star Wars? Mark Hamill disappeared entirely from the screen. Surely not because he was such a brilliant actor.As for G. Lucas, instead of telling a simple story with a good pace (like for instance Kershner in Empire Strikes Back), he indulges in trivial details of his simple universe. I found the first half often boring and repeatedly checked my watch. Can't remember having done that 20 years ago. Did the characters gain any depth by dragging it out? I doubt it. The acting between Portman and Christensen is wooden and poor. Both remind me of early evening soap opera teeny stars. Anakin Skywalker behaving as such a spoiled brat after ten years of Yedi training? Maybe after ten days The guy grew up as a slave. In his present position he should be the happiest adolescent in the galaxy. He does not show a trace of his mentor Obi Wan, nor a trace of the great, dangerous Darth Vader we are to believe he will become in the next episode. Darth Vader is the prototype of efficiency and loyalty (to his emperor). He is  focused on what is important and what is not. Skywalker behaves like an American teenage boy with a light sabre, who thinks having fun` is the reason to be a Yedi. The computer generated Yoda has more screen presence than Portman and Christensen together. If it wasn't for Ewan McGregor, who IS the young Obi Wan, down to copying the expression of Alec Guiness, you could replace all the actors in the next Episode III by computer animation. After all, Final Fantasy had a similar convincing plot and in movies like this the actors seem to be more and more redundant.Episode II is (like the other Star Wars movies) just a brilliant special effects show. Nothing more, but this is still worth while watching (if you are a fan) and you get value for money in the second half of the movie. If you forget all the Lucas hype and concentrate on the special effects you are in for a roller coaster ride. Let us hope Lucas will be more modest in the final episode. He should not try to make a movie with real acting and with differentiated characters (for that you need a proper script and proper actors). Instead tie up the loose ends (like why can't C3PO remember Tatooine? Why doesn't any Yedi sense the presence of the Force in Senator Palpatine?), and get it over and done with. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Filled with cheesy dialogue, but still better than 'Phantom'.","Since I watched the original trilogy which is still awesome in every way I get why the fans mostly hate the prequels. But I am not a Star Wars fanatic, so therefore I do not get as angry about it.I was thoroughly bored with The Phantom Menace and the introduction of Jar Jar Binks, and thank god he has much less screen time in this, but Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin Skywalker is mediocre at best, partly because of the bad writing which George Lucas at least is aware of. The scenes of romance are so laughably bad, but at least much of it is taking place in pretty landscapes.While the acting is mediocre, the action scenes are more frequent in Attack of the Clones, and they work very well if you ask me.

"Better than Episode One, But that's not saying much...","I must start off by saying that I am a huge Star Wars fan and contrary to many reviews that i have read i did not like Episode 2 entirely.  It is above and beyond the shallow Episode One but that's not saying much. Episode 2 is almost equally as shallow filled with archetypes but no characters.  Plug in formula plot.  And so many special effects shots that you start to think that Lucas is making a cartoon with people in it.  Add to this that the editing is done with a meat clever and Lucas has almost no clue how to direct and you get this new era of Star Wars.  I'm not implying that the first three movies are works of perfection.  They have their flaws like all movies but they do offer something that these two new efforts don't; a sense that these characters actually exist in this world.  That they actually live and breathe day to day in this universe.  I don't fault the actors in not bringing life to the characters as much as i fault the writing.  The hammy dialogue doesn't sound like people talking but like people needing to say very little just to advance the plot which is necessary in order to show more effects.As I mentioned before this was way above EP1 especially since Jar Jar is in only about 3 minutes and Anakin is now a less annoying teen.  Still however i find that after watching the movie a few more times it really isn't that much different.  Only on the surface.  IT wows you at the end having you leave the theater with a smile.  That's great, the first time.  But watching the movie again, when the wows are not wows anymore and you realize that the movie is as empty as before.  There are no characters to really cling to here.  There is no real plot but something strung together that leads me to remember Lucas once saying that the effects served to tell the story more effectively and if you watch the original trilogy again that rings true. The effects tell their part intertwined with a better constructed plot.  Now it seems that the story is here to serve the effects.  Lucas seems obsessed with having digital shots all over, not realizing that digital effects can not do it all.Bottom line: Watch it once and you'll be okay.  Watch it again and you realize that you wasted your money.  You could have just stayed home and watched the far superior original trilogy and used that money on far less expensive food and drinks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A huge step forward,"I will say that I didn't expect great things from this film, and I was pleasantly surprised.  It seems like Lucas really listened to the griping about Episode I and did his best to not commit the same mistaked.  He's never tried to write a love story before, and in my opinion he needs some practice.  Don't get me wrong, it is necessary for later plot developments, I just found it a little weakly constructed.  My other complaint is that there are certain scenes I felt were delivered in such a way for no other reason than to get cheers from the audience (which they did), although in my opinion they might have been more appropriate a little less overdone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This one explains more,"Like i put for TPM, don't try and link this to the originals. I sat, again in the cinema trying to link this film to the original saga and when Skywalker is flying across the city planet (cant spell its name) i had to think: ""is this star wars I'm watching?"". Once I cut off the others and enjoyed this for what it is, i could see the plot and see what was going on.This is 10 years since the TPM. Anakin has grown up, Padme hasn't and Obi won still has a dodgy English accent. Palpatine is firmly in office and still playing everyone against each other (opps a spoiler). The effects are amazing, honestly you cant tell what is digital and what is real (and in some films its obvious). The cast are great. Lucas did a fantastic job with them as they aren't all one nationality - Too many sci fi films like Starship Troopers use all American casts (Find the Americans could be a game to past the time in this) and the story does seem slow at times but it explains things and how the latter story fits together.Watch and enjoy with the other 5, you'll need a wet or snowy day to do it in.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
pretty good if your expectations are low,"I thoroughly enjoyed Attack of the Clones, although I probably would have been disappointed if I hadn't read all the bad reviews of it before going. The battle scenes are spectacular, Ewen McGregor seems to be channeling Sir Alec Guiness as Obi Wan, Christopher Lee is outstanding as the evil Count Dakou.  Also, the movie is worth seeing for Yoda alone, who has a surprisingly large and *active* role.  On the bad side, the dialogue is pretty poorly written, the guy who plays Anakin makes Mark Hamill look like Robert Deniro, and the love scenes between Anakin and Padme are cringe-inducing and utterly unconvincing.Not a great movie, not anywhere close to the original three, but it definitely had it moments and it was a pleasant surprise after the Phantom Menace.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Attack Of The Clones Is Just As Fascinating As Before,"The movie have a better and easier story than the previous one, a better performances, a better visual and special effects, and the world is still look large and rich, the Anakin and Padmé romance thing feels unnecessary but it's necessary and if it's not because of the Luke and Anakin father and son story it is very unnecessary, but i'm still fine with it, i just feel it that way, the rest of Attack Of The Clones is just as fascinating as before.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Juvenile movie with pathetic script and acting,"If you're 10 or under, I can cautiously recommend this film, but if you're over 14, forget it.  This is the most juvenile attempt at action/science-fiction I've ever seen.  Simply put, it is a pathetic excuse for a movie.  It is clear that their special effects consumed the entire budget for the film, and they had no money left over to pay for actors or a script.The acting is so bad that it is frankly embarrassing.  I felt like I was watching a junior high drama club. `My heart is breaking for you  Yes, but this is a love that cannot be'. (barf).  They are so stiff and the lines so trite that I think I could find two random teens at the mall who could give a better reading.  The script sounds like it was written by a 15-year-old girl who spent the last 5 years overdosing on romance novels.Unlike the original episode, Attack of the Clones has no fun or humor.  It plods along with the bad guys plotting a rebellion while the good guys try to figure out what's going on.  There was not one single laugh in the entire movie  not counting my chuckles at the pathetic acting and script.I thought the visual effects were poor given the budget for this movie. There were a number of scenes which appeared to have the actors standing in front of poorly painted landscape scenes.  Even the indoor shots seemed to have a haze about them.On a 1 to 10 scale, Attack of the Clones barely rates 1.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Simply Horrific,"It's evident that Lucas has lost his mind.  I've seen the movie twice to be sure of my opinion.  Hands down this is the worst acted and written soap opera set in space ever conceived.  The name ""Attack of the Clones"" is a misnomer in that the entire movie is the rambling between Natalie and the guy!  The attack of the clones happens about 2 hours into the movie which was a side bar to the movie if anything.  The digital visuals though ""very clear"" PALE in comparison to the visuals of the 1st three movies.  The Fifth Element already did the car chase scene 8 years ago! A clear failure of vision and CG technology.  This movie is a testament that acting, alien costumes and miniature model's cannot be replaced with CG graphics.  And moreover, visuals cannot carry a movie without acting or direction.  Wake up George.  You have too much money and the fact that you don't answer to anyone leaves us to suffer with your monolithic vision of how film should be made.  I can't help but remember Mark Hamill's comment about you in his biography, "" I have a sneaking suspicion that if there were a way to make movies without actors, George (Lucas) would do it.""  Well you can't make movies that are successful without a director that cares about actors story and plot.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I liked it a lot- 4.5 out of 5 stars,"Surprisingly enough, I really liked this film. The only reason I had actually gone to see it was because of Ewan McGregor and Hayden Cristensen- I'd never watched a Star Wars movie before (Yes- I am a freak). Although most people have critised Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's acting, I have to disagree. Regardless of whether or not Anakin's character lived up to all the fans' expectations of what Darth Vader should have been like when he was younger, Christensen did a superb job with his role. Hayden has a very unique way of acting that makes him stand out from all the other young actors and he really put a lot of emotion and realism in it and I could truly see him as a person, not just as a fictional character. The scene with his mother and the one where he is confessing to Padme are incredibly moving. Natalie, though she seemed a bit bored and stiff at times, was very good with her eyes. In the confession scene you can see all the terror and hurt she is going through when listening to Anakin talk about killing the Tuskens, while also seeing the compassion she is feeling for him and the instinct she has to comfort him.  Ewan McGregor is amazing as usual (too bad he didn't sing...:D) and brings a light touch of humor to all of his scenes. I heard he hates the Star Wars prequels and George Lucas, though...that's pretty freaking hilarious. Franz Oz is absolutely the best! I love Yoda!!!The special effects were awesome as were Natalie Portman's costumes (though it was a tad unrealistic to have her in a different dress for every scene...). If this movie isn't at least nominated for a cinematography award, I do not know what I will do to the Oscar people.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
yay for lucas!,I was simply blown away by the special effects in this movie!  I loved every part of this movie and it's totally worth seeing again on the big screen.  I really liked how Lucas introduced some of the backround of the characters from the first three.  The Yoda fight just blew me away.  They did a fantastic job with Yoda.  What really blew me away was Amadala.  She was absolutely gorgeous!  She made the movie and I'm looking forward to her costumes in the next one.  I really liked the music in this one.  Wonderful film!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Grim,"Though it's a worthy addition to the `Star Wars' series (there's lots of eye candy), the aura of gee-whiz and kid-like vigor that has come to be expected has been replaced with a grimness of purpose that drains most of the fun out of the experience; what's left is creator George Lucas' relentless intention of ramming a narrative down your throat. Almost completely devoid of humor, Lucas seems to have put his blinkers on: in between chase and battle sequences are long, dull stretches of exposition meant to `explain' Anakin Skywalker's descent into Darth Vader (as played by Hayden Christensen, he's both a teenage rebel and a budding fascist) as well as his blossoming romance with politician Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). For the most part, the action sequences, while elaborate and convincing, are overlong; the final section, the actual clone attack, has so much going on and to such lengthy extremes that you begin to get distracted and confused (although Yoda, as the field general, keeps telling you what's supposed to be going on). The acting itself, usually reliable if not spectacular, this time around seems to have a joylessness to it (Ewen McGregor appears to have phoned in his Obi-Wan Kenobi) that makes things seem drearier than they should, although Christensen does have a nice, startling moment when he describes the rage he felt avenging an important death. In the end, though, the visuals make the enterprise worth it, particularly a short, monochromatic fight scene in a driving rainstorm on top of a mushroom-shaped building--it's vastly different from anything in the entire color-drenched series and wonderfully memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Set against the background of political conflict, Obi Wan investigates the source of an assassination attempt whilst Anakin and watches over Padme.","The special effects are great, all of it looks real and the detail to attention in superb. The Clone war is amazing, explosions and shooting. And the digital characters don't look fake at all.The plot is good too,it all revolves around the beginning of the clone wars and thats all I'm going to say.The acting is on the whole good, McGreggor, Portman and Lee are all great. Jackson's good.The film starts off interesting with some scenes of mystery and intrigue that hook the attention. Unfortunately it slows down in the middle with some unnecessary sequences and others with too much static dialogue. When spectacle does occur it is mostly good but nothing interesting links them together other than characters blandly talking. However, It finishes strongly with a sequence of exciting moments and big nod to what is to come.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Great film, but only seemed to be getting started!","Well where to start. Firstly I have to say the special effects were brilliant. Everyone will probably know at least a little about the general story line so I will omit that for the time being. With that out of the way, onto some more important factors.Firstly every little niggling annoyance from the Phantom Menace seems to have been dealt with. Most notable there was a highly agreeable lack of Jar Jar Binks. The film does well at filling in the missing parts of the continuing story line, without giving too much away Anakin's and Amidala's love storyline is good, albeit it drags on a little with only a little substance. The characters are developed well, and you can see little changes in them, for example Senator Palpatine.There are some awesome lightsaber battles, and the clone battles are fairly good fun. Although the highlight had to be Yoda with a lightsaber (?!!).There was a distinct lack of any stand-out characters. C3-PO's introduction was the possibly the first piece of Star Wars style humour. I went to see it with a few friends, and we all agreed that although the acting was brilliant, the storyline did seem a little wooden. There was noting there for a StarWars fan that was out of the ordinary, with only one unforeseen twist.Personally I felt a little disappointed at the end. It was good to see how the characters developed as a view to the entire StarWars saga, but it just seemed like it was churned out to fill in the gaps with few surprises along the way. There was a certain lack of je'ne c'est qua (apologies for my poor French). The special effects were jaw dropping at times, but surely some of that money could have been pushed towards adding a little more to the storyline. I am sure many people will say that it set out what it hoped to achieve, which it does. But i still feel that a lot more could have been done.In conclusion, go see it. Especially if you haven't watched the middle films exhaustively. It does leave you mouth-wateringly into the third instalment......",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Ridiculous love story,"This has to be the most ridiculous love story I have ever seen. The little boy with a crush on the big girl.

Attack of the clones has a lot more action and adventure, and just... well, it's great! And of course, YODA IS THE GREATEST LIGHTSABER MASTER EVER!!!

StarWars is back,"I believed that this film still shows us that George Lucas still has a passion for this epic.  His love and devotion is on course, but it would appear that he sometimes he can't ""see the forest for the trees"". Like many, I found the beginning rather pedantic in it's ability to draw the observer into something emotional, but rather attempted to dazzle us with effects. In my opinion, Lucas has so developed his scope and concept for the films attitude, that he forgot to allow one very special thing to happen: Allow the actors to act. I got teary-eyed at some of the action scenes rather than the development of sympathies and antipathies involving the character development.  There is where the trees go in the way.  The movie consisted of so many trees, that one kind of didn't see the forest till after they had digested the viewing for at least 45 minutes.Movement from one shot to the next was breathless. I also found myself yearning for the days of the little puppet that characterized Yoda rather than the CGI - especially in the fight with Dooku.  A bit much. And even though the antics of C3PO in the assembly line of Droids and his 2-sided part in the arena battle was comical, it lacked coherency with the seriousness of the moment. And yes, I do know what comic relief is.But yet, all in all, it did not really disappoint me like The Phantom Menace. I saw it on a huge screen with a Dolby system that was, in my opinion, the best in the area.  It was a true sensation, and for that I will go see it again, and probably again. And even though it didn't rank up there with ""Return Of The Empire"", or had the heart that ""A New Hope"" had, it shows that Lucas is still in love with this epic tale of good against evil.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Average Start, terrible middle and an incredible ending","The movie starts with some nice racing scenes, not too bad but nothing you haven't seen before in ""Blade Runner"" or ""The fifth Element"". Then it seems to fall into a bottomless pit of boringness for about an hour!!! I don't know what George Lucas had in mind, when he blew the whole romance thing to a whole hour. Obviously it had to be in the movie because it belongs to the plot, but 10 minutes would have been more than enough! I read somewhere that the audience was laughing in some cinemas when they saw that ""Heidi""-like love affair on Naboo. When I saw it, nobody was laughing! At first everybody seemed to wait patiently for the action to start up again, then the ""BORING""-chants started and finally a lot of the people started to leave the cinema. Only those who couldn't believe George Lucas could make such a crap and who were still waiting for a good ending were rewarded with an incredible and furious final battle.The last part was something, every Star Wars fan has been waiting for since the first movie appeared on the big screen! For those who read to this point and who haven't seen Episode II yet and who still want to see it after all, I won't spoil the best part in years (Although it seems to be ""stolen"" from other movies like ""Gladiator"", ""Starship Troopers"" and even ""Return of the Jedi"").Those who have already seen it, they will know what I mean anyway (If they were strong enough to survive the terrible middle)!I would like to say the ending would have saved the movie and I really would like to give it a high vote. But although the ending is worth a 12 out of 10, the first part is even with the hunting scenes and with a whole lot of Good-Will a 2 out of 10. That makes only a 7 altogether.May the force be with you, George Lucas, and may it clear your mind!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's okay but should have been a lot better.,"Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones"" misses the mark for me. It has quite a few really good scenes but overall it's too long and too plot heavy. The scenes that really drag ""Attack of the Clones"" down are the ones with Padme and Anakin. When the two of them are on screen together time stands still. Their ""romance"" is wildly uninteresting. Whenever I watch this movie I find myself fast forwarding through those scenes. Doing that makes ""Attack of the Clones"" way more enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
big step up but a long way to go,"Surprise- Hayden Christiansen was not as bad as I feared. However, the CGI effects were as distracting as expected. In my opinion creature effects hit their pinnacle in the 80s with films like Dragonslayer and Aliens. Nothing in the past 20 years can surpass those in realism. The CGI characters in SW 2 were just not tangible or  believable. Yoda was the closest thing to a success in this area but he looked like Sonic the Hedgehog during his duel (even though that was the most entertaining sequence in the film.) Overall all SW 2 was such a vast improvement over Phantom Menace that you have to be somewhat pleased but it is still is light years behind Empire which it desperately sought to emulate (protector and princess fall in love, severed limbs, asteroid chases, etc). Maybe its the Byzantine politics instead of rag tag heroes trying to oppose the ultimate bad guy. It's hard to figure out who you should hate.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Held to any normal standard can only be considered excellent ...,"Because it's Star Wars, I think viewers don't see this as just another movie, but tend to micro-analyze everything. Since I don't really care that much about Star Wars, compared to something more serious such as 'Shadowlands' or any one of a hundred other movies, I think this movie comes off really well. It's gorgeous to watch, especially the imaginative scenic renderings of the different planets. The acting is quite credible, the storyline has way more dramatic tension than you'd normally expect in sci-fi, and there's an ominous brooding presence I find quite amenable to our lives and the times. So I give this an 8/10 (only a very few of my ratings get up this high).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Bring back the plastic, the steal and the scale models","First of all: I enjoyed myself. But that's as far as it goes. Even though EP-II has its moments, I think the domination of CGI makes this film (and EP-I) look pale in comparison to the EP IV, V and VI. Most of the space-ships are too smooth, too fake to be believable. Where as the actual steal of e.g. The Millenium Falcon made it more real. The old spaceships, aliens etc. were made, created and built out of real material and even though a lot the time they were scale-models and Lucas used trick-filming, it worked good. Which cannot be said all the time of the new space-ships etc.And of course the acting of good actors as Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson etc. doesn't benefit of having to perform on a set that probably only consits of blue screens, bc the actual set and opponents are created on computer. Even Yoda looked better in the old movies, where he was wonderful done puppet, whereas now it shows that even he is created on a PC.But there are just enough good things in this movie make it enjoyable: the hints that tell us how the Empire will be constructed, the clones that will become stormtroopers (and *they* look much better in this movie), Tatooine is still the most interesting spot in the universe, Yoda duelling with Count Dooku, Padme kicking as in the arena (notice that her white outfit gets more shredded, and thus more sexier as the arena-battle continues -- compare to Princess Leia in the gold bikini in EP VI). And the Jango/Boba Fett plotline is good too.But the missers are also there. What about the scene with Anakin in Padme as they arrive to save Obi-Wan and get trapped in some sort of mine/machine-plant? Totally unneccesary. Haydn Christiansen doesn't convince as Anakin, his anger when he killed the tusk-warriors isn't too real. Mostly he is just irritating. Someone like Ryan Philippe would have done a better job (I guess, but Ewan McG.'s acting is also less then we know of him).I didn't see the original StarWars untill 6 years ago, on video. And the acting there was sometimes cheesy too, but I was overwhelmed by the snow-attack in EP V, with the ""walkers"" etc. Well, the podrace in EP I came close to that, but in this movie I haven't seen anything that caught my breath or made me feel the threat of danger and doom that Yoda hints to in one of the final scenes.I'm sorry, especially because I wanted this movie to knock me off my feet.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great!,"I will start by saying where I stand on Star Wars Films. I still recall seeing Star Wars as a child with my parents and it blew me away. I have never collected the figures or read any of the books I love to watch the movies. There are many films I enjoy from the Shrek to Lord of the Rings have all been favorites of mine. My personal favorite Star Wars goes like this Empire, A New Hope, Jedi-didn't like the muppets much, and then Phantom Menace. Films in my home collection run from Gladiator to James Bond and the Mummy. I must say the Phantom Menace was watchable but not a great movie to me. Jar Jar drove me crazy with his slapstick, and my nephews and nieces that I thought would get a buzz from seeing Star Wars thought it just Ok. My wife fell asleep, though she enjoys watching the originals. I recently saw episode two. I loved it, so did my nieces, nephews and wife. The story kept moving along at a good pace. The settings were amazing. If romance was not your cup of tea it would soon move back to Obi's detective story and the last 45mins were a blast. The politics,my nieces and nephews did not seem to understand, but for me were the most interesting part of the story, how everyone was being manipulated. In the Phantom Menace there were some good surroundings but the characters didn't seem to interact with them in this film you could see the depth to the city and felt as part of the locations. I felt actually cold out there in the rain with Obi in part of the movie. The dialogue in the romance scenes was a little corny but I'm used to that from the Star Wars universe, I've also sprouted some pretty corny lines myself when young and in love. The sound and effects especially the sonic mines blew my mind.What I'd love to see is a Lucas produced re-edit of the Phantom Menace with slightly less Jar Jar. I can hardly now wait for the next film and getting the box set of all the DVD's when they come out. This is now on top of my favorite Star Wars movies, equal to Empire and a New Hope I give it 10 out of ten and thank everyone involved for bringing fun and wonder back into the Star Wars universe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
possibly the best,"despite popular criticism, star wars 2 is a very good film suffering from having to deal with a difficult to please fan-base. Fans of the old trilogy are hanging on to an irrational and nostalgic memory, if Lucas made the new trilogy literally like the others they simply wouldn't cut it by todays standards and most people know this. Whilst some of Lucas' ideas are a bit off, he and his production team nevertheless know how to make a film, and regrettably until someone passes that knowledge to the fans, you will always have this kind of discrepancy between expectation and fulfilment. I personally like empire strikes back the most, followed by this one.

"very pretty, very empty","It wasn't as boring as the last.  It was very beautiful, lots of pretty pictures and cgi that didn't actually ruin the film (shock!).  But amongst all these good things were a weak (and obvious) plot, terrible direction, and possible the most implausible love story this side of Spaceballs.More good things? Well, I suppose it does help build the mythos of the Star Wars universe, and the action certainly picks up when we're with Obi-Wan.

"A Pretty Average Movie, Not Bad, Not Good","I was raised with Star Wars, all six of them, and loved each one. Since the release of the new movie, I thought it was about time I revisited the movies before I went and saw the new one. I'm somewhat happy to say that the second prequel has held up for the most part.Unlike the Phantom Menace, which was pretty bad this time watching it, Attack of the Clones is much better. One of the biggest struggles of the first movie seemed to be in finding good actors. In the second installment we get much better ones. The acting is, although not fantastic, a vast improvement of the first one. Its very average and sometimes a little over the top, which I know is the style George Lucas was going for. Although it could be really cheesy at times, and the over the top acting felt fake and sometimes out of place, it was easy to look past and enjoy the film for what it was.The plot is, as I suspected, better than I remember. It's much more political, and is actually pretty interesting, more so than the first one. Although I'm not particularly fond of the whole ""let's just go to war to solve all our problems"" scenario, it certainly is more entertaining then negotiating.The characters were more focused on this time around. They were good for the most part. Not bad, but not great either. Anakin himself often seemed disinterested, but I assume that was just his acting ability.The CGI effects weren't always good. It was clear what was more focused on and what wasn't. I know that all the clones were CGI, but I felt like that was understandable and didn't really take away from the movie. Sure, sometimes, it was blatantly obviously that they were fake, but sometimes they looked real enough for you to believe them. I still wish there had been at least a few real clones, as it would have made the movie look a little better, but it's really not a big deal to me at all and I don't see why people seem to get so mad about it.Overall Attack of the Clones is just an average movie. Nothing particularly special about it. Not a bad movie, but not a good one either. I still enjoyed it, despite it not being that well-done. In the end I would only recommend this movie if you were really interested in it, or if you had already watched the Phantom Menace and wanted to continue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pretty good movie,"Well I saw Attack of the Clones and must say I enjoyed it. It has good entertainment value. But it had all the problems that the other 2 Star Wars movies that George Lucas directed were filled with.I have to say that George Lucas should step out of the director's chair for Ep III. The biggest problem Lucas directoral attempts have is that they ""flowed"" badly, I mean ""Deep Impact"" badly. You know what I mean, pretty much everyone has seen enough movies to know what I mean, your sitting there watching the movie, and It cuts to a different scene, and you say to yourself ""that shouldn't have cut there, man that was to fast, and why are we here now?"". Episode IV, and Episode I were eroded with the same problem, it looked like everything is cut up into micro stories, and then blended poorly together, Attack of the Clones had the same problem. Just compare ESB, and ROTJ to the rest, George Lucas stepped out of the Director's seat, and it made for good movies, with more then just alot of action to hold it together.The other problem that Lucas has is that he has middle men (""Yes"" men) that are filters between him and his fans, this makes him pretty oblivious to fan reactions. Here's a perfect example, he made an appearence on ""Inside Entertainement"", Canada's version of Entertainment Tonight. He was asked what he thought of the fans reactions to Jar Jar, and this was his answer:""There were a few fans that disliked Jar Jar, but they didn't like him even before the movie came out"" - LucasCan you tell me of anyone who liked this character?Oh and George, don't listen to your kids, and put in lines like ""This is a real drad"", and ""This party's over"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Style Over Substance Episode II,"There was no way I wasn't going to see this film, however, like Episode I, this is a triumph of special effects over plot and acting, and definitely a case of style over substance.Industrial Light and Magic have obviously outdone themselves, a highlight was the chase through the asteroid field.  But what Episodes I and II totally lack for mine is any sense of wanting to cheer for the good guys and boo the bad guys.  You just don't have that sense of the characters taking you along on the journey with them which the first three films had by the bucket-load.An interesting and humourous side note, watching as an antipodean, was hearing all the Australian and New Zealand accents, especially Jango Fett who I'm afraid will always be the violent Jake Heke of 'Once Were Warriors'. Either that or seeing familiar famous local actors trying to put on accents, in Jack Thompson's case, quite atrociously!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Just a ordinary movie which doesn't feel like ""StarWars""","I just went to that movie yesterday and like Phantom Menace it was a real disappointment. Most of the people will have seen the movie by now so I won't bother about the contents of the movie. But a few thing have to be said. At first the setting is beautiful made. The locations the costumes they all look beautiful and the special effects are awesome. The music is quite good and has a nice opera effect when hearing it. But this doesn't make the movie a ""good"" movie. Although the landscape is beautiful made it has no atmosphere. The whole look is like seeing a normal US city in the future. The whole concept of another world with its own culture and civilization has been neglected. Those people in that planet is nothing more than the USA in the future. And all the people in the movie behaves the same. No cultural differences. The whole idea that the queen had become a senator was terrible. The whole personality, and elegance of an aristocracy have been wiped out by this idea. A chosen queen??? The whole meaning that Luke Leila SkyWalkers background is ""chosen"" and ""special"" is just gone. And the way she acts is so ordinary that you don't find her to be an important person like the people in the movie suggest she would be. The whole concept of the Jedi knight was meant to be some kind of an elite order of knights within the system. In the movie they just differ from the rest of the soldiers that they are fighting with light sabers and not with laser guns. It doesn't fell that they were special at all. They had no special customs or rites. No symbols or mythologies. And the fighting scene was very nice done but also dull. Those people are fighting robots... The excitement is missing when you know that they are just machines. All in all the movie lacks the ""magic"" and ""atmosphere"" of a good epic space opera. It wasn't epic at all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Stop being a funsponge and enjoy the freakin' movie already, you must!","I was, needless to say (go read my review), a bit disappointed with ""the Phantom Menace"".  So when I went to see ""Attack of the Clones"", my mood was more one of ""as a Child of the 80's, it's really my civic duty to go 'Star Wars' crazy once in a while"", rather than, ""I'm going to see 'Star Wars 2' and have FUN!!!""And lo and behold, I had great fun at ""Attack of the Clones""!I'm trying to figure it out.  I guess it's simply that Episode Two just *feels* more like a ""Star Wars"" movie.  There's more gleeful swashbuckling action.  The plot has finally kicked in and is starting to get interesting. My favorite characters from the original trilogy are finally getting in the spotlight.It isn't perfect.  I'll admit that.  I'm still not anticipating part three as much as I am counting the weeks until ""the Two Towers"" and ""Matrix Reloaded"".  But it IS a much more enjoyable movie than many movie critics would have you believe.One hint: anytime Amidala and Anakin are onscreen together before they head to Tatooine, go get more popcorn.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Dramatic improvement,"I will have to admit I was skeptical going into my viewing of Episode II, after the disappointment of Episode I. However, I was pleasantly surpirsised by the film. In many respects, Lucas has returned to those elements which made his prior films a success. As you would expect, there are familiar faces, as well as new characters, and an explosive action finale. While no one may be surprised at the superior effects, it is actually the story of the inner struggle of Annakin, a momentous task to handle, that the film captures well. Performances are not as stale in this film, and it is a great improvement. This is a film Lucas can take some pride in. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
bleh,"aside from the bad actings, the real problem lies with the bad dialogues. i mean come on, the script is so bad, it makes rollerball's ""pow"" look good. lines such as ""i truly deeply love you,"" or ""i hate them"" just don't work in their respective moments. then there's dooku... who's nothing more than a 70 year old guy with lightsaber. was he really necessary to the franchise? other than that, the effects were pretty cool i thought but they couldn't save the movie. overall, im left with another disappointment.i give it 6",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A masterpiece!!!,"I find it very difficult to except that fans of the original trilogy don't appreciate these films. Its seems to me that bad critism is somewhat of a trend these days. Everyone finds the worst in everything. HERE'S THE BAD NEW PEOPLE ; The original trilogy had its major flaws too.Star Wars - Episode II : ""Attack of the Clones"" DVD in a 2:35:1 Widescreen aspect ratio with Dolby 5.1 Surround sound.FILM QUALITY - The best I have seen on the market thus to date! The quality, colour, texture is impressive, even in comparison to ""Episode I"", or ""The Lord of the Rings"".VISUAL EFFECT AND C.G. Animation - I must make a point of this. I am amazed at the new C.G. characters especially Yoda. His performance was more life like then Frank Oz's original puppet (especially the ""Phantom Menace"" performance). I was a little nervous about the ending saber battle, but seeing if for the first time gave me chills. Well done to Rob Coleman and his animation team at ILM.STORY - The film takes place 10 years after ""Phantom"" and, I assume, 20 years before ""A New Hope"", or the original Star Wars. Anakin, now a young man (even resembles Mark Hamill) is on his way to becoming a Jedi. Even though WE know his fate, I found it interesting to see him loose control once in a while. Hayden Christensen did a fine performance and had me convinced right from the get go. Skywalker and his Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, are ordered to protect the former Queen, now senator Padme Amadala from an assassin, only to find a deeper purpose. While Kenobi is primarily sent to investigate, Skywalker and Amadala romantically fall in love (something most movies lack these days).As far as story goes, ""Episode II"" is (or is one of) the most important Episodes in all of the trilogy. It is the center piece that combinds both trilogy's. I thought it was brillantly done and it changed my mind about the prequels. I give it a 10/10.

Duration (considering how little story is being said) of the movie may be its biggest handicap.I guess the problem with the movie seems to be the predictability of the movie's flow and the graphics overkill. We've just seen some much of this cloning business (a small group fighting a large multitude of beasts/mummies/ghosts/insects/robots/droids.... in the recent past that the only great feature (the visual extravaganza) seems to get boring and monotonous at times.Even the most enthusiastic fans who were cheering at the start for almost anything that moved on the screen, where walking out of the theatre like they were following a funeral procession when the closing credits were rolling.Can't complain about the acting, nor about the music, but the movie as a whole was a let down for me.

No to Digital Special Effects,"Good not great movie but what I'd like to comment upon are the digital special effects.In my opinion they don't cut it. What made the original 3 movies so memorable was the ""realism"". We all remember that mile-long ship just after the end of the rolling opening credits. It looked real as did just about every imaginary item in the three films.I felt in watching ""Clones"" that I was watching a super sophisticated video game. Except for the desert of Tatooine every other landscape looks phony. The cities look like drawings from a sci-fi magazine not  real places. That waterfall in the open country is beautiful but also unreal. Same for the Amidala's home world and most of the vehicles.I hope Lucas realizes his mistake to rely solely on digital trickery and returns in the third film to a mix of digital and more traditional models/real objects. It's clear that digital effects still can't do the job by themselves.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Even if it doesn't.,"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a film directed by George Lucas and is a part of the Star Wars series. The film delves into a period where the Galactic Republic is gradually unraveling and the rise of the Sith is beginning. It follows Anakin Skywalker's (Hayden Christensen) Jedi training and the development of his relationship with Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman).The film stands out for its impressive visual effects and action sequences. The diversity of galactic arenas and planets conveys the presence of an expansive universe. Action scenes and lightsaber battles can be enticing for Star Wars enthusiasts.However, the film has also faced certain criticisms. Characters' dialogues and performances might occasionally come across as artificial. Additionally, the handling of the romance between Anakin and Padmé might be considered weak by some viewers. Furthermore, political intrigues and background stories could slow down the pacing of the narrative.""Attack of the Clones"" presents an important period where the Sith are gradually emerging and the foundations of the Galactic Empire are being laid, showcasing the richness of the Star Wars universe. However, weaknesses in characterization and dialogues might impact the experience for some viewers.In conclusion, ""Attack of the Clones"" garners attention through its visually impressive scenes and presentation of a vast universe. Yet, the shortcomings in characterization and certain dialogues could prevent the film from being entirely satisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
better than phantom............. but so are most movies,"Alright im just going to get this out of the way, Aotc is better than phantom. ITs got a better story,better action, better effects and just plain more enertaining in my mind. With that said i will now let you know that doesant mean its that great of a movie. The writing is still bad, the acting is still not that great, the special effects are still way over used( the aliens in costumes look much better than the ones that are all computer), and the love story is just plain bad. Im not sure what lucas was thinking when writing out the dialog but its like he cant figure out how to have interesting conversations. Lucas never uses more words than he has to move the plot along(unless its to make a sassy remark at the worst times)Maybe its just me but i like to see normal conversations sometimes so that we can really learn about the characters.Action wise the movie is pretty good. The fight between Obi wan and jongo fett is great and anakin going on a killing spree was suprising and just plain awesome. But other moments when the movie could be great its killed by stupid jokes. The end was getting really good until c3po has to screw it up with bad jokes that dont fit.If Lucas has done anything right its that ill see episode 3 cause there is still a chance to end star wars with a bang. FOr me thats having a plot twist no one see's coming.WHy does anakin have to be Vader? WHy does he have to be the father of luke? With a few great twists at the end of these 3 movies can make you look at the other 3 in a whole new light and give them a whole new meaning.

Too much yet too little,"It was just action after action. However, much of it did not have much meaning to the greater plot at hand. Furthermore, while I welcome a good romance, this unfortunately, is not.

Top notch graphics that truly bring out the essense of the film. If not for it's somewhat convoluted and subpar plot, this film would have been an absolute winner.Still, despite its many apparent faults, if you take into account the success of which this film it's riding on, and with it the greater plot at hand, this film makes for a decent transitional film to the key elements of the franchise as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Another dent in the legacy.,"This makes ALL the same mistakes that made The Phantom Menace the biggest disappointment in cinema history...and adds a truly awful title for good measure. Alluding to sci-fi B movies before you've even reached the opening credits is hardly a stroke of genius, and this bad judgment is present from start to finish.Amazingly, the utterly ruinous portrayal of Anakin Skywalker manages to be the worst part of Episode I AND II...just with a different actor. Anakin The Hot-Headed Bachelor is every bit as annoying as Anakin The Cutesy Little Twerp. His expression of anger and frustration - at basically everything - is hammy beyond belief, and the foreshadowing of his transformation into Darth Vader is both clumsy and transparent. The weak, superficial romance with Natalie Portman is the final nail in the coffin of a truly woeful performance.The CGI is as expensive as ever, and also as conspicuous and unrealistic. How embarrassing that, after 20 years and a lot more money, the special effects - particularly the rendering of characters like Yoda - actually look WORSE than those of the original trilogy.Once again, the script is poor, the plot spins off in all the wrong directions, and the principal villain is a let down. Whereas Darth Maul looked spectacular and was left with no dialogue and no character, Christopher Lee looks nowhere near as striking. He is thrown a few more lines than his predecessor, but is still isolated from centre stage. The half-hearted attempt at moral ambiguity simply diminishes his evil status even further. He is never frightening or imposing, a far cry from the supreme menance radiated from the original Darth Vader.The final light saber showdown was the only good thing about The Phantom Menace...here, it gets off to a brilliant start - Yoda is an absolute revelation - then fizzles out in a terrible anti-climax. How on earth did George manage to screw up a light saber battle in a Star Wars film?! This is the epitome of his miserable failure in continuing the saga.Is Episode II better than Episode I? It has become popular to say so...in truth, these films are equally poor. Many fans, desperate to whip up some excitement over Episode III, have done their best to clutch at straws, but that is all they are doing. Attack of The Clones is every bit as much a disappointment as The Phantom Menace...just less of a surprise.Copying practically everything that went wrong first time around does not bode well at all for the (I hope) final installment. More than likely, Episode III will be the sorry conclusion to George Lucas's attempt to destroy the memory of three of the greatest films ever made.This generation is much better off turning their attention to The Lord of The Rings (which would have matched the original SW trilogy, were it not for the over-long final film).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Much better than Episode 1, but still lacking heart","First off for all those people who liked this movie and are urging people to ignore the critics, think for a second.  You are a critic when you give any review, even a good one.  So, by that logic they should ignore you.  A discerning potential moviegoer will survey a variety of opinion, both good and bad, and decide accordingly.  Trying to divert this process by discrediting other people's posted opinion does everyone a disservice.Secondly, special effects and battle sequences alone can't make a movie. Star Wars fans, such as myself, that question Lucas' abandonment of characters and dialogue aren't asking for a Merchant-Ivory production.  We are simply asking for what we got with the first trilogy; bold, defined, and likable characters as well as a decent plot.  I judge Star Wars episodes against the high standard the series set for itself, not against other Hollywood genres.That said, here's my impression of the movie.The Good-Some great action sequences. Namely, Obi-Wan's fight and later pursuit of Jango Fett.  The gladiator sequence and subsequent Jedi battle.  As unbelievable and unrealistic as it was, the Coursecant flying car chase sequence.  And of course the final battle with the oft mentioned light sabre duel between a Jedi master and his former pupil.  These scenes had proper gravity, unlike the wooden and fake battle scenes against almost exclusively droids in Episode 1.-Good character work by MacGregor, even if the part is underwritten.  I liked the way that Obi-Wan has become kind of a unlucky fellow who has to deal with his not so stellar skills.  Kind of the series' over-achiever. This shows us the roots of the wisdom he exhibits as an older man in the first trilogy.  This poor man had nothing to do in Episode 1 but mimic Sir Alec Guiness.  It's nice they put him to work here.-Despite many opinions, I think Christenson was a good choice for Anakin. He seems athletic and energetic enough.  And he also mines some emotional nuggets in a poorly written part.  He should get some sort of reward for having to read the insipid psuedo-romantic lines to Padme.  I think most believe that Jake Lloyd was a huge mistake for Anakin in Episode 1.  Cute kid syndrome was rampant in the earlier film, and the kid was a terrible actor to boot.  Much improved here.-I liked some of the ways they foreshadowed the episodes to come.  At a few points, you do get to feel some of the dread that the impending dark time will warrant.  The feeling of dread was one of the great things about the first trilogy.  You really felt the prescence of repressive evil.  This was missing completely in Episode 1, but was hinted at here.-The effects were often breathtaking.  It made Epsiode 1 seem absolutely barren.  At times, the CGI was very apparent and took you out of the story, but on a whole I saw visual imagination of a high order.-Minimal Jar Jar Binks.  But why'd they put him in a position of power? Are they insane?The Bad-Dialog.  If another reviewer here says that dialog isn't important, I'm going to scream.  No, I don't expect the characters to sound like Hamlet, or even to utter colorful original words as in Pulp Fiction.  However, they should have dialog that distinguishes their character and invests some depth and sympathy in them.  Think about Han Solo, perhaps the best written character of the trilogy.  He said things that made him sound nothing like the other characters.  He had a chauvinistic streak, he had mixed loyalties etc.  None of the characters here seem like people.  And their line readings seem stiff as a board.  With the caliber of actors here, I can only blame Lucas who made the James Cameron mistake of thinking he could write dialog himself.-Over use of CGI.  The things they can do with CGI are incredible. However, too much use of it and you are overcome with a strange detached vibe from the screen.  You get the weird feeling you are watching a feature length video game.  And that's not good.  I'd take the somewhat limited traditional effects of the original trilogy over this any day.  At least you felt the actors were on actual sets in actual locations.  This makes me wonder why he shot in Australia.  Can't you setup a green screen just about anywhere?-Complicated plot.  The great thing about the original trilogy was it was easy to follow.  You have a repressive regime, and the good guys are trying to topple it.  In this one, I came out of the theater still questioning the loyalties of several characters.  It's almost as if you have to read all of the post-trilogy books that fill in the back story to make heads or tails of it.  The motivations of the characters just don't make sense often. Actually, Palpatine is the only understandable evil character in this respect.  He just wants power.  Easy enough to understand.-Clunky love story.  A good movie containing a love story can get you to understand the chemistry with little or no dialog.  This movie seems to be trying to make up for bad chemistry by soaking us with terrible cliche-drenched words.  I don't think you have to show us why Anni likes Padme.  After all she's beautiful, loyal, brave, resourceful and pure good. Who wouldn't fall for her?  But they failed to show why Padme would fall for this petulant, irresponsible, and often down-right hostile little boy.  And thus, I felt they will get together only because they must in order to produce Luke and Leia.In conclusion, I enjoyed the pic.  It was good escapist entertainment.  It shined far and above the abysmal Episode 1.  But, I still think Lucas is a ship far off course.  After almost 20 years, he lost what made the first three movies great.  Unfortunately, here he gains only a little bit of that magic back.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I am thankful that I was one of the first in the world to see this.,"Star Wars Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones has reawakened the joy of Star Wars in me. I live in New Zealand and we were favoured by the time zones, to see the world premiere of this before the rest of the world.I can only image what it was like to see the advances in technology in the original Star Wars film (afterwards renamed Episode IV - A New Hope), but I feel that this was a similar leap in audio visual entertainment. Industrial Light and Magic have outdone themselves yet again, though I am beginning to feel that Skywalker Sound is giving the sound effects a bit too much of a sameness... when will R2 say something other than the soundbites from the original movies?The backgrounds are stunning and the plot I found was a little easier to follow than the previous episode. I don't know whether this is because the film is structured better or because characters that we are being introduced to are ones that have already been involved in later episodes. I certainly get the feeling that chunks of the Star Wars ""jigsaw puzzle"" are coming into place.Fans will notice that a lot of dialog is delivered in similar fashion as the other films we have already seen; some of Amidala's lines are reminiscent of things that Leia says in Return of the Jedi, and we hear the usual verbal jousting... ""join me and together we will..."" etc. This seems to follow Lucas's intent that everything ""rhyme"". Themes and constructs are mirrored throughout the Star Wars story to give a semblance of wholeness. I don't think it's cheesy, but some may disagree.Speaking of cheese, many critics will be happy to know that the role of Jar-Jar Binks is peripheral at most, and when we do see him he is being less of a twit.It's about time we saw Master Yoda in action. We've heard people rant and rave about how he's so powerful, and you'll be happy to know that we finally see a slice of what he is capable of.My only problem and I don't know if it is a world wide one was that the film looked grainy (I guess I'll have to see it a few more times to see whether or not it was just the theatre that I was at ^_^).Throw in some gorgeous critters, more highspeed chase scenes that you can shake a stick at and light sabers everywhere and you have a high paced romp that is leaving me (at least) primed for the next installment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not just Lucas, but Star Wars, too, is back.","This is the most entertaining out of all the Star Wars movies.  Lucas brings back the franchise where it belongs with loads of nostalgic hype and links to the originals.  This may be a simply effective tool to reign the box office, but I think I stand with most Star Wars geeks in saying that those subtle and obvious foreshadowing points, etc. effectively brought huge grins on each person's face.  On top of this, the visuals in the film are simply unparalleled.  While Phantom Menace (which still is not a Star Wars movie in my book) had good stuff, the art was not so effectively implemented with the new visual technology as in this film.  Every new amazing shot of a spaceship, and you think they will not be able to top it, and then the next one leaves you hyperventilating because the visuals are that awesome.  The computer-generated character models are especially good--Jar-Jar looks even better than he did in Phantom, etc.There aren't too many flaws in this film for actual movie quality.  (There are none for entertainment value.)  The dialogue in a few scenes, especially the romantic ones, can get really lame.  Other times, though, the script is some of the best throughout all of Star Wars.  Even still, looking back at the originals, there has always been some pretty poor dialogue once in a while, and that did not hamper them in any way, and ultimately ends up only as a one point drop on 10 scale, at most.  Another problem was the presentation of Natalie Portman in a few scenes.  She obviously has great acting talent, and the problem was not her.  (Also, she is absolutely, constantly beautiful/sexy)  But she was not given the regality from Phantom that many of the scene's scriptings still called for.  The biggest one was a packing scene in which she kept stooping over, even when she needed to express her power, and the script doesn't really intend for her to appear so awkward throughout the scene.  I originally felt that the plot did not move enough in this movie, it mostly just thickens, and there is a lot to be taken care of in the next one, but then my friend reminded me that Empire really did not move that much, either, so much as leaving us on a cliff-hanger, and Empire is the best of all Star Wars.  So, the plot is fine overall.  Other than that, not too many problems.The good stuff.  Surprises of all surprises, the character of Jar-Jar Binks has completely redeemed himself.  I love the way he was used in this movie, for the deservedly short screen time he had.  Ewan gives the great performance we always knew he could for Star Wars, but the script still limits him as compared to some of his more powerful performances.  Natalie is good when presented correctly, and Samuel Jackson gives a basic, Steve McQueen-esque performance that has no fault but does not steal the spotlight (fortunately).  Hayden Christensen is the man.  Except when the scripting for him absolutely bites, he takes the cake for best performance in the movie, rivaling the quality in Star Wars of Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams (my personal favorites)  A few scenes will have you gaping at just how good this guy is, and I hope many casters and producers will pick him up for more, because he can do it.  Oh, and by the way, in case you had not heard it enough, Yoda = god.  Basically, combine the great character he has always been, then take the level of coolness of the younger Marlon Brando, or maybe Shaft, and combine it with his philosophical character, and you have the freaking coolest thing in a really cool movie.  The main bad guy is pretty cool, as well, but not as cool as his lightsaber.Basically, the coolest part of this movie is the large battle sequence at the end.  Easily the best in all sci-fi/fantasy ever, this battle is amazing, and I dare to say it rivals Black Hawk Down in actual movie quality of capturing the action.  It is simply amazing, and perfectly done.Lucas really treads some new, sweet ground in this with a totally sweet chase scene resembling noir stuff, and the realism-based epic battle. Overall, in actual movie quality I think this is better than Return, a little better than A New Hope (my second favorite) and almost touches Empire, even though by touching it it would not necessarily be as good. If the script for the romance sequences had been improved it would definitely touch Empire.  By the way this movie headed, the next one could very easily beat Empire in quality, because so much great plot-stuff has to be taken care of.See this as soon as you can, and then as many times as you feel are necessary to take in all the great details and entertainment.

A Computer Generated Mess,"Attack of the Clones, like its predecessor, The Phantom Menace, possesses intriguing concepts that could have made it an outstanding space epic. However, similar to its predecessor, the excessive use of digital effects makes this chapter in the Star Wars saga look like a video game.Hayden Christensen takes over the role of Anakin Skywalker, giving a subpar performance. The film hinges on the love story between Anakin and Padme, but Christensen has zero romantic chemistry with Natalie Portman. Instead of smitten, Anakin comes across as creepy. He also comes across as whiny and irritating in many instances. The dialogue is particularly terrible, and the Naboo scenes that develop the relationship between Anakin and Padme are excruciating to watch. The only redeeming factor of their relationship is the incredible love theme by John Williams, titled Across the Stars. Once again, his music surpasses the overall quality of the film.And while Hayden struggles as one of the film's protagonists, Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi is a significant improvement over his wooden portrayal in The Phantom Menace. He successfully makes the role his own, stepping away from Alec Guinness's shadow.The excessive reliance on digital effects results in a visually ugly film lacking grittiness, realism, and believability. This hampers investment in the story, characters, and locations. While Phantom Menace retained a small number of practical effects like the Original Trilogy, Attack of the Clones has wholly embraced the digital world, feeling like a completely different galaxy to the one George Lucas created in 1977. Even the beloved puppet Yoda, operated by Frank Oz, has been replaced by a fully CGI character, altering his essence. (It is worth noting that the practical puppet from The Phantom Menace was replaced by CGI in the Special Edition release).Despite its flaws, Attack of the Clones does introduce fresh story elements to the saga and features captivating new planets such as Coruscant, Kamino, and Geonosis. The city chase scene stands out as an enjoyable sequence, with Coruscant's cityscapes reminiscent of Blade Runner.One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the planet Kamino. It has an A. I. Artificial Intelligence vibe to it, and the mystery surrounding the clones is the best aspect of the film. The concept of an army of identical soldiers is both fascinating and frightening. The insect planet Geonosis is another creatively original planet, and the gladiator arena scenes are on a scale we haven't seen before in a Star Wars movie. Count Dooku is a fun new villain played by the excellent Christopher Lee.The final lightsaber duel doesn't come close to the exhilaration of The Phantom Menace's climactic fight. Seeing a CGI Yoda fighting an old man is not as exciting as the filmmakers expected. This scene and other action scenes in the film push the boundaries of plausibility, even for Star Wars, with characters leaping from skyscrapers and speeding vehicles high in the air.Overall, Attack of the Clones is a film of great ideas that are poorly executed. The third act had the potential to be incredible, with an enormous, epic scale that included a huge intergalactic battle, gladiator fighting, and numerous lightsaber battles. However, the excessive use of digital effects and poor execution diminishes the impact of its grand scale and ideas.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Yeah yeah,"Well, following up after the phantom menace and I can say that the movie is consistently as good. But whats not consistent is the dated cgi and effects, I understand that its older, but the movie ranges from looking incredible to be absolutely horrid to look at. The plot is actually quite good, I like how it flows and pieces together to form one huge scale battle at the end which is the real highlight of the movie. The only part of the plot I didn't enjoy was Anakins and Padmes romance, its just downright bad. Shockingly dreadful dialogue and some mediocre acting don't do the film Well. The characters also aren't developed too much, only Anakin really is, which is alright. But again the movie all comes down to the ending which is spectacular to watch. Unlike the new star wars movies this one gets how to do action and especially lights aber fights...literally the most important part of star wars. Which is why I give 7/10 the film knows what it should be and it executes it pretty well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not the best...Not the worst!,"Well it's here -- the eagerly awaited next instalment of the 'Star Wars' saga. The last one - 'Episode I' - was decidedly average and this one clocks in just above that. Anakin Skywalker (the new kid) is annoying and the love story between him and the Senator Padmé Amidala is lacking in chemistry and believability. The effects are as good as you'd expect from a 'Star Wars' film -- the flying and fighting sequences are great -- but if anything they go overboard with them -- as you can just see the video game footage being churned out straight from the movie! The only other real complaint I had with the film -- is all the bouncing around can be a bit tiresome and confusing. C3PO isn't in it nearly enough but when he is, he steals the show. Yoda's quips and 'Crouching Tiger' moves were enjoyable as was the always delightful Ewan McGregor. At the end of the day, the movie will be HUGE and it is better than the last one. ""True"" 'Star Wars' fans will no doubt enjoy this and see it again and again. Once was enough for me, I think, though. If you do go see it, stock up on plenty of food as it clocks in at nearly 2 and a half hours! Enjoy! :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"George, we miss the passion from the originals.","As a child, I must have seen the original three episodes about 100 times. The movie was presented to me in a way that was easy to understand and the characters were well defined.  You knew who the bad guys were...and who were the heroes.  The effects were awesome, yet simple compared to today's standards.  At the end of ""A New Hope"", I couldn't wait to see the next movie.  At the end of ""Empire"", I was jumping out of my seat...applauding and cheering.But now....My good friend and I saw it 'this morning' at a midnight showing.  When it was over...no one clapped, or cheered.  We all just walked out.  I could sense from the other viewers the disappointment I also felt.  The effects were wonderful....but almost TOO much.  Where was the heart of the movie like ""A New Hope""?  My friend quoted it perfectly...""They should call this sequel 'Anakin Creek'"".AOTC is a good movie, but is far from reaching the standards we have come to love from the originals.  It is much better than Phantom Menace (easy enough).  I feel that Mr. Lucas has chosen to ignore the cries from his fans and decided to simply make a movie for himself.  So many of the action sequences are OVERDONE.  He might like all that eye-candy, but fans like us want a better story....not a city of floating cars.We all have learned in English class the term ""KISS"" or Keep it Simple Stupid.  There are too many plots going on that are poorly defined.  The love story (or lack of it) is worse than a TV daytime SOAP.  Finally, there is just WAY too much animation.  My guess...you could easily cut out 30-45 minutes of the stuff and still have a great movie.Please Mr. Lucas, review original Star Wars episodes.  Create that type of energy and plot line for us when you make the next one.  We like simple stuff like light sabers, tie-fighters, good guys, bad guys, and Han Solo. Leave the digital effects for Pokemon.PS - Delete Jar Jar Binks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Attack of the Middle Movie,"Stuck between The Phantom Menace(99) and Revenge of the Sith(05), this one-sixth of the Star Wars saga may end up being the most forgettable of all. There are no scenes which seem to stand out and at least embed themselves in the memory. Phantom Menace may have been a bit slower going but at least you had the devil-like Darth Maul killing a Jedi Knight and the first glimpse of a planet-sized city. The climax here is still my favorite sequence of this film, with Chris Lee showing off his still-formidable chops, but this doesn't say much for the rest of the picture. Annakin Skywalker has grown up from a cute little boy of Phantom Menace into a pouting young man (Christensen), mentored, with difficulty, by Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor). The Jedi Knights (led by Yoda) deal with mysterious plots to create an army of clones, which are scheduled to fight some war for some reasons unknown. Annakin learns about loss, in a couple of different ways, and begins a slight turn towards the dark side, in the form of vengeance. It looks like Christensen was instructed to act younger than he is because that part does work out - he comes across as very immature. Meanwhile, the clone army wears the same stormtrooper white armor we all first saw in Star Wars(77 aka A New Hope), which means they were all clones...? Darth, where are you when we need yuh? The pic is naturally hampered by being the middle one in the 2nd (1st?) trilogy, with no real beginning or ending. All you can do is look forward to Darth Sidious doing his thing in the next installment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas has run out of ideas,"This film is far, far superior to the Phantom Menace. However, George Lucas has left himself with too much to do from a storytelling perspective, and appears to be way out of his depth. For all his claims of having the grand storyline written all along, he suddenly has to get from point A (powerful, precocious young Jedi) to point B (most evil man in the galaxy) over the course of two films, and it doesn't look like he knows how. What results is a mess of cliches and rehashes of his own (and other people's) work, riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions, and with parts looking like the opening chapters of My First Book of Love Stories.The special effects are, of course, astounding. It's rumoured that 95% of the film isn't real, and although that's certainly believable, you may have a hard time spotting the gaps between the genuine 5% and the rest. The Phantom Menace was technically impressive, despite its other more obvious (and less forgivable) flaws, but this film exists on another level beyond it. However, special effects do not the film make - and although poor effects can ruin a film, perfect effects do not make it a success (just look at the Final Fantasy movie).This effort may be heralded as a ""return to form"" for George Lucas, but if that is the case, then it makes me inclined to go back and watch the original trilogy with a more critical eye and see if they are as weak as the most recent two. And I don't want to do that - I treasure my childhood memories.Exciting, visually magnificent, in parts amusing, but overall it is a two-hour exposition of the mind of George Lucas, which seems far shallower, and emptier, than I'd ever considered. An improved 6/10 to the Phantom Menace's 4.Kids should love it, if they know what's good for them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Rather weak but still watchable,"As I an older Star wars fan I do still like the prequels, Revenge of the sith is by far the best in the prequels The phantom of menace is very good but its is bit too long as for Attack of the clones well it is rather weak compared to the other star wars films. Fans do say this is their least favorite in the star wars series and saying its the worst one out all of them. While I do agear that it is weak rather forgettable,but I disappear that its the worst movie ever made. its not that bad at all but I think it could of been a tiny bit more stronger here list of things that made this film weak. 1. too much romance okay in the empire strikes back their was bit of romance but not to the point of romance in this one. 2. not enough Jango fett or Count Douko as I think that we don't much about these expect that douko did appear a lot in the clone wars series but I would like to know a little bit more of Jango Fett as he had less scream time in this whole film.all in all still a watchable but probley the weakest one in the series so far.but I still like this film I just think it could of been a bit more stronger 7/10 for still watchable but weak",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but not perfect","A worthy summer blockbuster, but little quirks keep it from a perfect action thriller.First, the film lacks the youthful energy of Episode IV: A New Hope - it takes itself way too seriously. Hayden Christensen is awkward in almost every scene, too holdback during the first half and not fierce enough during the second half. The love scenes between Anakin and Padme are not very well developed and acted - Anakin is just too young to be charming enough to win over Senator Amidala. Obviously the film intends to show that it's Anakin's wild side that attracts Padme, but there's very little of that shown during the time the two actually spend together. And later on in the scene where he shows his dark side, it should be a closeup with his eyes burning and teeth grinding with anger and sends chills down the spines of the audience - but it doesn't, he's too good looking a kid to make you scare of him.Second, like Episode I: The Phantom Menace, there are some totally unnecessary scenes. I understand the desire to create an entire world (or galaxy to be precise), but some sequences (like the factory) interrupt the flow of the story and just drag down the action.Third, the fight scenes are not very well choreographed. The Jedi duels are the perfect place to overuse wires like The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but like The Phantom Menace, the fight scenes, especially the one with a squadron of Jedi Knights versus thousands of battle droids, are too repetitive. A Hong Kong action choreographer like Yuen Woo-ping, would've made wonders here. Even the duel between Yoda and Darth Tyranus (Count Dooku), thought great to look at, could have been more imaginative.And last, the FX is very well done generally, but some scenes, like the chase at the beginning of the movie could've used less - sometimes the CGI world can be too distracting and keep the focus off the action.Don't get me wrong, I still like this movie, a lot, and would recommand it to anyone. But there's still a lot of room to improve on the script, the acting and the FX.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Yikes, this is bad","Re-watching all the Star Wars films for the benefit of a younger member of my family and ... this one is just absurdly shockingly bad and easily forgettable.Now that I'm viewing these more dispassionately, rather than when they first came out when I considered this one better than The Phantom Menace simply because it seemed more ""mature"" to me, this is actually a lot worse. At least The Phantom Menace had a clear (if boring - trade disputes anyone??) plot and structure, with a first, middle and final act, and a nicely self-contained story.This film can only be summed up as ""The one where Obi-Wan discovers the clone army that we see in Revenge of the Sith, and Anakin and Padme fall in love"". That's really all you need to know, anything else that happens in this is basically filler, very badly scripted, and using woeful CGI).Also any ""romantic scenes"" are just criminally bad, with truly cringe-worthy dialog (seriously, you have to see it to believe it) and not an ounce of chemistry between these two people who are supposedly in love (they both look like they'd rather be anyplace else).Avoid, avoid avoid. Just watch The Phantom Menace (it's worth it just for Darth Maul), and proceed straight to Revenge of the Sith, understanding that some stuff happened in between that means the Republic now has an army of people that look a bit like the storm troopers from the original trilogy.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I couldn't help but laugh at the complete pointlessness and idiocy of some scenes.  It was like a cross between Bold and the Beautiful and The A-Team - NO - that would be disrespectful to the A-Team.  The actors (and I use the term loosely) had as much on screen charisma and presence as a line of parking meters. Lucas should concede that he is a visionary - not a director. It is no coincidence that the most loved of all the Star Wars films - Episode 5 - was not written nor directed by Lucas.  Fair enough, the CGI is very good - but it is just not believable. Movies such as The Matrix and LOTR simply blow these ""new"" Star Wars films away in terms of professionalism, acting, effects and screenplay. I can't be bothered buying a copy of this film for my collection.  But I might rue that decision in case I accidently swallow some drain cleaner and need to make myself throw up.

"By itself a Good Movie BUT Where has the Star Wars ""feeling"" Gone?","I love the Star Wars films and have since I saw Star Wars IV in the theater as a kid. This is a very good movie and it is great to finally see the beginning unfold, but it seems with the special effects and abilities George Lucas has found, he has lost that true Star wars feeling. You remember in the original the spine tingling shots like when Luke and the Princess swung across the missing bridge, you felt it. Also the Original movies had a look, be it lack of modern special effects or intended look from Lucas, either way I loved it, The greys gave a ""cold and dark feeling"" to space. The new movies have changed and do not have the look of the with the new colors and everything stepped ahead of the older, they do not fit in with the old. The new movies make the ships and technology look more advanced than the original trilogy which comes later in time after the movies we see now.Don't get me wrong I love the new movies and I love this Movie, was great to see Yoda kick some #$@! But they just don't give you the same feeling as the original Trilogy.

Vast improvement...,"I saw this movie a couple of weeks after it opened because I wanted to read what people thought about it before I saw it.  In a number of instances I was taken aback by the number of people who seem to be personally offended by this movie.  They sound as if they expected Lucas to make the movie to THEIR specifications, etc. rather than his.  I will agree, the story is much better than the first but, they are both just as good as the original 3 episodes.What I don't understand is the rather forceful rebuke of the romantic twist in this movie.  Many who simply can't stand it all profess to be die hard Star Wars fans, but, they seem to forget Han and Leia...  Besides, if Anakin is going to be the father of Luke, Luke is gonna need a mother; it stands to reason at least doesn't it?  If we want to revisit Greek mythology we can have Luke popping out of Anakin's head like Zeus and Athena but, that just doesn't work.We hear a much less campy script, although the light hearted, corny, 3PO lines during the ""colosseum"" scene, but it was just good fun.  We are blessed with less Jar-Jar; I think I appreciated his goofiness much more in this movie because instead of a constant stream of it we got just a peppering.Another complain I heard was the understanding of the Force in this movie, that the Jedi seem to have ""lost"" the understanding of what it is all about. But, I think that this comes from a blind viewing and not putting that LOSS in the context of the other movies in which there the Jedi are not simply destroyed but the understanding of it is lost.  The Dark Side, for the most part, has over powered the good guy in the original 3 and Luke is the ""New Hope"" for the Jedi...  Sometimes the titles of the movies tell us something...don't you think?This movie was impressive and fun.  There were some kinks, I think, in the plot (For one, I didn't understand the fact that Dooku didn't know about the Clone Army yet he was the one who recruited Jengo Fet to be the clone host) but, I don't care.

"Better, but still stagnant & disappointing","Yes, it is better than Episode 1. But, this is still a very stagnant (exposition heavy) and disappointing film (SOMETIMES, you just can't put that old magic jeanie back in the bottle). The STAR WARS series has become the souless creation of a man, Lucas, who's spent too much time with his electronic toys and not enough in the ""real world"". This is no better exemplified by the ""I'm Lost here"" look in Samuel L. Jackson & Natalie Portman's eyes.As to the digital projection aspect. I am shocked at how few people have commented on how ""digital"" the film looks. Visible resolution lines, digital smearing, pixellation, subtitles which look like they have ""stripes"" jagging through the white lettering, and obvious contrast problems when Very Dark & Very Bright elements in the same frame co-exist. I know 90% of the general public don't notice (or care) about such things. But, it still looks like TV blown up large. Admittedly, scan lines and resolution will continue to get better, but it Digital ain't there yet. I also found that when I saw PERFECT STORM & OCEAN'S 11 (the latter at the very same screen as I saw Lucas' folly) digitally projected, they both looked a little better than CLONES.

It may be due to a technical advance to make characters like that, but to me puppets that were used in Episode IV, V and VI looked more real and had more feeling. And to speak about the plot itself, it was cheesy. Too much happened in too short time. I think Lucas tried to add too much to the film and so he still couldn't produce the feeling the older episodes had. The old man is just too creedy.

A decent successor to Episode I... nothing more...,"I don't see why so many people consider this to be a work of a genius. Lucas has excellent funding with which he can hire the best special effects people in the industry. You EXPECT excellent special effects. I think that most of the scenes looked like they were video-game cutscenes (reminiscent of Final Fantasy). They looked original, colorful, but far from photo-realistic. (And sorry guys, a bunch of people in an arena with glowing rods fighting off hundreds of computer-generated creatures just doesn't do it for me.) The creatures looked like bad guys from role-playing games... I wish they would spend more time trying to come up with foes that actually LOOK fierce.The sound is excellent, the acting is okay. Evan McGregor and Christopher Lee are great; Natalie Portman, one of the best actresses of her generation, is okay. She is there to look good, and she does a fine job at that. Christensen is, well, pretty bad. Some of the characters are great, which is one of the reasons why I like watching any film that Lucas is involved with (like Indiana Jones)! Obi-Wan and the Count are excellent. Palpatine has an excellent bad-guy voice. I fail to see why Samuel L. Jackson was so hyped up. He was supposed to have excellent fighting scenes, but all we really saw were basic enemy fire deflections and a few slashes. I was disappointed when he beheaded the ambitious Jango Fett, who was one of the highlights of this film!Overall, I think the movie was quite lame; most of the scenes were borrowed from other films (Examples: the chase scene from The 5th Element, the Gladiator scene), and the unoriginal scene transitions made the movie feel like a PowerPoint slideshow. Lucas needs to hire some good editors.The best thing about Star Wars is the story. Lucas did an excellent job with the storyline for his saga... too bad the screenplays are weak. Some of the dialogue was irritating, some of it was adequate... the rest was simply bad. C-3PO replaced Jar Jar... he is officially Mr. Annoying in this movie. I was constantly hoping that he would get destroyed during the last fight scene; he was getting on my nerves.Finally, the movie lacked darkness. All the pretty colors, happiness, and pretty fight scenes fail to provide a dark atmosphere for the film. Then again, it has been blessed with a lame PG rating (I guess this was Lucas's goal). I recommend this movie for everyone. It is nothing incredible, but definitely worth 150 minutes of your time just to see what the special effects gurus are able to achieve today. I love intelligent, well-written, dark, and unpredictable movies. This was film doesn't fit into any of those categories. I am going to watch the third installment with low expectations as well... but who knows?

A Personal Rant,"Reasons why I will boycott ""Star Wars Episode II -- Attack Of The Clones"":*  The ""original"" Star Wars was exciting because of the ground - breaking special effects and because of the saga character.  A generation on, the Star Wars ""Episodes"" have nothing new to offer, especially in the field of special effects.*  ""Episode I -- The Phantom Menace"" sucked badly, especially considering that it was one of the most hyped and highest - grossing movies of all time.*  It really, really, really, really sucked.*  And I will only be suckered once.*  There is no such thing as a ""must see"".  Especially not in the field of Star Wars.  I want to see Star Wars to be entertained, and not to join the Millions who can claim that they have seen the entire series.*  George Lucas is a rich enough man already.*  George Lucas should limit himself to producing and the technical aspects, and leave the creative bits (writing and directing) to someone with talent.*  Even the special effects in E1 were awful -- to speak nothing of the story, dialogue, acting -- in fact everything that makes a movie.*  Jar Jar Binks in Episode I is the single most annoying, unfunny nd offensive character in movie history ... and Lucas thought it necessary to roll him out again for the sequel, because, as he told German magazine Spiegel, he is not one to be swayed by public opinion or prescreenings. Sure signs of megalomania are beginning to show ... where are the guys in white suits and rubber sneakers when you need them?*  So what if E2 is ""not as bad as"" or even ""better than"" E1 -- the ""Mentos - The Fresh Maker"" commercials are cinematic genius compared to E1.*  There is romance in E2.  I just don't trust George Lucas with romance, the same way I wouldn't trust Jane Campion with sci-fi or action.  And the reviews I have read so far vindicate me.*  The original Star Wars was likeable because it was aimed at nerds.  The ""Episodes"" are strictly Disney, clean, wholesome, family fun, and utterly boring.

A vast improvement over the Phantom Menace,"This was one of the two movies I chose to see this weekend in Russian because I knew the dialogue would not be the best aspect of the movies(the other one was Spider-Man). From what I could understand, the lines were a bit flat. I didnt get in all of the story, but I loved the CGI. It was very very exciting. Thankfully, Jar Jar Binks had a very small part in the movie. I was a bit confused as to the story's plot, but i still enjoyed it very much. A must-see in the theatres, just because of the wonderful effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing Visuals w/ A Whole Lot Of Terrible Dialog,"See the title?  That about sums it up.

The best so far!!!,"I love this movie, I give it a 5 of 5.  Before I begin my review, let me explain MY rating system: 1)Not worth seeing for free, 2)Worth seeing for free, 3)Worth paying to see, 4)Worth paying to see, again and 5)Worth the purchase. Now on to my review:  George Lucas has done it again!  This is his crowning achievement so far, and it's only gonna get better!  I know a lot of people didn't like the acting or the dialogue, but to the fans this was beyond a masterpiece.  This movie far surpasses everything in the previous trilogy with sound and visuals.  Granted, George Lucas sticks to a certain formula, but if the shoe fits... I feel that the acting in the movie was not as bad as most have said, and the dialogue is standard Star Wars.  There is no way around it.  George Lucas has his method of doing things and he's not gonna change.  For every Star Wars fan that thought this movie was bad look at it this way: My wife is ABSOLUTELY NOT a Star Wars fan, but she liked this one! If a non-fan can like it, why can't everyone who claims to be loyal?  I say respect Lucas for his vision and his dreams, because if it was not for Star Wars 90% of the movies today could not have been made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
More action packed,"After the odd mess that was Episode I, this film demonstrates a tight focus on plot progression and action. In other words, it actually gets to the point, for the most point. We still get some strange character moments and moping, but overall it was an alright watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Force Needs Character,"Well, this film can be reviewed as two seperate movies, really. One is a visual treat on a level never before seen in the cinema. The other is a character play that clunks along like cinematic artereosclerosis.Fans who hope for an ""improvement"" on ""Phantom Menace"" may be thinking quite a bit over ""Clones"". The story continues to be an explanation of the first trilogy rather than a story on its own. It reads like a backstory. The implication is always that the first three films are the reverential material, and ""Clones"" (along with ""Menace"") is merely the prolog. Consequently, none of the characters have any of the charm that the first films had. This is a problem that will persist into ""Episode III"". It is a major dramatic weakness that no amount of special effects can cure.Hayden Christensen does his best to present a conflicted Anakin. The character has to play against a continuing wooden Ewan McGregor, who has yet to capture the gravitas of Alec Guinness. Christensen also has to contend with Nathalie Portman and convince the audience that we should believe and care that the two are falling in love. I don't. I can understand Anakin's obsession, but not Portman as the object of it. In order to be three dimensional and empathetic, one must be more than an object. And there's that lack-of-charm thing again.Lucas has repeatedly said that this prequel triology is meant to find an echo with the first three. Obi Wan is Obi Wan, Anakin is the Luke replacement, Amidala is the Lea replacement, Jar Jar is the Chewbacca replacement, jango Fett is the Boba replacement, and so on. Where's the Han Solo replacement, the ""rogish"" character that personified the charm of the first three films? It isn't there.The story itself could be compelling, but is bogged down again by explication. Apart from a pretty good car chase scene in the first quarter of the movie, nothing really happens. The plot revolves around an assassination attempt on Senator Amidalla, but we the audience never get a sense of urgency because we don't care about her. The only interesting thing is the tension between Obi Wan and Anakin, and if anything, we empathize with Anakin. Obi Wan is a priggish ass.I'm not quite sure what to make of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Yoda"". It seems to me that his inability to perceive Palpatine's machinations, along with his generalling at the end of the film is out of character. But it got a good laugh (one of the few the audience had).Personally, I would like to have seen more seducing between Palpatine and Anakin, and this promises to be the one true character play of this trilogy.Now, let's look at the other film: the visuals. Nothing on this scale has ever been seen in the cinema. The digital video photography is almost on par with celluloid. Almost. The only fault is the washed out palette when the filming moves into sunlight. The definition is as good as traditional 35mm, and signals a final death knell for the latter medium. Technical Oscar for ILM.The production design is what one would expect from Lucasfilm. Apart from nods to Bladerunner, Metropolis and Gladiator (to name a few) the vistas are magnificent and well worth seeing the movie over again.All things considered, though, when I left the theatre today, I wanted to load my VCR with some recent tapes of ""Enterprise"" and watch characters I really care about. The story might be a little smaller in scale, but ""Birth of the Federation"" is a more interesting story than ""Birth of the Empire"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas has fallen to the dark side...,"Being a huge Star Wars fan myself, I was very eager to see the next chapter in this saga. I must admit I have been dissapointed by the Phantom Menace which I found evasive and quirky compared to the more ""serious"" or ""classics"" sequels. Nevertheless, I had heard the second one would be different, that it would be targeted at a more adult audience and I hoped some people might have learn from their past mistakes... But what I saw makes me beleive Lucas has fallen to the dark side of the force...It is true that the special effects are very impressive, realistic and beleivable. I personnally didnt see much improvement on that matter since the first episode. The settings are better looking, the mood of the movie is therefore more ""star-warsih"" (if you see what I mean). I cant deny the fact that the movie looks good (it's been filmed in digital format) and that it sounds good. Attack of the clones is like a nicely wrapped up gift.The only problem is what you find when you open the gift; Merely nothing. Young Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) really doesnt look like much of a jedi; he doesnt seem to have a personnallity of his own. It's the same thing with most of the characters; they speak out their dialogue and that's about it. Even the ""seduction"" scenes between Nathalie Portman (Amidala) and Anakin look passionless...Another big problem is the structure of the film. The beginning of the movie is quite promising, the situation is critical, the Republic is on the verge of a crisis and something must be done. Senator Amidala (former queen of Naboo) is on Coruscent to vote on the creation of a Army of the Republic. The story is interesting, certainly better than the one in episode 1. Problem is, from this point on, you almost forget about the story and are sent on a roller coaster ride of action scenes intercutted with love scenes, all of which are overdone or poorly executed. I'm sorry, but if R2 would have had rockets on his sides so he could fly, he wouldnt have let himself fall down in the sand in the beginning of Return of the jedi.Some fans might disagree about my review, yes there are good scenes in Episode 2, not all of it is bad. But like a brick wall cimented with dental paste, it just doesnt hold too well.3/10 -",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better than Episode I, but not without flaws.","This penultimate chapter in the Star Wars hexology is better than the last, but not flawless. With all the kids grown up and Jar Jar off to the side (though important to the progression of the story) Lucas has taken the cutsey feeling that TPM had.The story (no spoilers): Well, people are getting all antsy about something and factions are leaving left-n-right. The Jedi council is starting to get overwhelmed. Meanwhile, Kanobe is training young Anakin to be a Jedi. Anakin is now like a grown up punk who whines and bitches alot. Queen Amidala is now a Senator. It becomes a double story of protecting the senator (Anakin's job) and finding out what's going on (Kanobe's job).The good: 1) Yoda: Trust me, you'll know *exaclty* what I mean when you see this. 2) Ewan McGregor: Lots of action and a touch of humor, Kanobe is older but perhaps still needed more training as a Jedi. McGregor delivers the funny quips with good timing. IMO, his acting shines, though perhaps it's because he had the best lines. 3) Last 30 minutes. Finally, action! 4) No Jar-Jar. As I said above, he plays a central role in one scene, but other than that, is out of the picture. Good. Meesa couldn't take another movie him as a leading character. 5) Jango Fett: Bobba Fett's dad. Guy kicks ass. 6) Yoda: Yes, it's worth mentioning twice. 7) No mention of metachlorines (or whatever): In my opinion, the metachlorine thing was the *worst* thing Lucas could have done. The mysterious force is now just a bunch of germs. 8) Great aliens. Lucas knows how to paint a picture.The bad: 1) Dialogue: Anakin uses a line on Padme that wouldn't work in a sleazy bar filled with women who haven't seen a man in years. Worked for Padme. Maybe he was using the force all along... Samuel Jackson delivers his lines without any emotion. Maybe that's what he was told to do, but it just seemed like he was reading his lines like someone who wanted to be somewhere else. 2) ""Pod-racerish scenes"": There's a couple of scenes where you just feel that Lucas put them in only to show the CGI prowess. Not nearly as bad as the dismal pod racing scene, but it grew tiresome, at least for me. 3) Long strip of non-action in the beginning. For a (long) while Anakin and Kanobe split. Two stories are then told, switching back and forth between them. In the first hour, there's only one action scene. Lotsa talking. 4) Lame story progression. Example: Kanobe is looking for a planet not in the star charts. He asks yoda (and a bunch of kids) for help. Yoda tells him to go to the place where the planet should be. Uh, duh? 5) Missed opportunity in Anakin's transition to the dark side. I can't say much, but it's the scene where he goes back to find his mother. So much could have been done to show Anakin's transition. Why Lucas didn't do this, I don't know.It's better than Ep1, not as good as Ep4/5, and I'm not sure about Ep6. But it's worth seeing, it needs to be seen on the big screen, and it's worth seeing more than once.7/10.PS. Yoda rocks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
And yet...,"I find myself agreeing with almost every review that I've read.  I know that sounds ridiculous.

Lucas needs an editor,"I saw this in the theater several times, as well as at least once or twice on DVD. I finally got around to watching the blu-ray, after at least three or four years of not seeing it. While it isn't as much of a mess as Episode 1 was, Episode 2 makes several missteps that are disappointing, but not offensive. The primary mistake is that Lucas got carried away with wanting more spectacle. He makes some beautiful shots. He knows how to frame things, how to make individual shots very memorable. And that's great, but the movie is packed with those, at the expense of making a movie that will stand up to repeated viewings without getting boring. The plot feels needlessly complex for a story that should be easy to summarize in a single paragraph. But each step of the story includes sequences that slather icing all over the cake that is Star Wars. Chasing Zam Wessel through Coruscant? Yes, it's technically impressive, but it feels pretty boring. It takes up too much time, cut with some very tacky dialogue, to get us to the nightclub. There are a lot of these little diversions, like the little chase through the asteroids, the entire droid factory sequence... event the romantic elements seem forced.I can't offer too much criticism about how the story could be fixed, except that Lucas needs an editor. I don't even feel like the movie is too long, it's just unfocused. The character building scenes don't feel natural. I don't buy that Padme likes Anakin at all. She doesn't come across as being bound by her profession, she just comes across as annoyed about his dog-like devotion. Then we're supposed to believe that all that changes? As a result of his fascist political beliefs, combined with bloodlust? If Padme were a little more similar to Anakin's childlike craziness, I could probably believe it. But as the movie stands, it's entertaining. But it's not strong by itself.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Special EFX make up for a poor Story!,"I really didn't believe in the new trilogy of star wars until i watched revenge of the Sith which i really loved, so i decided to watch Episode II for the sake of Star Wars and i must say i was bored to death for the first hour, i only got excited to watch the load of special EFX at the end with disconnecting my heart from Star Wars as a whole! This is not Star Wars, i cant seem to relate it to the old trilogy as a whole story of six Episodes and thats the worse thing to ever happen to the Star Wars Saga, but thank god Revenge of the Sith redeemed it again! I truly believe Lucas should have pushed the new Trilogy into a single 3 hours Episode (Revenge of the Sith that is) and compress Anakins Story into one Episode named "" Revenge of the Sith"" or ""The Rise of lord Vader"" or something cool, but he chose to Kill the whole Saga with Special EFX Overwork! any way watch it for the CG creatures, nothing else is worth watching!

It's just a movie for goodness sake!,"Remember that and I sincerely believe you will really enjoy this film. Life is far too short to take all this stuff so darned seriously.So sit back and get comfy with a nice fresh tub of buttered popcorn and a drink (this is quite a long movie you know) and enjoy! There are no answers to ""Life the Universe and... everything!"" here. There are no deep and meaningfuls of any kind. What there is here is an alternate universe with alternate problems and alternate joys which allow us to forget our real universe and and our real problems for just a little while. And perhaps, if we're really really lucky, we might just be able to bring some of the perspective, this larger than life universe Lucas has provided for us, back into the reality of our own 'little' lives and realise maybe just maybe our own though perhaps very real problems may not be as large and severe as we may have originally thought. After all, perspective is a wonderfully cathartic thing sometimes.I was in my mid teens when I saw the original Star Wars 'magic' and though I didn't realise it or appreciate it at the time, that is exactly what the movie trilogy did for me then. It took a very naive and anxious teenager with acne and what seemed then like insurmountable problems and transported him to ""A Galaxy Far Far Away"" and showed him a universe of teenagers and people struggling with much bigger problems and catastrophes and just said ""Believe in the Force young Luke"". In other words ""Trust in life, the universe and... everything will be alright and somehow work itself out"". Well I'm now thirty years older and I hope wiser and I can honestly tell you: He was right! As I said before, life's too short, so relax, and enjoy. Because that's all this film and indeed the series was made for... a little bit of fun and pure escapism, nothing more and nothing less. And on that score Lucas has once again succeeded admirably.That's really all I wanted to say except please be nice to each other!

at least it's not episode I,"So i was skeptical, but it turned out pretty good. The action sequences were pretty cool to see, and parts that i thought would be stupid looked pretty cool. I liked this movie, i am surprised by how much i enjoyed it. I expected it to suck. Don't get me wrong. George lucas has no ear for dialogue and the scenes where people are talking are pretty rough because of it. Acting is bad in this movie for several reasons, ewan mcgregor is straight jacketed into an alec guiness impersonation. Everyone seems to have trouble working with the huge amounts of computer effects. It seems like no on really has any idea what is going on in the shot. Hayden Christensen would have been good, there is a scene where he starts to get angry, but unfortunately George Lucas lacks Cajones and doesn't show anakin skywalker go insane and kill a bunch of tuskan raiders. That would have been cool to see, but Lucas had to make it kid friendly and that hurt.Also, the effects in the movie are way overdone. I read some where that it had a shooting schedule of 60 days, which i totally believe. The rest is computers. Maybe Lucas should ignore the computers and focus on people, his movie would have benefited from it. The effects kick butt though, so hey!I did like this movie. Despite deficiencies in the script and acting and a dependence on computer graphics that rivaled robert downy JR.'s dependence on drugs, it has a great plot. Real confusing, pretty complex, rather impressive. And the abundant eye popping action sequences are cool. I gave it a 7/10, Jar Jar Binks still sucks though.

George Lucas may be a good storyteller but he can't write human emotions at all.The whole story just feels rushed and written without any second thought, or someone saying "" hang on, you really want to do this ?

A major disappointment,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsAOTC is way inferior to The Phantom Menace.The first film in the new series was hardly anything to rival the classic Sci-Fi movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s,but compared to this labourious,droning dud,it doesn't seem so bad after all.Lets begin with the plot (what there is of it) which drags on forever and has no real coherent structure to follow.Too much is attempted to be established too early on,and it becomes information overload.Nevertheless,this is a Summer blockbuster and plot was never considered an essential ingredient in these ever.So,with all the on screen talent involved,you'd expect the acting to be great.But sadly,no.Everyone involved turns in blank,unemoting performances.But to be fair to them,so would anyone working with a script as dull and cliched as this.And all who act in it,including Samuel L. Jackson,Ewan McGregor,Natalie Portman and Christopher Lee,are barely seen on screen for longer than a few moments,leaving not enough time to establish them and relate to them.We learn more about each of them individually towards the end,but the ending drags on so much that all the individual twists and information they try to cram in becomes too much,and you're just screaming for them to leave it till Episode 3 already.This is really proof positive that a film can have all the brilliant special effects in the world,but if the story sucks,the audience will become nauseated.**",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Let's Get a Little Bit Real,"Considering there are nearly 4,000 reviews of this film on IMDB, what can I say. I read quite a few of them and the only thing I can summarize is there is mild to serious disappointment with this film--actually with the whole trio of later films (earlier--I guess). Anyway, as I've said before, we are not dealing with life and death situations here. It is a movie, but those of us in our day to day, relatively boring lives, tend to latch on to popular media and take it personally. We have expectations of creative people to satisfy our needs. George Lucas is seen, in many cases, as a villain or an incompetent. We've lost the ability to look at the amazing things that have been done on the screen. Let's relax and try to see things from a moderate viewpoint. I agree that the romantic entanglement, while necessary to explain future events, seems rushed and a little harsh. Would these people talk and act this way if not driven by future plots? At times is slow moving and breaks a part of good storytelling. Let your characters show you--don't have them explain. We have events that are rushed, but there is a limit to how much time can be used. This is not a ten part mini-series. It is a single film that perhaps should not have been done, but some remarkable things are there for the viewing, a gift to us for a few bucks.

A movie rush for two+half hours!,"Being in my early 30's, which means that I grew with the Original Trilogy, I am one of those people that were genuinely interested to know, in the Star Wars storyline, what happened before the Original Trilogy, and after. Timothy Zahn's books were great, and covered most of the Trilogy future; so when George Lucas announced he will be filming the first Trilogy, and changed the focus from Luke Skywalker to make it a six-part story on Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, my interest grew more.""The Phantom Menace"", as a *story* unwrapped in the past, was something I found clever and good. Anakin, as a boy slave, is found and taken to the Jedi Council for training. We get to know Amidala, who will later become the mother of the Skywalkers we met in the Original Trilogy. Clever story; but the film itself, disappointed me more than expected. When I read that Lucas was mainly addressing TPM to youngsters, I accepted it--besides, it's his own work and life dream, and I cannot judge that.Following TPM and the internet fuss (including the notorious ""Phantom Edit"", an edited version of TPM) I believe Lucas got the message; he has to do a more serious storytelling, and not forget that the majority of fans are adults, living up to the expectation to see something spectacular in terms of story and visuals. And I think he achieved this, with Attack Of The Clones, a title that many disliked but was necessary, to my point of view, to set the pace for things to come.The film itself is a feast for the eyes--George Lucas overdid it this time, and the ILM guys probably got PhDs in special effects. Although the dialogues needed more 'polishing', the film itself adds a new tone and becomes a vital part in the Star Wars storyline.When I saw the film in a journalist premiere on my birthday! here in Athens, Greece, I felt again the same excitement when the STAR WARS logo opened the film. I wanted Lucas to heal the TPM disappointment, and he did. I left the theatre (DTS ES 6.1 sounds great) and still felt the adrenaline pumping. I was pleased, and it's not something that every film does to me.I read reports before and after seeing ""Attack Of The Clones"" and in most part, people have some 'logical' reasons to be disappointed again by the thinner story, the not-so worked dialogues and the extended scenes on the love between Anakin and Padme/Amidala. But I am willing to accept that. Why?First of all, one cannot compare the Original Trilogy to the current. Different style, Hollywood has itself changed a lot since the late 70's.Secondly, Lucas said that the effects he is exhibiting have always been the effects he wanted on the Original Trilogy--so it's not really a question ""do the effects make the film or the film needs the effects""? A counter-balance to that was The Matrix, where the effects served the film, did not make the film.Finally, accept this film as ENTERTAINMENT, not as the story of your life. Do not go to see it with high and serious expectations--just 'free your mind'. I can classify this more of a ""pop-corn movie"" than serious viewing; I remember the same happened with Independence Day. People did not like it initially, me neither. We took it very seriously, but eventually I accepted it as a ""pop-corn movie"" and enjoyed it--even bought the AC-3 laserdisc and later the Special Edition on DVD...I know I did not write a lot on the film itself, but ""Attack Of The Clones"" remains a George Lucas creation. The man has the power to do whatever he wants, however he wants it. We can only accept this, and enjoy the film; it is really up to us. As for myself, I enjoyed it enormously and rated it 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I have an idea,"I have an idea...maybe George Lucas will wake up and hire Peter Jackson to direct Episode III.  Mr. Lucas could certainly pick up some lessons on how to create an epic trilogy.  Mr. Jackson did not have oscar-level actors, or a huge CGI budget.  But he knew enough to film on location, hire someone else to do the screenplay, and keep the CGI down to reasonable level.  I know the CGI per frame in ROTK was excessive, but compare his battle sequences to those in Episode II, at least Jackson made it part of the story instead of making it the whole story.Bottom line, the original trilogy was cheesy, the lines corny, the acting poor at best...but for whatever reason it worked.  Lucas can not recreate that magic on his current budget, and we are just going to have to accept the fact that Episode III is going to be just as crappy as the first two.

Exciting and dull at the same time,"I'll be brief, the movie is a hit and a miss.  The actions sequences are some of the best action I've ever seen on film, but the dialogue is frightfully dull.  The love scenes in particular could have been so much more, and perhaps the development could have been given to a more experienced writer.Anakin comes off as being too immature for a Senator, which could have been okay if we were given something to show why Amidala would have respected him.  It might have been improved perhaps if generally speaking Anakin showed immense maturity for his age, but you saw glimpses of his emotionalism.  Subtle hints would have fared much better than the obviously childish antics of Anakin.However there's no doubt that Star Wars fans will love the film.  There's been so much talk about this and that throughout the previous four films, and finally the fifth film does the walking!  Especially nice to see the king of talk: Yoda, finally earning the right to spout all that annoying rhetorical philosophy.I give it an 8 for enjoyment, an 8 for plot, a 7 for the acting and a 5.5 for the direction and script writing.

third time's a charm,"This is my third review of this film, and hopefully my last. I do, I really do, like Attack of the Clones, but I don't love it, and I wanted to, very much.I can't put all of the criticism on George Lucas. He has an amazing imagination, and with the people at ILM putting his wildest dreams on-screen, I can't blame him for wanting as many new planets, aliens, weapons, and ships as possible.Unfortunately, the focus on the visuals leaves the actors surrounded by blue screen instead of physical sets, marks on the walls instead of fellow actors, and wooden dialogue. Many scenes conducted with live actors on real locations also suffer with script and/or acting deficiencies. The acting necessarily must be fit into the planned effects shots, but this leaves no room for spontaneous rewording or alteration of dialogue that looks better in print than it sounds out loud.The main problem is a serious lack of fun. There's wit and whimsy, sarcasm and menace, but the overall result is flat. From the opening with Senator Amidala's ship to the Jedi council meeting in Palpatine's chambers to the reunion of Anakin and Padmé, my mind is saying, ""Well, that scene was pretty good,"" instead of being caught up in the story. I did enjoy the speeder chase and the bar scene.In the middle section, Obi-Wan plays detective, to good effect. This storyline is intercut with an awkward, unconvincing teenage romance. Again, the pacing is deliberate, rather than building anticipation for the dramatic conclusion. The painful-to-watch fireplace scene with Anakin making his grand declaration of love to Padmé is a particular target of my dislike. The speech is overblown and both Hayden and Natalie look uncomfortable, not upset, or hurt, or in the the grip of passion. Anakin's fall to the dark side on Tatooine, and subsequent regret had much more real emotion.Once everyone is on Geonosis, the action picks up. The conveyor belt scene, the battle in the arena, and the Obi-Wan, Anakin, Dooku, and Yoda showdown are all great. The menacing vista of the soon-to-be Imperial army sent chills down my spine. The secret wedding, though, is not convincing. Extreme circumstances brought Anakin and Padmé together, but nowhere in this film did I see anything but lust on Anakin's part, and perhaps curiosity on Padmé's. I don't see a good reason for Padmé to choose a relationship that will destroy both of them, when she doesn't seem to love Anakin.Despite my reservations, I remain a fan of Attack of the Clones. I do hope the ""third time's a charm,"" and that Lucas will develop a true winner with Episode 3.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars is Back,"I saw Episode 2 today, and i must say that i was truly impressed with this effort. After seeing Episode 1, i was greatly disappointed in the plot, and the casting (Jake Loyd was probably the worst Star Wars casting ever, well maybe next to N'Sync) and the amount of crappy religious elements in it. There were many scenes that could have been edited out of it such as the underwater part where they are being chased by that fish. The emaculate conception crap was laugh out loud funny in its lameness as well. I think that Lucas has listened to all the complaints from fans and tried to address them, and for the most part he suceeded. Jar-Jar actually serves a purpose in this film, and Hayden Christianson is very strong as Anakin Skywaker. He plays the role with anger, and saddness, pulling the viewer in to his struggle. Sure he is whiney, but he is also playing like a 17 year old kid so that is fine by me. He has a look about him that seems to scream evil, and he is very good in this role. Ewen McGregor is strong as well as Obi Wan. He really adds a lot to the role. His performance was very good, and he seemed to have that auora of Obi Wan greatness around him. Natalie Prtman was weak as Padame' as her performance was kind of bland and cookie cutter. Although she was the most beautiful i have ever seen her. She was gorgeous. This movie really set up the future of the Star Wars universe such as introducing the storm troopers instead of the droids. The Droids in the first movie really bugged me, as i wanted to see Strom Troopers. I was happy to see them introduced, but was shocked at their role in the movie. There were some complaints such as the Jedi were made to look like weaklings. I will not reveal how, but you will see when you watch the movie. Most of them are just pushovers. I think they tried to hard to make humour with C3PO and R2D2 and a lot of the time it didn't work. It ended up being rather lame. The fight that Yoda had was cool in the beginning, but the more i thought about it, the more laughable it was. I was chuckling when i was watching it because it was pretty outrageous. My final complaint being that Obi Wan was kind of shown to be a loser, as Anakin was correcting him and making him look stupid, and he was getting beaten up a lot, but i guess it is ok because Anakin is suppossed to be the bad ass of the universe.I was not disturbed with Jimmy Smits, as i thought i would be. He was cool in his role. Chancellor Palpatine and Count Dooku were cool as well, as the dark Jedi badasses they are. I was happy to see an amazing battle with Jedi, and droids and troopers. The last half an hour will make up for Episode one ten fold. I enjoyed this movie beter than Spiderman, as the ""love"" theme didn't bother me nearly as much in this movie as it did in Spiderman. I was shaking my head during Spiderman because it was so cliche'd and lame with all the ""I love you crap."" There is some lameness in this movie too, but for the most part it was cool, and nice to see.This movie is really some eye candy. The city in the beginnng of the movie is pure beauty, and amazing to watch. When i think about the complaints of this movie, that it is not as good as the originals, and i agree (although i liked this movie better than the first Star Wars). But think about this. These movies have a lot of back story to deal with. And it is hard to cram all of this story together, and make everyone happy. Plus wouldn't you rather the middle movies be the best? I would. They are still amazing to watch today, and i think there is no way to compare them to these. Lucas had a lot more to work with on Episodes 4, 5 and 6, and in these movies he is more limited in his material.It still bothers me that the ships in these movies look a lot better than the ships on the original trilogy, but there are cool precursors to the AT-ATs and Star Destroyers in this movie. As well as a cameo from the ""secret weapon."" All in all i had a blast watching this movie. This was a feeling that i haven't had for a long time. The final battle was incredible, and everything else was amazing to watch. The story really develops as well as Anakin's character (A cool side note my friend pointed out was that Anakin's clothes get darker as the movie progresses) and i can't wait for Episode 3. Episode 2 gave me ""A New Hope"" for the series. A great movie, that is amazingly fun to watch and experience. Great Job Lucas and Company. You have me waiting eagerly until 2005. P.S. Anyone who says ""Return of the Jedi"" is the best Star Wars movie, isn't a real Star wars fan. We all know it is the ""Empire..."" that is the greatest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Triumph of Technology Over Movie Making,"It's all been said before...but I'll say it again.  The acting by Natalie Portman and Hayden Christenen is so wooden, flat, and devoid of feeling I suspect they're the true subject of Attack of the Clones.  (BTW, the bonus disk showed an impassioned speech by Ms. Portman to the Senate, but it was a deleted scene...too bad).  Dazzling special effects that affect no one, lengthy scenes plodding on with senseless bloodless violence borrowed from every movie that came before it, etc. etc.No heart, no soul, no real tension.    Not even a naked love scene between Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor would have redeemed this bloated barge of ILMish clone-mongering (well, hey, this would have merited at least skipping to that chapter before tossing the DVD).Yes; the final fight scenes do have some of that ole'time magic, but why suffer the first two hours for the last 10 minutes?Advice from The Force:  ""George, you don't need to direct the next Star Wars; George, you don't need to be involved in the screen play; George, go home and take care of your kids and relax!""",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great film,"It's a shame to hear from critics and some inattentive viewers that ""Attack of the Clones"" is the worst episode of ""Star Wars"". Personally, I completely disagree with this! In this episode there is both love and hate, and action, and unsurpassed landscapes of different planets of the ""far, far galaxy"", and scenes of laser sword battles - in general, everything that is necessary for real fiction! And it was thanks to this episode that I fell in love with Star Wars...Forbidden love. For me, the central event of this episode was not the beginning of the Clone Wars, not the terrible premonitions of Master Yoda, not the increasing power of the mysterious Sith lord, but love ... the forbidden love of Padawan Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padme Amidala. I watched them with fascinated eyes throughout the whole movie! Padme resists their feeling at first, as she is used to considering herself a strong, not a weak girl in love,.. . Because he knows that the Jedi are forbidden to love. But eventually she reveals her feelings to Anakin when they once again find themselves in mortal danger.In the last episode of the film, against the backdrop of an amazing landscape, they swear eternal love to each other. And the only witnesses to this marriage are two droids - R2D2 and C3PO, a marriage that is doomed from the very beginning...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Hmmmm....how do I call this one?,"Ok...let me start by saying that I am total Star Wars fan. I grew up with the ANH, ESB and ROTJ and LOVED them all (even ROTJ)!!!I waited MANY, MANY years for more of the same and my prayers were finally answered with TPM. Sadly, the film did NOT live up to my hopes and dreams. Far from it!! There were good points -though not many. Darth Maul was cool but very little else shone. It set the scene I suppose but ultimately it was flat, and lifeless. The poor acting left me with NO apathy for any of the characters.Now, here we are 3 years later and I have just seen AOTC a few hours ago. And....well....I really don't know what to make of it. I wanted to LOVE it, but cos of TPM I was scared and frankly, I approached the film with a 'its probably gonna be a let-down as well' attitude.However...I was excited and when the film started and the title music played after the all too familiar 'A long time ago in a Galaxy far, far away...' I must admit I was tingling all over, all doubt left my mind and I waited, waited to be enthralled like I was all those many years ago.BUT.....you know what? Something was wrong. Seriously wrong! My head is still buzzing from seeing it but I will try to sum it up in as best I can......though this could be tricky.Good Points...1. YODA -OH MY GOD!!!! I still can't believe how amazing he was in this. That end fight is truly one of the greatest Star Wars moments EVER!!!!2. COUNT DOOKU -At LAST someone who can act in Star Wars!! Thank you Mr Lee. It's just a shame none of the others can match your talent.3. THE BIG BATTLE -Well, to sum up, it was fantastic. Epic, sprawling and with, best of all, loads of Jedi fighting. Most of it was CGI and the action was so overwhelming as to be sometimes difficult to follow but it was still GREAT!! I was enthralled throughout this final battle. Great stuff!!Bad Points...1. The Acting -This was ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. Perhaps even worse than TPM, especially as this film had so many more poignant moments in it. They really should've done better. There is no excusing it!2. Dialogue -For the love of GOD...why is the script so child-like AGAIN!! Almost every line could be winced at. Like Obi-wan's 'BLAST, this is why I hate flying!' Though I must admit, Yoda had a few good lines like the one about Obi-wan 'losing' his planet for example.3. CGI - I am all for CGI and the new boundaries it gives films. BUT a film loses its warmth and feeling the more you add in. The actors have enough problems struggling with the awful dialogue without having blue screen after invisible enemy after blue screen after invisible enemy, etc to work with.4. The 'Plot' -hmmm.....this was very worrying. How did a Star Wars storyline suddenly become so confusing to follow? I know plenty of the Star Wars Universe, but at times I was left wondering just what the hell was going on. This will be explained upon further viewings but should that need to be the case? I am CERTAIN that people new to Star Wars will be totally lost at the Political angle to this story. This is such a shame.5. The 'love' Story -ARRGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! This was SOOOO painful to watch. I just CANNOT buy into this at all. It's these scenes which could prevent me from seeing again in the cinema.So.....What does this all mean? It means I feel mixed emotions about this film. I want to LOVE it and bits of it I really do. BUT, there are SO MANY gripes and niggles that, worryingly, I cant love it.This is such a shame....My mark for this film will be 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
truly amazing,"This movie absolutely amazed me and left me wondering.  When did it really all go to hell?  I like the original Star Wars movies.  There nothing mind-shattering, but they're good.  They certainly aren't good enough to have become what they became.  An American institution.  Moviegoers everywhere feel obligated to go see Episode II, even though Episode I was awful, because, well it's Star Wars.  And I saw it too.  But I saw it for free and still felt cheated.  The movie has no heart.  The dialogue is awful( fans say all the movies have bad dialogue and that's Star Wars ) The directing is flat, and yes I'll say that the special effects were awful.  I enjoy a pretty landscape as much as the next guy, but in the end, I'm not gonna like the movie because of some establishing shots.  The CG characters stick out like a sore thumb.  The characters never really look like their anywhere( they often don't cast shadows or reflections ).  The action scenes were boring( the clone factory one in particular ).  And as for the big Yoda scene.  I didn't see what the big deal was.  It was as forgettable as the rest of the movie.  Sure, the story is starting to piece together and there is no arguing that George Lucas has a vivid imagination.  But the movie just left a terrible sour taste in my mouth.  Let's hope it's mediocre box office sways him into making a decent movie next time and not worry about how many digital projection systems they'll be.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Flawed STAR WARS film,"Attack Of The Clones continues the story from 1999's THE PHANTOM MENACE-Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan Mcgregor) is now a Jedi Master, Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen) is his Padawan, and Queen Amidalia(Natalie Portman) has decided to take Palpatine's place as the Senator from her home planet. However, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine(Ian Mcdiarmid), AKA ""Darth Sidious"" is up to no good, and is playing both sides in a galactic conflict between his Republic and the ""Seperatists"", led by Count Dooku(Christopher Lee) who is secretly working for Palpatine to start a war-the Clone Wars mentioned briefly in the original STAR WARS. AOTC attempts to address many of PHANTOM's flaws. There's less Jar-Jar, the henchman this time have a lot more to do and say, there's no scatological humor and the film is a lot more darker in tone. The film is also more visually and thematically linked to the original trilogy. However, there are still flaws. The two leads-Hayden and Natalie-give cringeworthy performances, and the love dialogue they're given to say doesn't help.(This is perhaps more Lucas's fault than theirs-both stars have been good actors in other films). Ewan Mcgregor, as Obi-Wan, tries to do his best but he's mainly stuck with bad wisecracks and exposition dialogue. The best performances come from returning old trilogy actors-Daniels(C-3PO) Oz(Yoda) and Mcdiarmid(Palpatine) as well as Christopher Lee(Who also plays a slightly similar villain in the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy) and Temura Morrison, who plays the ""father"" of the Stormtrooopers and Boba Fett. The direction is OK-Lucas's transitions and edits are a little better here than in TPM, but still are very sloppy, especially in the film's final battle sequences, which fail to capture the suspense of the similar ground battle in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The special FX range from excellent to poor...particuarly with the Clonetroopers, who look excellent when we see one or two, but are obviously cut-and-pasted in assembly shots in the middle and end of the film. Overall, it's a passable ""Star Wars"" film, but still could have been a lot better.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Finally! This movie had all that I missed in episode one.,"After seeing episode one I had pretty low expectations on this second episode, but after a bit slow introduction of the 'new' characters the movie really takes off and Gorge Lukas takes you for the ride of your life! The last part of the move is really breathtaking, the battle scenes has nothing more to wish for.We also get at insight on why Anakin is drawn to the dark side and for the fans of Boba Fett there is some sweet candy in the form of Jango Fett (Boba's father) and his son (Boba).All in all, the Attack of the Clones is a worthy member of the Star Wars Saga!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Star Wars heats up!!!,"AOTC begins 10 years after TPM left off. There is a noticeable gap between the two but it doesn't feel like it needs bridging. This really emphasises TPM as a prelude as what is to come in this film.I will start off by saying how intriguing the story is in this film. The pace is fast from the beginning after an explosion. The pace is taken off in parts but essentially the film maintains its momentum until the terrific climax. No-one does them bigger and better than George. After they leave Courscant the plot divulges into two story lines one with Obi-Wan doing his bit of detective work whilst Ani and Padme are making some discoveries about themselves and their close ones. Both plots are reunited as are all the Jedi in the climactic battle. Thrilling light sabre fights and an ending that raises more questions than answers. There is a certain feeling of mysticism all the way through this film that I felt; and found it very enjoyable. It is unique and different to all other Star Wars films in that here we get to see HOW and WHY the Star WARS began. It makes the wars in the next 4 films that much more meaningful that we no know how they came about. George's panache for story telling really comes to the forte here.The effects are stunning...enough said. The acting is solid Obi-Wan becomes more like Alec Guiness' Obi-Wan in this one yet Mcgreggor adds his own touch; which I admit could be slightly annoying at times. Other notable performances from, Oz, McDiarmind, Jackson and of course Lee. Padme seems confused yet determined which suits her character down to the earth. Hayden however gets the 1st prize. He has been criticised for being a whiny Darth Vader. While many people forget his character is still on 20 in this film and in many ways very naive. I thought he played this well. He seems to have the turbulence of youth as well as volatility yet something far more dangerous lurking beneath. While perhaps not Oscar winning; solid mention worthy performances all round. And o yes C3PO and R2 provide the usual comic relief.As a prequel I have no complaints everything was done to the letter. This is a different Star Wars film in that it shows the beginning of the Wars but by the end we're in full swing and the next four can't come on quick enough. It links the more introductory TPM with the rest of the saga more too I fell. Answering some vital questions. Does everything it needs to and is a good Star Wars film for bringing something different and a different feel to the trilogy making it that much more complete a package. We really begin to empathise with the characters in this film; I felt so much for Anakin when is mother died and even Yoda has me on the edge of my seat. Can he really keep that level up to beat Dooku i hope her survives for the others?!? Well of course; but a real connection is deepened hear I feel. We get to know Obi-Wan that much better in this film he almost starts to feel like a friend.All in all a must see multiple viewings for all true star wars fans. UNmissable and it brings the Saga one step closer to completion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas is still a pioneer in the industry,"The movie, finally here, delivers.  Yes it is over 2 hours long, but in the end we all want it to be that long don't we?  With another 3 years to wait for the final installment, we need all the Star Wars screen time that we can get.  All the Star Wars films are around 2 hours long, so why would this one be any different?I, considering myself an extreme movie buff who has seen literally thousands of movies, have never seen anything like this movie before.  It's not just the scenery, but the depth of the battle scenes.  It makes any battle scene of any movie look like fodder (including Episode I's climactic ending battle scene which was impressive).The critics of ALL the Star Wars movies are a bunch of self-proclaimed astronomers who expect space laws to be followed to the ninth degree.  Give me a break.  I'm so sick of hearing about how Yoda didn't act very well or how Hayden and Natalie didn't portray their on-screen romance very convincingly.  They did just as well as any.  Their performance was hardly worthy of any criticism at all.  Considering some of the lines of previous installments (i.e. ""No I'll not leave you, I've got to save you""-Mark Hamil, Episode VI; ""Let's try spinning, that's a good trick""-Jake Lloyd, Episode I), this movie has an excellent dialogue for a Star Wars film.Lucas has really out done himself this time, though, imagery wise and story wise.  Unbelievable twists, young Boba Fett (a newly sworn enemy of the Jedi), pre-technological artificial limbs, etc.  We are all so glad he agreed to have someone help him write the script as you get a few extra ideas and less not-so-great lines.In the end, the movie is excellent.

"Better than EP1, but not great","I finally got to see the film, and I was definately impressed by the improvement over Episode 1.  However, there were still quite a few problems I have with the story:1.  Anakin - ""Padme, I just killed all these sentient creatures that had homes and families.  I hope you don't mind.""  Padme - ""That's ok, I love you anyway.""I just don't understand this.  While the whole idea of having the tusken raiders kidnap and torture Shmi was fine, I don't really believe that Padme would be completely fine with it, and comfort him.2.  C3PO - ""This is a drag.""I hate, absolutely hate Lucas's attempts to put ""hip"" language in a movie series that are supposed to be classics.  The dialogue is always out of place, and seriously dates the movie, something the originals avoided.3.  Shiny ships and other ""old"" technology.Unless Lucas is going to work into the plot that there was a serious downgrade in technology after the Clone Wars, I don't really understand some of this stuff.  And the ships are the worst.  The Star Destroyers, the Millenium Falcon, the X-Wings....You could see the structure of the ship.  The god aweful shiny ships that pervade Episode II are completely out of place.4.  It's kind of corny how Anakin loses an arm and Luke loses a hand, both in the second chapter of their respective stories.  I guess Luke's kid will lose a pinky?5.  The catch-22 of knowing what happens to the main characters puts a bit of a damper on the action, since you know who's going to make it.6.  In ""Tales From The Bounty Hunters,"" Boba Fett's real name is revealed to be Jaster Mereel.  I await Lucas's explanation on this one.  I also don't like the fact that Boba Fett is a clone of Jengo Fett.  It lessens the coolness factor of Boba Fett by insinuating that he's just a clone of the real cool guy.  Also, Epsiode II gives Boba a reason to hate Jedi.  However, in all the books and the other movies, the only person Boba absolutely hates is Han Solo.  Boba never shows any particular personal animosity towards any Jedi in the stories or movies.5.  And most of all, both prequels are ready-made for toy production, and in fact, are made with video games and toys in mind. Why couldn't they use typical stormtrooper armor for the clone army?Because then they wouldn't have another toy to sell.  Part of the reason the originals were so good was because they were intended to be movies, and only moviesWhile it seems from my comments that I hated the movie, that isn't the case. I found it to be much more enjoyable than Episode 1 (which is one of the only movie that got worse each time I watched it).  Episode II was a decent offering, but it still falls quite short of classic status.The biggest saving grace of both prequels has to be Natalie Portman.  She brings a quiet authority, youthful exhuberance, and athleticism to the Padme character.  Apart from Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn, Padme was the only character I found myself caring about.This series of prequels, according to Lucas, is supposed to turn the Star Wars story from Luke Skywalker's adventures to the Redemption of Anakin Skywalker.  So far it isn't working.  I didn't like the special editions of the classics, and I don't have a whole lot of enthusiasm for the prequels. I am hoping that once the last one is released and Lucas finally releases the whole series on DVD, that the unedited, non-special edition classics are available seperately.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

And George does it, and it gets in the way of the story.  Lucas has wrapped three pictures in the ""Coming of the Empire"" cloak, so we know that SW-3 will not turnout happy.  Anniken must become Darth Vader.I wonder if the same thing that happened to Star Trek will happen to Star Wars.  As you recall, Star Trek: The Next Generation had a spectacular run on television.  The next Star Trek series, Deep Space Nine was static by comparison, and revolved around politics and personalities.  Action was limited by the concept, and as a result has never been the financial success of ST:TNG.As a hyphenate, I know how difficult it is to write a prequel.  Writing a trilogy of them is a nightmare.

Incompetence or Genius?,"I was almost as disappointed with Episode II, as I was with Episode VI. I only liked it slightly better, because the special effects were a lot cleaner--what would you expect with close to 20 years more computing power and 100 million, or so, more in budget (not inflation adjusted).I kept asking myself what was wrong, and this is my analysis:1)  This is Star WARS, we did not get the impression there was a real war going on, until late into the movie. In all the other good episodes, there was a space fleet, actively engaged in battle early into the film--and usually after our heroes.2)  The promised romance had virtually no plot significance (for this episode) and was not particularly passionate or well done. I know Star Wars is for kids, but George a lot of your fans are know well passed their twentys and thirtys!  Throw us a bone why don't you?3)  R2-D2 and C3PO had virtually no relation to the plot and were just thrown in for comic relief (too much criticism of Jar-Jar?).4)  Nobody bad wore a mask throughout, without revealing a recognizable""human face"".  This wildly reduced the ""menace"" facing our protagonists. Exactly who was the antagonist here anyway--Boba Fett?5)  Where were the machines that inconveniently malfunctioned at inappropriate times?  This reduced the fun and perceived danger.6)  Blatant rip offs of elements from other popular science fiction franchises--(I know he does this a lot, but at least he used a little imagination previously).  Padme's battle outfit was almost an exact copy of the Defense Directorate uniforms from ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"".7)  ""Star Wars"" has almost always been the exposition of stealth and cunning versus blatant force and power, but this is increasingly downplayed.  I guess this may be to show why the Jedi fell from grace.One outstanding, and disappointing, aspect was watching Yoda finallyyield his light sabre--What a hoot.I hope George can recover from this one in Episode III.

Very honestly, H.Christensen is a bad choice for the lead of this movie -he doesn't have the range (at least in this movie) necessary to pull of a character as complex and conflicted as Anakin Skywalker.So the confusion and internal struggle the character is supposed to go through falls flat and you are left with someone who appears arrogant and quite honestly just an overconfident brat. A long way from a Jedi master (which is wanted I guess...?) but also a long way from the noble villain he's supposed to become.When this fails, it's hard to enjoy the movie. It has some flaws similar to the Episode I (too digital being the main one) but does improve on many things: Fan Service is full speed and you get to see Yoda, Bobba Fett etc. in their peak.But a slow pace, a hard to swallow romance and the afore mentioned problems don't save it from being average at best... +1 point because it's Star Wars!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Incredible digital effects,"I hoped this episode would be better than first, for I consider the Trilogy the best thing in cinema ever made. Well, it was, but just for digital effects (if its possible). Really incredible, but dialogues were very boring. Terrible the falling-in-love-scenes between Anaquin and Padme, worst than a soap opera dialog. Finally, it was great seeing Yoda fighting with his sword! At the end I consider myself satisfied.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the last one but still disappointed,"Besides the special effects, which sometimes are too much like the Jedi group fighting scene in the arena, and the potential of the story line, everything else is sub-par.

A shadow of its former self,"I was there at the beginning and stayed until the admirable entry-point to the trio of prequels that would, we were assured, re-map the splendid beginnings of George's magnificent odyssey and usher in a whole new generation of fans who had only ever experienced the magic on VHS/BETA. No, I didn't much care for Star Wars ""Re-dux"" a couple of years ago at the cinema with the added bits for good measure. I mean, if it ain't broke, why unnecessarily lengthen and dissipate the narrative structural integrity with a plethora of CGI jiggery-pokery? For me, the original IS most definitely the best. Having said that, I was suitably impressed by ""The Phantom Menace"", a film which was chock-a-block with the aforementioned effects but which managed to develop the early incarnations of our heroes/villains suitably whilst effortlessly introducing some new faces and even throwing in some stunning set pieces (that remarkable pod-race sequence, for example) before slapping us across our drooping jaws with an intricate and splendidly edited three-way battle extravaganza at the finale. And of course...the critics disliked it as I believe did a sizeable majority of incredibly hard to please individuals. Poor ol' George must've really been scratching his head over that one. ""What in God's name did I do wrong?"", he might have said. ""I set the whole shebang in perfect motion or so I thought. Sure, the effects got most of the headlines but scrape away the CGI and I also had a solid script, some thoughtful, low-key and otherwise performances from some splendid actors, some breath-taking locales, unparalleled action sequences in the traditional Star Wars stylee and the Mother and Father of all light-sabre battles with a particularly loathsome Sith Lord who prior to a late narrative tinker, I had pencilled in to last until the beginning of Episode III. I mean, what more do you people want!?!!"" screams Curious George. O.K. folks, it appears that what George has done is pull his hair out in trying to bend and mould a once fresh-faced and truly original movie-franchise (if that's not a contradiction in terms), into a shameless hussy of a free-for-all in which everyone gets a bit of what they fancy. To hell with the original vision, here's Star Wars by the numbers with a dreadful, wise-cracking new version of once stolidly po-faced Obi-wan, a slew of cartoon-like chases and near-misses and improbable escapes. Throw in a ludicrous, ""Gladiator""-style melee with terrible creature design and a newly transformed Senator Amidala into some kind of neolithic Wonder Woman and you're really only scraping the surface of what's gone very badly wrong. I'll admit that the story-line is reasonably well adhered-to in most places and the double bluff by the fantastic Count Dooku (take a bow, Sir Christopher) will leave most people guessing till the end, but by the half way stage, no amount of shots of the supremely cool, but criminally underused Jango Fett can sway one back to full consciousness after more than an hour of a tepid romantic tale not at all suffused by a rousing finale which instead is just a large mess of flashing lights and a painfully obvious, heavily unlife-like series of skirmishes which leaves a rather unsatisfied taste in the mouth as the strains of John Williams build to the end titles. ""What did I just watch?"", I heard someone say, ""Was that Star Wars?"" piped another. ""My bleedin' eyes hurt"", moans a third. All I can add to the growing list of unsatisfied customer-speak, is why reduce one of the most famous and well-written characters to the lowly bowels of bad stand-up with shamelessly ill-judged and un-funny puns. Poor ol' Anthony Daniels must be secretly crying into his cocoa. R.I.P C-3PO. I remember when real humour and many an uproarious punchline was exacted from your uppity, cantankerous and uniquely blinkered view of the universe and not from a junior script-writer's lazy scribblings on a matchbox on the subway to one of George's crisis meetings. Ah, what the hell, bar Lee, Jango Fett and a half-way decent performance by that Danish bloke wot played Annakin, ""Attack of the Clones"" was little short of a complete disaster. Please, George, I beg you, recant, shut yourself away in a little room with some pencils and a notepad and start re-writing the third and mercifully, final instalment. Don't listen to no-one, my amply-jowlled friend, and throw your work out there into the big, wide world letting those would-be directors and screenwriters amongst us peck at the pieces and take it or leave it. After all, you don't need the money at this stage, right. Right? And to think, your good buddy Mr. S. actually went and said that AOTC was better than ""A New Hope"".....the man's loosin' his cool.

another zero shot,"After a bit of dissapointment after The Phantom Menace, I still had some hopes in me that this one will finally live to it´s right. But again...no, it did not. Ok, now we see why did Lucas said that he waited so long for the effects to improve. When it comes to visuals this probably is one of the best in saga. But when it comes to story and what Star Wars are really about, then it´s no better than chapter I, maybe in some ways even worse. But still, there are a few points that I liked. Since the new trilogy is more about silly politics than anything else, I really liked how he treats Palpatine. I could see his rise from the strange character in shadows to the Great Emperor in the old trilogy. We all knew that in Attack of the Clones we are going to witness the start of an Anakin-Amidala romance, but what we got here is dreadful. Dialogues and the whole love story can only be compared to the lines of Dawson´s Creek or some soapish nonsense like that. And the philosophical lines are now laughibly pretentious and meaningless. Again, very similar to chapter one, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch and it has some of the most spectacular scenes ever to be seen in science-fiction cinema. But for a Star Wars fan it´s not even close to enough. Sometimes I think that Lucas shouldn´t go further at all from the original trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Movie made for Star Wars Fans,"While you see a lot of mixed reviews on the movie, we must not forget that this movie is made for star wars fan not the critics.  Thus if you are a fan you will enjoy it.  The effects and action are at its best and while we see very poor acting for Hayden Christianson, Natalie Portman and Ewen Mcgregor light up the screen.  What is also great about this movie is the links between this and the original trilogy.

"The story of a young man with the potential for greatness who falls into bad ways - George Lucas, I mean","An improvement on The Phantom Menace. I was entertained for most of the way, but a lot of the flaws of ""Episode 1"" and in George Lucas' films generally are painfully apparent. In the end it was disappointing to see so little interest in characterisation and good story-telling, and it all felt a little bit second hand.In 1977 George Lucas and Star Wars were the leader in a field of one. The Seventies was a time for some fascinating cinema but no one was making the kind of swashbuckling entertainment or films suitable for children with anything like the verve and charisma of the ""old days."" The splash that Star Wars made on its release was heard around the world. A phenomenon was born and a trend was set, even if purists were alarmed that one day there would be no room for thoughtful adult fims among the blockbusters. At the end of the day, though, ""Star Wars"" was entertainment for all ages, with adventure and excitement to the fore and everything else second - and throughly enjoyable on that level. The next two instalments showed a real talent (especially in ""Empire"") but a talent all too ready to forget good cinema and concentrate on juvenile fodder (like ""Jedi""), but he still did it better than anyone else.When ""Phantom Menace"" was released people were full of expectation, hoping to see the mythic storytelling of the first two films taken to a pulse-quickening max by state-of-the-art special effects. What we got was a few good sequences and  a succession of nicely rendered CGI images and nothing else. Lucas obviously found characterisation and the human side a distraction from the technology that he was more interested in. There was no way Lucas could live up to the reputation that the early films had rather spuriously gained as classics to rival the all-time greats, but he was supposed to be able to make a straight-ahead entertaining film instead of an infantile effects picture that tried to pass off its lame plot and funny names as ambitious mythic cinema. Worst of all, it just seemed like a procession towards Episode 2 with almost no sense that anyone was in any danger or that anything bad was going to happen unless our heroes save the day.""Attack of the Clones"" is a big improvement on ""Phantom"" but still suffers from stunted ambition in terms of story and character, with the usual clunky dialogue that pervades all Star Wars films less easy to forgive when you haven't got Harrison Ford and a walking carpet making it fun for us. At least there is more of a sense of danger and people who have to be rescued or confronted, and there is more variety to the scenes instead of the endless, boring sunny backgrounds of Naboo in ""Phantom."" However, it is very hard to forgive how utterly perfunctory Lucas is with the characters and the story line. OK, Anakin is angry and rebellious, but we know WHAT'S going to happen to his character because we've all seen the ""first"" three films, so how about making us interested in HOW it happens? Also the true identity of one of the characters is kept a ""secret"" when it's fairly obvious who the person actually is, which frankly felt like an insult to the intelligence. I don't mean to sound like a moaner and wanting every film to be a piece of Indie Art, but by the same token Lucas seems to think that he is producing an epic saga that rivals ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Godfather"", and let me tell you George, you aren't even close.The biggest problem for George Lucas is that there is a big body of opinion ready to forget that he (like Spielberg to a lesser degree) always shies away from applying his considerable talent to something more complex instead of serving up puerile goo to five-year-olds, and will say that he is the greatest film maker of all time. He thinks what he does is good enough for his audience, but it isn't and it is a shame to see a talent go to waste. It is put into even sharper focus by the fact that ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Matrix"" provide entertainment, story and action for his older audience that puts anything he has ever done to shame, and the likes of ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek"" are much better as films for children.In the end what we got was an OK movie, but I couldn't get over my disappointment that it could have been so much better and more entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Despite its flaws its a lot of fun,"I'll let everyone know right off the bat that I'm a big ""Star Wars"" fan.  I have seen the original trilogy many times and plan to see it many more times.  I also played with all the toys when I was a kid, I even had a C-3PO case to keep them all in.  The big problems which have been stated countless times are the dialogue and the romance.  George Lucas needs someone who can write good dialogue to co-write the screenplay with him for episode 3.  The romance was weak though it was not as bad as I expected it to be from what I was told.  Still the Anakin's line about the sand being course has to be one of the most unromantic lines ever and also one of the worst lines in movie history.On the positive side the story was interesting.  The action sequences were great, especially Yoda (everyone was cheering!). The characters were all interesting, too.  And, of course John Williams' music was great.  In enjoyed Christopher Lee as the bad guy (he always makes good bad guys).  He just turned 80 so I hope he stays alive for Episode 3.  Fortunately all of ""Lord of the Rings"" has been filmed so if he was to croak tomorrow it wouldn't affect that but it would ""Star Wars.""I give this film a 7/10.  And I can't wait for Episode 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better than Ep. 1, but...","Although it's been said many times before, it's worth repeating: Ep.2 is better than Ep. 1. The story is a bit more adult, something actually happens in this film, and Lucas relies a bit more on the actors than the computer generated images (CGI) to keep you watching. But being better than Ep. 1 isn't that great a stretch, and Ep. 2 still has a number of holes that needed patching to make it a great film.The good points of AOTC include the design, solid acting (mostly) and lots of action towards the end. There were moments that filled me with geekish glee, and the city / weapon / ship design all looked good and suitably impressive. But at almost two and a half hours in length, the eye candy can only distract you for so long.AOTC suffers on a number of fronts. The love story seems stuffed into the film, slowing the film to a drag in places. Dialogue between Anakin and Padme seems forced and unbelievable. Maybe Padme likes whiny, petulant young men, but with the amount of whinging Anakin does you'd think she would get sick of it.There is also a number of unnecessary scenes in AOTC, seemingly placed to either pad the story, or because it would look cool. There are solid chunks of this film that could be cut out of the film with minimal impact to either the film's story or the overall narrative.The ""looks cool"" factor also comes into play quite a bit, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but also adds an unnecessary layer to AOTC. A huge number of creatures, weapons and vehicles can be seen througout the movie, and while I went ""whoa, cool!"" at a number of them (eg the seismic charges) they were just there to make Lucas look clever and to give toy makers things to sell.My biggest complaint of the film is that it completely lacks any form of subtlty or deeper meaning, no matter how hard it tries. Every time the characters come close to some realisation or a point the audience would have to think about, AOTC telegraphs it so every four-year-old in the audience can follow it. The conspiracy involving the Dark Lords of the Sith is so open and easy to follow you have to wonder why the Jedi still haven't gotten it. It strikes me as odd that in a film where a decapitation occurs centre screen that the narrative caters for children.I hold the Empire Strikes Back as the best of the Star Wars series because it suprises you - AOTC holds no suprises, just a number of sequences where things look really, really good. It is a great build up for Ep. 3, which I can't wait to see, but I am hoping for a bit more depth than AOTC provides.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Do the clones even Attack?,"While the first film was a disappointment at least it was a little fun. This film tries to be more serious in tone, but comes across as boring and dull. The first and last acts are a lot of fun and action packed, but the middle drags and feels longer than it actually is. McGregor, Jackson, Oz, Morrison, and Lee are the best performers in the film, the effects are good but feel more dated even compared to the first film. Christiansen is really disappointing as Anakin, sometimes he feels like he's doing a good job the rest, well let's just say he doesn't like sand. Portman feels like she's phoning it in but is still being professional about it. All in all the film is a lot like Episode I, it has its moments but overall underwhelming.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
George is still looking for an original idea,"Let me begin by saying that this film is way better than Ep I.Way back when the world was younger and more naive, along came a young filmmaker called George Lucas who created a fantasy world in which adult and children could immerse themselves.  They were good times, happy times, analogue times, where puppets and stop motion ruled.But now times are much more cynical, and filmmakers have less respect for their audiences.  We live in a world where major plot lines can be altered at the whim of the film maker for convenience, and all those things that have been foretold in future episodes can be changed to suit substandard story lines.At least in Attack of the Clones, Lucas does not mess with the well-established story lines set out in the original series, but he is still in search of an original idea.  Clones is full of cliched dialog, characters and ideas that he has lifted from numerous other science fiction works.Some of the story is laboured, particularly those sections set on Naboo. And as usual, Lucas manages to get very wooden performances out of some very talented actors.  I also felt that the film was about 30 minutes to long, with the inclusion of some gratuitous special effects.Now for the positives.  Its fun.  My 3-year-old son will love it.  There are no truly annoying or cutesy characters that seem to be regular inclusions of late.  The special effects are very special.  The film has lost no definition by being shot on a fully digital media.I think that Lucas has tried harder to be less condescending with this film, but at times we are still spoon-fed, probably for the benefit of younger viewers.Overall worth a look - 3 out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A love story in space...,"While episode two is definitely as step up from the abysmal episode one, then it is not fully up in pace, and it sort of feels like a space version of ""Titanic""; a way too long love story.The best part of ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is the fact that they toned down Jar Jar Binks to an acceptable level.""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" introduces a bunch of important characters and do focus on the storytelling. And it is entertaining from start to end, offering a lot of flavor to the ""Star Wars"" universe.The effects and Visuals are, as always, impressive. And the importance of the Visuals is what add that special atmosphere to the ""Star Wars"" universe. However, it is a shame that they opted for CGI effects more than actual practical effects.Personally, I think Hayden Christensen is as talented as a Christmas tree and is poorly cast for the role of young Anakin Skywalker, because it is a very prominent character in the ""Star Wars"" universe. However, Ian McDiarmid really is amazing in the role of Palpatine (and even more so in episode three). But all in all, the cast were great and did fantastic jobs with each their given roles and characters.This is a love story in the ""Star Wars"" universe, although an important movie in the ""Star Wars"" lore, but not quite fully having attained the magic of the original trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The film is very good, but forget the romance","This film shows the beginning of rebellion movements within the Galactic Republic and the events leading up to the start of the war. Directed by George Lucas, it was written by him, in collaboration with Jonathan Hales, and count's with the participation of Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson and Ian McDiarmid, among other actors.George Lucas has learned an important lesson from the previous film: special effects and action can make a bearable movie, but cannot make a quality movie. And it's not hard to see that the Director made an effort to ensure a more careful script this time. The script looks cleaner of expendable elements and worthless characters, and the characters exhibit much more psychological depth, particularly Anakin and Amidala. However, Lucas was unable to print passion to the loving bond that the couple starred. If there is love there, the public never see it or feel it. It seems friendship or affection, but never love so, they managed to become one of the most frigid romantic couples that cinema ever portrayed. Jar Jar continues to be a funny character but there are certain scenes when he's just stupid. The performance of the actors wasn't brilliant or inspired, with the exception of Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Lee, who deserve congratulations, and Natalie Portman, who was not bad but could have done better. The soundtrack also does not bring anything new and does it's role with confidence.

Loads of action and romance - a packing movie for everyone,"With Episode 2, Lucas sets a new milestone in his Star Wars saga.

Anakin Skywalker has to fight with too many problems at once, revealing his strength as well as the fact he indeed has still a lot to learn. Senator Amidala is Overwhelmed by her love for Anakin, but does not reveal it until she thinks it is too late.

Episode II: Attack of Episode I!,"I've seen this movie four times now, and I still contend that nearly all of its problems are bleed overs from the disastrous decision to cast Jake Lloyd as Anakin in Episode I.  Let's look at this logically.Anakin's character is, unfortunately, woefully underdeveloped.  Why? Because after one whole movie supposedly starring Anakin Skywalker had been produced, we still had no idea who he was.  Why? Because Jake Lloyd was used in the first film.  In the name of all things sacred, I cannot fathom why this decision was made.  If Hayden had been cast in Episode I instead of Lloyd, just think of all things that suddenly get a hell of a lot better in BOTH films:1) The romance between between Anakin and Padme could have been allowed to develop over two films instead of one (see A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back), circumventing the need for the atrocious dialogue and rushed storyline of the ""love"" scenes in Attack of the Clones.2) Anakin and Obi-Wan could have developed a more ""friendly,"" warm relationship, so that Anakin's defiance of Obi-Wan in Episode II would seem more of a typical teenage rebellion and less like he was just a complete jerk.  Remember, Obi-Wan calls Anakin ""a good friend"" in A New Hope.  I didn't see any friendliness between the two in this film, however.3) One of the big problems with Episode II is that the scene where Anakin's mother dies lacks the emotional fire it should really have.  This is due to two reasons: the first is that the actress playing his mother really turns in a performance worthy of The Gong Show, but the second is that, as I mentioned before, we don't KNOW Anakin enough to care. Why? Because he's been two different people --- it's hard to get THAT attached to someone in an hour, especially given the scope of this story.  The audience should have been building its identification with Hayden as Anakin in Episode I, making the work of Episode II to tell his story, rather than re-introducing a character that should have been well known by this point.The moral of the story is that if you know ahead of time you are going to make three films about one central character, pick someone who can play that character in ALL THREE MOVIES!!!! Maybe, just maybe, Episode III will be far enough along in the story to have shed the after-effects of Jake Lloyd, but I doubt it.  That stupid little kid has ruined this prequel trilogy. Hayden's acting is cheesy, but hell, so was Mark Hamill's.  Besides, he's eighteen, eighteen-year-olds are over dramatic about things. They're all like that.  Give Hayden a break.  It's Jake Lloyd, and Lucas's decision there, that deserves the real calumny. Oh, and Natalie Portman, hot or not, was actually embarrassing in this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
TOP 250?????,"I'm sure this review will not endear me to the majority of IMDB users who seem to share a far more glowing outlook of the movie than do I but such is the price of a democratic society.  THE TOP 250 movies of all time? What movie were you people watching. Yes, I understand that this movie was a Star Wars film and thus it is hard to be totally subjective about it because of the past achievements of the holy trilogy. But please! I will be subjective despite my absolute reverence of Lucas' accomplishment in episodes 4-6. The plot was interesting and succeeded in tying in the generational connection between characters (Skywalkers, Fetts, etc...) Visually, this movie was also one of the most pleasant experiences I have ever had at a movie theater. Beyond that, its all downhill. The writing was a complete abomination of cliches that made characters that we are supposed to legitimately care for appear as nothing more than a big book of recycled hollywood drivel. The topper for me was that line comparing sand to the smoothness of Naboo followed by the awkward moment where Anakin starts feeling up Padme. Also, in terms of actual action sequences, they were few and too far between.I recently heard a point made that I thought really helped me understand the reason why I was having trouble relating to this trilogy in comparison to the former. One big absence is the lack of the Han Solo character, or more importantly, the everyman, the critic, the cynic, the perspective from the public masses. Solo was the tie between a world of complete fantasy and our own lives.     Anyway, this movie is not horrendous. I enjoyed many aspects of this movie, yet when I see it ranked in the top 250 movies of all time, I think this should at least ensure that this movie had plausible dialogue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic... but overdone.,"This new Star Wars installment sees Lucas move into an upper echelon of special effects.  But is this necessarily a good thing?I am of the firm belief should only augment the story and not dominate it, as happens in Attack Of The Clones.  The saga that began (or ended) with such a fantastically involving story, complete with such intense mythical underpinnings that Joseph Campbell (the renowned mythologist) himself looked upon it favourably.  Its a pity now that it has degenerated into an orgasmic explosion for the senses.If you have no problem with what's mentioned above, the sensory overload will no doubt appeal to you and, by all means, get out and see the film for yourself.  But for any discerning film buffs who look deeper than the superficial images, for any concepts or, God forbid, even a theme, I wouldn't bother.I seriously doubt whether Attack Of The Clones will garner the same enthusiasm in a few decades as the original trilogy currently does.

"Visuals 8.2, Plot 7.4, Acting 4.5, Dialog 4.1","(No spoilers) The summary says it all. I read another review where someone said they will go back and watch the movie while listening to some music so he won't have to hear the dialog. That's a great idea.The visuals are quite good. I don't think they are better than Lord of the Rings but they are quite good. There are several good action sequences. One near the end is amazing.I think the whole story line ties in well with the future episodes, gives a very good story/history and there's some excellent irony (not the literal kind but the kind that people normally us the word for) in what happens throughout the movie.There are some scenes where you can almost read on the face of the actors ""Do I really have to say this line coming up?"" There are several scenes where the direction given to the actors does not seem congruent with the situation. Adding to this is the fact that several characters are mostly/entirely computer animated, so the eyes don't line up (either in the real actors or the animated actors).I think they used some previous characters well, if not a bit forced. Unfortunately, some of the jokes/puns were so very, very bad I literally heard my wife saying (quietly) ""they did not just say that.""It's the start of the summer movies. This one is OK.

Clones rocking fun,"Sure the acting is wooden, the dialogue weak, but Star Wars succeeds in the only area it needs to.  It is a spectacularly fun romp.  There are some cheesy one-liners that leave the movie-goers laughing.  People and critics tend to forget that the original Star Wars trilogy does not invoke memories of great acting or dialogue.  In fact, the acting in the first trilogy was attrotious, but it didn't matter.  The true star of any and all Star Wars films have been the special effects, the non-human actors.  This trilogy is missing the formidable villian that Darth Vader was in the first trilogy, but the torment that Anikan is having not over his feelings for Amidala but over his feelings of anger and frustration come across well enough to give that foreboding of doom that surrounds his character.  There is some zingy dialogue that foreshadows events that occur in the first trilogy, like when Obi-Wan tells his Padawan learner, Anakin -- well, you'll just have to see it.  I don't want to ruin one of the few dialogue moments in the movie. There are very few dialogue moments.  Obi-Wan has that one.  Mace has one later in the film as does Yoda.  Yoda is the best part of this film and his scenes along with the scenes involving Jango Fett and his clone son, Boba are among the best.  The climactic battle scene is so filled with energy that I feel that I must see the film again because I know I missed half of what was going on film. I wrote a review for Spider-Man not to long ago where I said that Spider-Man failed on the level that it needed to succeed in the action aspect. Spider-Man succeeds where Star Wars does not on a dialogue, acting level. If you combined the two you would have the perfect movie.  George Lucas is not an actor's director.  He gets better performances from his special effects than his actors.  That is the way he directs.  For that matter, who really cares?  The performances do not need to to be Laurence Olivier quality.  The best performance given by any actor in the whole series was by Alec Guiness and that's only because he's one of the finest actors that ever lived and did not need a whole lot of direction.  Young actors like Portman, McGregor, and Christensen need direction.  McGregor gave an outstanding performance in last year's Moulin Rouge.  Portman has been outstanding in various films.  These are not bad actors.  They just didn't get the direction they needed to fulfil their characters.  I'm still not sold on why Amidala would be in love with Christensen.  It would seem to me that she may be sort of sickened by his actions when going to save his mother.  My disbelief can be linked back to Episode I where it is difficult to imagine Portman's sexy Amidala with the young 9-year-old Anakin. Nevertheless, this is a great movie that doesn't rely too heavily on the love story the way Spider-Man did.  This movie relies on gun fights, chases, exploding starships, light saber duels, which includes one of the most unlikely duel of the series and one of the most satisfying.  I wouldn't dare to ruin it for anyone, so I won't. Bottom line, this film succeeds where it needs to and fails where it has never mattered before and still doesn't.  I mean, did anyone really go to see a Star Wars movie to find out if Han and Leia end up together.  That love story was as poorly written as this one and who cares.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Episode 2 - Attack of Bad Writing,"Like so many other die hard fans, I waited in line for the midnight showing to see this film, and now I am completely regretting my decision. While it was better than Phantom Menace, as a life-long Star Wars fan, I take offense that Lucas thinks he can get away with putting the worst love story ever into an otherwise interesting action movie. The film would have been so much better if 90% of the dialogue that Amidala and Anikin have together was cut from the movie. Star Wars fans are smarter than Lucas thinks. WE KNOW that Anikin and Amidala fall in love when they're not supposed to. Otherwise, Episodes 4, 5, and 6 don't make sense. Just showing scenes of them enjoying each other's company in the beautifully landscaped scenes would be enough to get the point across. Instead we have to endure crappy lines like ""Everything here is soft and smooth"", and ""I am haunted by the kiss you shouldn't have given me."" It sounds like Anakin is making an awkward pass at his sister.It's also this clumsiness towards Amidala that makes Anakin a spoiled little brat, rather than an arrogant and extremely talented Jedi. When Anakin fights, he is arrogant and rushes to judgment. But this arrogance doesn't carry over to his relationship with Amidala. If he was truly the arrogant hero, then he wouldn't fumble around making awkward passes at her through the entire film. It would be more romantic if Anakin just knew that they were supposed to be together. Lucas meant for Anakin to grapple with his emotions throughout the entire film, but we don't need to see the angst he has with Amidala, we needed to see him grapple more with the death of his mother. Unfortunately, we are wisked away from a crucial scene with Anakin and his mother's kidnappers before we truly grasp what he is doing that is so wrong. Instead, Lucas has his characters map out all their actions with words, instead of letting the actions speak for themselves. This is his main fault as a script writer. He is so good at letting the scenery and locations speak for themselves, but all the actors have to say what they are going to do first, then do it, or vice versa. Just because actors have mouths doesn't mean they have to use them.Case in point, during the final (and very cool) battle between Tyrannus and Yoda, Tyrannus (Christopher Lee) says ""Clearly this battle will not be won by our knowledge of the force, but by our abilities with a light-saber."" Well, thanks for clearing that up for me George. I've just seen a very cool fight scene where both characters try to defeat each other by using the force to move objects and kill their opponent, and you had to ruin in by having someone talk. If Tyrannus and Yoda had just pulled out their light-sabers and started fighting, we would have understood perfectly. No one would have thought that when they pulled out their light sabers that they were going to have a cooking contest. Let the action speak for itself. This is what Lucas needs to learn as a script writer, and a director. Action speaks louder than words.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Excellent - Star Wars is back!,"I'll be brief as those of you reading through the reviews would have already read the plot synopsis many times prior to my review.I went to the 12.01 screening of Episode 2 last night and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.After reading the critics negative reviews, much anticipation on my part and three years wait, I thought it was excellent.I loved digital Yoda, however could not notice any visual difference in the fact that the movie is filmed in Digital (of course it may not have helped being seated 4 rows from the screen).I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"great effects, shame about the acting","Saw it last night. The scenes between Annakin and Padme are terrible. The CGI is great. Yoda was done very nicely. last half hour is great.However when Yoda gets moving (When you see it you'll know what I mean) He moves just too fast. I thought It would be great after reading some of the reviews here, but it was bad. Looks like there will be some cool games come out of this movie. Basically sometimes it feels like one long games advert. Hopefully George Lucas will not direct (At least not the real live actors) in episode III.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awesome,They did it.  This is the best of the series.The critics are looking to recapture the thrill of Star Wars.  Star Wars was so unique in 1977.  It was a spectacle.  If it were released today it would not do as well.  The audience has become more sophisticated and expectant. Lucas Films delivered.  Can't wait for Episode III.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not at all up to what could be expected of a must-see installment,"Christopher Lee is good as always as our main villain and Ian McDiarmid could have been had he not been such a dead giveaway Emperor to-be. That is what can be said about this movie. The characters are narrow (the term Hamill-acting gets a new meaning here) and the surroundings a display of the effects department rather than a story foundation. The effects are often stunning but mostly cartoon like and utterly unconvincing. CGI characters much too often do not blend in like they should but become obvious inserts. All in all not at all up to what could be expected of a must-see installment. Entertaining, though, it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The worst film in saga that i've ever seen...,"First, it was 90 minutes of dialogues and talking. It was so boring so i decided to chat with my friends instead of watching this piece of fruit.

"Keep your spirit up during the terrible first half, it'll pay off in the fantastic second","The problem Star Wars has always had is with the screenplay, and this is no different. The first half is filled with cringe-filled dialogue and one-liners, and when Jar Jar Binks appeared early on my own thoughts echoed Han Solo's: ""I have a bad feeling about this"". However, Jar Jar's appearance is brief though it will have you burying your face in your hands until its over.Though the special effects are impressive they tend to get in the way and are at times distracting. Luckily the chemistry between Anakin and Obi-Wan works very well, though it still doesn't come close to the charming relationship that Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon had in Episode 1. The build up of Anakin's and Padme's relationship is the major thing that slows this movie down, and its hard to care about them at all. While Obi-Wan is investigating the creation of a clone army this subplot intrudes which is frustrating since we already know the outcome. Unfortunately its important to the plot and the future of Luke and Leia so we must grin and bear the melodrama. The action later moves to Corruscant where CLONES really begins to pick up.From that point onwards the bad dialogue (for the most part) is left behind and the fantastic action begins.From the introduction to Count Dooku, the suspiciously familiar Gladiator battle, the Jedi Battle, and especially the final battle between Yoda and Dooku, which works fantastically, will leave you impressed.The problems with this movie are mainly pertaining to the plot and dialogue, however as many Star Wars fans know, it was never the dialogue that made Star Wars - it were the space battles, wonderful locations and the climatic Jedi duals and when these eventually make their appearance it will make you remember why you loved Star Wars in the first place.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
