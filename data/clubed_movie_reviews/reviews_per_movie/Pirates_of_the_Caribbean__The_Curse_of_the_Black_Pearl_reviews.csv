Terrific!,"You will always remember this as the movie that made Johnny Depp a superstar and almost got him an Oscar.The fact that he didn't win isn't a problem,since thanks to him this is the best pirate film ever made.The opening concept is a clichè:a beautiful woman(Keira Knightley)is kidnapped by a bunch of filthy pirates(led by Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa)and the man(Orlando Bloom)who's desperately in love with her decides to track them down.From now on,things get unexpected,as he asks another pirate for help.And it's no ordinary pirate:it's Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp),a lying,cheating,but charismatic scumbag,the hardest man on Earth to predict,not to mention quite unlucky and clumsy(""You are,with no doubt,the worst pirate I've ever heard of"" ""But you HAVE heard of me!"").It's got all the elements of a classic pirate movie,elements that would give this flick a 9/10.So,why am I giving it a 10/10? The answer is simple:Captain Jack.From the moment he makes his entrance,justly included in the Empire Top 10 Entrances of all time,we know he's the reason people will keep watching the movie.He 's Depp's best non-Tim Burton-character ever,and I can't wait 'til he returns.See you next summer,Captain!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Surprisingly Good,"Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.There aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good.Basically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Depp for Emperor?,"I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney ""adventure"" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen ""Pirates"" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, ""Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?""And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.Except for this year.Go Jack.And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected ""money shots"" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, ""You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!"" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking ""overproduced by"" credit on the cover-liner. ""Bombastic."" ""Overdone."" ""Absurdly Stupendous.""Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.Once again, the children were wondering, ""What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?""Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, ""Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho"" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.This is not just another ""entry"" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of ""The Wizard of Oz."" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Johnny Depp is fantastic!,"Awesome action and swashbuckling adventure, great music from the likes of Hans Zimmer, good visuals and Johnny Depp's hilarious improvisational performance as Captain Jack Sparrow (the other performances are good as well but Depp's the highlight and you damn well know it) make the first Pirates of the Caribbean adventure a fun action flick that's not only a great first non-Touchstone/Hollywood Pictures/pre-2006 Miramax & Dimension PG-13 Disney movie but also a much better movie than a movie based off of a THEME PARK RIDE has the right to be.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Captain Jack Sparrow arrives,"And he has a great entrance. A really great one, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it! Even if it's only the first scene with Johnny Depp as Cpt. Jack Sparrow! While many/some have dismissed Johnnys performance here as being gay, I do think his intentions were others! That's not only because he himself said so in an interview (his inspiration being Keith Richards as he said), but also because I saw him as crazy, but genius guy, who was different.But kudos have also to go out to Gore Verbinsky. First of all, for resurrecting the pirate movie ""genre"" (maybe genre is not the right word, but you get what I mean) and also for sticking to Johnnys decision to play Sparrow the way he did! It's know that the studio didn't want Johnny to play it like that. They were afraid, that Johnny's performance would destroy it at the box office ... quite the opposite happened! Captain Jack Sparrow is the one who saved this thing from drowning (excuse the pun)! If you haven't watched it yet, go out and see it now!

The Good & Bad Of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl',"I very much enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it but lost interest on the second viewing, for some reason. It's the usual Disney adventure story which means the same good and bad traits I usually find, namely:THE GOOD - Nice camera-work and very slick-looking on DVD. Interesting characters, mostly here the ones played by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. It's difficult to find a role in which Depp doesn't play someone odd and/or fascinating. The story has a good mixture of drama, action, suspense and humor. Keira Knightley is attractive as the female lead and the story is interesting for the full 133 minutes (the last 10 minutes are ending credits.)THE BAD - Once again, the messages are ""laws are made to be broken;"" ""rebels in society are the good guys while authority figures are the villains,"" and the girl wants the poor man over the rich man, etc. etc. That all is so '60s clichéd by now, you'd think the Baby Boomers in Hollywood would grow up, but apparently not. These traits are in almost every film, including a worldly outlook on everything, which includes glorifying occult nonsense. Disney will never change.OVERALL - A fun movie, thanks mainly to Depp, director Gore Verbnski and his cameramen, and successful enough to spawn a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun movie, but doesn't deserve such high praise","Yes, Johnny Depp is one of today's greatest actors and it's amazing that he'd dedicate so much time and effort to a character in a flavour-of-the-month fad movie like this one. But really, that's all there is to this film. If another actor entirely had played Jack Sparrow, this movie would get a 5 from me, tops. It is simply an extremely forgettable film. In 20 years, who will even remember who played Will Turner or Elizabeth Swann? Knightly and Bloom are good to look at, but they'll soon be past their expiration date and, let's face it, no one watches their movies for their acting.The entire movie consists mainly of CGI skeletons, CGI ships and tired children's' humour derived from would-be funny characters (the transvestite ghosts, whatever their names were, are the most forgettable sidekicks this side of Tantor). The plot is as uninteresting as they come. The only reason to see this film is Depp, and although his performance is positively amazing, it's not enough to boost this flick to ""great movie"" status. His great job and the gorgeous Caribbean scenery is enough to make this movie an above average kids' flick, but no more, no less.There's not much else to say on the subject, so I'll leave you eunuchs to re-watch the film and consider that maybe everything about ""Pirates"" really isn't as amazing as you first thought it was.

Why is the rum gone?,"A damn good movie. One of the best of 2003 in my view.This movie made me laugh, and it really pulled me in.At first I was afraid this would be another bad Pirate movie. I went to see it anyway, as I've always loved the legends of pirates, and I love adventure. I saw it once. Then twice. Then Quadrupul. Then six times. And one more 7. And now I eagerly wait for the DVD in Australia.What i'm saying is I couldn't get enough of this movie. It was so well done.Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the british fleet.A great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Phenomenal!,"If there was a minor quibble with the movie, it is that it is a little overlong. Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like ""Stop blowing holes in my ship,"" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Finally, a real swashbuckling film to make me laugh","""Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male,"" a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.With hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!)The moonlight special effects were overdone, in my opinion - not that they aren't believable, but that they would have been more effective if used more sparingly, for occasional flashes of nastiness rather than solid minutes of battle. However, that's a minor niggle. The stunts are energetic, highly satisfactory, *not* computerised, and on occasion even carried out by the stars :-)The other saving grace of the production is its humour - not that there aren't a few over-arch knowing references, but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process. Jack Sparrow's first arrival on the scene (with total aplomb aboard a steadily-sinking boat) is a prime example, as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character...The basic Romance and Rescue structure is satisfactory enough, with the addition of the requisite Feisty Female for the 21st century (though I felt the character would have been a little more historically plausible if she had been a little less liberated - she clearly possesses a stronger character than her young man, she doesn't have to strive to be his physical equal as well...) However, it is the pirates themselves who really make the film, simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains (from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect) who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the 'Guardian' review: ""we have been waiting [50 years] for a modern pirate film featuring someone who, in all seriousness, actually says the words, or perhaps the two-syllable single word: 'Ah-harrrrr!'""Jack Sparrow, as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue (of course, totally honest in his own way... ahem) is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend - outrageous and unpredictable (there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as ""the worst pirate I've ever seen"", as in ""the worst at it"", only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful).This character saves the hero in more ways than one - without him, the film would be another ""Mask of Zorro"", a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modern-day sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier sword-fighting (swashbuckling is not *about* fighting! It comes into it, yes, but it's not the point.) But together, the pair work off one another beautifully - reliability and inspired lunacy, self-doubt and cocky flamboyance, dogged devotion and shameless self-interest. The only question is which, precisely, is the sidekick...There are two beginnings to this film, neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costume-drama-by-numbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move (it could scarcely be less subtle) is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow's initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape, when he seizes the rope and swings up, up, and out, in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat, and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie, when the audience began spontaneously to applaud.The film is far from perfect - characters like Captain Norrington (*please* - 'Commodore', like 'Prime Minister', is a job description, not a form of address!) and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes, with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in - ""it's okay"", ""I was rooting for you"" - most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language, and Sparrow's one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film (was it my imagination, or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache?), but, alas, any resemblance ends there.But then it doesn't really matter. It is Depp, not Bloom, who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination - and, since I'm extremely impressionable, also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there's not many films can say *that*..! ÿ",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
memorable Johnny Depp,"Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), his daughter Elizabeth and Lieutenant James Norrington (Jack Davenport) rescue boy Will Turner from a burning wreck on their way to Port Royal. Elizabeth hides Will's gold pirate medallion. Eight years later, Governor Swann is trying to set up Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) with the fast rising Norrington but she is still taken with Will (Orlando Bloom), now a swordsmith. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues Elizabeth from the water but he is set to hang for being a pirate. He escapes but Will helps catch him. Meanwhile the gold pirate medallion has called in Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on the haunted Black Pearl to attack the port. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth with the medallion. Will frees Sparrow to pursue her.The movie is bombastic, chaotic and messy. It's great to have Knightley and Bloom but it is Johnny Depp who steals the film. It is such a crazy performance that it is bigger than everything else. Without it, this movie would be a messy muddled thing. With it, this is a wonderful brilliant exuberant fun mess.

It's a fascinating and amusing pirates film with a lot of entertainment and fun,"The movie deals with a curse on pirates , then they abduct the starring named Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley) , the governor's daughter , with the aim she free them of a damned spell . A brave blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) is helped by a likable pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to rescue his love and .save her from Jack's former pirate allies . They will have to confront a nasty villain (Geoffrey Rush) and his henchmenThe motion picture mingles adventures , action-packed , thrills , humor with tongue-in-cheek , rip-roaring , romance and results to be bemusing enough . Yet another swahbuckler adventure in which our starring blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow to save his love by embarking in a maritime escapade and these protagonists will have to confront an ominous villain and his hoodlums who are now undead. The film runtime is overlong : two hours and some , but is neither boring , nor tiring but entertaining. The movie there is a homage to the pirates' films , paying tribute to classic pirate movies , also to Ray Harryhausen and his picture ¨Jason and the Argonauts¨ regarding the living skeletons . The action is messy and repetitive and there's a slew of duels and betrayals . As part of a franchise based on a theme park ride , this installment lives up to its heritage ordinary bouts of heart-pumping espectacle including merciless pursuits , fantastic pirates , living skeletons , ships tumble down, overwhelming duels , swashbuckling and anything else . As usual , Johnny Depp is the real star , he invests this overfed , action-tractioned swashbuckler with a voluptuous wit and fantasy enough . First-rate interpretation by Johnny Depp , he plays Sparrow as a purring East End dandy and like Robert Newton in the film titled 'Blackbeard', providing the necessary hilarious touches . Along with habitual roles : Depp , Orlando Bloom , Kiera Knightley who was only eighteen years old when this movie came out , they're well accompanied by a good support cast , such as :Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Lee Arenberg, Kevin MacNally , Mackenzie Crook , Martin Klebba, Greg Ellis, Damian O'Hare , Isaac C. Singleton Jr. , Trevor Goddard, Zoe Saldana and Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush (Shine) is excellent but overacting , at times .Colorful, glamorous cinematography by Dariuz Wolski and lavish production by Jerry Bruckheimer . Klaus Badlet's musical score as well as direction by Gore Verbinsky are well made . The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is the tenth highest grossing franchise ever including similar actors and technicians .

I Was Shocked,"I saw this movie in the cinema without hearing any reviews at all from any newspapers and without reading the reviews from this website. I came out of the movie thinking it was OK, although would have been much better without all that ghost garbage. It's one of those movies I just forgot about from the minute it finished, it left no impact on me at all.A couple of months later I was looking through the IMDb Top250 list and I was absolutely shocked to see this movie was in it, absolutely shocked. I clicked on it to see if it was the same movie I saw because I simply couldn't believe what I was reading. This? In the top 250? What's my point? Well my point is that I thought the movie was ordinary at best. Maybe it's just me? As soon as the ghosts came into play I was instantly turned off by this unrealistic pointless add-on, so maybe this is what sent me to sleep. If it was the ghosts or not, it doesn't matter, I didn't like it.The script and directing were good, so was Johnny Depp's acting.

Proof that Disney can still create good movies,"Disney seemed to be going down the tubes lately, with Atlantis and Home on the Range, but this movie is a masterpiece. If it wasn't for this movie, Johnny Depp wouldn't be as famous as he is today. Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don't buy DVDs often but this was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's mouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films you'll love this, if you like comedy you'll love this, actually, this movie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened by the skeleton scenes). 10/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is a true classic,"There are two few action-adventure movies now a days that delivers such original characters, played by a truly incredible cast. When I first saw The Curse of the Black Pearl as a boy I was fascinated. There where Pirates, cannons, sword fights, treasures funny monkey's and a beautiful girl, What more could you possibly ask for.I can still remember when I saw Jack Sparrow for the first time. He may not of had the typical ""hero"" qualities that would see in somebody like say William Turner, but that is what made jack so undeniably brilliant, he wasn't somebody we have experienced before. He was a witty, drunk, Sword fighting Pirate, with a flare for the dramatic. Seen for the first time in possibly the greatest hero entranced ever made. I glanced my stunned eye's at the screen to behold the one they called Jack Sparrow, or should I say ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow. There he stood in all his glory, the anthem soundtrack blared as he stood on top of his wooden sinking ship, or boat... As he floats by the pirate outlaws hung by there necks, with a sign on them that states ""pirates Ye Be Warned"" he stops bailing his sinking boat in time to offer a kind salute, to his fellow dead pirates.Its not long in till we are swept away by a amazing story of a two men desperately trying to find the loves of there life. One a Pirate after his stolen ship, and the other, a working hard blacksmith boy, trying to find his true love. Luckily for them, both loves have been taken by the ""crew of the dammed"". Barbossa, the fearless pirate with a pet monkey, yes a pet monkey. It soon becomes apparent that everyone in the story wants something, and they will screw and back-stab anyone who gets in there way, honestly this film there are know such thing as true friends, everyone will become an enemy in time.After years of watching this film, it still reveals itself as nothing more but a great adventure movie, just plain fun. So why not give it ten out of ten. There is everything you want in an adventure movie, girls, fights and a little magic and mystery. Not to mention some of the best 1-liners you will ever hear, ""you best start believing in ghost stories miss turner, you're in one"", and my personal favourite, the very last line in the film, as Jack prepares to embark on more of his adventures he quotes ""bring me that horizon"" as the ship sales off into the sunset.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Depp makes this worth watching...,"Fun stuff, and I think Depp is definitely the best part about the movie. My major qualm with the film is that it was way too long, this could have been cut down to a 90 minute non-stop adventure movie. But instead it gets a little repetitive and unnecessary at times (fighting the undead?).The second major annoyance was that the fight scenes were shot too close. The cinematography was very fast paced and close up (remember Moulin Rouge?), there are really no long drawn out panoramic shots here. This may seem trivial, but I had trouble following the action, it seemed very rushed and inconsistent.The acting was pretty good, given the fairly straightforward, cut and paste adventure movie script. With the exception of Depp's eccentricity, the dialogue is mainly to advance the plot instead of develop any interesting characters. Geoffrey Rush overacts as normal but is an entertaining villain. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are at times a bit stale, but otherwise do a decent job with the material.Overall, Depp is entertaining, and good swashbuckling action is rare these days. I'd give it *** out of four stars...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great family movie,"This movie is a must fo anyone's collection. It's clean, exciting and fun to watch. It gave me a whole new view on piracy. I mean every pirate in movies and plays before this either had a parrot, a peg-leg or an eye-patch. Pirates of the Caribbean doesn't have any of those stereotypes. Depp plays his role brilliantly, there is not a dull moment when he's on screen and Bloom portrayed the love-sick blacksmith perfectly as well. Knightley's role was a bit modern(strong, take-charge feminist), but that also added to the movie, she was great. I could go on about the actors, but there wouldn't be any more room, they were marvelous! This movie is mysterious, every single time I watch it, I can barely pull myself away from the screen! THis is without a doubt, the best movie I've seen yet.(A)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fun movie with a great performance by Depp,"(Note: this review is from 2003.) In its fullest, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Curl"" succeeds as entertainment. It is one of the great adventure films of this year, jam-packed with chills and thrills. It's a rousing swashbuckler with a great cast and a great story. But, ranking in at 143 minutes, it goes overboard on scenes a few times. Just a few.When ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" first opened, my Website was bombarded with desperate letters from frenzied fans of the film, all asking me to post a script for the film. It is perhaps the most requested script I've ever had people write to me about. It's amazing what an impact a film such as this can have.It stars Johnny Depp in the lead role as the infamous pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, the worst pirate the film's Good Bad Guy has ever heard of. ""Ah, but you have heard of me,"" Jack says. Jack used to be the captain of a deadly ship named the Black Pearl, before a mutiny took place at the command of Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), who left Jack for dead on an island where he drank rum for three days and got a permanent case of sea daze.But Jack survived, and now with the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), he will track down Barbosa and claim his ship back. Will is not in it for the ship, however, but rather for the young girl, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who was kidnapped by Barbosa in hopes of removing a curse put upon him and his crew after they removed gold coins from a cursed treasure chest. By the moon of the light, Barbosa and his idiot crew turn into skeletons. They cannot die, they cannot feel pleasure. They are ""cursed pirates."" First, they must restore all of the golden coins to the treasure chest, then pour the blood of a Turner over the stash of treasure. Captain Barbosa thinks that Elizabeth is the late Bootstrap Bill Turner's daughter, but he never had one -- his single child was a boy, and the boy is Will, who is coming to save Elizabeth from a doom that he himself should be facing more than anyone.Confused? Don't be. When you watch the movie it will all make sense, because it just does.The main element that carries along ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" well past its expiration date is the casting of Johnny Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow. In a constant drunken stupor and with a splendidly funny rough British accent, Depp has finally hit payday in a mainstream motion picture. He's been cast in cult favorites over the years, specifically those directed by Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Ed Wood""), but he's been around since ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Platoon."" He hasn't exactly gotten major recognition over the years, and though movie buffs know him by name, mainstream filmgoers probably wouldn't recognize him at first. Not now, however. Now everyone's jumping on the bandwagon. Depp, at forty, has finally gotten a mainstream break.Also helping the film is Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa. He's a dastardly villain with bad teeth and, we can only assume, bad breath. He's good at being a bad guy, but because the film is rated PG-13, a big step forward for Disney, he isn't allowed to be quite as vicious as he probably would be. And, I can only assume, the rating prohibits him from taking advantage of poor Elizabeth while she is held captive aboard his ship....The movie's score is by Klaus Badelt, who has been getting his big break lately with films such as ""The Recruit."" It's a good score that fits the film's tone of pirates. Pirates are everywhere in this film, and at one point a character remarks that it's good to be a pirate, or something like that. I just wonder: If that's true, why does Disney prohibit pirating of its films? Har, har.""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is one of the better entertainments of the year, helped primarily because of a great cast and witty script. But the character that will stay in your head long after this is over, more than any other character in the film (including Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's father, who I have not mentioned before now and I think I should have), is Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. He's going to go down in the books as one of those famous film heroes. And what saves him from becoming another gung-ho hero is what helped Harrison Ford make Indiana Jones so likable: He's an apprehensive and cautious hero with wit and loads of dry humor and funny one-liners to spare. He's not the type of hero who is necessarily always looking out for the best because he wants to save the world, but rather because he knows it's sort of his duty to do so. And he does so with apprehension. It's a key to making a great screen hero, and Johnny Depp succeeds where I can only assume most modern action heroes would fail.Let's just hope the rumored, upcoming back-to-back sequels don't sink to Davy Jones' Locker, eh?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates of the Screen,"It really does steal the screen!This is, without doubt, my favourite movie of all time. It was brilliantly written, performed, filmed, and put together. I cannot work out the mystery of why critics gave it such bad reviews. The special effects were excellent, as well.I was very choked that it did not get a single Oscar award. I especially couldn't believe that Return of the King got best Makeup over it. I saw NO makeup in that (the Orcs were people wearing masks), and then in Pirates, in come Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in spectacular makeup. I certainly think that Johnny should have gotten ""Best Actor"" for Jack Sparrow rather than Sean Penn.A great movie for all pirate lovers out there, and well - any movie lover out there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Channeling Robert Newton,"This first of the Pirates Of The Caribbean series, Curse Of The Black Pearl was a milestone in the career of star Johnny Depp. I always liked Depp since 21 Jump Street and he always chose quirky products where he did great as an actor, but the films were more often than not less than successful commercially. With this film first and foremost Depp got himself linked to a commercial success that spawned several sequels. His box office was now secure.But also this is a once in a lifetime chance to do a part that calls for some of the most outrageous overacting you'll ever see. I think Johnny Depp might have been channeling Robert Newton in one of his pirate films, be it Blackbeard or Treasure Island.In fact the plot is a lot like Treasure Island in the sense that Depp is looking to get back his ship the Black Pearl. It was taken over by his former First Mate Barboso played by Geoffrey Rush and the whole crew Depp included is under a really bad curse. A couple of civilians, governor's daughter Keira Knightley and blacksmith Orlando Bloom are also part of the adventure.The Pirates Of The Caribbean blends both the swashbuckling adventure film and the horror genre quite nicely. I can certainly Robert Newton in the part had this been 60-70 years ago.This is one film as are the rest in the series to just kick back and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic cinematography and costumes.  Depp's best performance,"I just got back from seeing this movie and I was overwhelmed.  I wasn't sure what to expect and was terrified that it'd be another Cutthroat Island bomb. One of my favorite things to collect is pirate paraphernalia so I was very heavily anticipating this movie -- making me certain I was setting myself up for disappointment... Thank GOD I was wrong!Johnny Depp has NEVER impressed me in all these years.  I hated him in every show and movie he was ever in (and that included Edward Scissorhands, Platoon and 21 Jump Street) until now.  This time he was right on the money. He stole the show and was by far the star over Orlando Bloom and Geoffery Rush.  His character was colorful and was a throwback to the swashbuckling of guys like Douglas Fairbanks, Burt Lancaster and Errol Flynn.  His costuming was fantastic, but the other characters' attire was great as well. Whoever picked out the outfits for this movie did a great job.Equally great was the cinematography.  It isn't easy to capture much of the scenery the way they did.  The shots of the ocean and the islands were beautiful.  I was reminded of my trips to Hawai'i and Catalina.  Great wideangle shots.I was also very impressed with the action.  The movie never drags despite its long running time of over 2 hours.  There are many fencing scenes and I enjoyed every one.  Somehow they manage to make the movie very action-oriented without making it turn into a mindless action movie a la Stallone/Schwarzenegger.  The movie is safe for the entire family despite its rating.  My girlfriend and I took her 9-year-old daughter to see the movie and she loved it as well.If you're familiar with the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland you'll find many aspects of the ride in the film.  The movie literally brought the ride to life with they way they recreated the ride's scenes without being hindered by them.I highly recommend this movie, despite the bad reviews it seems to be getting in many newspapers.  You won't be disappointed.  Take the kids.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
World's Only Ride-Inspired Movie?,"We watched this in summer 2019, after Sienna got into the ride at Disneyland Paris. But we all went on the ride at Disneyland LA in summer 2016.

While not particularly powerful, this roguish pirate can win a fight, and seems always to cheat death. Most of all, he commands the respect of other (low lifes). He's CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow.

"Good but overrated, too.","8.0 is a much too high rating for this good but not great movie. I like the fact that a movie finally does justice to pirate stories. It's strange that this genre, which sure holds a few adventures in store, hasn't been too successful until ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" hit the screen. Anyway, ""Pirates..."" is just that, a funny adventure in the tradition of ""Indiana Jones"" and ""The Mummy"". It's got everything: ghost pirates, abandoned islands, a beautiful governor's daughter and a brave young hero (or two heroes that is). The dialog is witty although I feel that it could be even wittier. The direction and the special effects were not too special (nothing compared to Gore Verbinski's great job for 'The Ring'). It was funny to see Steve from ""Coupling"" and Gareth from ""The Office"" on the big screen for the first time. They should have brought Jeff in as well! All in all ""Pirates..."" is a fine popcorn movie and surely the summer's best Blockbuster. I hope that maybe after the success of this movie, Hollywood thinks about turning ""Monkey Island"" (the classic adventure game by LucasArts) into a movie. Just a thought.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it.,I did not originally see the movie in the theater but rented it when it came out on video and loved it. I have eventually bought it and have watched it so many times I have lost count. I thought Johnny Depp's performance was really good and you couldn't help but love him. I also liked that the movie didn't have a lot of gore and sex in it but still kept the viewer captivated. As for T. Robertson's comment on Captain Sparrow having been under the curse too the whole time-he was not. Jack only came under the curse after having slipped a coin out of the chest after Will had been captured (You have to watch closely). That in itself was rather clever on Sparrow's part since you can't do battle with an immortal pirate and win if you are mortal. :-)This one definitely ranks in my top ten favorite movies. I hope they make another one.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Most entertaining film ever made,"OK, so everything that I could say has all been said in the other reviews already, but I can't stress just how enjoyable this film is.

The special effects are perfect - the pirates are very funny and not overdone at all. It is fun for all the family, and I can't think of anybody who isn't a complete kill joy, who wouldn't enjoy this film. It's always worth a watch when you need cheering up.

A succession of thrilling scenes,"If you still remember those old pirates movies with Errol Flynn, Walter Slezak or Douglas Fairbanks (Sr and Jr) please forget them because this movie has nothing to do with them not only because the means employed are quite more developed but also because we are not in presence of a mere adventure movie but before a movie which combines in well balanced doses comedy, suspense, horror and of course also adventure and action. The images are fairly beautiful making a pleasure for the eye, both static and action ones. The characters are sufficiently typical and convincing and the stereotyped traits of some of them are aimed at making you laugh. And what about the story? Well as you know the story in this kind of movies is always the weakest part with its usual flaws but we must tolerate it as the necessary conducting wire giving a logical sequence to all the scenes. So if you don't have anything better to do or to watch go see this movie. It will keep you fairly amused during more than two hours.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another childish flick,"This movie, as 99% of Hollywood's productions, was made for kids and teens, or people who think they are still kids. I don´t want to say it's bad or stupid, it's just...like a floppy, disposable, toy. As an adult, I felt a waste of time sitting down and trying to watch this kind of material, even with one of my kids besides me, enjoying it. Saying this, if you take this movie seriously you can point out the following: 1. It lacks of historical accuracy or even the remotest realism (pirates were bandits blessed by the Queen who used to attack Spanish vessels, I guess, or someone told me that). 2. All the characters are caricatures from a comic strip 3. The plot is 0, nil, nought, zero. 3. The formula: Maximum adventure with Minimum suspense (poor Hitch!) 5. Avalanche of FX to keep the children amused. 6. No dialogs, no conflicts, no real life. But, who wants these things today?",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Brilliant!!,"This is a fantastic movie full action, adventure, humor and a hell of a lot more! The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but that time flies by as you are transported into an awesome world of swashbuckling and sword fights.Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter, Elizabeth Swan. She is also another young, up and coming star with a bright future ahead of her.The film may not be the most historically accurate pirate film of all times but all that is forgotten as you enjoy the brilliance of this marvelous movie. Did I also catch a subtle omage to the 1953 swashbuckler 'The Crimson Pirate' when Will and Jack walk underwater in an upturned rowing boat? Sneaky!The only negative thing I have to say, and believe me I don't want to say it, is that fact we are never told the reason why the curse of the black pearl could only be broken by the blood of William Turner (Senior) and in turn by his son. Despite this plot flaw however, Pirates of the Caribbean is a magical journey that will drop the jaws of parents, children and grandparents alike. I'm definitely buying it when it come out on DVD!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Surprising Gem,"When I was first planning to view this film I must admit my expectations where not that high. After all, the title did give a cheesy feel to the whole thing. However, I must say that within 10 minutes of the film I was completely spellbound by the film, characters, and plot. The fight scenes where well done and not over dramatized, the animation of the skeletons was smoothly done, and the acting was incredible.The most surprising factor was how Johnny Depp played his character Jack Sparrow. Normally I am not a Depp fan per say, I enjoy his work but I don't exactly find myself fascinated by it. This role, however, gave me a whole different view of how truly talented Depp is as an actor. Depp took on a whole different role that even varied in the way his character Sparrow carried himself and mastered it like it was nothing.Bloom was also a pleasant surprise. A few minutes into the film in you completely forgot about the elf and focused on the character in front of us. After seeing Bloom in this film I can honestly say that he is not a typecast and will well be on his way to the top. Rush was excellent as usual and portrayed his role as `a captain so evil Hell spat him out' with such humanity you actually felt a bit sorry for the cursed pirate.All in all, this film is a rare gem to come from behind the Disney vaults. Along with the superb acting the writing, camera movement, plot, and timing was perfect. Not once did you feel the length of the movie setting in like `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' or like watching `The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' a third time. Humor, drama, action, and adventure where perfectly balanced out to make this film the movie of the summer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Enjoyable pirate adventure powered by Johnny Depp's performance,"A pirate attempts to retrieve the last pieces of a treasure that will lift a deadly curse.The concept of a movie based on a theme park ride feels quite thin, but the combination of writing, filmmaking and Depp's lead performance make it work.There is a fair bit of exposition through discussion of past events, but it does not over complicate the story. The characters are the main focus and are all well realised, with solid arcs.Depp as Captain Jack is easily the main attraction as he entertains in every scene and holds it all together. Most other characters fall into specific categories of hero, antagonist, honest, dishonest, funny, straight, safe or dangerous, whilst Jack has aspects of everything. Geoffrey Rush is also on great form as Barbossa.Visually it as as strong as you would imagine from a high value Disney production.

I am sure that, you are going to enjoy this movie for the next round. I think there will be another movie coming out for this, hence i encourage everyone of you to watch it. Although not a classic piece of film-making, the movie was never intended to be such and did exactly what it intended to do - entertain. The make-up and costumes for the pirates were very well done and most of those same pirates were very well played. The town of Tortuga and the ships were also quite impressive. Geoffrey Rush was very good in his role as Barbossa, although perhaps he should have been more evil. Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce were very good in their roles as Commander Norrington and Governor Swann. However, as already mentioned a million times, Johnny Depp completely steals the show with his wacky performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. This character should have been pretty one-dimensional but instead he's larger than life. Sparrow is a very memorable character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley had perhaps the two worst performances in this movie. Their characters were so flat that one truly doesn't care what happens to them. Looking handsome or pretty just doesn't cut it. Another complaint is the extended scenes involving fights with skeletons. Although the CGI pirates were impressive, the fight sequences near the end go on far too long.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, what started one of the highest-grossing movies series of all time, and a series that became a huge part of my childhood. In addition, to being wildly enjoyable and a great bit of fun, it also gave us one of the best-known characters to ever bless the silver screen, that is, Jack Sparrow.Despite considering this as one of the biggest movie influences of my childhood, I believe I've seen each film only once or twice. And if you were to ask me when was the last time I saw any of them, I couldn't tell you. So, fuelled by a desire to see the latest and hopefully last film in this series, and not remembering what has happened previously, I decided to embark on a journey through the seven seas and watch this whole series through.And what a great start to the series The Curse of the Black Pearl was. It's filled with everything you'd want from a fun, fantasy ridden pirate adventure. It's action-packed, guaranteed to make you laugh, and most importantly, it's tremendously entertaining. What surprised me the most, seeing it now with practically fresh eyes, was how tense and even scary it was, at times. People are killed left and right, and surprisingly little is left to the imagination. While I welcomed these traits as an adult, I'm a little surprised by their existence, especially when you consider how young most of the people watching it were, back in the day. However, it is mostly due to these thrilling elements that this film is as enjoyable as it is, even for the older audiences. Instead of having to only rely on action and comedy, the tension and horror elements create an environment that suits the film spectacularly well. It's an environment of moody and dark caves, loud and turmoiled cities, and dank and cursed ships. Combine all that with the contrasting splendour of Port Royale, and the royal fleet, and you'll have a film that beautifully divides pirates and the rest, giving each a surrounding that compliments them.But, as we all know, this series wouldn't have been anything without the one factor that doesn't suit either of the aforementioned camps. That is, of course, Jack Sparrow. He essentially becomes the bridge between the two worlds. Using traits from both sides and mercilessly taking advantage of them. He is a man that seemingly looks out only for his own interest, but when push comes to show, he'll forget about his beliefs and do the right thing. Indeed, it is painfully clear that Sparrow was meant as the odd man out. Even his clothing, while very pirate-like, doesn't fit in with any of the other pirates. Nor does it fit in with the law-abiding citizens. But, Sparrow's purpose isn't just being a bridge between two worlds. He is also the much needed comedic relief, the light-hearted drunk who always seems manage to stumble his way through. The performance that Depp gave is one that has become iconic. The way he talks and acts, the mannerisms that he has throughout and the countless quotable lines, created a character that became a staple in most households. If you were to ask me or any of my friends who the most memorable and iconic movie characters from our childhoods were, Jack Sparrow would, without a doubt, be towards the top of that list.While I have spent my time praising The Curse of the Black Pearl thus far, there was one rather significant problem that I noticed. Although it is a fun and entertaining film, for the most part, it was, surprisingly, the action scenes that felt the most redundant. Indeed, the first hour or so flew by. I had to take a quick break at one point, and I could hardly believe that an hour had already passed. Unfortunately, though, that didn't continue forever. Especially towards the end, it seemed to start dragging quite a bit. A lof the scenes started to feel repetitive and stretched out, something that the first half of the film didn't struggle with. Having said that, The Curse of the Black Pearl never feels too long, despite its lengthy run time. And for that, we have to thank, for the most part, the performances and the pure entertainment that this film offers.While I didn't enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl as much as I perhaps once did, there is no point in denying how fun it is. It's the perfect example of how to make a film where you can happily turn your brain off for a moment and enjoy some popcorn. Despite being shamelessly stupid at times, it never crosses the line of actually feeling stupid. Instead, it remains funny and fun throughout and provides a tremendous piece of entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I can't believe people liked this movie!,"Maybe I'm just getting too old for these childish popcorn munchers, but I found this movie to be tedious and contrived. It was SO predictable, in fact, that I was quoting lines before they even happened.Do movie audiences still NEED to see a man leaping from a second story balcony to avoid an explosion? This movie was so packed with stereotypes and shallow eye-rolling dialogue that there is little to no room for any creative originality.If it were not for the always delightful Johnny Depp, there would be little need for this movie at all. Splice together ten of your favorite Hollywood Frontal Lobotomies in to one big safe happy crapfest, and you'll achieve the same result.In short, the movie was entertaining, but not deserving of any special attention.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Johnny Depp puts a little swish in swashbuckle...,"Despite being rife with technical blunders such as the longest full moon in history, Disney's first non-PG film is proving to be a financial boon while at the same time collecting reviews from critics that run from tepid to red hot. I am in complete agreement with Roger Ebert on one point: Somewhere in this 143 minute tour de force there lurks a very good ninety-minute film.Other than Johnny Depp, who fashioned his character's personality (and eye makeup?) after observations of his good friend Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the cast of 'Pirates' reads like a Who's Who of English film actors, including Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport and Mackenzie Crook.When screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio originally pitched the movie to the Disney executives in the early '90s, Disney rejected it. It makes one wonder just who is running the Disney empire. Universal Studios have been combining action/adventure movies with theme park rides for over two decades (E.T., Jurassic Park, Jaws, and Back to the Future to name a few) only in reverse order-first the film, then the ride. This combination has worked well for Universal, and it seems almost absurd that Disney has taken so long to pick up on the obvious.I liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt's performance in Children of a Lesser God , and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner's in JFK, has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp, 'Pirates' is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), you will enjoy 'Pirates'.That is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa, and Orlando Bloom's performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future.Let us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph, for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft, unconscious, wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later, the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor's daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly), now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you're a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates, save Elizabeth, and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight, swordfight, swordfight, and that's about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that.A few predictions may be in order, however. Look for an Oscar nomination for Depp's efforts. Look for nominations as well for sound, set design, makeup, and cinematography. As far as best picture? Next to Lord of the Rings (Return of the King)? Not likely.Director Gore Verbinski, who used to play in a punk rock band and is best known for creating the Budweiser frogs, does an outstanding job keeping track of the myriad details required of a director, given his limited experience. True, 'Pirates' has countless errors in continuity, but those occur in any film of such scope. Mr. Verbinski has only four other films to his name: a short entitled The Ritual (1996), and then three very different but effectively made films, Mouse Hunt (1997), The Mexican (2001), and the very creepy thriller The Ring (2002). Again, it makes one wonder just who is at the helm of the USS Disney to put a $125 million movie in the hands of a neophyte. Well, it worked with Lord of the Rings and a very inexperienced Peter Jackson, and it worked here for Disney as well.'Pirates of the Caribbean' is a fun movie for most of the family. It may be rather scary for children ten and under and somewhat boring for many over twenty-five. I enjoyed it immensely for exactly what it was... an amusing ride.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A positive review of Pirates of the Caribbean,"I saw this movie and I thought it was excellent. Admittedly, I originally was only going to see it for Orlando Bloom, but I ended up loving the film as a whole. The actors are excellent in their individual roles and all worked very well together. Johnny Depp was hilarious and portrayed a unique and lovable pirate. Geoffrey Rush played an excellent adversary who was both sinister and entertaining. Orlando Bloom played his part of a devoted lover wonderfully despite many people's opinions that he was weak and too lovey-dovey. The plot was interesting and captivating, and although I found a loophole, I think it was purposeful as they are making a sequel. Wonderful special effects and sets helped to make this movie excellent. Wonderful direction from Gore Verbinski held this movie together and an awesome score by Klaus Badelt accompanied the entire movie very well. Overall, I thought it was an excellently made movie that was fun for all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Depp saves the day,"Pirates of the Caribbean is a nice 100-minute movie with an extra hour of inane plot twists thrown in - who edited this thing? Johnny Depp's performance is the one thing that makes this movie enjoyable throughout. Without Depp, Pirates is just another bad summer block-buster movie with too little plot and too much special effects trying to cover it up. I'm a bit amazed that the Oscars saw fit to nominate his performance - one of the boldest, riskiest acting jobs ever allowed in a summer release. I know all the accolades went to Sean Penn's overdone performance in Mystic River. But, I'd give the nod to Depp for single-handedly pulling this movie into the enjoyable category.Afterword: Pirates II has come out, and the first hour is abysmal. Depp seems bored, and there's even less of a story than in Crrse of the Black Pearl. Barely worth renting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates A Terrific Adventure Film,"Pirates Of The Caribbean Curse Of The Black Pearl is a terrific adventure film with action, drama, suspense, some romance, and humor.

The rest of the supporting cast are great in their roles including Geoffrey Rush as the villain Captain Barbossa, Orland Bloom as Will Turner a blacksmith, and Kiera Knightely as Elizabeth Swann. Gore Verbinksi does a fantastic job of bringing this movie to the big screen. From the action, to the drama, to the humor and adventure this film has something in it for everyone who's looking for an entertaining movie to watch.

With plenty of humor thrown in that balances well between the drama, suspense, and action.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An entertaining jumbalaya of a pirate movie,"Two reasons to see Curse of the Black Pearl (and I'm speaking more to adults, kids will see just about anything they can get into admission-wise) are the effects done on the crew of the Black Pearl, and two performances amongst those that were OK but nothing special- Geoffrey Rush as the taut, creepy captain of the Black Pearl, and especially Johnny Depp as the somewhat unconventional captain Jack Sparrow. On this site it's said that Depp patterned his character's moves and voice after Keith Richards, which I can see, however my first impression watching him was that he was basically playing Raoul Duke from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in a pirates cap and with gold fronts. This is indeed an original turn for Depp, even if we've seen him do something like this before, and it helps when a persona is this fresh in a story that counts the numbers a bit too often.Curse tells of a governor's daughter, Elizabeth, who is on the verge of being married to an uptight British officer, despite to pining of blacksmith Will Turner (LOTR's Orlando Bloom). When she is kidnapped by a looting band of pirates one night, he enlists the help of imprisoned Jack Sparrow to find her and the Black Pearl. But when the curse is revealed to Elizabeth that's when things get suspenseful (to a degree).One thing that makes this a worthwhile time for the kids is that it's the first PG-13 film from the Disney people, and though it might have fared a higher calling if it was under a different studio with an R rating, it can give them a chance to see some scenes parents may find a little risqué. For instance, at one point Jack and Elizabeth are stranded on an island (which is all I'll say as to not spoil it), and he finds a stash of rum in a hiding place, and then the two get hammered under the moonlight. Another instance is when the curse is first revealed, once again under the moonlight, and this can be a perfect introduction to the magic of zombies.The action scenes, however, are the weakest scenes of the film, which is a let-down since there's some good choreography in the swordplay, but there's just something about the way they go on that doesn't catch the viewer in (at least me) like how other action scenes this summer have. By the end of 'Curse', the audience can see it's nowhere near greatness, but as popcorn fodder it is a pick of the moment. B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overrated,"Could their be a more over-rated film this year. While okay in part, I think the main reason behind it's success is the fact that some people take a liking to Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. It has problems classifying what type of film it is. Not enough action to be a action film. Not enough laughs to be a comedy. It has also been put up for major awards, yet it is clearly a blockbuster. 'Its both of these,' you may say. That is not the case as the poor attempts at jokes do not work. Johnny Depp probably deserved his Golden Globe nomination, not his Oscar nomination though. His character, along with everyone elses, is one-dimensional and conforms to stereotypes. Bloom plays Legolas very well to say the setting has changed. the other actors are fairly decent in their roles. A plot that i could predict in my sleep and a boring script prevent it from being good. What could have been a great 90 minute blockbuster has been stretched to 2 and a half hours on a plot that cannot manage it.*1/2 out of ****p.s. It has been hyped up recently.

A Pirate For Our Times,"What lifts this film above typical Disney fluff is Johnny Depp's humorous performance as pirate Jack Sparrow, the eccentric, individualistic anti-hero, who confronts other pirates, and outwits a humorless, incompetent bureaucratic establishment. Sparrow looks more like Cher than Johnny Depp, and talks more like William F. Buckley than a pirate. Geoffrey Rush is a worthy foil as the main rival pirate, Barbossa, a character who vaguely resembles Margaret Hamilton in ""The Wizard Of Oz"".Most of the plot is silly. There's lots of fighting, shouting, and general mayhem, all accompanied by a frantic score. It's a cinematic slight of hand that conveys an illusion of substance. Still, it's an entertaining popcorn flick.I'm glad I watched it.

"Calm down, people!","I saw the movie for the second time and decided to write this review. I don't think it's a good idea to write one just after you saw the movie for the first time, because you can be too impressed by the movie and therefore not thinking clearly.The movie is nice, very nice, and I'm sure I will see it multiple times more, but to say »it's the best movie ever« is as ridiculous as the fact that all three movies of the »Lord Of The Rings« trilogy are in the top ten of all times on this site. A great movie, in my opinion, is the one that raises important issues and forces you to think about them and generates strong emotions together with superb acting. So, by definition, I tend to like dramas a lot.I know I can't expect this kind of things in an adventure movie. So, I saw POTC just to have fun and I had a great time. It's a movie which was designed to make a lot of money and entertain the whole family (like Disney's parks), and it did its job perfectly. I can imagine it must be so magical for the kids. Jack Sparrow, brought brilliantly to life by Johnny Depp is so charming and witty. I bet there are children out there arguing at play because everyone wants to be the Captain. Bloom did all right but that's it. I'm kinda romantic guy, so I did like scenes between Orlando and Keira, but I can understand they were very pathetic for some people. She did much better in them, he was basically just staring at her.The story is interesting enough, it has golden treasure, curse and pretty good twists, effects are impressive, movie is also very funny.

"A giant, thrilling roller coaster-ride, indeed","To be totally honest...I didn't join the hype and the worldwide enthusiasm when this movie was first announced. I was actually worried when I saw the names of Johnny Depp and Jerry Bruckheimer listed together on one movie-poster ! I always looked at Johnny Depp as he is Hollywood's last ""rebel"" and seeing him in a big budget production ( like the average Bruckheimer film is) would mean we've lost him too. By ""rebel"" I mean that he chooses the roles he really WANTS to play. For himself or for his Hollywood friends ( like Tim Burton for example ) So, in that way, I'm glad to admit I was wrong. Johnny kept his own personal style and personality in this movie. The big money and the huge hype surely hasn't changed his way of film-making.Pirates of the Caribbean is indeed on of the most enjoyable films coming from the last few years and a must see to everyone who likes an original and well made movie. But I wouldn't go so far to call it a masterpiece already. I even saw they've included this film in the list of ""250 best movies ever"" here on this website...That may be a bit soon, I guess. I prefer to await its status within a few years whether to include it or not.But hey, no complaints from me neither... I saw it 3 times so far and loved every single viewing. Making a good movie about pirates is some sort of achievement to itself, actually. This topic seemed to be ""cursed"" to itself ( oh, sweet irony ) because the last attempts of telling a story about pirates all resulted in complete failures. Cuttroat Island by director Renny Harlin was a complete disaster and it messed up the career of Geena Davis. Even the brilliant director Roman Polanski didn't succeed in making an interesting movie about pirates when he tried it, back in 1986. Upcoming talent Gore Verbinski ( his version of the Ring was quite good as well) did succeed and I find this to be quite remarkable...especially when you consider the basic idea behind this film is a roller coaster-ride from Disney Wold.Yes, Johnny Depp is great in it. I said it already and he got lots of praising all over the world for his role, so I think it's not necessary to mention him again. We all know Geoffrey Rush is an overtalented actor and Orlando Bloom is well on his way to build up a great career as well ( not many actors his age can say they starred in 4 of the biggest box office hits of all time, even though 3 of them are part of a trilogy ). I didn't know Keira Knightly yet but she looks cute. In general, I think we can say the acting is flawless. There are also enough fascinating plot twists and funny moments in Pirates of the Caribbean thus it's certainly recommended !! I'd already recommend it if it were  for the used language alone !! I love expressions like "" Ye'd be lost to Davey Jones' Locker"" and several other, typical sayings. But if you really think there's absolutely nothing negative to say about this film, I suggest you stop reading now because I do have a few minor comments on it. First of all there the CGI, I complain about this matter on most modern films, but that's because it bugs me so much. I'm still convinced it's possible to create a visual stunning film without the overuse of computer effects but this movie didn't try to do so. Maybe it's for the best, otherwise many (younger) fans wouldn't have liked it. And I do think this motion picture is a bit like its title...too long. I'm not saying it becomes boring but 145 minutes is a bit long to tell the story in my opinion. Furthermore...no remarks. Off you go...watch this film !!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Skulls and bones,"Naturally, computer graphics had to get in there --- pirates alone could never be enough for the modern child. She has to have pirates who are ghouls as well, so that the film is a messy hybrid of horror and adventure.The combination of men who can't be killed fighting endlessly with characters made of wood while a symphony orchestra goes crazy is utterly tedious.It's so sad that worldwide youngsters subject to the American global market have only this junk-food to consume on DVD.Throughout the whole deadening two and a half hours, there are about five seconds of shots of the Caribbean. The picture might as well have been shot in Disneyland.Johnny Depp is even more pathetic here than in his next role, The Libertine, in which he played a sex-crazed poet who never touches a woman throughout the whole film.His British accent, predictably, is a mess (as in The Libertine) and his role in this film is to spend long periods in a cell while everyone else gets on with it. The idea that he is some kind of commander of men is ridiculous. He simply camps up the whole picture and makes a mockery of it.Naturally, the plot is the most ludicrous imaginable, it's not even worth discussing. Suffice it to say that it is full of holes you could navigate a ship through.As for black people who populate the Caribbean, just two appear in this picture: one a glimpsed female pirate captain (!), the other a glimpsed huge stereotyped brute with a studded face and massive muscles. So, take your pick: cheesy stereotype or politically correct cut-out. As for the other millions who inhabit the Caribbean, they don't exist.If there was a scrap of history that validated this film as a nostalgic romp, it might be excusable.

Freedom,"When I first saw the film, I thought it was awesome- the graphics were great and no doubt, Jack Sparrow (Depp) and Will Turner (Bloom) were hot in their own ways. I was surprised that Disney would have scary skeletons in a movie, but it was a very good film indeed.This movie starts off with a song about pirates, which, I think, is genius. Not subtle, not direct, just genius. The whole plot revolves around rescuing... and rescuing... and rescuing, again.The second time I saw this film, I thought it was disgusting. What the heck, I thought to myself. It's so... so... unrealistic (which is really unlike me, because I adore fantasy- just not too far-fetched in the fantasy world, like Mary-sue or people popping out of no where to help others). Until I saw it for the third time. I loved it then. (And yes, to watch a film for 3 times and have 3 different opinions each time makes the following statement true- 'there is obviously something wrong with me.') The thing that made me love this movie SOOOO very much was- 'Freedom'. As Sparrow had said, being a pirate is like having freedom. I had a knot in my stomach when I heard this- I mean, oh my god, I hated being trapped in a boring routine everyday. Being a pirate meant adventures, risks, excitement. And that really attached me to the movie. Whenever I read books or watch TV shows or movies about high adventures or fantasy, I almost cry because I'm not the main character- it's not me who's having all the fun, and reading these books or shows or movies might be the closest thing I will ever be to having the adventure of a lifetime.Watch this movie.

Johnny Depp Is Ready for His Close-Up,"""From producer Jerry Bruckheimer comes 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl', the thrilling high-seas adventure with a mysterious twist. The roguish yet charming Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) idyllic pirate life capsizes after his nemesis, the wily Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), steals his ship, the 'Black Pearl', and later attacks the town of Port Royal, kidnapping the governor's beautiful daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightley).""In a gallant attempt to rescue her and recapture the 'Black Pearl', Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) joins forces with Jack. What Will doesn't know is that a cursed treasure has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever as the undead,"" according to the DVD sleeve description.This first ""PG-13""-rated Disney film unexpectedly became the first of a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" feature franchise based on one of the company's amusement park rides. It's Disney off the Jerry Bruckheimer production line (so, plan accordingly), and is eye-pleasingly well-produced. The screenplay, by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, is quite a nice modernization of the classic ""pirate"" story.The film's greatest strength is Mr. Depp's slosh-buckling, swish-buckling, swaggering, and staggering ""Jack Sparrow"".Depp's characterization cuts through the screen with uncommon, original charm. This part made critics strut up and take notice, with Depp being rewarded with several ""Best Actor"" awards and nominations. This was also the film which vaulted Depp into the Quigley ""Box Office"" Top 10 stars list (#6, with a bullet).

If you think about it, this was Disney's first PG-13 film; thus, if ""Pirates"" had flopped, Disney likely wouldn't have continued to make PG-13 movies and, for better or worse, likely wouldn't have acquired more mature properties like Star Wars or Marvel Superheroes.Of course, this film was a smash hit, and the rest, as they say, is history.It's easy to see why Pirates of the Caribbean was so successful. Beyond the obvious reason (Johnny Depp's now iconic performance as Captain Jack Sparrow), this film is incredibly fun, ridiculous, and full of inimitable action sequences.I would argue, however, that the appeal of this film (and the subsequent two movies in the series) runs deeper than just the surface joys of the zany action and stellar performances. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", at its core, is surprisingly anti-establishment and joyfully liberating. It is ultimately a tale of following your heart, and not letting social norms decide what is right and wrong.That is what I think is so captivating about this series as a whole. You can look at it from both a surface level and a deeper level, and both interpretations are correct. It is both a relentlessly fun and exciting action movie, a work of escapist fantasy, while also being deeply liberating and life affirming.Specifically related to this first film in the series, I am blown away every time I rewatch it just how solidly made it is: the way they introduce these lovable characters and develop their relationships is so endearing. Even though the story is (kind of) set in the real world, there is still a sense of rich history and politics with all the set pieces and characters. That, plus the fact that many of the character's backstories (especially Jack's) are not overly explained and left largely mysterious, is something that I've rarely seen done better in many other mainstream movies.Overall, this film is incredible, and I don't think it deserves this reputation as only being a really good action flick. It truly has something for everyone: action, wit, humor, drama, romance, and surprisingly complex ideas. A true landmark masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie is just OK.,"As a kid I've loved pirates and adored pirate-movies, as growing up I do not even know how many times I saw the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, how often I quarreled about it.
Man, this was my favorite movie.When the fourth Film was released, I wanted to watch the first one to get rid of the bad taste and the terrible memory of all the other movies. I took her on a weekend time, put myself in the right mood, had a big plate of pancakes on my table and saw, after a long time, the ""Pirates of the Caribbean 1"" again in the atmospheric light with my freshly purchased boxes and the best sound...And Now:
The plot is relatively complicated tolled for such a simple pirate adventure, all locations look quite chic so I think it's a shame how much time on the water or on ships spend. The special effects are pretty cool, I like the eerie atmosphere and the actors manage to convey it correctly, making you feel like you're part of it. Even the costumes and make-up contribute to the impression that I do not see actors but I really see these characters. I think Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were born for these roles.
I'm sooo happy to see again Disney movie with action and sword fight instead of musical numbers.But:
This movie was just below my expectations. It was not so exciting, not so cool, not so funny, not so thoughtful and not as creative as I thought or remembered.And to my astonishment, the movie is not nearly as good... as I thought.
The movie was still good but, maybe I had lower demands as a kid, maybe the movie is still good but my taste and expectations are now too high, maybe the movie was never good was never that good to begin with and as a kid I tolerated it more or anything else happened so I can say today this movie is just OK.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Shockingly poor,"There has been so much hype about this film, but in reality (well, in my opinion anyway) it is seriously bad. Let me explain myself...Firstly, Johnny Depp, who everyone thinks has given some career-defining performance, simply hops around dressed as a woman and makes cliched little comments that really grate. Secondly, Depp and Bloom's swordfight near the beginning of the film is horrifically dull. They spend the first few minutes exchanging limp jibes (physical and verbal) walking indifferently around the set... one is left half-asleep. I know the action comes later, but this dull, empty screen-time is unusual for Disney. But the most laughable element of the film (so far) is this absolutely ridiculous idea that between the ragtag, thieving bunch that pirates were, there existed a 'code of honour'. We see in the film one of the characters asking not to be killed because, according to 'the code', she has the right to 'Parley' and can be saved from death and have a nice chat with the captain instead. When the captain later tries to distance himself from this and says that the code is 'less rules...more a set of guidelines' I was crying into my chips. This is Final Destination-quality craziness.Anyway...just thought you should all know this film really ain't that great.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pure pirate perfection, to see this film once is worth all the gold and silver in the world!","The idea of plucking a long-time neglected genre out of the dark, combining it with concepts introduced by a theme park ride and throwing the varied combination of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley does seem bizarre and risky. Admittedly director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer had no idea what they had created when they first released this spectacle into the theatres, and certainly weren't prepared for its instant monumental success. Though one must remember that nowadays twentieth century pirate adventure flicks are considered predictable and shallow light entertainment that really only haven't been criticised because of when they were made. Indeed, you might say that it is a miracle that this film was even accepted by today's audience and its creators were very fortunate not to be insulted over and over by thousands of cynical and terribly displeased critics. But no it definitely wasn't fortune that got this over the line and beyond, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl' differs greatly from the others in many ways. The major one being Depp's exceptional performance as the film's central character: notorious, elusive, sly and unpredictable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow. His unique portrayal turns what could have been yet another classic specimen of a famous stereotype into a character that is hilarious, charming, poignant and perplexing.The other cast members are also pitch-perfect, and some of them are even better: Rush is wonderful as the cunning and horridly cruel villain; Orlando and Keira are nothing outstanding and we feel that we have seen their characters countless times before, but neverhteless they do manage to pull off the pair of heroic lovers that they play quite nicely; Jack Davenport is superb as the dutiful Commodore who greatly despises piracy; Jonathan Pryce is decent as a cowardly governor and the protective father of Keira's character; Kevin.R.McNally is excellent in the role of an old companion of Jack's; and the dynamic duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg are delightful as two bumbling blundering pirate buddies under the the service of Rush's character.The music is incredible, and greatly enhances the overall uplifting and exciting feel of the film. The choreography of the action sequences are outstanding, the special effects work beautifully, the costumes are very well designed as are the sets...This is my equal-third favourite film, with the other two being 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'. I really sincerely do mean that, no other of my reviews says this. I just hope that i have given this film the vast quantity of praise that it deserves.It completely shatters the Walt Disney Company's reputation for being able to create only babyish kids cartoons and similar live action movies. Though it is still a bold and daring little company that thrives on risky endeavours, like the dazzling 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', such as this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I'll drink to this one me hearties!,"At first glance, you can be forgiven for being sceptical about Pirates of the Caribbean. A movie title taken from a slow-moving, Disney theme park ride in a genre in which Hollywood has failed to make any real imprint onto since Errol Flynn's swashbuckling days. On closer inspection, however, Gore Verbinski's latest offering, penned from the writers of Shrek, boasts an impressive cast and a trailer showing just a glimpse of some the amazing CGI special effects that no Summer Blockbuster can do without. So, did Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean 'shiver me timbers' or did it make me want to run off the nearest plank? I am pleased to report that this film more than lives up to the preceding build-up. It looks gorgeous (helped along by the fresh faces of our disgustingly handsome hero, Orlando Bloom and his, 'bonnie lass' Keira Knightley); it has just the right mixture of romance, action and comedy and is a showcase for one of the most mesmerising and innovative performances this year (move over Errol, Mr Depp has landed.) Probably one of the most underrated and the most unconventional actors in Hollywood, Johnny Depp masters the character of Captain Jack Sparrow and creates a half-drunk, half-insane pirate, delivering the gags with almost perfect comic timing and an assortment of hilarious mannerisms. Alongside Depp, Geoffrey Rush plays the villainous Captain Barbossa, doomed to live as a cursed man because of his greed and piracy. Rush ensures that Barbossa is a genuinely creepy character whilst even managing to evoke a degree of sympathy for him as he wanders miserably through life in a desperate struggle to lift his curse.A script containing every ingredient you would look for in a movie of this genre backs up these superb performances. Without ever taking itself too seriously, Pirates of the Caribbean, embraces all of the old pirate clichés, to produce a cracking story, exciting action sequences and enough double-crossing buccaneers to provide one of the most entertaining two and a half hours I have sat through. The CGI special effects create amazing fight scenes as Barbossa and his cursed crew exchange their human bodies for that of ghostly skeletons as they are hit by the glow of the moonlight. All praise goes to the special effects team that created these seamless transformations. Not just a fun Summer Blockbuster but also the movie that has resurrected the swashbuckling genre, Pirates of the Caribbean comes highly recommended.

Really good fun  doesn't take itself too seriously and is played to perfection by a wonderful Depp,"Sailing with her father as a girl, Elizabeth Swann, is on board when the military ship comes across a wreck from which they rescue only a young boy, Will Turner.  Elizabeth hides the boy's medallion in order to hide the fact that he is a pirate, she also thinks she sees the mysterious ship The Black Pearl.  Years later Elizabeth is being wooed by officers while Will is a blacksmith in her father's service.  When her  medallion calls out to another force, it brings the crew of the Pearl to the bay in search of the gold.  Elizabeth is kidnapped and Will resolves to go after her.  He turns to the only man he knows who knows the black pearl  incarcerated pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.  However how can you trust a pirate's word?I'll be honest and say that I didn't want to see this film  I had been totally turned off by the trailer.  The one attempt at humour in the trailer is that awful `try wearing a corset' line, it didn't get a laugh in the film or on the trailer.  However I did go and see it and, after Hulk and Matrix, I was very glad I did.  The plot is pretty enjoyable allowing for lots of fights but also enough twists and turns to hold the interest.  It doesn't all make total sense but, like the ride it is based on, the film moves on before you have time to think too hard about anything.Unlike those other blockbusters I mentioned, POTC doesn't take itself too seriously.  It doesn't make fun of itself either, but it does have it's tongue in it's cheek the whole time.  This is seen in the vein of gentle humour that runs through it in the dialogue, action and characters  the film is basically having fun so it is easy for the audience to get with it too.As every other reviewer on earth has said, the biggest strength of the film is Depp's Captain Jack.  Playing him like a drugged out rock star who clings to his half-fame like a life raft, Depp wrings so much humour out of every line, every scene and every little thing he does (`but why is the rum on fire?' being my favourite line).  It is a performance that could have been awful but he pitches it just perfectly and stops the film ever becoming anything less than fun.  The only downside of his character (who makes his appearance on a ship revealed to be a tiny, sinking boat) is that the film sags a little when he is off screen for longer than 5 minutes.Bloom and Knightly carry the film's more serious core and thus have a less glorious job.  Both do well however and are good if not quite stars  certainly I was surprised to see Knightly with such a big role in a big film.  Rush enjoys himself as Barbossa and the crew also have fun.  The effects are used just as they should always be used  to compliment the film rather than be the raison d'etre!  The effects are good without replacing plot or characters  they are well blended into the flow so never bring the film to a halt by their use (although wine flowing through and out of Barbossa is pretty impressive).Overall I enjoyed this film a great deal.  Sure it is not a classic film or a perfect one, but it does exactly what a summer film should be  entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously and moves a long at a fair pace without ever lapsing into impatient editing or flashy visuals.  Having said that, if Depp was not onboard the film would be much the lesser.  His exaggerated performance enhances the tongue in cheek feel to the film and makes it a much funnier, livelier and all round fun experience.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Depp adds needed ingredient,"This easily could have been your run of the mill pirate movie but thank god Johnny Depp is not only a terrific actor but one that adds real ""Character"" to his characters. Film starts out with a young boy found adrift at sea with a gold medallion around his neck and an old ship which looks like a ghost ship is spotted. Years later the boy Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is working with a blacksmith and in love with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and she is the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) who would rather see his daughter marry Cmdr. Norrington (Jack Davenport). One day at port a strange sailor shows up as his small vessel sinks and he is found out to be pirate Jack Sparrow (Depp). They want to hang him but that night the town is attacked by pirates headed by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Jack has a personal beef with him. Seems as though Jack was the Captain of the ship Black Pearl but the crew performed a mutiny and left Jack on a deserted island which he escaped from. Two of the pirates grab Elizabeth because she has Will's medallion and while questioning her she says her last name is Turner. She discovers during her kidnapping that the pirates are really the walking dead and in the moonlight they appear as rotted cadavers. They think she is related to ""Boot Strap"" Turner who was a pirate that they killed and they need the blood of his offspring to become human again. Jack and Will steal a ship and go to recruit sailors so they can save Elizabeth and Jack can reap the rewards as well. This film is directed by Gore Verbinski and along with ""Mouse Hunt"" he demonstrates a real flare for lavish sets and decorum. The sets are terrific here and the special effects are pretty good as well, especially some of the underwater shots looking up at the bottom of the ships. The big problem with this film (Besides being too long) is the script. How many times did Depp get captured by either side and then have to talk his way out? And the romance between Bloom and Knightley is just so cliche. Knightley is particularly dreary. She's a fresh pretty young face but in this film her role could have been performed by any other actress and it would have been the same. She showed much more spark and left an indelible mark in the film ""Bend It Like Beckham"". Here, she's just a forgettable pretty face. What saves this film is Depp and Rush. Thankfully these two remarkable actors add so much imagination to their roles and they give the film the added flavor it badly needed. Can you imagine this film without them? Depp has stated that he played his role in the nature of a drunken Keith Richards and with the eyeliner he wears its a joy to watch him. Rush also does a good job and with that monkey on his back he seems to be having a good time. Some of the other pirates are played on a comedic level and one that stands out is the pirate with a glass eye. The film doesn't take itself seriously and this attitude works to its advantage. This film came very close to being very routine but with the performances of Depp and Rush they together save it from being predictable and stale.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Refreshing Piece of Old Fashioned Swashbucklery,"It's not going to be the best film you see this year, maybe not even this month or this week...but it's refreshing and entertaining all the way through thanks to some smart direction, a clever script, and a delightfully off-kilter performance from the master of such turns, Johnny Depp. Here's the reasons I liked this movie so much:1. Johnny Depp is a hoot. Jack Sparrow is by far one of the strangest yet most endearing anti-heroes ever to grace the screen. You never know if he is drunk, crazy, or cleverer than you. All of Depp's quirks and mannerisms and line readings keep you constantly off guard and entertained.2. Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of some of the biggest film travesties ever (""Armageddon,"" ""Pearl Harbor"") actually hired a director who can sustain a shot, control epic scenes, pace a film, and set atmosphere without tricky camera movements or overused special effects (finally a summer movie where the effects aren't wall to wall CGI and actually seem special). By delivering this after ""The Ring"" Gore Verbinksi proves he is the best for-hire/hack director working in Hollywood. He's into the old-fashioned razzle-dazzle type of film-making, you know the kind that doesn't give you a headache and has some scope and where you can actually tell what is going on in big action set pieces. He can do family films (""Mouse Hunt""), horror thrillers (""The Ring""), and now big-budget action adventures. Though he shows no signs of being an auteur or having any kind of grander scheme to his work, I can't wait to see what he tackles next.3. The film has a bloated run-time (almost two and a half hours) but it's not because it takes itself too seriously or knocks you out with set piece after set piece. You see, for the first thirty to forty minutes this film actually provides exposition and develops characters. What a novel idea! I had almost thought Hollywood forgot how to do that.4. Last, but certainly not least, Kiera Knightly. She's got spunk, she's hot, has a British accent, and some of the most natural acting chops of any young actress working today.It made me forget that it was based on a Disney theme park ride and that Big Jerry B bankrolled the whole shebang.

"Lousy poster, great movie","The poster doesn't do justice to this movie. It has single-handedly brought the genre back from the dead. Yes, the plot requires actual concentration on the details, but that's part of the fun. The pacing is fast when it needs to be; the camera can linger, too. Depp is a wonderful pirate: cocky, self-assured, disarming, dangerous, single-minded. He flouts the rules and rulers with the aplomb one expects of an outlaw. He brings a particular zest to the role that he skews in interesting directions. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann (see Maureen O'Hara in The Black Swan) is one of the few fully-realized female characters in a genre film. Her bravery and longing for adventure are clearly shown as traits held even as a child. So it's no surprise to see her reject the proper suitor and insist on meeting the pirates personally. Orlando Bloom is pretty, but pale except in one smashing fight scene. Fun, fun movie with great outtakes on the DVD. Go see it; then rent Captain Blood, Against All Flags and the Black Swan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Depp and Knightley are fun to watch, but it's not the rousing adventure I was expecting.","Rating: ** out of ****I saw the movie in the hoopla of all the hype, when most people I knew were proclaiming this one of the summer's best films. Not unexpectedly, I walked into this one with high expectations, hoping for perhaps another Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or even The Mummy. Walking out of the theater a very long two-and-a-half hours later (actually, more like 2 hours 50 minutes, given the previews and the final scene after the credits) (this movie has way too many double crosses and false climaxes), I'm not even sure if this is better than The Mummy Returns.Based off an amusement park theme ride, a lack of solid plot isn't a surprise. Orlando Bloom stars as Will Turner, a dashing blacksmith who's in madly in love with the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, a Natalie Portman look-a-like, except she's much prettier and appears to be a better actress). But when she's kidnapped by a group of ghostly pirates (led by Geoffrey Rush), Turner enlists the help of pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who appears a few cards short of a complete deck. Dark secrets are unearthed and it is revealed the undead pirates need to make a blood sacrifice to become human again.It's not that Pirates' premise doesn't hold any potential, the movie does, after all, give us the prospect of an oceanbound adventure, the kind of movies you don't see too often. But Indiana Jones on water, this is not, for it lacks all of that trilogy's infectious sense of fun and thrilling ventures into the unknown (not to mention the smart dialogue and rousing John Williams' score). If not for Johnny Depp's performance and Keira Knightley's beauty and strong screen presence, Pirates might very well have lulled me into sleep.The movie's biggest problem is its generic action sequences. Most of the swordfights are routine, directed without much flair or energy, and their bloodless presentation is just too juvenile-oriented for me. In fact, they all start to look the same after a while, so a little variety would have been appreciated. The film's one semi-creative fight, between Turner and Sparrow, is ineffective since you realize neither are in danger, and the climactic battle, pitting dozens of the undead pirates against the living, doesn't work since the fighting is done by characters I didn't give a damn about.I like the actual concept of fighting undead pirates, but most of the villains are so goofy (especially the one keeps that fake eye), it's hard to see them as an actual menace. And when they are played for laughs, they're not very funny, either (how many times can we see an eye pop out before it stops being funny?). Also, making them former mates of Sparrow's sort of demystifies them (as if their goofy behavior didn't do so already).As a pure adventure, Pirates is fraught with a lot of problems. It's repetitive, the characters keep going back and forth between the same islands and boats, sneaking in and out. The most successful adventures usually get the characters going from A to B to C, rather than A to C, then B, and then back to C, then B, and then back to C (and in this case, even back to A!). I got sick of seeing that island cavern over and over in ten minutes.But Pirates is not without merit. Its singular savior is Johnny Depp, whose introductory scene is so hilarious, I was afraid I'd choke on my laughter. Sure, some of his scenes don't work so well (like when he tries to get those two guards to distract themselves), but he's more often a blast to watch than not, and most of the scenes he's in are pretty enjoyable. I also liked Keira Knightley (almost easily the movie's best piece of eye candy when you compare her good looks with some of the goofy visual effects), who displays genuine fire and feistiness even when she's mostly played as a damsel in distress. Both performers make the best of their parts, elevating the material quite significantly (if Depp and Knightley weren't present, the movie would have gone from middling to bad in a heartbeat).Klaus Badelt's score sounds almost exactly like Hans Zimmer's work in The Rock given a period flavor. It's distracting, I spent too much time wondering in what ways Badelt would rip-off scores from Jerry Bruckheimer films. But at least it gave me an excuse to pay attention to something in-between th e scenes featuring Depp and Knightley.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Very, very good.  But not perfect.","Johnny Depp is superb.  He makes the movie, hands down, and I couldn't imagine it being anywhere near as good without his magnetic, amusing performance.The film/locations look stunning, and the story is good.  In fact, there's very little wrong with this fun adventure - the effects are superb (especially fighting in & out of the moonlight) - but I don't think it quite lives up to the hype (everyone I know said it was fantastic, but I see a lot more films than they do).First off, the pacing drags here and there (not really during scenes, but between the set-pieces).  The swordfights (and other fighting bits) are inventive, but let down by lacklustre angles and editing.And in the script, they've tried (a bit too hard) to make comedy duos out of two of the royal officers, and two of the pirates, with scenes that would fit right into a Disney cartoon but only serve to hold up the story in this live action film.  And while Geoffrey Rush is always great to watch, he just isn't evil enough.In fact, I think that's the real fault of the film - it's written as if it were a cartoon.

From start to finish i was taken on a swashbuckling adventure! It had everything that a movie should have... love, comedy, adventure, a kidnapping and cursed pirates after treasure. The film was mainly carried by the fantastic Johnny Depp... playing the slightly drunk Captain Jack Sparrow who's main mission in the film is to get back his ship 'the Black Pearl'. However, he ends up taking on board Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) a blacksmith who is in love with the Governers daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). Elizabeth is kidnapped by Pirates and it is up to Jack and Will to save her. However the Pirates are cursed and are neither living nor dead...they must repay their blood otherwise they will be cursed forever. So as you can see there is a lot to go by on the film. Can Jack Sparrow be trusted? Will they reach Elizabeth before it is too late? Will the pirates ever be rid of the dreaded curse? Watch this film as it is perfect for anyone! This film is one of the best epics every made! Watch it...you will not be disappointed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the Top 250!  I don't think so..........,"I thoroughly enjoyed this very clever movie. It's a fun ride and I really did appreciate Depp's unusual character.That said, this is no masterpiece. It is, rather, a very enjoyable and expertly done piece of fluff and a rather long advert for Disneyland. It's basically a lovingly rendered rehash of all the well-known clichés of 80 years of swashbuckler films with a bit of ""Sinbad the Sailor"" thrown in. This is like Ray Harryhausen (all hail!) would have done had he CGI tools at his disposal.Pirates of the Caribbean is fine entertainment and it's certainly a far better movie than the recent Star Wars efforts. But it's no masterpiece. It pales in the wake of classic swashbucklers like ""Captain Blood"" (Errol Flynn) or ""Treasure Island"" (the one with Jackie Cooper and the Disney one with Robert Newton), or even the recent ""Master and Commander"".Let's put POTC in the ""fantasy"" category. Within that context I would rate it much higher than within this TOP 250 FILMS category. It is a great fantasy film.As a ""spoof"" it's not in the same class as ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Young Frankenstein"" or ""Love and Death"", but it's very close and a job well done.Good film. Rent it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"fork in eye, knife in concept","Yes, dear Disney fans your dreams have come true. Your youth can be prolonged. There is an other formula that will turn the average adult into a giggling teenager. I have seen it happen in a big cinema in my city. Mature folk that went hysterical by the dozen as flying cutlery landed in eyeballs. Please man, stop it! Go see a flick to get out of the daily routine, but please stay a bit critical. Just for the record: These words do not sprout from the mind of a bitter person, but from a bitterly disappointed one. Once again a great concept has been completely overdone in the wrong direction. It has been said before and that does strengthen me to discuss it one more. This genre is weirdly annoying 'the portrayal of gruesome (in this case 18th century buccanic) violence combined with Uncle Walts very own vision on slapstick'. What is the message and who is supposed to be addressed? Is made for big children or for small adults? In one way you might say that in works for those you have a good time watching this film. In an other way I would like to take great distance from exactly those people over 18 that reward this flick with anything over a 4. Hereby I do so, bunch of gullible kid souls. I declare I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. My mistake, 'cause I had wrongfully set my sights on something like Mutiny On The Bounty (1962 and 1984) meets Master And Commander(2003).",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie,"This was one of the best movie that I have ever seen! I didn't see this film at the cinema, but I really wish I had because it has instantly become one of my favorite movies of all time. I bought the DVD because I'd heard good things about the movie, and I've been to both Disneyland Paris, and Disneyland Florida and loved the Pirates ride at both of them. Having been on the ride, it's quite easy to spot many things in the movie that pay tribute to the ride, especially in the town scenes. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the movie, but I definitely didn't expect to laugh so much! This movie has such a wonderful combination of excellent acting, astounding special effects, and dry humor. Johnny Depp steals practically every scene he occupies, and Geoffrey Rush is excellent and sinister in his villainous turn. It's about as high-quality fun as one might demand in a summer blockbuster, and will have you singing ""Yo ho, ho ho"" for days and days to come. A ""pirate's life"" is plenty the life in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", an worthy, intelligent sea-faring adventure guaranteed to leave you, at the very least, plenty satisfied.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great movie!!!,"When the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was released, I was really looking forward to watching this movie. However, I finally managed to watch it many months later and I LOVED it!It's a breath-taking movie, with an interesting plot and great performances from the actors. Although the movie is a little bit long, nobody can get bored while watching it. What I liked most -and I think most people liked- is Johnny Depp's performance. He was GREAT, he perfectly played the role of Jack Sparrow and whenever he appeared, he was ""breaking"" the ""gravity"" that prevailed in the movie and turned everything more pleasant and funny, by reminding us that he's a really great actor, something he has already proved many times so far.Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were also very good and proved that they are two talented actors. However, they are still quite young and I personally think that their performances seemed rather indifferent, comparing to Geoffrey Rush's and Johnny Depp's.To sum up: I found this a great movie and anyone who hasn't watched it yet, he should definitely buy the DVD!Finally: Many people say it's a good movie, while others disagree. However, there is one point that nobody can doubt: Even if you are not a fan of such movies, it's worth watching just for Johnny Depp!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great Movie, Love It!!","I think that this is one of the best movies that i have ever seen. I own it on DVD and watch it every time that i get the chance. I can not wait for the next one. Hopefully it is as good as the first, but i have no doubts. Johnny Depp is a great actor and he plays the part of Jack Sparrow well. Orlando Bloom is great too. I think that all the actors played a big part in making the movie and they put it all together and made it come to life. Thanks to everyone involved!! The next one sounds really good and as soon as it comes out i am going to gather up all of my friends and we are going to go see it in theater. It is going to be really fun and i hope that it comes out soon because i can't wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
B Adventure surrounds excellent performance by Depp,"This is an excellently made movie except for the script. There is one pleasurable twist, but that is not enough to carry the already predictable plot. Also, there are many lines which detract from the adventure and make it almost as much a comedy. That's fine if done in moderation (in my opinion), but this is done to excess and makes the movie appear more as a kid's adventure flick than an attempt at making a story.This movie is only worth watching to see Depp's performance. Johnny Depp is superb as Capt. Jack Sparrow - utterly convincing. Yet the rest of the cast seems contrived and fail to carry any weight. They act as if this is a ""made for TV movie."" It could be the directing, but then how would one explain the same directing that Depp received?The mechanical special effects were ok (6/10), while the rest: production, lighting, photography were excellent(9/10) and the computer graphics were superb (10/10). They brought something new to computer graphics - well articulated skeletons as well as the immediate switching between body and bones in different light. Overall, in my opinion, the movie earned a 7/10.-ZafoidPS: A slight node to political correctness occurs in a few scenes thus downgrading the already flawed movie. Definitely see it for Depp.-Z",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Ahoy mateys, this be one cool movie!","Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! That's what I feel like having watched ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl""! I have to admit that I don't know any other pirate movies, but this one gives the genre the best possible name. It's mainly due to Johnny Depp's ultra-neat role as swashbuckler Jack Sparrow, but there's other things too.It all begins when a little girl retrieves a medallion from a boy; she doesn't realize just how important this particular medallion is! Several years later, we see that this now grown-up girl is Elizabeth Swann (the ever gorgeous Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter. Unfortunately, that's when the pirates led by Capt. Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) storm the town and take Elizabeth hostage.Enter Jack Sparrow and his brave companion Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). These guys may be oddballs, but boy do they know how to fight pirates! Depp based his characterization on Keith Richards (yes, THE Keith Richards), and he plays the role to great effect. ""POTC: TCOTBP"" is a real treat from beginning to end. Gore Verbinski is proving himself to be a very interesting director, with this movie - plus ""Mouse Hunt"" and ""The Ring"" - to his credit. Now that I've seen this movie, I almost might like to try out a little swashbuckling myself. A pirate's life just might be the life for me...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Swashbuckling good time,"I half expected Errol Flynn to appear at any time. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley head a fine cast in this rollicking adventure about a cursed pirate crew and their quest to undo the curse. I don't want to give the story away too much, but suffice it to say that Bloom figures prominently if unwillingly in that quest. Plenty of action and adventure along with excellent at-sea shots make this a well executed film. All in all, a great time!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A tale of love, war and power","Oh and what a movie this is. There is something for everyone in the family with this movie, romance, action, drama, horror, adventure and fantasy. A quality of acting rivaling no other movie in recent times, except for the Rings trilogy, but that's another thing altogether. I have watched this movies so many times that I can't even keep track. This movie never gets boring. Johnny Depp is at the top of this career with this film!! A must see, many times over. A true classic! The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle. He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead. He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself. The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez. With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after. Well, not exactly like that but almost. This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film.

Over rated.,"The Pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the black pearl, is  a very good film. Everything in this film is quite outstanding, but lets face it, people are starting to get over obsessed with this film and calling it ""The best"". I don't think it deserves to be in the TOP 250, and in a better number than IN America, Henry the Va and 21 Grams. Johnny Depp's performance is very good, funny and realistic, however, it didn't deserved an Oscar nomination. The OSCARS should pick the best performances for the nomination, but Johnny's performance was not that great.

"Good Plot, Good Actors, Amazing Movie","I must say when I first watched this movie, I loved it, I loved the plot, music, characters, and the actors. The actors are so good in this movie that I surprised that they were even acting, and pretending to be like the people in the movie. Johnny Depp really did his best in this one, and I was not even the smallest surprised that he did an amazing job in this movie. Seriously, if they picked anyone else for the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, then I would not like this movie, and no one else would like it. Everyone I know believes so, and no one yet has stepped up and said something about changing the actor for Captain Jack Sparrow.The writers did an amazing job with the script, but obviously Johnny Depp did a little improv while acting this role. Very good improv at that. All the other actors where good too, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, and Geoffory Rush, which happened to also be one of my favorite characters in the movie also. Oh yes, the role of Barbossa really knocked me in the head. His acting was almost as good as Johnny Depp's. The way he looked and talked just freaked the hell out of me and I just wanted to scream my lungs out.The special effects in this movie also got me too, the way the Skeletons look when the moon rises really got me. The special effects people did an amazing job at that, as well as the Make-Up people. Putting Make-Up on Johnny must of been tiring for both him and the people, as his role had a lot to do with that. I for one would not like it at all, I can't even handle 2 days of it.10/10, most people would agree that this movie is very stunning, and well done.

The best movie to be created....,"This movie tops them all with AMAZING direction, AMAZING moods, AMAZING music and mostly AMAZING OF ALL AMAZINGS... acting! I have the biggest passion for Johnny Depp and thought this was the most hilarious role to have him play. He did it flawlessly! and he's so hot! Just an added bonus. Orlando Bloom was probably at his best in this movie as well, and because i don't really like him at all, that is definitely a huge compliment to say the least. And if all i told you about this movie is that it was produced by Jerry Bruckhiemer, then you would automatically know it is something worth watching. From The Amazing Race, to CSI, Jerry Bruckhiemer produces everything worth watching. And don't get me started on the flawlessly beautifully talented Keira Knightly. She is beautiful, has the cutest accent and is extremely talented!

I shoulda known it was going to be good.,"I didn't see this movie till it came out on DVD back 2 years ago.I regretted not seeing it in theaters, because I kept thinking it'll suck, because it didn't look like it be anything similar to the ride at Disneyland.But I was surprised to see that it's a very well done action movie. And surprised that it's even done by Disney. Cause it's not the common Family Friendly movie you'd find from Disney.The movie of course takes place in the Caribbean and during the 16th or 17th Century era. Which is when pirates ruled the 7 seas. A ship was sailing across the Atlantic which came across a wreckage of another ship. With only one passenger who is a young boy named Will Turner. Who had a gold medallion in his position. A girl named Elizabeth noticed the medallion to be pirate related so she took it and hid it from the ship's crew so that way they wouldn't think that Will is a pirate.8 years later Elizabeth is more grown up and Will is a blacksmith who makes and repairs swords for the army of the seaport town of Cape Royal. Life was very calm and peaceful till Jack Sparrow came ashore of Cape Royal. He is not your average pirate and he's very well known throughout the Caribbean. And there's a lot more to his back story than there seem to be.The medallion that Elizabeth holds is the key to breaking the curse of the pirates of the black pearl.I gotta admit i did like it quite a bit. I just wish I knew it was going to be a must see movie. It had action, great special effects, plenty of humor in some parts, and great characters to know while watching the movie.It's also unlike the common pirate movies you'd see anywhere else. Which is because it's a modern day made pirate movie. Those who are obsess with the ride might enjoy this movie a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun, but not much of anything new","Elizabeth Swan is captured by the pirates of the Black Pearl. Captain Jack Sparrow and Will Turner go out to save her.As you can see, the storyline is nothing new. To add to that, Pirates of the Caribbean had no inspiration, except for a Disney ride, so you can't expect anything extraordinary. The movie, however, does offer some pirate sword-fighting, adventure, and funny lines to make up for that. However, the adventure isn't enough to hold the weights of a close-to-two-hour-experience.The movie is fun, but forgettable to some people, and drags on too much for more people.

"Finally, some entertainment","This film has several good reasons to go and see it:1) It's funny, exciting well worth seeing.2) Its got Johnny Depp. Reason enough. You'll like Jack Sparrow far more than Will Turner, I can guarantee that.3) Geoffrey Rush. Again, enough reason to see it. I wouldn't call him frightening, just scarily cool, dark and ugly. Very different role to the voice over of Nigel the Pelican.If you like him 4) Orlando Bloom... not good reason. He's pretty. Can't say much else about him though. He was better in Lord of the Rings. He's better being silent, elf-like and graceful.5) Keira Knightley... *shudders*... is better off playing people like Jules in Bend It Like Beckham: half friendly and half bitchy. Bizarre face: she's got a dazzling smile but a really pinched disgusted look the rest of the time. Not the best choice foe Elizabeth Swann.6) Johnny Depp again.7) It's fun. Really.

Delivers the goods,"""Pirates"" is a fun adventure film that breaks out of its ""based on a Disneyland ride"" chains and delivers a near-perfect summer family blockbuster.The film is aided tremendously by the casting, especially Depp and Geoffrey Rush. All of the performances are very good, and it adds immeasurably to the quality of the film. The production is also very well done, right up to the great visual effects. However, one let down was the music, which features a pounding quality heard in many Bruckheimer action films.The characters are brought to life with the skill of the ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Harry Potter"" movies, yet somehow the overall film seems to be just a few notches of ""The Mummy"" and ""Tomb Raider"" movies. Unlike the latter movies, however, it seems a sequel or two could really help lift ""Pirates"" out of that same category and into the heights reached by ""Indiana Jones"".The verdict: about as good of a summer blockbuster as could be hoped for.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Starts off great but quickly becomes tedious,"I'm not much of a fan of Disney movies, pirates and Johnny Depp so I was really reluctant to see this Disney flick. I was pleasantly surprised by how the movie started. I was actually riveted, by the funny action and the amazing performance of Depp. Like I said, I'm not a Depp fan and I usually can't stand him in anything but as Jack Sparrow, Depp is totally amazing. Depp created a real character here, no matter how campy he is. Unfortunately, once the pirates invade the port and the story concentrated on them, the film became really tedious and I didn't care about anything. The film should have concentrated more on Sparrow and the two other characters. The pirates, or ghosts, are devices and it's almost impossible to care for them. The story became sillier and sillier and Depp, who's the ONLY good thing in this movie, went missing for long periods of time. Bloom and the actress were pretty much flat. And this film is very LONG!!! Oh well...",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Jolly Good Pirate Fun!,"I watched this while babysitting my neighbor's kids ages 9 and 12. They liked it a lot, I thought it was okay. I got a little bored about half-way but not enough to turn it off, I wanted to see how they would wrap it all up.It has some neat effects and the story line is pretty good, every kid wonders what it would be like to do something amazing. The acting was pretty good, especially from Johnny Depp he delivers an excellent performance. The beautiful Keira Knightley delivers a good but not great performance and so does eye candy Orlando Bloom. I think that this movie is a good movie for Keira Knightley's future career, she is a beautiful young actress that has a lot of potential. I thinks that she would be in many of the future ""big"" movies! I also think that Orlando Bloom would become a big actor, but I don't think that he will become bigger than Keira Knightley. Well this wasn't the greatest pirate movie ever told, but the potential for it to be above average is definitely there. I went into this movie expecting it to suck right up there with one of those crazy Lampoon type spoofs of a movie, not to mention something that was just for kids. I was totally wrong. Me being a 18 year old adult found it to be quite humorous and quite exciting in most parts. Johnny Depp, in my opinion was cast perfectly for the role. Of course I tend to be a bit biased when it comes to good ol' Johnny( I loved him in Edward Scissorhands). He definitely shines in all of his performances and will blossom into one of the great actors of the upcoming generation. As far as this movie goes, its all about having fun, and that's exactly what Johnny accomplished with this film... hail Jack Sparrow (Johnny). When I took my cousin out to see ""Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl"", I fully expected to be bored and go away hoping that at least the children enjoyed it... boy, was I surprised! Johnny Depp played a great pirate, and Keira Knightley was a cute rich girl. I thought it was really funny and full of action, and my cousin thought it was ""really cool!"" It's a creative family flick...fun for the whole family. (Even I enjoyed it!) I think this movie will be on every kid's top ten for a while to come...as for me, I'll be waiting for a sequel.  I know what you're thinking, and you're right. Keira Knightley's acting really doens't leave much to be desired, but the witty script, good lead from Johnny Depp and excellent fighting make this a must see. A great movie. I liked ""Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl"". It was cool, funny, thrilling, and had a lot of action. Although I am a big fan of Keira Knightley's and was disappointed at her acting in this movie. Sure, she was great in ""The Hole"" but in this movie I found her to be a bit over-the-top. I know Keira could've done better than that. On the other hand, Johnny Depp did great playing Captain Jack Sparrow. Keira's clothes weren't really appropriate for a PG movie. But I thought this movie was a little bit too intense for a PG and for little kids under the age of 7 to watch. Some of the violence was just a tiny bit intense. In one scene they show Will running his hand up Elizabeth's chest, but I don't think it was meant in a sexual way, and some woman show cleavage and look like prostitutes.  But I still recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it, you should!!Pirates of the Carribean :Curse of the Black Pearl has an interesting premise even if at first I was a little cautious about it. But we must look at it from the right point of view, meaning like a kid would. Who never wished to be to be a pirate? Even today I think about it.Johnny Depp is perfect for the role. He represents a feisty pirate captain. Orlando Bloom is also great as his tough, icy partner. The amazingly beautiful Keira Knightley however suffers from a huge lack of screen time. Her acting could also be better and we can clearly notice the girl has a huge ego. With her looks she can go far no doubt about it. But she has to be a little humble and be ready to learn. I'm not sure that is the case. With full knowledge of the power of her physical side she appears not the least interested and I would say even bored throughout the movie.The story is simple and without a touch of reality to it, just like it was supposed to be. The humor however could be more efficient. Some jokes, maybe too many, fall flat. The action could also have been improved. It's not even close to spectacular. The opening scene is very attractive but then all we get is some explosions and a few swashbuckling fights. There's also some violence, but nothing too extreme.POTC:COTBP has some flaws. Its slow to build, some scenes fail miserably and sometimes its just too stupid.But since I'm not in its target audience. not anymore, I would recommend it because I still enjoyed it very much. It has a light, childish atmosphere that works very well and provides an innocent fun. This was a very entertaining film for anyone of any age. It had cool action, and good special effects. Johnny Depp was good as Jack and was excellent at playing the beautiful Elizabeth Swann. When Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce) is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the young man who loves Elizabeth despite the fact that she is promised to another, sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight. When it is revealed that the only thing that can break the curse is Elizabeth's blood, Jack and Will are faced with a race against time and a battle against the undead to save the Governor's daughter.Perfect Film to take the whole family to. This was also pretty funny. Very good action/family/comedy/pirate movie.Loved this movie! Saw a free sneak preview and would pay to see it again. Johnny Depp was crazy/wonderful as usual. Funny, creative, handsome, surprising - as he always is.Orlando Bloom was like a young Errol Flynn. He was a dream in Lord of the Rings and this proves that was no fluke. He can act, he's good to look at - has a sweet personality and the physicality to carry the role. The swordplay between Bloom and Depp was terrific!Geoffrey Rush pushed the envelope at being wonderfully hammy and the rest of the cast was simply great.Beautifully visual, a bit too long, but worth the ride. And I mean Ride!Really cool! 8.5/10I liked the action parts and the skeleton pirates. If you think of yourself in place of the actors,it helps you get a feeling of how the actor were.There is also romance at the end of the movie.I would recommend this movie.Went to see this on a rainy evening on vacation with my cousin. They loved it, and my parents and I enjoyed the experience too.Depp is an excellent lead - charming and likable, and the other cast members are well cast. Interesting story, good dialog, pretty decent special effects, great pace and length - what more could one ask for?AND IT'S NOT JUST ANOTHER FREAKING PIRATE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
excellent,"What can i say?, its a brilliant movie. Casting is just right, especially with the fantastic Mr.Depp, he outshone everyone, and also gave the movie its humour, The story line was very original, and an ended most people wouldn't of expected. The special effects were very well done, especially the pirates turning into Skeletons, and looked very scary at parts.Jeffery Rush, also acted brilliantly with his part as the evil captain Barbossa, and orlando bloom as the young man, falling n love and what he would do for love. All i can say is i cant wait for the next movie and i bet it will be even better then the first.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic Film You Cant Miss It ! ! !,"This film is absolutely mind-blowing!I watched it the first time and was very impressed with Johnny Depps performance as Captain Jack Sparrow.He really put his effort into this film and suited the part very well.I was also impressed with Keira Knightleys performance as Elizebeth Swann she too suited the part very well.I am very glad that Pirates of the Caribbean 2 is coming out next year!!!!I think that the beginning was fantastic and introduced the characters well.The storyline as a whole was very impressive.This film is fun of laughter,romance,action and a lot of drama!This is a film you have got to watch!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun and Original,"For some time now I have been putting this movie down because it didn't seem to appealing to me when I first heard about it. Now, I know, I was so wrong to say I didn't want to see it. One reason was because I knew the sequel was on the horizon and that I felt I should see the first in order to get a sense of what Pirates was all about. I loved just about every aspect of this film. The acting was great and the story had so much to tell that I never felt like the film was long just for the sake of being long. Johnny Depp played a great pirate and so did Orlando Bloom, only in the latter part did he really shine though. The story is pretty simple but is an old tale that people of all ages will react to, for some time, as they always have. The effects were not over the top and they were done to a point where I thought I wouldn't care if I could tell the difference between live action and CG. The only thing I felt to be off balance was some of the Disney dumbness, that plagues most Disney movies and was probably put in at the request of Disney to make it more audience friendly. Overall I felt that I saw a movie and not some action flick with no backbone....ie(STORY). When I was finished, the movie gave me a sense of pride I have not had in a long time when I watch film. I have seen something I will never forget.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Depp is made for this role!,"Such a great movie. Great story with lots of fun elements to the film. Think the story is a bit cliche however it works perfectly and is made really well.Johnny Depp is made for this role he embodies Captain Jack Sparrow so well. His nonchalant energy that he brings to the character makes all of his lines comedic and great.I think that the love affair between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan is a bit cringe for me, but does not take away from the brilliance of the movie. I am a big fan of Orlando Bloom as an actor and the flair he brings to his action scenes really enhances the character of Will Turner.I also think that the cgi is quite cool especially with the live skeletons which have aged well through the years.Overall, I think this is a great movie that can be enjoyed by all. It's a timeless movie that does not diminish in its quality the more you watch it. Highly recommend this!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Johnny Depp Perfect!!!,"Magnificent! I will start off with the one problem so that I can end by thrashing it with compliments: Too long. If they had just cut out all the crap in the scenes which made this movie so long it would've gotten a perfect 10 from me (I gave it a 9). But anyway, no movie is perfect. To the compliments, Jack Sparrows (Johnny Depp) was out of this world. His performance was just outstanding. No one in my opinion could have done the role better and I could probably find a better person for the role of just about every main role in a movie except this one. The way he says things are the kind of jokes that make you laugh in your head and think about what and outstanding movie it is without laughing out loud. It's like when you go a movie with someone and you don't hear them laugh once but when they come out they say it was the funniest movie they've ever seen it's because the jokes are the kind that if you laugh out loud you're going to sound crazy. That's what all comedies look for and this one got it right with Johnny Depp.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awesome...,"...the thing about this movie is... if you haven't seen the ride, it's cool. But if you have seen the ride, even better.What I would like to know, however, is does this mean that there are going to be movies made from every single one of Disney's rides? And then, will rides again be spawned from the movies?So we're stuck in a never ending cycle of Disney-to ride-To Movie-back to ride.. and so on...Does anyone know of any other Disney rides being turned into movies?Does anyone know of any other themepark rides that were turned into movies?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing,"Wow. Originally I thought this movie wouldn't be so great, but after I saw it, I realized how stupid I had been. This movie is fantastic. It's Romantic, funny, a little scary, historical, and, of course, action packed. Is there any genre this movie ISN'T? The plot and characters are well-developed, and It's the kind of movie that you just want to see over and over again. And, it seems to get better every time I see it (approximately 10 times)! The only flaw is the fact that if bootstrap bill had in fact taken a piece of gold (which we know he did; he sent it to Will) then he would have been affected by the curse. And..If he was affected by the curse, he would be immortal. So...How did launching him off a cannon into the ocean kill him? I guess that's why there's a ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2""... I can't wait. As Captain Jack Sparrow might say, ""Go see this movie. Savvy?""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Money down the Drain,"Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl - The movie is as aimless as the tittle. Pirates attack a settlement known as Port Royal and capture the town's governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), as they believe that she is the one who can remove a curse set upon them. They lug her aboard the Black Pearl, their ominous sailing ship. In a prison in a battered garrison in Port Royal, William Turner (Orlando Bloom) makes arrangements to free Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), A captive, and some-what idiotic pirate, in exchange for his aid to rescue Miss Elizabeth Swann, the woman who William is madly in love with. Along the way, there are many sword fights, but as this movie is a pirate one, viewers will expect a major death. Sadly there are none. Most of the time it miraculously stops or those cursed pirates never die, because they're practically undead. Many of the fights are absolutely retarded and pointless, with no purpose what so ever, except just to allow this movie to be classified under a pirate theme. The director, Gore Verbinski, made a horrific effort to add suspense, and about the only scary thing in the film is a cursed monkey!The characters, although interesting at first impression, soon get boring and ridiculous! Jack Sparrow has a major speech impediment, always looks like he's drunk 24/7 and seems to have hands that don't look connected to his wrists! His opening scene where viewers first catch a gimps of Jack was quite comical, but his later acts were plain, foolish. It's impossible to believe that such a pirate could even be conceived! The actor Johnny Depp played a magnificent part, but it's Disney's lack in concept to produce a more credible character, which unfortunately destroyed the feel of a real pirate film. The character William Turner was an even bigger let down. His jokes are dry to the bone, at best they my cause a chuckle. His character's desires are typical of what modern movies are about. All of this was made worst with the selection of actor to play the role. Orlando Bloom's parts in the film were particularly weak and lacking in emphasis, as you felt that Jack Sparrow was more important then the less adventurous blacksmith Will.The few good things about, The Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl are the tunes and the CGI effects. These are the only factors that keep the viewer from going to sleep! The music is on the dot, particularly when you see beautiful long shots of the surroundings. You'll get butterflies in you stomach, similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, when you witness the sight of the Computer Generated Images! Since the cursed pirates can only take the undead form in certain conditions, the lighting, and shadow effects make these images top-notch.This film is better of to just have CGI pirates walking around, raiding random ships, then to have poorly thought of characters, residing in the picture. There is too much that has been added to the film, and the mambo-jumbo comedy, action, thriller, love story, adventure theme is just a missive cliché of genres. The attempt made by Disney to have a classical family movie was a disastrous shamble! Millions of dollars have been wasted, down drain on actors who don't even suit the characters. I strongly recommend no one see this monstrous movie, as viewers would also be throwing away their money down the drain.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Brace the main sail, shiver your timbers and prepare to set sail.","In a time where movies of this type had practically disappeared or bombed badly at the box office (Cut Throat Island springs to mind), it is nice to see Hollywood once again embracing this classic genre.Despite suffering from a mild case of over hype, this is actually a very good movie, mixing in modern day film making with the classic pirate yo ho ho's without getting all lost at sea (Da-Dum!!)Johnny Depp plays the lovable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow who along with the dashing Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom, sail the Caribbean Seas to stop a ship of pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Rush) and his crew, who are trying to break an ancient curse... by using the blood of the Governor's daughter (Knightly)From the outset the film is light hearted and playful in tone giving it an old fashioned boys own adventure' feel without coming across as camp. The set design, locations and costumes are fantastic and really help to set the scene and create the atmosphere.The story is told well and although getting bottle necked at times, keeps a jaunty pace. There is plenty of swash buckling sword fights and sea bound action, plus some effective if sometimes overused computer driven effects to create the cursed pirates.All of the main performances are strong. Bloom is fresh faced and as charming as a modern day Douglas Fairbanks (if sometimes too much of a goody goody), Knightly is beautiful and compelling, adding a touch of glamour and Rush is superbly extravagant and plays his part with a good sense of fun.However all are very nearly played off the screen by Depp as Sparrow, a fantastic character who is swaggered, eccentrically unrefined, wiley, self-promoting and loveably roguish. This is one of Depp's more funny and notable performances making the film worth watching for him alone.I have no doubt that we will see more of Captain Sparrow in the future and I will look forward to it as POTC was head and shoulders above the rest in a summer of disappointing blockbusters.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Though supposedly a movie for Orlando Bloom....,"A movie that was suppose to have Orlando as lead, is taken by my beloved Johnny Depp. I have been a fan of his since I can't even remember how far back. I not only drool over him, his talent is true and original. How many sexy males do you know that would or could pull off a very believable rendition of a punk-rock pirate named Jack Sparrow. The plot is almost perfectly mending to all genre's and pulls anyone in by its diverse levels of movie goers. If you like action, comedy, and anything with Johnny Depp, this is the one to see. I recommend other Johnny Depp movies, and that you keep watch on Keira Knightly, and Orlando Bloom for other upcoming movies to see that they are savvy actors and actresses.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Need more Disney like this.,"This movie works so well on a variety of levels. Despite being so outlandish, Depp's pirate is clever, creative and believable ... except that he doesn't seem like he'd ever be able to back down a crew of pirates; to wit, his crew abandoned him on a desert island. That he could come back over and and over would create respect in many and, sometimes, those who seem craziest are most feared, so perhaps he could do it.Verbinski knows what he's doing but I wish so much of the movie hadn't rested on Depp's shoulders. That being said, it still works beautifully and Depp's acting is spot on. I guess it comes down to this: When you're watching the movie it can be totally absorbing and any criticisms spring to mind only when the lights are up and I've moved on to other things. I've seen the movie several times and get sucked in every time. If I were to judge a movie only by my thoughts after it's over, that wouldn't be fair. I believe you have to judge a movie mostly by what's on your mind during it and give much less criticism after wards.

A true legend,"I was a huge fan of The Pirates of the Caribbean long before the movie, so I was very nervous--would the movie do justice to the attraction? Or would it be another stinky pirate movie? The first time I saw it, though, I knew it would be a hit. The casting was perfect, the music spectacular, the special effects astounding, the story intriguing--this was as close to a perfect movie as I have seen in a long time. It's great fun, making you laugh, gasp, hold your breath, cheer, and sigh, and it appeals to all ages--I even heard grandmothers commenting on how adorable Johnny Depp was! It's not surprising that we've seen more of Keira Knightly, who gave quite a twist to the ""damsel in distress"" role. Orlando Bloom was a pleasure to look at, but his character was the only ""cardboard"" one of the lot. He did OK, and at times was great, but overall he was just overshadowed by Captain Jack, whereas the other characters seemed to hold their own. Maybe he was tired from fighting trolls (Lord of the Rings)? I've seen the movie a good two dozen times now, and it just never gets old, mostly thanks to Depp, who so deserved the Oscar for his performance. Maybe he'll manage it with one of the two sequels. Even if he doesn't, though, this will be one of his best roles ever, and it's truly a movie that everyone involved can be proud of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates! What's not to love?,"I guess I am a bit of a nut when it comes to pirates, but there simply aren't enough films that depict this brilliantly caricatured era.Pirates of the Carribbean adds to the mix a tad of supernatural elements and makes a very standard plot into a fun adventure by adding several memorable characters. The special-effects add to the feeling of the film, but at no point does the film become too big. There's no plot to conquer the world. Everything in the film is very down to earth and personal.Johnny Depp naturally adds to the film with his brilliant performance as Jack Sparrow, possibly one of the most original characters I've seen in a long while. He's become one of my favorites alongside such figures as Darth Vader, Bond and Riddick.A very nicely done adventure. Brilliant movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
2003: From LOTR to POTC...,"The history of blockbusters fantasy epic movie franchises is just a series of new beginnings and so the glorious year 2003 was marked by the conclusion of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and the beginning of another, Gore Verbinski ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", the common denominator was Orlando Bloom who had the classical profile of the Hollywood young actor, but he wasn't the star. It was Johnny Depp.Now, when modern movies for the whole Hollywood old-fashioned way, their success then depend on various factors but having the right cast always means that half the job is done. And from that starting point, since the film is no serious melodrama, it can get away with two good castings: the hero and the villain (obviously). And allow me to state that as a mathematical certainty, for a good portion, the film is as good as Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are... I'll cover the remaining portion after.As Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp surely delivers a performance that is not great because it's spectacular but because it's not; he plays a pirate who doesn't need to show it off, to chew the script as if he meant to make that clear for a 7-year-old M&Ms cruncher (not the film's target anyway). And so the more you underestimate him, the better.. I like that subdued approach and I guess Depp has such a predisposition to tone it down when it comes to over-the-top characters, it ends up bringing the right balance. It's precisely because he was good at Sparrow that maybe Depp's cheerful energy ran out of battery and gave that disastrous Willy Wonka.To the villain now. I feared it would be the predictable rival in the dashing but boring Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), you know the clean-cut straitlaced no-nonsense officer who already acts like the chosen fiancé of governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and is so confident he even treats the high-ranked father (Jonathan Pryce) like a lackey.... He gets along with the role but in the film, he's a cardboard character and nothing new after ""Titanic"" (maybe he'll get two additional dimensions in the sequels). No, the real villain is Geoffrey Rush as Barbarossa, the former mutineer who stole -with the Black Pearl- a treasure full of gold coins, they belonged to Cortes and struck the Black Pearl with a curse, turning the crew into skeletons, ghouls and monsters at moonlight. Naturally, I was more interested in daylight Rush.Rush is over the top, going all ""aaargh"" in his role and it's again the right tone, in the way it completes Depp, Rush not only made me believe he could be a pirate, even with his borderline cartoonish attitude, but he made me believe he could be a rival and former ally to Sparrow Once you believe in that, the film works. It's obvious that the other pirates are secondary and their main purpose is to show their ugly yellow teeth, their rude and crass manners, one running gag involve one with a glass eye that keeps popping out and makes a weird rubber-sound, there's no hook or pegleg but there's Kevin R. McNally as Joshamee Gibbs and Zoe Seldana who save the day by being a little more than a 'colorful' presence... the parrot comes in close thirdI should mention Keira Knightley who's never disappointed me but here seems to have picked the wrong angle, she plays her part as if she was in ""The Duchess"" or ""Pride and Prejudice"", she's good in the sense that she gives a good performance but she doesn't feel like the Marian for Robin Hood, maybe the film didn't bring these romantic vibes we could sense between her and Will Turner (Bloom) and assumed we'd take it for granted... because both are young and beautiful. So many things in fact happen in the film that it didn't need to be sidetracked by a romance.The real problem with the film is that it's based on a Disneyland ride and it's just too long and I'm not saying ""long"" because there were boring parts but I'm among those who have an inner resistance to fantasy and I don't understand why they needed to rely on supernatural elements. In a universe where anything is possible, the swashbuckling effect loses its appeal and the stakes are diminished, especially when the notions of lives and deaths are being toyed with... it all comes down to pirates being fearless not because they are trained that way but because they are immortal. If the film follow the pirates tropes to the bone but ultimately it's a fantasy story.It's still effective as an action picture with some great shots, spectacular stunts that don't rely much on CGI, and little performances so good they didn't have be drowned in an overlong film. Anyway roughly two decades ago, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was the bless of Johnny Depp's career before he'd be cursed by his black amber... it took me as many decades to decide myself to watch the first film, I'm not in a rush to watch the sequels...... and here concludes my 1900th review.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Those Old Sea Pirates in All of Us,"This movie is a very funny romanticization of those Pirates of the Caribbean during the early 1700s, yet touches a deep & wonderful sense of adventure in us even now.The sea ""pirate"" that is Captain Jack Sparrow is that childlike spirit that lives in all of us - ""despite all the evidence to the contrary"" - and has its source beyond and without any definition of worldly authorization. J.R.R.Tolkien had a saying - ""not all who wander are lost"".And another truly great thing about this movie - it is not in the least pretentious or heavy handed nor does it wallow in personal issues like so many self-important films today.'Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl' is just one very cool, well made and fun movie!!p.s.if you liked this Pirate flick - another kind of 'pirate' in our more contemporary times (1992) that you might enjoy and might want to check out is 'Captain Ron' (as in the movie with Kurt Russell).

Great Film,"Gore Verbinski follows up The Ring with this incredible family film. Johnny Depp turns in another incredible performance that should get a laugh out of everyone. This is the type of incredible family adventure/comedy that should be a favorite of the youth in this generation as The Princess Bride was for those before it. Both movies give you that good feeling and have that quality where you never get sick of watching it and hearing the lines over and over. This is a film that everyone should see a couple of times, just to enjoy the pure fun it has to offer. The great film was a surprise to me, since I knew it was based off of a Disney ride and I thought it was going to be a film for kids, but it is definitely something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Captain Jack Sparrow is the pathetic yet savvy and smooth pirate that you can't help rooting for. Orlando Bloom is the one actor I don't particularly care for in any movie, but he doesn't bother me in this one. Geoffry Rush is cast perfectly and the special effects are nice.

Fear of a Black Pearl Planet,"So many things could have gone wrong with this film. (And to hear tale from some of the commentary, many did). I mean c'mon...four writers create a script based upon a theme park ride? This could have all the charm of a film based on a video game like such classics as ""Super Mario Brothers"" and ""Street Fighter.""Now to be fair I haven't seen either of those nor ever will, but neither had Johnny Depp at the helm. Much has been made about his swishbuckling here, but I dare anyone to see this and not keep his/her eye on the Sparrow. In the commentary, he and director Gore Verbinski talked about some of Depp's original ideas for the character...including a prosthetic nose. Hmmm, maybe that's where the Keith Richards' idea originated? To see the best use of a faux nose so far, see Vincent D'Onofrio in the excellent ""Salton Sea.""But back to these high seas, high crime and high entertainment. Look the ride itself had to be made suitably accommodating to put a lot of different butts in seats, and so was this film. But think of all the other action/adventure blockbusters that simply went bust.I recently saw ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" which despite Alan Moore's impetus wound up extremely ordinary. And we had to elect Schwarzenegger as governor just to prevent him from making any more films after ""The Rise of the Machines.""So for the people who complain about the plot, to make such a popcorn movie, you have to traffic in larger-than-life myths that *need* to be familiar. Lover's need to be separated, one must promise her love to another to redeem her true love. Toss in an absent father (Bootstrap is about as dead as Luke Skywalker's dad was.) Allow there to be a chase and make sure the original chase is after the wrong goal or gal or gal's blood...and your on your way.So the key here, like the ride itself is not in revolutionary twists along the way but an attention to detail as we are moved along. The pirates' code and parley, splendid spectral special effects, the tie-ins to scenes from the ride. Little bits of the dialog...""Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt""...""Welcome to the Caribbean, love""...""Impersonating a cleric of the Church of England...""I want you to know that I was rooting for you mate""...""Cotton, he says you missed a spot."" (As spoken by a mute man's parrot and translated by the first mate.)This film is more than clever enough, and looks gorgeous, even on the small screen...though I and you imagined reader should have seen this on the big screen. The use of CGI was less ""siege"" and more ""see."" Verbinski largely forsook his first name and avoided  egregious amounts of gore.Yes it's as inflated as a Macy's Parade balloon, but its the smaller things that keep this afloat. I'll give it one stars for each of the seas, and hope we don't get half as many sequels...7/10By the way, the DVD I got from NetFlix was only IBM PC compatible for the bonus features.

Another Bad Bruckheimer Production,"The only thing memorable about 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' will be Johnny Depp's usual out-standing performance.I can only hope that this 'Blockbuster' featurette won't do for his acting career what ""Leaving Las Vegas"" did to Nick Cage's.  Remember Nicholas Cage, a quirky, interesting actor who was almost always worth watching, no matter how bad the movie?  Then his big moment in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", and he hasn't done a thing worth watching on-screen since then, including his woefully lackluster performance in Martin Scorcese's 1999 film, ""Bringing Out The Dead"", where Mr. Cage would only be considered interesting in contrast to John Goodman's typically bombastic, bizarre, supporting-actor overdoses.Now it's Mr. Depp's turn as an actor.  Either he will continue to pick and choose his movies based on the merit he sees in them as an actor, along the lines of the late, great, Gregory Peck, and the still living, and equally astounding, Meryl Streep; or, he will pick and choose his movies based on how much money someone is willing to pay him for his 'appearing in' their studio's (insert studio name) production of (insert producer's name and/or production company name)  film directed by (insert director's name), and starring (insert actor's name).I am rooting for the uniqueness of Johnny Depp, of course.For a movie as over-produced as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is, with the occasional well-done special effect (which should be a given considering the money spent), and interesting costuming (especially in the 'heaving-bossoms' scenes), some of the 'special effects' come off rather mediocre in comparison to better done summer fodder.  The distance shot of the burning Port would have been at home in Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"".  The underwater skeleton-walking scenes looked like out-takes from ""Clash of The Titans"".The humor of the movie is also in question, first during the looting of the British Naval Port and attacks on it's citizens by the pirates, with scenes of murder and attempted rape, played on film as quasi-comedy (in someone's seriously disturbed idea of entertainment); and also during the scenes when British Sailors are being slaughtered left and right onboard their own ship, immediately after the Pirates' underwater skeleton-walking scene, although these sailors are mostly being dis-embowelled off-screen so as to further distance us from contemplating the possibility of their deaths, and we are coerced instead into laughing at a Pirate's severed boney claw, clutching for the cowardly Governor Swann's throat.  A character foppishly over-played by Jonathan Pryce. Can anyone say ""Vincent Price"" cheese-ball?The dashingly pretty Orlando Bloom, as Will Turner, barely registers a ripple of a human nuance, rather like observing an interesting wall-paper. Likewise for Keira Knightley, as his longed-to-be-statuette-on-a-pedestal, Elizabeth Swann, the (of course!) Governor's daughter.  For a good acting comparison see Kate Winslett in ""Titanic"". Both parts seemingly conceived by a group of writers discovering cheap plastic glow-in-the-dark religious icons for the first time and attempting to pass them off as feminine Heaven.On screen for an hour too long, with convoluted plot 'twists' packing the wallop of moist cardboard, character actors required to do uninteresting comic 'bits' that might amuse a two-year old, screen-writing that barely rises to a fourth grade school play, wooden acting filmed along the lines of ""Stand there and don't move while we shoot the scene"", yet another 'typical' Hollywood feel-good ending, and, voila!, this summer's simple-minded Block-Buster movie is completed.On to the usual mass-merchandising, burger chain tie-ins (no matter how oddly far-fetched), and 'direct-to-DVD' sequel(s)!

Grow a Sense of Humor!,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl truly is a work of art.With the notable exceptions that the Disney logo is slapped on beside the title and a ride bearing its name exists within their parks, this is far from the cliché kiddy flicks they have grown famous for.  It's obvious that they've done little other than collect royalties and throw a killer premiere party for this film, leaving it in the very capable hands of Verbinski and Bruckheimer.  So for those of you who swore off seeing it, claiming you'd rather die than deal with little mermaids and lion kings, get over yourselves and give it a try.First off, this film brought together the very best of Hollywood, with a stacked cast both in front of, and behind, the camera.  It is obvious from the beginning that more than one or two people threw their all into this production, for everything oozed precision.The ships were incredible and the attention to detail was startling, especially on the Black Pearl.  The cursed pirate vessel was everything one would imagine it to be.  The weathered wood was dark as were the shredded sails (although they were a bit over done and sort of resembled Swiss cheese, but you can't win 'em all...) and everything was draped with cobwebs and immersed in fog; it was incredible.The setting was utterly breathtaking, and the views of clear blue-green waters, white sand beaches, and tropical foliage were enough to make anyone in the audience damn near suicidal.  The re-creation of the colonial ports was very well done and, once again, the attention to detail was insane!But the storefronts and marketplaces would not have gone far without the great work of the many extras employed.  Between soldiers, sailors, and townsfolk, the amount of people needed for filler was staggering, and yet they seemed to find the very best to provide a foundation for this story. The pirates were especially well done, reviving the idea that the supporting characters can, and will, steal the show.  They were funny and disgusting cutthroats who each had their own personalities and quirks, making it seem like there were eighty main characters instead of four.Speaking of the main characters, the casting done for these roles was simply masterful.  While the character of Will Turner is a bit melodramatic and annoying, Orlando Boom's good looks and some really smart one-liners make him loveable in the end.  Kiera Knightly's character wasn't all that special or different, but she shined in her portrayal of the beautiful rich girl who secretly longs for adventure and the not so rich boy, so snaps to her.  Geoffrey Rush was Captain Barbossa, and it is next to impossible to imagine him as anything else.  His gait, his costumes, his speech, it only added to his mystique, making it completely impossible to outright loathe his character even though you know you should.But the man of the hour is without a doubt Johnny Depp.  Known for taking the most bizarre and least publicized roles, he went from the pasty introverted Edward Scissorhands characters to a very tan, very loud, and very drunk pirate by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow, solidifying his status as one of the foremost acting talents of his day.  With the aid of incredible costuming and extremely witty writing, Depp becomes the man, swaggering and slurring, not once falling out of character.  If he doesn't win the Oscar for this performance, the Academy is most definitely on all of the drugs in Raoul Duke's damned briefcase.Basically, this film is a gem, and while it doesn't solve world hunger or confuse the viewer into a coma, it does take the audience away from their humdrum lives and into a simpler time where adventure was a way of life, not office work in a cubicle.  Many people have griped about this film, and to them I say this: There simply isn't a need to overanalyze it, so just sit back and enjoy, and grow a sense of humor, for Pete's sake!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I Liked This A Lot,"I never believed I was going to enjoy CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL as I stuck it in the DVD player . After all it was produced by Jerry Brukheimer who's only real critically acclaimed film BLACK HAWK DOWN is down more to director Ridley Scott rather than producer Bruckheimer and let's not forget he also produced Armageddon and PEARL HARBOR two of the most obscene wastes of money Hollywood has come up with in recent years . In fact I would have paid good money NOT to have seen either of these filmsThe production team seem to have taken a leaf out of the Peter Jackson book of film making by casting hunks as heroes with Shakespearian trained actors in the supporting roles . The cast are very good . Johhny Depp was atrocious as an English police inspector in FROM HELL but here as Jack Sparrow his camp English accent is entirely in keeping with the tone of the film . It also makes good business sense too , just think of the amount of 20 something woman who'll go to watch Depp play a swashbuckling rogue . Same with Orlando Bloom who's incredibly popular with a teenage girl audience . Keira Knightley ? Yeah she's really fit but like these other much hyped English Roses such as Julia Ormand in LEGENDS OF THE FALL and Kate Winslett in TITANIC I doubt if she'll be a household name many years from now , she is good as the ballsy heroine in this though . The always under rated Jonathon Pryce is slightly disappointing probably because like so many great stage actors he's not very good with camp humour . By an ironic contrast Geoffry Rush gives the best performance as the villain , a performance that may see him get an Oscar nod as best supporting actorThere does seem to be a lot of debate as to how well this film will do at the Oscars . I very much doubt if it'll be up for best picture or director ( It is a fantasy film and this genre is always over looked by the academy ) but it does deserve a handful of technical award nominations in the fields of cinematography , editing , sound , costume design and special effects . Unfortunately it's going to be up against RETURN OF THE KING and MASTER AND COMMANDER which means a probable empty treasure chest for these pirates which is a pity***** SPOILERS *****No review of mine is complete without a few grumpy complaints so here they are : Once again the Brits are shown to be stupid and incompetent but that's Hollywood for you , while there's a serious plot hole at the end where it's revealed that Jack Sparrow has been suffering from the curse all along so how did he manage to stay out of the moonlight without anyone noticing his skeletal state ? And how did he manage to get drunk on rum ?But no matter I liked this movie and I thought I'd I never say this but I hope to see the words "" Produced by Jerry Brukheimer "" a lot more in the futureUpdate - Sorrymy mistake . Jack wasn't suffering from the curse all along . Thanks to the forty or so people who wrote to me pointing this out",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Excellent!,"Despite the obvious gift of total hotties in this movie (Ahem: Johnny and Orlando) the plot, for the most part, is very original. Sure, it's about Will Turner going off to save the woman he loves, but the plot is so intricate and delightful that the first time you watch it, you don't even concentrate on how gorgeous these men are, but more so on the plot.The actors were well-placed as their characters, but most importantly the characters were believable, due firstly to the writers. The CGI effects were truly amazing, as they were able to characterize the skeletons to the characters, which made it easy to keep track of them.Pirates, well put together, is not just a family-fun movie or a chick-flick, but rather something that just about anyone can enjoy: action for men, romance for women, and humor all around.Shorlty: humorous and captivating, this is a must-see. One can only hope that the second and third movies are as well-written.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best pirate movie ever!,"Wow was this movie good! I don't think I've ever seen a movie like this before! I went to go see it when it first came out in 2003 at a huge theater and it was almost completely full, but luckily I got in. I wanted to go see it because people kept on bragging on about it so I just wanted to check how it really was, and to tell you the truth, I don't regret any of it.This is also probably one of Johnny Depp's best movies. He was a perfect and sometimes even funny character in the movie. He met the exact pirate voice, which is kind of weird because I haven't heard him talking like that before. Also, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley did a good job. It was just a really good movie with an awesome storyline.The reason I'm giving it a 10 is because of the plot, the cast, the acting and so forth.. And I feel that it was delivered in this amazing pirate movie! So if you're bored one night, and decide that you wanna rent a movie that you haven't seen before, I suggest picking up Pirates of the Caribbean, as you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Certainly a fun movie to watch,"Johnny Depp saved this movie. There, that's all you need to know. POC was a pretty good film overall, with excellent production design worthy of any spectacular epic film. But it was one character that made this whole movie worth watching, Mr. Depp. I have to say, that without Depp, this movie would be tanking worse than Charlie's Angels 2 with an anvil attached to its foot. The eccentricities of his character Jack Sparrow provides such an energy to the film, you can't help not saying a good word about it. Every one of the characters were fairly hollow and boring, but Depp's portrayal of Sparrow provided a nexus for all of the other characters to feed off of. To say the least, this film was fairly entertaining, even if Orlando Bloom seemed completely out of his element. This is one of he few times I will say a movie was good mostly for its entertainment value. Rarely do pirate movies grace the landscape of overly expensive action movies and remakes, but this movie really hit the spot. Go to enjoy this film, because you might be surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The worst pirate movie ever.,"Just kidding. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" is an extravagant and sumptuous feast albeit an awful lot of talking...and we all know pirates were long on plunder and short on words. It's politically correct Disney all the way with this watered down and convoluted family fun fare which has delighted the critics and public alike. However, there was no black eye patch, no peg leg, no hanging from a yard arm, no pieces of eight or dubloons, and its common knowledge that planks were always walked blindfolded which was a big part of pirate fun. Also, what's up with sword fighting someone you can't kill? Good stuff even if it was an encyclopedia version pirating as opposed to the more real good ol' Hollywood version of the buccaneer.

"Special Effects: 10, Storyline: 2","I am a HUGE fan of both Depp and the original Pirates. Naturally I went into this movie with a bit of skepticism as I do with ANY sequel. My daughter (15) had seen it twice and raved about it. So my 13 year old son and I went today. As we walked out, he said EXACTLY what was going thru my head: ""I was kind of bored"". Me, too.Special effects do not a movie make any more. We've come to expect that. Something that NEVER changes, though, is the critical element of a strong plot, something that ""Dead Man's Chest"" lacks. As near as my son and I could figure, the whole plot line was that everyone wanted Davy Jones' heart to control the seas. Yawn. The rest was a showcase for some admittedly fantastic special effects.Another gripe I had with this movie, as I do with many nowdays, is that the trend towards such utterly authentic dialogue almost makes much of the dialogue incomprehensible. Okay, maybe it's because I'm ""old"" (51) and my hearing sucks. But the dialects used by Naomi Harris (Tia Dalma) as well as the usual cast of ragamuffin sailors, was often impossible to understand. I love the realism; I hate the fact that I missed so much of the dialogue.It's hard - almost impossible - for a sequel to live up to the expectations of an original. Only a very few (""Aliens"" for example) can come close or achieve it. In my opinion, and my son's, ""Dead Man's Chest"" fell a bit short. Am I glad I saw it? Absolutely. I was moderately entertained. Would I see it again or buy it on DVD? Absolutely not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Escapism,"I'm not a fan of reality TV. When I watch TV, read a book, or go to a movie, I want to escape from the real world for a while. POTC is just such a movie. I was never a Johnny Depp fan, but seeing him in this show made me one. He is the coolest pirate ever. He was funny, cool, arrogant, daring, dashing, brave, cunning, and many other things throughout. There was plenty of action - never a dull moment. I liked it so much that I have the DVD and have watched it many, many times and don't get bored with it. Now I am trying to see anything I can with Johnny Depp in it. The other actors all did a great job, from Captain Barbarosa to Elizabeth and William to all the other pirates. I loved this movie!!

***1/2 Stars,"Pirate lovers have been waiting for a movie like this since the days of `Waterworld' and `Cutthroat Island.' Set in Port Royal, an island historically associated with pirates, and based on a Disney world ride, the movie follows Orlando Bloom as a sword smith with a dark past, who enlists the help of famed pirate (Depp) to rescue the object of his affections (Knightly). To go in more detail would take hours because, unfortunately the plot's long-winded and has more twists and turns than one can keep up with in one sitting. Nevertheless, while Pirates veers into the basic formulas and clichés of any other pirate movie, it does so with purpose and style, to make a quality ride out of a familiar outing. The movie also has some truly original elements, most notably Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow, a name you'll remember long after you see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This was an okay movie.,"I must admit, this movie was pretty good. But, the ending was cheesy. As Stephen King once said, ""You can have a really good storyline, but it isn't as good as it could be because of the ending. After all, it's the ending that matters most in a story. Without something special to wrap it up, the story is worthless."" With Pirates of the Caribbean, the storyboard directors should have been more choosy about what makes it in the movie. The ending of Pirates of the Caribbean makes it seem like the entire plot is a whole big love story, even though romance was shown very little throughout the film. Though, the hanging scene was good, the ""As is mine"" part wasn't necessary. Jack could've just thanked will and went on his way. And After Elizabeth's dream and before Johnny comes in, it was rather boring. I mean who CARES about Will and Elizabeth. It's setting up for a romance movie, when the movie should make the audience focus on the cursed pirates and Captain Jack, which is after all the focus of the movie. They could've just shown the part where Elizabeth puts on the necklace, then opens the window showing Port Royal. Then, the next part could be when Jack comes in on the boat. It would have kept the pirate theme alive, while still showing the movie from Elizabeth's point of view. There was a lot of action in this movie, so it should have ended shortly after a part with a lot of action. After the pirates become cursed no longer, they could've had Jack become captain, once again, and end the movie there. It would have made the people leaving the theater, thinking thet just came back from a really good pirate movie. Instead, they just remember the final part, so they leave thinking, ""That had a really good love story in it."" COMPLETELY forgetting about Will and Captain Jack's huge sword fight and the climax of the 3rd act. The movie was overall good, but I would've tweaked it a bit to make it perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"ahh, not another pirate film?","When i was at the cinema waiting to see The Matrix Reloaded, a trailer appeared before me for a certain pirate movie.

My fears were confirmed when the Disney logo appeared at the end of the trailer. There was no way in hell I was going to see this movie. Then, people started telling me about a certain guy called Johnny Depp. Now, I have never seen a movie with Johnny Depp in it, so I wasn`t really moved when people told me that he was the best thing in this movie. Anyway, lately a friend and I decided to rent the movie just to see what it was like. I watched it and I must say, it IS a Disney pirate movie made for the kids for summer. However, it is also a very entertaining movie, in parts. I can see why it has done very well at the box offices around the world and why people keep going back to see it.

A Swashbuckling Bore,"I thought the first forty-five minutes were very cleverly written, and Johnny Depp is inarguably a scene-stealer in this film.  But the cumbersome plot turns absurd, and as soon as all the characters' energies onscreen are diverted toward the task of lifting an ancient curse (culminating in a set of dreary sea battles and chases), I lost interest.  Honestly, Depp is probably what made the last half of this overly long film bearable for me.I am disappointed that Disney released such a violent movie in such kid-friendly packaging.  There are a lot of callous murders of innocent townspeople here.  And to put so much work into producing a film that glamorizes pirates--a word that has little meaning outside of rape, murder, robbery, and destruction--is a questionable endeavor.  Think twice before you let your kids watch this one, unless they're already desensitized little bloodlusters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Yo Ho Ho Ho! A Pirate's Life For Me!  ---84%,"FIRST IMPRESSIONI dont know about you, but I've been on Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean ride probably a dozen times.  Its a classic, and in some ways the new blockbuster hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, is one as well.SUMMARYBasically, Johnny Depp plays Jack Sparrow, a cunning and smooth-talking pirate who seems like he might have spent a little too much time at sea. After the governor's daughter gets kidnapped by an odd gang of pirates, who have been sailing on the mythical Black Pearl, it is up to Jack and a courageous blacksmith to not only save the kidnapped girl but also prevent the crew of the Black Pearl from destroying the curse that plagues them.ACTING: 93%Truthfully, I wasnt a big fan of Johnny Depp.......until now.  He is terrific in this movie.  His smooth, humorous words and his somewhat drunken stature make his original pirate character into a full scale movie of its own.  In some respects, I dare say, he made this film.  But, all the other actors, including Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush, are top notch and worthy of praise.  Still, its Johnny Depp who lights up the screen, and everytime he enters a scene, the movie is somewhat enhanced and ultimately more enjoyable.  All in all, great acting all around.STORY: 75%Moderately good story.  I mean its nothing epic or rather new, but its decent for an action movie.  Usually in a standard action flick, the plots follow a set pattern.  The bad guys steal something, and the good guys set off to take it back.  ""Pirates"" follows the same premise.  One thing I didnt like about the story, and this is a big chunk of the story actually, was why did Jack and Will Turner want to stop the pirates of the Black Pearl from breaking their curse?  I mean, once the curse is broken, they become mortal men.  So, the danger of walking skeletons with the intent to kill would be over.  And it wasnt like they were going to kill Will Turner over the coins; they just needed his blood.  They knew and the audience knew that a simple cut would have sufficed.  Decent story, with that one big fault in the story.DIRECTION: 85%When a high scale action blockbuster comes out, you know its probably a Michael Bay film or a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  In this case, its a Bruckheimer film, and he doesnt disappoint.  The shots of the battling ships floating around in the fog and the smoothness of the transition of the pirates to skeleton are all perfect.  The shots of the beaches and palm trees also bring out a certain feeling of being stranded on a deserted island, with nothing to do but fish.FUN FACTOR: 85%One of the things that plagued this film slightly is its length.  At 133 minutes, the sword fighting got a little boring towards the end.  But, nonetheless, the rest of the movie, especially the beginning is totally engrossing and I would have to say ""Pirates"" is one of the more entertaining movies of the year.FINAL IMPRESSION  ---84%With its exciting action sequences, the humor of Johnny Depp, and the excellent shots of the town and ships at sea, Pirates of the Caribbean is one movie definetly worth your time in the theater.  Oh, and did I mention Johnny Depp?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just bad,"When I sat down to watch this movie, I was expecting to see a movie that was decent at best. I was very surprised to find how unbelievably bad it was. The plot is non-sensical jibberish. The characters are all one-dimensional, either good-to-the-heart, or bad-to-the-bone, with absolutely no variations. The acting is horrendous, Johnny Depp is like a washed-up rock-star, heavily drugged and very drunk, the entire time. Orlando Bloom is nothing but a simple rehash of the knight in shining armor, if only a bit more easily tolerated. Keira Knightley is just a damsel in distress, pure and simple, nothing else. Something I found ridiculous, was that every other character, even minor characters, mastered sword fighting. The humor is unbelievably childish, at several times it was on the level of the newer Simpsons episodes, which made me cringe more than I believed was possible. All of the CGI effects were very bland, most looked like they could easily have been made at the same mediocre quality several years ago. Why so many people claim this is a great film eludes me. If you ever even consider to sit down and watch this, make sure you keep your expectations very low. Very overrated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, as it is simply too long, too boring, too bland and too cringe-worthy to be the least bit enjoyable. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Highly overrated,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has been regarded as the best film this summer in the US, and many IMDb users have praised the return of the pirate genre.With this in mind I went to the cinema and watched this movie, and once again I disagree with the IMDb users and possibly also a lot of critics. The story had a lot of potential with ghost pirates and stuff like that, it is a pirate movie and you can accept things like this, but the movie fails to impress me for several reasons.First of all the cast was not chosen wisely. Johnny Depp is without doubt a great actor, but he is simply the wrong choice for an old pirate. He does not look old, but according to the story he should have been captain on the same ship where Geoffrey Rush was chief officer. The rest of the cast was chosen more wisely, but I never liked Orlando Bloom's character either.One thing that really annoyed me was that almost every character should be funny, it was very annoying and at some points unbearable to watch. First we have some stupid English soldiers, later Johnny Depp has to be funny, and we also have to watch some funny ghost pirates all the time. Suddenly all characters have to be funny, and the ghost pirates are just comic sidekicks in this movie, they are not scary at all. The idea to make the English soldiers stupid has also been seen so many times before, and I really dislike it.If that was all of it, then I maybe would not be that grumpy, but that was not all of it. The whole idea of immortal pirates was actually not good even though I accept stuff like that in this pirate adventure genre. I can ask a simple question, why do people take a fight against these immortal pirates? There is absolutely no point in doing that because the outcome has already been decided. Am I the only one who is asking these simple questions? Hopefully I am not.After having criticised the movie I also have to point out some of the good sides. The movie is well done in both sound and picture. The effects are good and the ships can fascinate most people.Anyway, the movie does not deserve a good rating, because the plot is too thin and all scenes have to be fun, which is a disaster in a 143 minute movie. Beautiful scenes and a few laughs however make this an acceptable picture, which should not be treated as an memorable movie of year 2003. - Rating: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A pirates life for me,"I loved this movie the first time I watched (when it was playing in the theaters) and I loved it again when I watched it yesterday.

Did I mention I loved every minute of it?This one has everything: good and entertaining story, well written script, fine direction, good acting (excellent acting in the case of J. Depp), great costumes and locations, nice looking effects, humor, cool characters, swordfights, ghosts, romance, great villains. WOW!! In short, this movie is awesome. And besides, pirates are cool!The best thing about the film is, without a doubt, J. Depp's character: Jack Sparrow (sorry, I mean CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow). Depp delivers an outstanding performance, effectively shadowing everyone else, as the goofy, somewhat crazy pirate captain, proving once again he is a great actor.If you expect deep ideas and dealing with important issues you won't find it here, but if you just want to be entertained and have a whole lotta fun I strongly recommend Pirates of the Carribean.

Checkmate losers.It is a movie that has everything working, aside from the script; every individual part is good, technically well executed and worthy of praise. It is just that the sum of it all is a big letdown.It tells the tale of Jack Sparrow, played by a Johnny Depp that is far too young to be a legendary pirate captain in charge of a massive warship a decade ago. The performance itself is not as bad as people make it. Yet, it is squarely out of place. It is essentially goofy and lighthearted. It works when the film's tone is cartoonish and silly. Sparrow and Turner hijack two British warships successively. In broad daylight. But, when the tone wildly shifts to supernatural thriller, full of walking corpses and sailors being stabbed in the gut; the lighthearted elements appear buffoonish.The script is bad, really bad. And it weighs down what the showmanship and visual spectacle could lift off. Most of the scenes at sea are fun and entertaining, but then all the characters are forced to go to a dark cave not once but twice. It is disappointing that after the sea battles and naval adventure the story forces everything to happen in a damp empty cave.So what is it? Is it truly cinema? Am I being to analytical? Maybe. But if you figure that this film's origin is not some novel or superhero book but a Disney ride, I would say what we got is pretty spot on.This is what happens when you adapt a theme park ride in a film. What is the difference; it's just stunt people doing acrobatics with ropes.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
a wonderful movie. Great acting by all of the cast and a brilliant plot!,"fans of Lord of the rings and star wars will love this movie. Excellent job by Disney and the cast + crew.

Best pirate film in years,"This is by far one of the best movies in my collection of DVD's. Pirates of the Caribbean is the best rendition of a traditional pirate movie plus all the special effects and budgets of our day and age. Johnny Depp was the absolute perfect character to play Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom couldn't have played the part of Will Turner any better. The casting crew did their homework and compiled and all-star team of actors and really knocked this movie out of the park. I gave this movie 10 out of 10 because there isn't any other pirate movie out there in the market to compare this one with. Better yet, I haven't seen a pirate movie at all that was worth anything except this one and I must say, I have been duly spoiled by it. I hope they come out with a sequel, because I can guarantee you that I will be one of the guys waiting outside the theater just to be the first one in.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A great, true swashbuckling adventure!","This movie was everything a great pirate movie should be, and more! Instead of adding more praise and point out some flaws, which previous reviewers have already done, I will say this: Johnny Depp may be the coolest character that sweeps you away but Geoffrey Rush is actually the better pirate.You will realize this during the scene where Barbosa points exactly the same out to Sparrow. The bottom line: Sparrow has a heart and cares about doing the right thing while Barbosa is one evil son of a b*** who'd sell his own mother if it would make him a profit.Oh, and the true star of this movie, of course: The Pirates! I felt so sorry for them in the end. But looking at the sequel currently in production and seeing the names of supporting cast, perhaps I have nothing to worry about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favourite movie ever,"It's now almost four years ago that this movie came out and it's still my favourite movie ever! I just love the light-hearted, humorous and adventurous context which stands in total contrast to the sequels which are darker and more epic.The humour in Pirates is brilliant - snarky, sarcastic and the running gags are also working very well. I especially adore Barbossa's monkey Jack (who will get more action in the third part!) But - as everyone else must admit - the real highlight of the whole trilogy is our dear Captain Jack Sparrow - played most brilliantly by Johnny Depp. I can't even say how much I love the character he created! His way to walk, to talk, to drink and to manipulate everyone else without them having the slightest clue as to what really are his motives has completely blown me away. Johnny Depp sure gave the performance of his life with this role and I'm still so very, very mad at the fact that he didn't get an Oscar for this achievement. Sure, Sean Penn is also a great actor, but the fact still remains, that without Johnny Depp we would have never gotten to know our beloved Captain Jack. No one else would have played him like this and he really created something on his own, instead of simply reading the script and doing it in the straightest way possible. And that's why he should have gotten an Oscar! - But hey, there's still hope for the third part!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pirates loved by their mommies, dadies, and audiences alike!","Disney has definitely learned from their mistakes with Country Bears, their first attempt to take a theme park ride and bring it to the big screen, to produce a summer hit with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The film's most endearing qualities are a great original story (kudos to Gore Verbinski) mixed with tribute to the original attraction. Fanatical Disney fans will be thrilled at how these images, characters, and dialogue/song from the ride are subtly incorporated into the film.Johnny Depp creates the character of Captain Jack Sparrow as only Depp can, using his combination of charm and wit to captivate the audience to remark on his performance long after the credits have finished. He once again demonstrates that he has an impeccable knowledge of who he is as an actor and what roles he can create to great success.  Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce all contribute fantastic performances to create a solid leading cast. All should receive accolades for their fancy footwork with a sword as well.The visual effects created by Industrial Light and Magic once again prove they are the leaders of the effects business. Audiences will be awed at classic swash-buckling action scenes combined with the latest in film technology.Jerry Bruckheimer proves that a pirate's life is also a life for him. This film has a great balance of Bruckheimer trademark action scenes with comical and plot development scenes. He has created a film that both the public and corporate audience will enjoy.Make sure you stay until the end of the credits... Could there be a Pirates 2?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Pretty Straightforward Movie,"And I really mean it! I have absolutely no idea how this pirate movie manages to enter the IMDb's Top 250 Movie List, but I guess most of you viewers love The Curse of the Black Pearl for some good reasons. However, I don't find it entirely revolutionizing in any sense.First of all, the plot's simply too straightforward in my taste (the script is pretty cheesy and tiring as well) and like any typical Hollywood movies, expect lots of the same old swashbuckling stuff and highlighted special effects without being mesmerized by its overall b-movie context. Aside of these criticisms, Johnny Depp is brilliant as the goofy Jack Sparrow but the rest of the cast is just plain OK.The Curse of the Black Pearl seems to be a no-brainer and doesn't hold my interest any longer now. If you want a quality pirate (or ship) movie, I highly recommend you to watch 'Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World' instead. It's far better than this dire action movie, for my sake.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

At least 30 minutes could have been trimmed to make it a tighter, more thrilling event.Depp is the star of the show, playing Captain Sparrow with aplomb, and is well supported by Bloom, Rush and Keira Knightley, looking very dishy and a future star in the making.The effects were excellent, and the fight scene at the end where the cursed pirates pass in and out of moonlight(and passing from skeleton to full person)is extremely good.It just left me feeling it could have been done a bit better, perhaps with a stronger storyline.Still, I seem to be in the minority, as the film has made a mint and a second installment is on the way next year.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

He does his best to hold the movie together, but even his performance couldn't save it in my eyes.First off the special effects weren't all that spectacular. It was cool to see the people turn into skeletons when they passed in and out of the moon light, but when you had a chance to really look at them it was sort of cheesy.The biggest problem with this movie is that Disney couldn't decide whether this advertisement for one of their rides (marketing brilliance by the way, no matter how disgusting it is) should be for kids or adults. In the end, it didn't fit for anyone. It was too violent for little kids with scenes of people getting killed with swords and their throats slit by daggers. It was WAY too hokey for adults.Maybe it works for 13-year-olds that haven't seen the special effects in the Matrix or Lord of the Rings.My advice, don't get your hopes up based on what the majority is saying about this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Amazing absolutely Amazing,"Although when thought of a pirate movie was in the making i had my doubts whether it would be a worthwhile movie 1 to watch or 2 to even make, whether or not it was based on a Disney theme park ride or not. But how i was wrong.With none stop brilliant acting throughout and a real smart dialogue with the right amount of humour to not this into a comedy genre movie was ideal. The real show stopper was off course the great Johnny Depp who up to now in my opinion has never played apoor role.The way he move and most definitely talks is perfect and in my opinion no one else could have played the character as good as he, he was seriously a joy to watch. With great help from the all star cast or Bloom, Rush and off course Knightley the film started and ended with absolute flying colours.The best thing in this movie is the way that the zombie pirates of the black pearl are portrayed and in my opinion a bliss to watch.

"Hang on to your gold matees, it's gonna be a bumpy night!","Well, what can I say.. Johnny Depp, looking like Alice Cooper meets the Scarlet Pimpernell meets Bob Marley and sounding like Oscar Wilde after too much absinth plays Jack Sparrow the overthrown captain of a band of cuthroats. The mutinous pirates are now led by a deliciously ruthless Captain Barbosa played to the teeth by Geoffrey Rush. They are in search of the final pieces of Cortez'zzzzzz Aztec Gold so they can lift the curse of Moctezuma and stop running around in a disheveled pirate vessel known as the Black Pearl.  All it takes is some special ingredient and the curse will be lifted and the guys can go around carousing and raping and pilaging and enjoy the whole thing rather than spend eternity as unsatisfied and perpetually ticked-off skeletal spooks.  Orlando Bloom plays a blacksmith Will Turner who has a bit of pirate in him and wonders why, and Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, daughter of the Governor who knows why.All in all good squash-buckler of a film that has little to do with the ride of the same name save one scene in Tortuga which looks remarkably like the raping and pilaging that goes on in the Disney attraction. The skeletal capuchin monkey was a nice touch. makeup gets high marks, although Depp should be hung for his excessive use of eye shadow and sparkle disco glitter..come on Johnny, who are you fooling?Apparently the music by Klaus Badelt, was a direct RIP OFF of Gladiator, because Klaus Badelt did the incidental music for Gladiator.

And, as of now (2015) it may remain that way, as his career seems to be in idle any time he appears as any other role (though his Wolf in ""Into the Woods"" has its charms).Worth pointing out is how this film has one of the finest scores ever recorded for a Hollywood movie.

Johnny Depp Does Cool Stuff!!!!,"Johnny Depp is in this movie. He wears a cool hat and swaggers about like a drunken bohemian on the loose in a boarding school.

Keira Knightley fails to fill out her dress, but that's okay because she's cute too. Geoffrey Rush plays another retired rock star, and between him and Depp the movie is nearly watchable.I stayed awake through this movie the first time. The second time, not so much. The third time, I'm not sure. I intentionally turned it on a fourth time while I was on a trans-Atlantic flight and needed to sleep. The plot is kind of unintelligible, with characters escaping and getting captured and being held in prisons and escaping again every five minutes or so, and no one ever bothers to clear up which ship they're on at any given moment.

A decent Depp flick.,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a pretty good little flick. Although I have to admit that I have a big soft spot for Pirates.The movie isn't anything special but that shouldn't take away from it.I thought the cast where fine but not the best part for the movie. Jack Sparrow was obviously the best character in the movie and I thought he was introduced well. Throughout the entire movie 'Captain' Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was good and fun to watch. He was nothing amazing as some people claim he is in this flick, but he is well done and a fine character that is pretty enjoyable at times. It has to be said however I haven't seen the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies as of yet so maybe his character improves. As of now he is a enjoyable character with a few good scenes and quips to make you smile. The rest of the cast where fine but nothing special so I won't bother mentioning them in detail. Basically they're mediocre (maybe slightly less).The story was fine but nothing spectacular. Although I did like how the curse worked and how it changed the crew of the Black Pearl. Obviously I'm not mentioning spoilers.The action was not great, but It was fine. Nothing amazing or even great but enough to make it's point. There was alot of scenes that include ""Action"", but I don't believe they where very good. So it's not a lack of action, just nothing special when it came to coreograthy. The action is pretty mediocre but it's more about the characters (Jack Sparrow) than an action-packed adventure.Cast - 6/10Story - 6.5/10Action - 3.5/10Johnny Depp - 7.5/10Overall a fine watch but nothing truly spectacular.

This sort of treatment was fine during the 1980's when Indiana Jones and the like seemed fresh and fun but surely young cinemagoers are entitled to something more intelligent in 2003 - such as a plot that makes sense, straight acting and some semblance of historical accuracy.

At least I wasn't bored,"The last 20 years haven't been kind to the pirate movie genre.  Audiences have rejected such forgettable films as Pirates (Roman Polanski, 1986), The Pirate Movie (Kristy McNichol, 1982), and who can forget the one of the biggest flops in film history, Cutthroat Island (Renny Harlin) that sank an entire studio.So when Jerry Bruckheimer, the production money behind such hits as The Rock, Top Gun and Black Hawk Down decided to put his name and efforts behind a big budget summer pirate film, I wondered if he finally lost his marbles, or if director Gore Verbinski had nude photos of Jerry in a dress.Also working against a return of capital was the running time.  At 133 minutes, I wondered if a swashbuckling movie could hold an audience captive  especially the target young ones  for over two hours.Well, all my thoughts and reservations meant nothing after first screening. The story is rather simple.  The movie opens at the conclusion of a pirate attack on a ship and the lone survivor by the name of Will Turner is rescued.  A gold medallion around his neck is taken by his rescuer's daughter, Elizabeth Swann, and a band of pirates lead by Geoffery Rush are out to get the medallion and return it to its original resting place, thus lifting the curse set upon them of being undead.In one of the funniest entrances in movie history, Johnny Depp arrives as Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and immediately his pirate ways lead him into jail.   But when Elizabeth is taken hostage upon the pirate ship the Black Pearl, the townspeople look to Jack Sparrow to rescue her and bring order back to the city.It isn't long before mayhem and sword fights ensue, and it is in the final act that the film has its most incredible visual.  The cursed pirates are visible in skeleton form when exposed to moonlight, and in a swordfight between Jack and Barbossa (captain of the Black Pearl),  the two battle in and out of the moonlight beams shinning down into a cave.  The transformation of skeleton to human to skeleton again in the blink of an eye is movie magic at its best.On paper, the movie had everything going against it.  Its running time of 140+ minutes.  It's director, Gore Verbinski, who had a hit last year in The Ring', but was still new to the fold with only 4 movie titles to his credit.  Johnny Depp in a leading role was even a gamble since he had yet to prove to be a box office juggernaut.  However, everything comes together in true Disney style.  The special effects are top rate, the story is long, but energetic, and the villain (usually the most important character in this genre) was superb.  Geoffery Rush gives us the most charismatic villain since Jack Nicholson in Batman.I should note that the supporting cast also does its best with the material. Elizabeth and Will are played with just the right amount of enthusiasm and playfulness, by Bend it Like Beckham's Keira Knightley and Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom.If there was once complaint I would say that the humor doesn't come off as well as they would have expected and Johnny Depp, although tolerable, seems like he is trying too hard in his role that was a cross between Errol Flynn and Liberace.But forget its small drawbacks and the history or pirate movies.  Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a good movie where everyone seems to be having fun.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awesome _ Depp!,"And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney ""adventure"" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect? And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen ""Pirates"" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, ""Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?"" And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best Disney movie Id say,I actually liked this movie quite a bit when it first came out and its still good to this day. Usually Disney goes for really childish movies but this one has more of a grown up feel and with a fun interesting story line and a great performance from Johnny Depp this movie becomes very enjoyable.This movie is about a blacksmith who teams up with pirate Jack Sparrow in order to save the love of his life who was kidnapped by Sparrows ex gang of pirates who are now undead monsters.I know the plot sounds kind of silly and strange but this movie is really enjoyable. Besides the countless historical errors if you blot those from your mind and just sit back and enjoy the ride it is very fun once all said and done with.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught captain Jack Sparrow""","(9.5) Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, holds a special place in my heart. I've always been a fan of adventure movies growing up, as well as anything pirate related. So when seeing this adventure-pirate film I loved it. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is the captain of his crew. Except their is no crew. One day Jack Sparrow gets captured on an island and imprisoned, when the island gets attacked. Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his cursed crew attack the island looking for a precious piece of treasure when they encounter Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) and kidnap her. Jack sparrow meets a young blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who frees him from his prison with a promise from Captain Jack to go and rescue his love Elizabeth Swan. Jack and Will must assemble a crew and track down Barbossa and save Elizabeth. This movie incorperates great storytelling elements with great acting. Johnny Depp does an incredible job playing captain Jack Sparrow, the start of the movie. A great movie for those who love adventure and pirates.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
2 words.  Johnny Depp.,"Without Johnny Depp this movie would be nothing.  Seriously.  Mediocreplot.  Mediocre direction.  Between an hour and a half hour too long.But it does have Johnny Depp.  I'll tell ya, I don't know of anothermovie where so much success can be attributed to a single person.  Deppis incredible.  He is a glam rock star in a pirate's body.  Hisperformance is entirely genuine.  It's incredible.  His performance isso brilliant that for the Academy to ignore him would be an absolutetravesty. (as much as something in Hollywood can be)It's basically like this... if Depp isn't nominated for his performancein this movie, it will show exactly how out of touch the Academy iswith mainstream America.This movie is definitely worth seeing.  Although it's not my favoritemovie of this year (I would place it behind T3 and X2) it is veryentertaining, and Depp's performance alone is worth the price ofadmission.

A Very Long Cruise,"The governor's daughter is kidnapped and an inept pirate (Johnny Depp) and a young blacksmith in love with her join forces to rescue her from undead pirates (headed by Geoffrey Rush).All right, I wish Erroll Flynn had access to these effects. Flynn played a man forced into piracy in ""Captain Blood"" and a privateer (someone licensed to commit acts akin to piracy in wartime by the Queen, in the anti-Hitler parable ""The Sea Hawk""). But special effects alone can't save a sinking ship of a movie.The story of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" isn't difficult to follow. Admittedly, this movie has an awful lot of story but I followed it fine after I got bored with the whole shebang and started surfing on my phone, listening to the movie with only one ear.The movie is very long. I don't mind long movies, but this one bored the socks off me. I'm still looking for one of them. And when I was fed up and checked the time on the dvd to see if it was nearly over and realized I had more than forty minutes to go, I switched off my dvd player and haven't gone back to it yet.Some of the imagery is gruesome but I remember what it was like being twelve. I ate that stuff up . . . Though it might give younger children the willies.Anyhow,the subtitle ""the curse of the Black Pearl"" is a misnomer: it's not ""The Black Pearl"" that's cursed, but the gold, allegedly stolen from the Aztecs by Cortes (ask the Toltecs some time what they thought of the Azetcs; they basically did to the Toltecs what Cortez did to them. What goes around . . . ) The undead pirates may be brought back to life under certain conditions . . . But I won't give it away. It's the crux of the movie and I'd hate to spoil it.I've enjoyed Depp's performances in other movies but here he's just plain weird, to say the least. Keira Knightley is okay, though I've had a mental block to her since ""Doctor Zhivago."" Rush comes off as the typical pirate, though he doesn't play up a silly Long-John-Silver Bristol accent, thank goodness. He's the best thing in the movie, and that's not high praise.""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has lots of good, if occasionally misplaced, humor. I never watch movies about gangsters, though I give leeway to watching flicks about pirates. After this I'll probably rethink that policy. I found the whole thing a big, bloated bore. Oh, it's better than lots of live-action Disney movies, especially those that nearly sank the company in the 1970s and 1980s. I wouldn't trade this for any of Kurt Russell's Disney ""comedies.""

"A Powerhouse Of Action, Spectacle & Humour. Prepare To Be Blown Out Of The Water.","A thoroughly fascinating blend of action, adventure, comedy, horror & fantasy, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a brilliantly scripted, skilfully directed & cleverly narrated cinema that paints an interesting portrait of pirates mythology on the film canvas like never before and is also notable for bringing to life one of the most iconic characters of 21st century cinema.The story of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl follows the quest of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow who teams up with a talented blacksmith, Will Turner, to rescue the latter's love, Elizabeth Swann, who's been taken hostage on the notorious pirate ship, Black Pearl, which is commanded by the feared Captain Barbossa and carries a crew of cursed men who were once Jack's allies.Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean brims with an energetic & creative vibe which keeps the story refreshing throughout its runtime, doesn't take much time to get its main plot moving, and with its firm grip on refined storytelling ends up infusing a new life into the pirates genre. The screenplay handles its different genres with remarkable ease and also presents a fine balance between its various elements.The production design team does a stellar job with its period sets & meticulously designed ships. Cinematography makes fab use of its camera to capture each sequence in fine detail, use of colour palette is quite splendid and the expertly staged camera angles & movements make its story all the more captivating. Even the Costumes are pretty much in tune with the depicted timeline, and the work in make-up department is no slouch either.Editing is undoubtedly one of its strongest highlights for it never allows the viewers to settle down, keeps the adventurous tone alive & kicking all the way from start to finish, and paces its 143 minutes of story amazingly well. Visual effects is state-of-the-art stuff which blends into the narrative quite seamlessly. The background score is composed by Klaus Badelt and is an absolute delight that enhances the whole experience by a great deal with its pulsating tracks.Coming to the performances, Pirates of the Caribbean features an awesome cast in Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley and they all manage to leave their mark, one way or another. Depp makes Jack Sparrow completely his own for it's his added inputs only which gives his character a unique look & edge over the others, and there isn't one scene where he isn't the show-stealer. Rush also impresses a lot with his crazy take on Captain Barbossa, while Bloom & Knightley deliver good performances in their given roles.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a powerhouse of action, spectacle & humour that's loaded with all the ingredients one requires to make a great blockbuster, which it is in every sense of the word. A work of ingenious craftsmanship that packs in a whole lot of fun, absolutely nails its comic timing, wonderfully balance all its aspects, delivers an entertainment worth your time & money, and is an extremely enjoyable, unforgettable & swashbuckling ride that presents Johnny Depp at the pinnacle of his talents while permanently engraving Captain Jack Sparrow into the annals of cinema & pop culture.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"If you like Johnny Depp, you'll love Johnny Depp in this flick.","Well, I finally got around to seeing this because I continue to hear such rave reviews and decided they can't be all wrong.Turns out, I was wrong: this movie bored me bored me bored me. By the time the movie was half-over, I began waiting impatiently for the smallest sighting of Johnny Depp - any scene he was in was incredible: his acting was genius, his costume was perfect, and his Captain Jack Sparrow consumed him. During his appearances, the scenes were understandable, sensible (for a quirky Pirate movie), and extremely entertaining; I laughed aloud almost every time he was on screen.Unfortunately, if he was not involved in a scene, it was guaranteed to be confusing and boring. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were the only actors whose lines could be understood the first time listening, I felt. I saw this on DVD with the convenience of the life-saving remote control to rewind when I couldn't get it. How did theater-goers manage?? Everyone else spoke too fast! I found myself rewinding many of Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom's lines, along with a few of the pirates. What's up with that? Why the frenetic spewing of lines? Depp's and Rush's words flowed from them as though part of their being, their essence. Masters, they are.The story unnecessarily twisted back and forth - trust or don't trust, honesty or dishonesty, honor or betrayal - it went from one extreme to the other like the audience was in a secret attempt by the writers to break the Guinness Record for yo-yoing. Too much work for the audience, for too little payoff, I say; it was exhausting. I am guessing that the ride in the park is similar: back and forth and back and forth, just to the point of breaking ""the fine line,"" you know, when you are just about to throw up? Now that I think of it, the actors' quality of performances yo-yoed from scene to scene as well. Up with Depp, down with Bloom. Up and down, up and down. It could have ended far sooner than it had.And the special effects, while impressive programming for video games and home entertainment centers, also did nothing for me when substituting skeletons for fleshy humans in this movie. I found the graphics an answer to the laziness in not using real humans in makeup and costume. They looked incredibly costumed and made up as human pirates, why not try the same technique for the immortal pirates? I thought it was kitschy and a cop-out.Johnny Depp outperformed everyone in this movie, including the writers and director. Other than Rush, the only others who performed on nearly the same level were the two goofballs trying to prevent him from docking, and later holding the flag during the execution scene.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Harrr...This flick delivered shivers down my salty spine!!!,"Ahoi there!!! ""Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl"" is one of the most funny, exiting, action-filled, spectacular masterpiece of this genre! One thing over all: Johnny Depp! He is simply fantastic acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow. I consider him one of the best actors of all times because he is always perfect in almost every role (thanks to Tim Burton that discovered him!). Jack Sparrow is incredible, funny and strange, the perfect buccaneer for a movie like that. Good performance from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley too. The photography, the sets, are perfect, and you can feel all the ""salty"" feeling of the Caribbeans in the whole movie. The story is good: a good mix of adventure and mystery, filled with action, explosions, and naval battles. The extra contents on the DVD shows how they have bought to life all that magic! The soundtrack is epic and it fit perfectly in the movie, thanks to Klaus Badelt, a real artist.

2.5h well spent.,"Well, the script is barely above average, acting OK and the special effects are very well made. The person who did the casting though has to get some extra credit. Bloom and Depp complements each other perfectly, giving this movie the little extra that actually makes it something to watch out for. Sometimes quite funny, but I suspect that they will not pass the test of time, and a second watching of the movie might not be quite as enjoyable. The action scenes are of good quality, about what you'd expect from a modern movie after watching the remake of Zorro starring Bandeiras/Hopkins. Don't go to this movie and expect to see something new though, the parts have all been done before, and most of the time better than what you'd get here. The combination is new though, and as the genre of swashbuckling isn't very common in modern movies you will find some fresh elements still in this movie so I'd say that if you enjoyed the aforementioned Zorro (which I rated 9/10), you'll find this a pleasant experience.

Superb,I really liked this movie because it was generally quite fast-paced and kept the viewer interested. There were a few parts in the movie where I can imagine some people would get confused but I think the movie later explains itself. I think the dialogue was good and the acing was excellent. I really liked the character building throughout the movie and I also like the little characters too. I think the scenery was amazing with all the detail which I think plays an important part in any movie but especially this one. I think that this movie is appealing to younger children because of the whole pirate and sword-fighting theme but older people because the more deeper side of the storyline. I hope POTC 2 is just as good and well done to everyone on set specially Johnny Depp! ;-),10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A summer blockbuster you can love,"I hate Disney movies, Jerry Bruckheimer, and summer blockbusters. But the reviews of Johnny Depp in the film got my butt to the theatre, and I wasn't disappointed.Occasionally, the movie gets into predictable ruts that are annoying, but most of the time the action is fast paced, the one-liners are zingy, and the acting is top notch.The film is full of cliches, especially Love Conquers All, but for once they work.This film almost ranks with Raiders of the Lost Ark and Spiderman -- it would be up there but for the emphasis on some bit part actors for comic relief that dragged the pace down.The score, as for all Jerry movies, is overly frenetic, but it steers clear of bombastic.Depp is certainly the highlight -- don't be surprised if you feel an urge to rent a bunch of Depp movies after this. Be sure to see Chocolat if you haven't seen it yet.But Bloom is not quite as lame as some have painted. He does what he can with a fairly drab romantic leading man role, and I'm sure all the 12-year-old girls in the theatre were enjoying his big brown eyes as he gazed yearningly at Keira Knightley [who puts in a perky perfomance].

I kinda regret not having seen it on the big screen. I will surely be seeing the next TWO, which are in production at this time.During one scene, he takes a swing at seducing a woman. Having enjoyed watching Depp in a romantic role, I was surprised at how smarmy he came off as when he was making his moves. Even though he is an attractive man, he managed to make himself seem, unappealing? Is that even possible?

A decent action/adventure film that has a secret weapon,"I have never been to Disneyworld or Disneyland so going into this film I had no idea what this movie based on an amusement ride was going to be about except for the fact that it was going to have pirates in it.  And lots of them.  After seeing this film, I still have no idea what the correlations between the ride and the movie are, but I did come to one solid conclusion: Johnny Depp is an unbelievable actor.Without Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow, this film probably would have still done very well.  It's a fun, reasonably well-done swashbuckling film that has a `cute' lead actor (Orlando Bloom), a `cute' lead actress (Keira Knightly) and Geoffrey Rush, a very good actor (who has unfortunately made some, shall we say, `interesting' career choices in the last few years) as the main villain.  Plus we have a lot of sword fighting, perilous moments and an undead monkey  all elements that will bring the kids in droves to the multiplex.  Myself, I had no interest in seeing it really  mainly because I figured I would either A) embarrass myself by laughing at the pirate-speak, which never fails to set me off, or B) engage in said pirate-speak myself, thereby embarrassing both myself and whoever was unlucky enough to drag me to see the film in the first place.I could not ignore the buzz surrounding Johnny Depp's performance however, which ultimately is what got me into the theater in the first place.  He is *so* incredible as Jack Sparrow that even a subtle facial expression or use of body language was enough to make me laugh out loud.  I have long respected his career since he eschewed the mainstream `hunk' roles that he seemed to be genetically predisposed to doing after his stint on 21 Jump Street in favor of more avant garde fare, but this particular performance solidified my opinion that he is one of the best actors we have in the industry right now.  I remember hearing that he had taken this role last year and was disappointed that he seemed to be jumping from his independent/obscure film repertoire in favor of commercialism, but his inspired performance will without a doubt get me into the theater to see the sequel(s).In terms of the direction, I had absolutely no problem with Gore Verbinski's approach.  I found it to be atmospheric and evenly paced, and the special effects were impressive as well.  Conclusively, a good movie  with Johnny Depp, a great movie.--Shelly",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Celluloid Pirate,"In the eighteen century, in the West Indies of the Caribbean Sea, there roamed a magnificent seafaring group of individuals who prided themselves in not only creating an adventurous and certainly idealistic way of life, but enamored a secondary generation to emulate their deeds centuries after their demise. They became known as The Pirates of the Caribbean. Today, the Disney group is satisfying the demand of the visual interpretation of said pirates. Reflecting and certainly echoing their traditional exploits is Disney's film version of the same name. In this film, Johnny Depp, is fabulous as Captain Jack Sparrow. This individual is a small package filled with more excitement than a barrel of gunpowder. Throughout this film he consistently invites the viewer to follow him from multiple escapes, duels with sword makers, damsels in distress and British Soldiers from the port-cities and market towns, in search of a cursed ship called The Black Pearl. Strewn throughout this adventure are Depps' fellow actors which include, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Orlando Bloom who is superb as Will Turner, Jack Davenport as Norrington and Keira Knightley, as Elizabeth Swann whom seems at times incongruous and out of place as the precursor of a modern feminist. Despite the awesome, incredible, often ideal locations and speculator scenery, studded with everything, but the essentials allowing the film lack to resolution for Sparrow or the viewer. Often we anticipate either, to be thrust into yet another hair-raising adventure or a ghost chasing episode which is setting itself up for a further sequel. Thus despite it's wondrous appeal, and Sparrow's ever changing destiny and demeanor, ( which by the way is a bit, effeminate, the film lacks adhesion to either traditional pirates or to their eventuality. In the end, it's a good film, which insists on re-creating itself again and again. ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The worst film of all time,"It's so bad, i'm not even going to bother wasting any time on this.Suffice to say, the dialogue is forgettable, Johnny Depp acts drunk for 2 hours+ and he got an Oscar nomination????? Orlando bloom is flat and monotonous, and keira is just the eye candy. Plus, the movie does'nt seem to end, EVER!!!! It just goes on and on being smug and thinking it's funny. I guarantee people will look back on this film in a few years saying ""what the hell was i thinking?"" If you are over the age of 21 than there are good odds that you will not, i repeat WILL NOT enjoy this film.When i heard of POTC, i was expecting something witty, adventurous, surprising, romantic, exciting and full of great characters. Something along the lines of The Princess Bride but with a huge budget. But, instead we got this twaddle. A film that did well in America but comparative poorly everywhere else. I've learnt my lesson now. I'm not going to watch a film if it is doing well in America and just okay everywhere else. Don't get me wrong, i love America, but sometimes i have to wonder at the intellect of it's youth! (meet the fockers made $277m in America and only $113 in the rest of the world. Need i say more?) Another thing i will do before i go and see a film is look it up on IMDb and see who the writers are and who the directors are. If you don't like their previous work, you probably won't like their new film.What has happened to Hollywood. It seems to me that 1999 was the last great year of Hollywood with original ground breaking movies like The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, The Green Mile, Toy Story 2 etc.But i guess, now with dvds, Hollywood producers know that if a movie sucks at the box office, it will find an audience on DVD and eventually make it's money back. I guess thats why they'll give the go ahead with any movie idea these days.

I can wait until the next two movies!!!!My favorite part of this movie is where Jack and Elizabeth are marooned on the island.I also think the part where Elizabeth is on the Black Pearl and she tries to stab Barboosa is kinda cool.But i don't like the part is when Elizabeth says yes to Norington! I think it was smart to stand by Will. I like the part where Jhonny Depp and Orlando Bloom are in his house and they have that sword fight.I think the part where Jack is in the house alone and he puts the hot metal rod to the donkeys butt is very funny.It is so cool where Barboosa drinks that red wine. I also think the part where the pirates walk under water is so cool.I really like the part where Will and Jack walk under the canoe!If you have never seen this movie you don't know what you are missing!!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This film was awesome,"This film was the best film I have ever seen I was over the moon when I found out they were making another one!!! Johnny Depp,Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom were definitely the right people to choose to make this such a great film. The plot of the storyline is excellent but i am a bit worried that the next one will not be as good although i will still look forward to it and seeing all our favourite characters again whoa!!! The creators of this film were so lucky to have worked with such talented people.I just thought i would say that there is one mistake, near the beginning they tie Johhny Depps hand s together with iron bar thing but when he slides down the rope he puts his hands down the bar an in real life he would not be able to do that!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.""","The first time I watched this movie was sometime during the summer of 2003. I read about it a bit, heard about it from a friend, and decided it sounded like a nice movie, so I might as well go watch it. And at first, I came out thinking it was a nice movie, nothing more. But I had watched it again later. And again. And again. And you could say the movie grew on me, because while I admit this isn't the best film ever made, it is my favorite movie.So what makes this so great? It's fun. I can watch it many times over and over and never grow tired of it. Be it the incredible fight scenes, the captivating scenery, the rich and amusing dialogue, the interesting plot line, or the unbelievable acting, something about this movie never bores me and just has me watching it again and again. I have seen the Star Wars movies many times, and can find myself growing bored while watching them. I have seen the Indiana Jones films many times, and lately found myself beginning to grow a bit bored while watching them (they are still enormous fun, though). I have seen Pirates more than any of the previous films, and never once have I been bored with it. Too often I catch it on the TV, sit down to watch a favorite scene, and stick on for the rest of the movie. It simply never gets old, and it's just as fun to watch it the tenth time as it is to watch it the first time.Part of the reason for it is, I suppose, that the movie doesn't really rely much on its plot to progress. Sure, it has a good, solid and interesting plot: the town of Port Royal is attacked by the cursed pirate ship, the Black Pearl, captained by the vile captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter of the governor of Port Royal, is kidnapped by the pirates due to a certain medallion she possesses and the name she gives the pirates as her own. Young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the local blacksmith who has a secret love for Elizabeth, goes to rescue her and enlists to his help captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who has his own plans regarding Will, the Black Pearl and Barbossa. It is interesting to see how the plot develops, but what really holds you are the magnificent scenes that come one after another. Whether it's the amazing sword fights (such as the early fight between Will and Jack, an extremely well-choreographed and amusing clash), the naval battles (fire all cannons, arr!) or the stellar performance by Johnny Depp, each scene is as captivating as the previous.I have mentioned all the good things in this movie (and yes, there are a lot of them), but the absolute best is the acting: Bloom and Knightley are good as Will and Elizabeth, each portraying their characters personalities extremely well, and you can believe that the two care about each other. Geoffrey Rush is extremely captivating as the villainous captain Barbossa. He manages to look, feel and sound like a true villain (even adding a little ""arr!"" here and there) while still having us believe that Barbossa is a human after all, with motives and feelings. You can understand why he's doing what he's doing in the movie. And as for why he's a pirate - that's what rotten scalawags such as him do. The true star of this movie, though, is Johnny Depp. Jack Sparrow is incredible - he acts a bit drunk and a bit crazy (to the extent where you hardly see the difference when he actually is drunk!), yet he is also cunning, intelligent and thoughtful. He is also amusing to no end, dishing out funny lines one after another, while maintaining to remain serious when the time calls for it. Depp's acting in this movie is truly the best I have ever seen in my opinion, and I believe to this day that he has been robbed of his rightful Oscar.And finally, I can't help but mention, that simply the fact that this is a pirate movie makes it so fun. Pirates are fun, and I am really interested in pirates. This film may not give a historically accurate version of piracy (I don't recall undead pirates ever mentioned in history books) but it's still fun, and gives you everything you need when it comes to the romanticized view of pirates that's so dominant in today's modern culture.Jack Sparrow says at one time during the movie: ""Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate."" and this is especially true of this film. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is treasure. It's a captivating, enriching experience. You'll come out with a smile on your face, and the mood for swashbuckling. Anyone who hasn't watched it yet, hurry up and do. Anyone who has, go watch it again. It's worth it. I'd give it 11 out of 10 if only I could. ARR!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it!!!,"This is one of those rare movies that both parents and kids enjoy to the max!  The humor is good for both adults and kids, and action keeps everyone on the edge of their seats, and the ""spook"" issue is just perfect for kids....makes you jump and raises a few goose pimples, but no out and out gore (which I, personally, adore) to gross out the kiddies.  My family loved it, and can't wait until it hits video so we can have our own copy. Johnny Depp is the ultimate cutie!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A colourful, noisy,rumbustious adventure.","Without a doubt this is Johnny Depp's film. As Captain Jack Sparrow he shows once again what a versatile actor he is. He bursts forth on the screen as a wily pirate character full of tricks such as distracting his adversaries with non-stop chatter.His swaggering walk unsteadied by a little too much rum and his flippant manner endear him to us immediately.  He seems to fear no man, and despite his unkempt appearance has a way with the women too.Johnny Depp has a mammoth task.  He is on the screen most of the time.  The success of the film largely depends on his performance.  Never once does he shirk this responsibility.  Indeed he seems to enjoy every minute.The battles at sea with cannonballs flying through the air bringing down masts and rigging and gouging great holes in the decks are a triumph of set design.  Wooden ships are very inflammable and lend themselves to some dramatic moments with everything aflame amid noise and confusion.  There is almost too much to watch at one sitting.  It is just as well because the story is pretty thin.The film especiaslly in the sword-fighting episodes is reminiscent of some of the early serials that once excited us at the Saturday afternoon flicks. Despite clash of steel on steel not much blood is apparent among the roguish-looking pirates who all look as if they need a hot bath. The make-up is right on target, a real credit to the artists.Much of the time Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa has to act with a monkey sitting on his shoulder.  An excellent little touch I thought as it added to his nasty character.  I could not take my eyes off the monkey.  He stole every scene for me.If we may judge from the almost endless listing of credits, a lot of work was put into this production.  It's loud and noisy and lots of fun and will be especially appreciated by those who grew up on pirate stories, and as in all those stories it's the good that triumphs over evil in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fantastic new age pirate film with everything!,"Set in the 17th century, a time where Pirates ruled the Caribbean, we meet Jack Sparrow (Depp) an unpredictable pirate and Will Turner (Bloom) and honest blacksmith who loves the governors daughter Elizabeth Swann (Knightly). When Miss Swann is captured by the evil Captain Barbossa (Rush) and his crew of treacherous pirates who plan to use Elizabeth and her necklace to lift their curse, Will seeks out Jack and the mismatched pair go after Elizabeth, the Black Pearl (Barbossa's ship), adventure and revenge together. This movie is a great movie with fun for all the family. Johnny Depp really brings the film to life with his fantastic humour and great acting. Everything fits and the special affects are great.

Disneys classic story,As children everyone liked Disney everybody liked Disneys stories . This one was very impressive and maybe curious . Pirates of Caribbean are bringing some new dimension and the are really entertaining . This is one good classic and I really liked it . Scenes were impressive and they are well made . Whole movie is very adventurous and it is so good . Maybe movie will look like some fairytale but it is so attractive that I wanted to watch and other movies from this serial . Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow had stunning performance . Keira Knightley was also very good but maybe sometimes too childish . Orlando Bloom didn't impress me so much because of his maybe too uninteresting performance . Other characters were looking simply good . This movie in comparison with others is maybe too simply.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
just a few words...,"well, first of all, I really didn't want to go see this movie, I wanted to go to another, but now I'm happy I did.I don't say its without mistakes; it's a bit too long and some characters are flat and blank and as usual in Hollywood, Will and Elizabeth must be paired in the end... but no matter, it's still the best movie I've seen for years, especially thanks to the great performance of Johnny Depp, but also Geoffrey Rush helped it a lot.One thing I really don't understand is: what they want to make Pirates 2 about?!And that's about it...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Bearable summer swill,"This is a ""good fun for the family"" movie, if you prefer your adventure soft boiled. I can't quite decide whether Johhny Depp makes the movie better or worse. Without him it would certainly have been drearier, but with him it takes the movie from adventure to amusement park ride. He plays a scalawag pirate who is more of a swish, than swash, buckler. He teeters rather than swaggers, bombs out with the ladies, and never shows us any of the skills of a former Pirate Captain.He's the modern androgynous anti hero we've had to put up with since ""real men"" departed the movies.Geoffery Rush on the other hand is the anchor that holds this flimsy vehicle down. He is plays evil properly: with cold amusement, and a solid sense of his own superiority. He adds just the right trace of despair at his condition, and avoids all of Depp's silly stereotypical ""Pirate"" babble. A more ironic Director would have allowed him to escape his formulaic ending.Unfortunately the movie doesn't know how to take itself seriously, when that is required, preferring to trot in a comedy relief duo when no such relief is required, and to insist on allowing Depp's character to stay dizzily in character, when I, for one, desperately wanted him to show some passion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
old pirate movies put this one to shame,"The old pirate movies put this one to shame. The main couple is so dislikable with babbling honorably sounding dialogue but without showing one shred of goodness that you expect in a pirate movie. This is also reflected in the script, which makes them act as if with good intentions, but when you reflect, only to make them look good. Naturally the end is incredibly cheesy, events without motivation, impossible action, and quite good special effects and big breasts to keep the eye interested.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Huge Fan of the Film,"This is one of the best movies i've ever seen. After this movie I bought up all the Johnny Depp movies i could. Became a huge fan of his work. This is a definite pleaser when it comes to adventure! Johnny Depp played this part extremely well and no one else could do it like him. By putting a lot of himself in his work, he brought the character of Captain Jack Sparrow to life. Extremely well done by all the supporting actors and actresses. Bloom and Knightley has done a fantastic job playing their characters as well. Gore did an amazing job directing the film. The sequels are sure to be some of the biggest hits in box office history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Amazing action scenes and brilliant sets, this movie has it all. Good directing by Gore Verbinski and well done acting! This movie is recommended for all pirate lovers and other people who just like movies with loads of good actors. Johnny Depp is by far my best actor, but that does not mean that the others aren't. This movie is probably one of the best in the world and is very, very well done. The ships and battles are incredible. The ghosts are very realistic and funny (the guy with the glass eye) and a amazing sword duel to finish. Outstanding!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Barbossa's monkey stole the show for me.,"I know its 2024 when I am reviewing this movie when its a movie from 2003 and people really don't read these anyway but felt like putting my thoughts out there on the internet for people to read.As a man who grew up watching this and now at 22 rewatching this movie I can say that this is still the one move I think of when you talk about pirates. When I just think of a what a pirate should be than I look exactly at Jack Sparrow as a perfect example. Johnny as most of you by now already know does an AMAZING job at being Jack Sparrow and there for he is an AMAZING pirate. But not only Jack the whole crew of Barbossa was just a perfect example of what a pirate should be like and what I expect when I ask for pirates. This is just a beautiful example with a little bit of fantasy added onto it.I truly enjoyed the idea of a curse in the treasure, i always thought of pirates going after gold and treasure without really thinking about what curses could be on these treasures and who those treasures even belonged to, and I am not sure if I am underestimating the year 2003 technology or if I can say this with a full chest but the way the skeletons and i suppose CGI was done, it was really well done.For sure a movie to go back to once in a while when you have been missing your childhood and a good recommender for the young kids to remember these movies as classics.PS: If you got this far, the title was not a lie, I damn love monkeys and this one was best of both worlds , adorable and scary.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Have you ever seen a movie and thought: Wow! I've got to see this again?,"I saw the commercial for this film in the TV and I thought, Oh, I don't want to see this movie it is way to scary.

It has the wonderful mix of action, romance and humor that only a few, too few, movies have. I have now seen it so many times that I have stopped counting. I know must of the lines by heart and I still thinks it's a brilliant movie even when I know the ending. Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor and even when he's not in focus he completely steals the picture. Keira Knightley is gorgeous and Orlando Bloom is so handsome, but Johnny is the true star in this movie you just have to see.

"Fromage, but fun fromage","I had heard so much about Johnny Depp's performance in this film that I had to see it just because I am a fan of Johnny Depp. And he didn't disappoint either as Captain Jack Sparrow aka ""The Swishbuckler"". And others in the cast were fine as well including Geoffrey Rush even if my reaction was ""what is he doing in this fromage"". As the love interests Orlando Bloom was fine and Keira Knightley while no where near perfect was okay.But folks at the end of the day this was pure fromage. Fun but fromage nonetheless. From the moment Captain Jack (Johnny Depp) entered the scene and stepped off his sinking boat onto the dock all you could do is burst out laughing as you knew this was, well, pure fromage. And if course it didn't stop there to the Pirate with the glass eye, Geoffrey Rush playing the baddy to the hilt, all of the sword fights and while the Pirates changing into skeltons and back again was pure fromage it was well done at least especially the final battle scene with Depp and Rush. Topping the list of fromage was the Pirates den which looked like well something you would encounter at a cheesy theme park. Of course it was based on the Disneyworld Pirate theme park so what did you expect - realism.Okay this wasn't Academy Award material but Johhny Depp's performance might be and at least it was fun should save this piece of fromage from the Razzies. See it. But folks don't take this fromage too seriously. IMDB top 250 material this ain't despite its current score. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Way better than it appears,"Blockbusters are a real hit or miss for me. Sometimes they're so filled with clichés and bland characters I can't stand them, other times they surprise me with their level of quality. One example of the latter would be this movie, which I think is way better than it's given credit for, and there's multiple reasons for that. First of all is the immersion. The set, costume and sound design are all amazing and make it easy to pretend you really are in 18th century caribbean. The editing and cinematography are also both really good, and the score is practically perfect. The plot is engaging, the pacing is great and the worldbuilding is very well done. The characters are also good, Will and Elizabeth both have their struggles and weaknesses while also being pretty likeable. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley both play their roles exceptionally well. However, the movie's biggest stars are Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, each giving the best performance in their career, as Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa. While Sparrow is goofy, entertaining and a very likeable anti-hero, Barbossa is vicious and threatening, whole also having legitimate reason for his actions and understandable motivations. Every time one of them is on screen, it's a joy to watch. They both serve as important characters for the story while also being one-liner machines. This movie also has great continuity and lets no arc stay unfinished. This is a movie which has just grown on me as the years have passed, it's one of my all-time favorite movies and I have no problems giving it the highest rating I can.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Orlando Bloom and the 17 year old Keira Knightley have great chemistry in the movie and Geoffrey Rush with his unique style plays an also truly unique character in Hector Barbosa.

A review Complementing Pirates of the Caribbean,"This movie was excellent. Throughout the entire movie my friends and I were totally absorbed. We've needed a new Swashbuckling movie, a good one that is, for a long time, and this did it. I had my doubts because it was a disney movie and i was afraid they would ""disnafy"" it, but i didnt realize until someone pointed it out afterwards, that there was no cursing, MINIMAL gore and sex, Disney pulled off the pirate look well.It was an exciting drama, with fun action (and not just action for the sake of action, and im very tempted to call it a comedy as everyone in  the theatre was laughing.

The score is very good, and you find yourself having a lot of fun picking out the little elements of the ride.YES, they sing the song once or twice, which suited me very well. There's some other things, but I won't spoil them.The best part about the film is they never take themselves TOO seriously, which is perfect. You feel the atmosphere of the well-known and trademark ride in the film, which keeps the heart in place.

excellent Depp,"I would like to say, that I did not expected anything special from this ""movie of Disney production"". It is not a very best piece of art, but it is piece of art. I think, and I tell it to everybody with which I talk about films, that film is a kind of art. It is in essence a theater piece fashioned with modern digital effects and sounds and music. It is art and it is hard to say, that it is just good or bad. But shortly: this movie is family movie and story is very simple. Characters are not preciously described, but every ""holes"" are counterbalanced by Johny Depp's acting (and Rush). Without Depp it would be a little boring movie, but with him it is fun to see it even twice or more.

I found myself checking my watch several times-not a good thing.The length of the movie offset most of the good points for me and I gave the movie a 6/10.

"Go see this, Savvy?","I see a lot of movies, and this one is the best one that has graced the silver screen for a long, long time. This is the perfect movie to go see again and again - whether you're alone, with your parents, babysitting a child, with a group of friends, or your boyfriend; There is something for everyone. The cast is incredible, but hats off definitely to Johnny Depp. I've never been one for the actors themselves; I think a movie is good based on the basic plot, storyline, and if the actors and actresses can pull off a half-decent job of making it believable. But Johnny Depp was absolutely incredible in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow! I am very, very impressed. In truth, until reading all the other comments posted about this movie, I never even realized it was a ""long"" movie; the time seems to fly by when watching it! The plot is great. Some people may feel it's a ""same old"" type of story, but there is just something about the film which gives it an edge-of-your-seat excitement and anticipation. Yes, the ""good guy"" wins, and Orlando Bloom does get the girl, but the outcome is not quite so black-and-white as all that. In fact, certain places throughout the story raise an arched eyebrow in the more detailed observer. For example, has anyone stayed through the credits to see the very very last scene at the very end of the credits? Be forewarned: you will have to dodge brooms and ignore the exasperated sighs of cleaning people as they manouever around you, and yes, the lights will be on, but stay until the last credit rolls. You will see what I mean about leaving it open for something else. I have been on the Disneyland ride, and found it a favorite. I was thus overjoyed to see scenes from the ride in the movie. My personal favorite was the scene in the prison, when the men are trying to get the ""mangy mut"" to help them escape. I loved thsi attention to detail that reminded people that yes, this is a Disney movie, in case some had forgotten amidst the skeletal ghosts and slashing swords and the figure that results from the beautiful heroine wearing her dreaded corset. There were no holes in this plot that I found. To the individual who didn't think it was mentioned why the blood of Orlando Bloom's character was neeeded, Geoffrey Rush's character explains that each of the gold coins had to be brought back together in order for the curse to be broken. In addition, each of the pirates had paid for their ""sins"" of taking the cursed treasure with their blood through time. The only pirate who had taken a gold piece, not returned it, and did not give any of his blood to ""the cause"" was the unseen character of Orlando Bloom's father. Just to clear up any misconceptions. This is an excellent movie, whether you want to see a romance, a happy ending, a plot with a few twists thrown in, an adventure, a fantasy, or anything inbetween. This movie cannot come highly enough recommended.

What's all the praise over,"This movie was OK, but not what I call great. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.  Johnny Depp is good and has to be since his character carries the film. But, I was expecting to get a lot more laughs out of him, and I didn't. The plot was OK, but not what I call original.  Of course, the special effects with the skeleton pirates were great. That must have been a huge part of the budget.  I guess since the horrible Mummy 2 and Tomb Raider movies, audiences went crazy over this adventure type of film because it didn't suck like so many recent summer flicks.Also, Rush made a good villian. But, I don't think Bloom or Knightly were outstanding. Anyone could have done those roles. I see they are already planning a sequel.  Considering how paper thin the plot was for this one, the sequel will likly be bad like Mummy 2, but make a lot of money.FINAL VERDICT:  If you are into the adventure movies, then this one is for you.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
God bless Jack Sparrow,"This is one of those movies I'll rate higher than I really should because it's pure nostalgia for me. I was in kindergarten when it came out, and this film was responsible for an extended pirate phase. Hell, I still want to be a pirate. The aesthetic in this movie is a powerful thing, and the character who embodies that aesthetic is, of course, Jack Sparrow.Oh, Jack Sparrow. I never had a crush on you, but you were and are #goals - a seaborne Mick Jagger swaggering down-ship with a bottle of rum, radiating a good-humored nihilism that even my child-self knew to envy. There's a surprising amount beneath the surface with Sparrow, but ultimately, he captures and complicates the conflict between fantasy and reality that defines this genre. All the other characters are pure period drama or pure fantasy. Sparrow quite literally walks the line between real and myth, and because of it he's the essence of a swashbuckler.

Fun and frolics on the high seas with Cap'ns Depp and Rush. High summer camp but not quite the masterpiece it could have been,"Johnny Depp and co shiver their timbers, hoist the mains'l and buckle their swashes in this jolly romp on the high seas.The, frankly, bonkers plot sees much toing and froing and double double crossing as Jack Sparrow tries to reclaim his ship, the semi-mythical Black Pearl, now captained by Barbarossa. He in turn is hell bent on lifting the curse on him and his men by trying to recover an ancient Aztec coin belonging to British Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann.Depp steals the show as brain-addled pirate, Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush hams it up as Jack Sparrow's nemesis Barbarossa but lacks the true menace of, say, Alan Rickman in Robin Hood. Keira Knightley is the spunky love interest, Elizabeth Swann while Orlando Bloom once again dons tights for his action role as her unrequited love.The other standout performance is that of Jack Davenport as Keira Knightley's fiance. British viewers will know Davenport as Miles from the BBC's This Life. Here he returns to form as the sneering, preening, supercilious Commodore Norrington after his shot in the BBC's lamentable 'comedy' Coupling.Strangely, the action scenes are leaden, lacking the panache of the Errol Flynn-like movies of yesteryear. These needed better editing and, in fact, the slow second act could have done with some judicious pruning, easily losing fifteen to twenty minutes off the running time.However, all in all, great fun that rises head and shoulders over the rest of the summer's disappointing releases.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Johnny Deep is Jack...So amazing,"I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. This movie was so cleverlishly funny ( is that even a word, well it is now) and witty. The movie as a whole is just perfect to me because the graphics was so realistic, I truly believe there is an under water world of hunted pirates. Whenever I watch a movie there is usually one person who does not fit ""their character to me , but not here. Every person was meant for their role in this movie. So my hat goes off to the entire cast and crew for this creation. This movie has action, has love, has mystery, has laughter and sadness.

This can impossibly appeal to an adult audience,"If you voted 10 for this film, you'd better be 10 years old or else this is simply unforgivable.Pirates of the Caribbean is a truly excruciating experience. I hate this film on so many levels, covering so many aspects and ranging from crew to cast that it actually makes me physically ill to watch. So if I hate this film to the core, then what's the 2/10 for, you ask? The answer is; I think this film could be entertaining to kids and the odd pre-teen. It is, after all, a Disney production based on a popular Disney ride in a theme park and I think this explains its paper-thin plot of ""saving the damsel in distress (Keira Knightley), killing the bad guy (Geoffrey Rush) and having an over-the-top comedic sidekick (Johnny Depp) whilst doing it"".I don't know whose genius idea it was to cast Orlando Bloom as the romantic and heroic lead, but this choice helps him cement his position as the resident Hollywood lucky-guy, getting by without so much as a shred of talent, but inexplicably being offered big-budget project after the other. Furthermore, my theory is that Bloom's bad acting is contagious and affected the rest of the cast of Pirates of the Caribbean like a nasty case of the flu. Keira Knightley is a stunning woman but all she does here is pout with her pretty lips until she gets to deliver some cheeseball tough-chick line like ""You like pain? *WHAM* Try wearing a corset."" I'm no member of the Depp camp but I think he has pulled off some great performances in the past, but in Pirates, he is so over-the-top and corny that this can impossibly appeal to an adult audience.So aside from the cringe-worthy ""corset"" line by Keira Knightley, the dialogue-writing on the film really puzzles me. It's like it's camp but not intentionally. I believe this film truly thinks it's clever and amusing when it's only extremely embarrassing. Juvenile generic action sequences, long-drawn segments, contrived performances, dumb plot and overblown special effects make Pirates of the Caribbean an unwatchable adventure.2/10",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A well-acted classic,"The two absolute stand-outs about the show are the score and Jack Sparrow. Firstly, the score is all it is hyped up to be. I had never seen the Pirates movies before but the second that thrilling piece started pumping during the first sword fight scene, I felt that I had known it forever. The music makes you want to rush into battle with the characters just to cheer them on. At the end of the day, what really carries this film to the heights it reached is Jack Sparrow. The combination of some of the best make-up/costume design ever done and top tier acting makes this character unforgettable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I like seeing him better as a kick-butt elf- but thats only my opinion. I think Johnny Depp did the best acting there. He really did a great job being ""the worst pirate there is"" and totally brought his character to life. The walk, the talk, the comedic performance here and there.. i'd give Mr. Depp an A+.

A STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL OLD FASHIONED FANTASY GHOST STORY ADVENTURE,"This is the best of the ""Pirates"" franchise & one of the greatest fantasy-adventure films ever made.
I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen way back in 2003 upon it's release & i loved it & still do in 2020!!!""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a fantastic piece of filmmaking as well as a big summer blockbuster film, everything from the absolutely stunning production design & outstanding special effects to the Amazing music score & excellent performances are all perfect & put together created a Masterpiece.Simple-basic story is about a famous pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) who teams up with a young Blacksmith named Will Turner (Bloom) who set sail on a thrilling adventure to rescue the princess Elizabeth (Knightley) & battle the Evil supernatural pirates lead by Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) & all hell breaks loose. That's the basic plot but of course there's lots more going on with Magic Medallions & Zombies & Battles & a whole lot of Fun.I loved all the performances here, especially the heroic turn as Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom, i liked his character more than Captain Jack Sparrow (which everyone became obsessed with?) Now Bloom is everybit the handsome & willing fighter out to save his true love Elizabeth. Depp is silly & fun as Jack Sparrow & very bizarre but good fun & Keira Knightley is great as the quick thinking & beautiful Elizabeth but who really steals the show here in my opinion is the fantastic Geoffrey Rush as the Evil, Funny & Cunning Captain Bambosa, he's a hilarious villain with such a great voice & it's the standout performance here for me.
The supernatural Zombie pirates look Amazing on screen with truly stunning special effects that make the pirates look scary rather than comical as you might expect from a big budget Disney production, here everything looks spectacular.
The ships are so richly textured & beautifully detailed as is all the costumes & fantastic sets, all the best quality possible.The Curse of the Black Pearl is truly a rip-roaring, swashbuckling fantasy adventure full of fun & magic.
An instant CLASSIC & a film that be watched over & over again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great poster, lousy movie","To tell you the truth I can't remember much about the plot--and I just saw it last night!  Something about a cursed pirate ship and its crew and how they all turn to skeletons when moonlight hits them and how they need some coins or something to release the curse...I was so bored during this film my mind kept wandering.  Maybe I just don't like pirate films but I think there's more to it than that.This film has some major problems--it's way too long (half an hour could have been cut out easily); the story is (needlessly) convoluted and very badly done (I'm blaming the screenwriters and director, NOT the actors); despite all the explosions and fights the action scenes are surprisingly dull; there's loads of casual violence; leading lady Knightley is constantly being hit in the face and the admittedly great special effects just didn't grab me.  There is a spectacular sword fight at the end with the men going in and out of moonlight and going from skeleton to man and back again--but it's too little too late.  The direction is WAY off too--he seems unsure of how to frame scenes and it makes things very confusing.I can't fault the actors--Orlando Bloom (very handsome with beautiful black eyes) is very good in a badly written role. Keira Knightly's role is even worse--she's just ""the girl"" in the movie and no one could be good in it. Geoffrey Rush is OK as the pirate chief.  Johnny Depp is the one reason to watch this movie.  His performance is so off-beat and funny he keeps the film afloat.  Just his mannerisms and facial expressions give an unexpected kick to lines.So...this handsome production sinks because of bad direction, ridiculous length and many many boring stretches.  Unless you're a huge fan of pirate movies you can skip this one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Older kids and adults can enjoy the play of good, the bad, and the ugly in a marvelous storyline of fantasy, adventure, and chivalry of a sort.

"YO, HO, HO and a Mixed Bag of Fun","Midway through the third installment of Walt Disney's deliriously popular pirate franchise, a character says of Capt. Jack Sparrow (played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history), ""Is he making this up as he goes along?"" Shiver me timbers, mateys, but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers, er, writers, the same question of the entire series.I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" but I saw its appeal. It was far too long and sloppy, criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well. I can't even really remember the plot. It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa (the marvelous Geoffrey Rush, bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings) and his army of undead, and Sparrow's efforts, along with that most boring pair of screen lovers, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to get it back. Depending on your perspective, that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface, because ""Pirates"" is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle. Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie (or trilogy of movies) and so much of it not mattered a bit. It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself, and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality. Well, it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken, and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel.That sequel, ""Dead Man's Chest,"" takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance. What a gormless mess the second part is, all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence. A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment. Indeed, the whole film is really set up for part three, yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax. Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones (no, not the Monkey), looking like a serving of very angry calamari, and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I. ""Dead Man's Chest"" makes no sense whatsoever, and it's not really even very fun. Even in a mindless action movie, one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about.So it pleases me to report that the third and (maybe?) final entry, ""At World's End,"" gets more right than not, and provides a tremendous amount of fun. It doesn't even feel overly long, despite its run time of nearly three hours. The ""Pirates"" movies' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled, and there are moments in this film, when the cast is all together at the same time, that rival ""Star Wars"" for sheer screen chemistry. Rush returns, so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy, and of course Johnny Depp is back, and returns to the inspired performance (and surpasses the downright nuttiness) that made the first installment so memorable. Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition, but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him. There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment, perhaps the most in the series, which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along -- a sort of Indiana Jones set on water. My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment, until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest (if most unintentional) belly laugh of them all. Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing, Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass?The ""Pirates"" trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre, but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America.Grade: ""Curse of the Black Pearl"": B ""Dead Man's Chest"": C- ""At World's End"": A-",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Decent!,"Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the British fleet.A great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story.

Some movies become classics because they're overall masterpieces like The Godfather, they become a phenomenon like Star Wars, or they set a new bar like The Matrix. But sometimes, like Pirates of the Caribbean each element may just be good but the sum of it all just works resulting in greatness. When I first went to see it in theaters, I really didn't expect much from a Disney ride inspired flick; what a surprise! It has everything an epic adventure movie should have and Johnny Depps' performance is just icing on the cake. Here we are 18 years later and I still enjoy it like the first time I saw it.

Strong Film But Depp Lifts It To A Different Level,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl might be the best pirate movie but it certainly isn't the most accurate one, giving them a far better image than they deserve. However, how can you point that out when this happens to also be one featuring ghost pirates too? It goes for effect and excitement more than anything else and as far as a swashbuckling adventure goes it's as good a one you'll find. The score's terrific and the writers, director, and supporting cast are all strong, but we all know what brings this movie up from just decent is Johnny Depp. To say he's the most memorable part of the movie is an understatement-he is the movie. I don't think I've ever seen an actor construct a more unique and interesting character and utterly consume a film with his performance as Johnny Depp does here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Savvy?,"The cinematography on this film is what makes it outstanding. Whether it's Elizabeth Swann preparing to faint from a too-tight-corset on a parapet, or the tattered Black Pearl sailing in the moonlight, there's always something wondrous to gaze at on the screen. One fantastic underwater shot peruses a school of hammerheads as they drift endlessly through an underwater cove of sunken, ghostly ships. The introductory scene is also stunning, one of the most spell-casting experiences I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The Interceptor creeping through a mist-shrouded sea, the umbrella floating by, the magnificent horror of seeing a burning merchant ship, and our first glimpse of the Black Pearl as it sails into the fog. This scene alone makes the movie ticket price well worth it... and that's only the first four minutes.As many profession and personal critics have observed, the film belongs to Johnny Depp's memorable performance as ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow, the single pirate able to elude the curse thanks to his crew mutinying before the gold could be spent. But the other performers shouldn't be overlooked in his hilariously likable wake. In the role of a very strong, independent heroine, Kiera Knightley manages to be both beautiful and spirited without escaping into cliché. Orlando Bloom is more likable here than as the aloof Legolas he's become so well known for; with some excellent action scenes, he shows his unique skill with a blade as well as has the opportunity to carry off a romantic lead with a keen flair. Geoffrey Rush is at his best; being a fan of his endeavors, it was a pleasure to watch him on screen in a very different, very misunderstood role. He manages to make Barbossa both fascinating, horrible, and yet have a shred of sorrow at the end for his passing. Two extremely underrated actors, Britain's Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce, are given the respective roles of Commodore Norrington, Elizabeth's unfortunate fiancée, and her governor father.For once, scriptwriters haven't copped out and given us an easy decision. While being slightly arrogant and something of an egotist, Norrington is also extremely likable, a perfect gentleman, and one might even go so far as to say, the most noble character by the closing credits. Davenport plays him with just the right amount of lethargic enthusiasm and irritation; his scenes with Depp, always wrought with blatant humor, are some of the film's finest moments. Pryce doesn't have a lot to work with, but the audience cannot help but chuckle over some of his humorous traits, such as fighting a skeletal hand for his magnanimous wig. The music is also first-rate, very mood-setting with a certain sense of dramatic tension even in romantic scenes. The film is well worth a PG13 rating, but is never inappropriate for younger audiences. The mild innuendo will go over children's heads (and most parents as well, for that matter -- only literature history-lovers will pick up some of the sly historical jests), the violence is all quite bloodless, and there's virtually no profanity. The pirates are properly frightening and in various stages of decay, extremely cool from a CGI perspective.A movie well worth its praise, and one you simply MUST own on DVD for all its subtleties.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl: 6/10,"For some reason, I've never liked Johnny Depp. Ever since I saw him die in A Nightmare on Elm Street and I was glad, I wasn't a Depp fan. However, as Captain Jack Sparrow, not only is he able to deliver snappy one-liners, he proves to BE the movie. If it wasn't for Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl wouldn't have a tongue-in-cheek feel; it would just seem like it was a serious pirate movie, which, by Jove, it isn't. There's nothing in it that's remotely bound to happen.The story, which was based on a Disney World ride, has Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, aka the hot girl from Bend it Like Beckham) with a golden medallion, and bloodthirsty pirates come to kidnap her for it. If regular `yo-ho-ho' pirates weren't enough, they're zombie/ghost/skeleton pirates that cannot be killed. However, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, who was added into this movie just so teenage girls would see it and swoon over him), who's smitten with her, tries to rescue her with the help of Cpt. Jack Sparrow (Depp). Soon they're in way over their head.As the previews for this movie started to come out, I had my doubts. I thought that this was going to be the worst movie of the summer, with a plot more contrived that Anger Management. Zombie pirates? Ech. Also, my grudge against Johnny Depp held me back. However, after hearing mainly positive reviews, and learning that Depp was actually good, I thought that I'd give it a try. And it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's not a piece of art, but it's a movie I wouldn't mind seeing again.The plot is, frankly, really stupid. Like most movies of the summer, they focus too much on having a plot instead of having two hours of rollicking fun. However, Pirates of the Caribbean tries to have a real deep, moving plot, while it suffers with it. It bogs down the fun that we could be having. Also, while all of the fight scenes were pretty good, there were too manynot to say boring, but not exciting scenes.Depp was pretty funny, but he also proved himself to be a welcome screen presence. I found myself amazed to actually be WANTING more Depp. If you've seen any trailers for Pirates of the Caribbean, which I think everyone in the country has, you know what he'll be like. However, I must object to the casting of Bloom. Just because he can be considered easy on the eyes doesn't make him a good actor, and he isn't. Every time he was onscreen, I was waiting for him to leave so Depp can do more onscreen. However, Gore `The Ring' Verbinski thought that somehow he wouldn't receive as much money if the reason half of the audience went to the theater wasn't on screen a lot, so in about every place, Orlando Bloom is on screen. Knightley, who was billed fourth and had the most screen time, was pretty good, but I think that she should stick to comedy.Even if you hate Disney (as I do), you'll be able to find something to like about the first PG-13 `straight Disney' film, whether it be the tongue-in-cheek humor, the few good swashbuckling scenes, or the horrible plot.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for action/adventure violence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The worst movie I saw in years; beats King Arthur.,"Simply said: no plot at all. What's happening? Depp is ridiculous in his acting. Anyone calling this humor, should think better. Full of improbabilities. The movie jumps from one topic to the next without any logical sequence. The characters are not properly developed. Keira is excellent, but cannot save this non-product. You expect a pirate movie - not necessarily full of romance, but this film lacks any trace of it. For instance: if you don't love Norrington, who then do you really love? A writer could do better than this. The movie is definitely not based on Disney's P. of the C. Anyone doubting that should go and visit the Real Pirates at Disneyland. I saw some bad movies, but this one beats a lot of them.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Adventure for everyone!,"Johnny Depp stars as Captain Jack Sparrow, in this film that was created from Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean amusement at Disney World in Florida.Directed by Gore Verbinski, the film tells the story of Captain Jack Sparrow, a humorous, egotistical,  unpredictable  pirate, who is attempting to catch the Black Pearl'  a pirate ship `with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil, that hell itself spat him back out'. After saving the Governor's daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) from drowning, Sparrow is arrested as a pirate and taken to jail where he awaits the gallows. In search of lost Cortez gold, the Black Pearl and a motley crew of pirates (led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)) raid the town and kidnap Elizabeth. The blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), in love with Elizabeth springs Sparrow from jail in return for his help in tracking down the Black Pearl and saving Elizabeth.Depp's own quirkiness brings Captain Jack Sparrow to life, continuing his tradition of portraying rather unusual roles. Bloom and Knightly play their roles wonderfully, while Rush, so versatile in his character portrayal, presents himself as an enjoyable bad guy' to watch. Pirates of the Caribbean  Curse of the black pearl was filmed on location around St. Vincent and the Grenadines, providing a spectacular backdrop of crystal clear blue waters and picturesque islands. The special effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic and as usual, blend into the live-action seamlessly. Merge all of this together with the wonderful musical score by Hans Zimmer (who created the music for Gladiator and numerous other films) and you have a really enjoyable experience.Obviously you can't have a film about cursed pirates without a little horror, and although most violence is implied and not shown in this film, this is the first Disney film ever, to be rated PG-13 in the United States, and M in Australia. This film is definitely a fun, adventurous family film, but some children under fourteen may find the occasional scene within this film disturbing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best movie.,"I think the writer of this play must receive a lot of awards and praise because the movie produced is considered a very high quality movie. Until making it memorable for people all over the world. The beginning of the movie is not boring because it has interesting action scenes. But the story goes on. There are some uninteresting scenes. But not much, mostly things are exciting. The first film will reach its peak as Captains Jack and Will begin stealing the Interceptor in order to find Jack's Black Pearl and Will's kidnapped lover. Will wants to help the Elizabeth, who's he falls in love with. So he borrows the hand of a seafarer like Jack in his pursuit of the Black Pearl. Will helps Jack break out of prison and steal a ship traveling to Tortuga. Starting the journey until meeting the other members of the ship, the scenes and CG that the filmmakers have done are of the highest quality and realism, such as scenes at sea, sea adventure scenes in movies. Including scenes with explosions Especially the scene where skeletons were rampant. They are very realistic, there will be a continuity of movement, Flawless. But this part has little effect, but it's all good. My favorite scene is the fight in the cave between Captain Barbosa and Captain Jack. And I think the editing and creativity of this film crew made it possible for audiences to recognize their dedication. Writer's attention. The director and the rest of the film's crewIn the matter of the actors of this movie. I think everybody's hit the mark, like the first person, Captain Jack, the main character. Is a person with a provocative personality. There are always sayings that can make you laugh. But the personality that is like an unusual person. Instead, it is hidden with determination and earnestness that many people find hard to understand. Like the personality of someone who keeps his emotions on guard. He's a hard-to-reach, hard-to-find, and memorable personality. There may be some people who know Captain Jack Sparrow but don't know the movie. It could be said that without Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie wouldn't be Pirates of the Caribbean at all. The actor who played the ghost in the film. Everyone performed it very well. Play the role that you have been given to the fullest without any defects. And other main protagonists, I think he put a lot of effort into this movie. All actors act naturally. Blending with the characters as if they were the same person, and in the end, this movie wouldn't be good without all the quality actors of this story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

In my top 5 list of my favorite movies..no joke,"I had wanted to see this film badly so when I walked in the theater I was already very excited..but nothing could prepare me for HOW GOOD IT IS!....Hands down to Disney who FINALLY make a stupendousely entertaining movie..good move on their part.You walk out of the theater in utter refreshment...and Pirates..will leave you satisfied and worth your 6 bucks, definatley the best movie of the summer no competition. You got it all in one movie..comedy,action,drama,romance...and each genre is pulled off with magnificence. Orlando Bloom is the heroic hottie that proved that he can play more than a blonde elf, and of course I think he's hot property for young Hollywood. The same goes for Miss Kiera Knightly, who is stunningly beautiful and Im looking forward for more of her. Geoffery Rush is of course the perfect bad guy who manages to reach into your heart. HOWEVER HATS OFF TO JOHNNY DEPP! As I've read on here everyone is saying the smae thing Mr. Depp steals the show. Before this movie Depp was OK for me I didn't love but I didn't hate him, however after watching this movie I've grown to idolize the guy. He's ASTOUNDING as Cpt. Jack Sparrow, the eccentric good-guy pirate. He also has these really funny one liners throughout the whole movie that are worth your money just to see him act out. I BOW DOWN TO JOHHNY DEPP for without a doubt providing the best performance of the summer or if I dare say so far this year! Go JOHNNY! GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I have yet to see a bad review on here and believe me if you don't enjoy this movie somethiings the matter with you..:) SCORE:8.5 out of 10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Pirate Blockbluster,"Unlike a lot of people, I thought the Pirates of the Caribbean series was okay, entertaining in place, but not great. Pirate films have a history of being flops, from Roman Polanski's Pirates to the biggest Blockbuster failure Cutthroat Island. Pirates of the Caribbean also has a filmy source material, a ride at Disneyworld (and the Florida version isn't that good). So the signs weren't good. However, the film is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer who has made a large number of blockbusters, had writers who were involved in successful films like Aladdin, the Mask of Zorro, Antz, Shrek and Colleratal, and staring Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush.POTC is set in the 17th Century, set in the Caribbean (surprise surprise). Sailing from England to Port Royal, Jamaica, the young Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and her father, the Governor of the island (Jonathan Pryce) find a young boy, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) floating in the ocean. The film fast-forwards to when Elizabeth and Will are young adults, Elizabeth still the daughter of the governor and Will is a blacksmith. Will is in love with Elizabeth but doesn't do anything about it. However their world is rocked when Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) shows up. He saves Elizabeth from drowning before getting arrested by the British authorities. That night Port Royal is attacked by pirates from the Black Pearl, with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) leading them. Elizabeth is kidnapped and Jack and Will have to chase to save her.Now the film is hokum, but that's acceptable. It is meant for a family entertainment. It also adds supernatural elements and it felt similar to the Mummy, even have similar action scenes. This film in the series has the simplest plot and has many humorous elements. The action is top-draw, mixing live-action and CGI, the whole series is known for it special effects and had an excellent score. The acting is hit and miss. Johnny Depp is entertaining as the drunken, distruthful Jack Sparrow. This is Johnny Depp's first blockbuster, in the past often rejecting big budget movies to work on smaller projects. Depp is a brilliant actor. Geoffrey Rush is an actor who added gravitas to project and makes an excellent villain; the films allows him to have some fun. Johnathan Pryce was underused in the film, but still made his character a good but indifferent being. Keira Knightley was okay, I don't mind her, she is very easy on the eye. Orlando Bloom is a bit wet and he has been type-casted since Lord of the Rings (he has been in Troy and Kingdom of Heaven). The film is too long and the story is not the best. It is filled with pirate clichés. Gore Verbinski is more comfortable with the action scenes then character development. Most of the humours comes from Jack Sparrow and often slapstick.Basically the film is entertaining enough, 3 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Save this for a rainy day,"If you read reviews of films in various newspapers and magazines, you will eventually notice trends in writing styles and points that are made in the discourses of the reviewers. In short, when they find something they think sounds important, they all focus on the same topic, and in a manner which seems meant to show off their petty vernacular skills, they make sophemoric quips and plays on the title of said flick, and/or gobble up several pages of the calendar section with mindless tripe that doesn't really get the reader anywhere. Not that a film critic really serves much purpose in the world, and thus shouldn't be taken too seriously, however, it is the fact that they are given so much attention for their interchangeably identical opinions that they should be avoided at all costs. Their recurringly similar reviews quite literally ruin movies, for they build an impression of a film before an individual has even seen it. In some cases this can be a good thing, i.e. advice to avoid a surefire disaster, or something like that. Yet when said impression is not met by the actual viewing of the film, disappointment inevitably ensues. This really only concerns films that would have been a nice little surprise, where one walks out of the theater and says, ""That was just a fun movie."" People who read film reviews don't get that pleasure anymore, and so, when a reviewer says, ""i wasn't expecting anything, and this turned out to be enjoyable, the audience then goes into the film expecting something that they otherwise would not have, and then, don't enjoy the film as much. This was the case with Pirates, where there was such a deluge of reviews claiming that this was a terrific, fun summer movie, with a bravura performance by Johnny Depp, that by the time one actually saw the movie, it seemed dull and pointless. Been there, done that sort of feeling. I say, damn the reviewers for taking what was a nice little movie, and blowing it into something that it wasn't, so that it seemed like an umpteenth viewing of Star Tours up on the screen. You new everything that was going to happen, every quirk and eccentricity, and so, it wasn't new, fresh, or really anything. In short, I advise people to ignore reviews, and see a film for themselves first, to determine what they want to think about a movie. This would probably have been a nice little diversion, so I would recommend it, if only on the grounds that one carries no expectations into it, so that they are not disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Klaus Badelt's score is phenomenal,"This really is one of the best adventure movies of this year (possibly of all time) but as yet another glowing review would be redundant, I will instead focus on the score. Klaus Badelt's score is amazing. If you don't already own the CD for this movie, buy it. Though not quite a prodigy of Hans Zimmer, they often work together, and I know his style has been compared to Zimmers, but Badelt's style goes beyond Zimmer's in originality, and freshness, and the result is one of the best scores of all time, in my opinion. I do have to say, however, that I am disappointed to learn that Badelt will not be reprising his role as composer in the upcoming Pirate's films, and that sadly Zimmer has ousted him for that spot. I do not believe he will be able to do them justice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just Plain Awful,"First off, having a movie based on a Disney ride seemed ridiculous. Second, having Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom together in a movie seemed terrible. The outcome? A painful 2 hours I'll never get back. The movie doesn't even have a pirate theme. There's no stealing, killing, drinking, etc. Just fighting off fake CGI skeletons on a stupid ship. I don't know how this garbage made it to the top 250 list. The cheesy dialogue, dull action scenes, cardboard acting, lame use of CGI, and the ludicrous plot made this as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm also beginning to think this is a total chick-flick, since the only people who watch it are peppy girls who drool over Depp's fake look in the movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Well worth the watch!!,"This film is full of humor, action and special effects, basically what everybody loves in films.

In fact Cutthroat Island for all it's flaws had far superior action sequences.  The only thing that really makes this movie better than this Summer's other Hollywood blow 'em up crap like Charlie's Angels Full Throttle and Terminator 3 is Johnny Depp.  He brings great humor and eccentricity to every scene he is in and single handedly makes this pirate movie a hoot.

An excellent surprise,"This was a movie whose trailor was played all day, everyday, as the build-up to the release loomed here in Cape Town.  Me, im one for swash-buckling pirates and handsome hero's, so of course i was intruiged and dutifully paid the fee to see the movie, although i have to add that my expectations were sky high, and this is normally a recipe for intense disappointment.But not this day, this movie.  It had me from the opening sequence, to the end credits and left me wanting more.  i found the entire movie a marvel, the characters well scripted and perfectly brought to life.  above all of that though, the humour and wit brought forth by the wondeful Jack Sparrow and counterparts made the film.  the chemistry was perfect and this is definitely a movie i would indeed pay to see once again.as mentioned, Johnny Depp was PERFECTLY cast as Jack Sparrow, Captain Jack Sparrow that is.  He melded with this character and there is truthfully none other i could see in the role.  it was tailor made and he fit it like a glove.  it was also interestingly refreshing to see him in a role that departed from the ""Sleepy Hollow"" ""From Hell"" spectrums of the last few years.Orlando Bloom, an actor surrounded with much hype.  and i have to say much deserved.  He was fantastic, and a wonderful support.  Will Turners chemistry with Captain Jack is a marvel to watch and i found myself smiling an aweful lot.  and yes, i too drowned in his gorgeously long lashed eyes!Kiera Knightly, the herione is one that i did not care for much.  despite her success in Bend it like Beckham, Kiera never really captivated me, but even she had me smiling and praising the casting directors for their choice. she was lovely and a wonderful foil for the otherwise all male cast.there is no other rating but 5/5; 10/10 Excellent, and more inportantly a movie that EVERYONE, adult and child alike would love.  something for everyone!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not too much action, not too much love, just right.","I went to the Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl the second week it opened. The theater was packed, which I found unusual since the last movie we had gone to, The Matrix: Reloaded, was completely empty except us. (I figured out why by the end of each)I had little interest in watching this movie going into the theater. I figured it would be all action or boring plot.I'd have to say this movie was just the right mixture of action, comedy, love, and fantasy, to make viewing a very pleasurable activity for all ages. Johnny Depp is great as a pirate, and the character is deep enough to make me wish both leading men ""got the girl"" at the end of the movie. Too bad there's only one leading woman.The authenticity of the dialogue, look, and feel of this movie is about 5/6 believable, but that's close enough. The special effects are pretty cool and they aren't overpowering the whole movie which is good. I thought the casting was very well done also.The slight twist at the climax of the movie was almost unexpected.I just don't feel the father would have reacted that way at the very end. Not in those days he wouldn't have... public hangings were a family event... But it does give the movie a somewhat happy ending.I went in thinking I would review this movie about a 2 out of 10, but once I started opening my mind to it, I came out rating this movie 7.5 out of 10.At least one good movie was made this year!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A pirates life for me,"A fascinating blend of action, adventure, comedy, horror & fantasy, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a brilliantly scripted, skilfully directed & cleverly narrated cinema that paints an interesting portrait of pirates mythology on the film canvas like never before and is also notable for bringing to life one of the most iconic characters of 21st century cinema.The story of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl follows the quest of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow who teams up with a talented blacksmith, Will Turner, to rescue the latter's love, Elizabeth Swann, who's been taken hostage on the notorious pirate ship, Black Pearl, which is commanded by the feared Captain Barbossa and carries a crew of cursed men who were once Jack's allies.Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean brims with an energetic & creative vibe which keeps the story refreshing throughout its runtime, doesn't take much time to get its main plot moving, and with its firm grip on refined storytelling ends up infusing a new life into the pirates genre. The screenplay handles its different genres with remarkable ease and also exhibits a fine balance between its various elements.The production design team does a stellar job with its period sets & meticulously designed ships. Cinematography makes fab use of its camera to capture each sequence in fine detail, use of colour palette is quite splendid and the expertly staged camera angles & movements make its story all the more captivating. Even the Costumes are pretty much in tune with the depicted timeline, and the work in make-up department is no slouch either.Editing is undoubtedly one of its strongest highlights for it never allows the viewers to settle down, keeps the adventurous tone alive & kicking all the way from start to finish, and paces its 143 minutes of story amazingly well. Visual effects is state-of-the-art stuff which blends into the narrative quite seamlessly. The background score is composed by Klaus Badelt and is an absolute delight that enhances the whole experience by a great deal with its pulsating tracks.Coming to the performances, Pirates of the Caribbean features an awesome cast in Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley and they all manage to leave their mark, one way or another. Depp makes Jack Sparrow completely his own for it's his added inputs only which gives his character a unique look & edge over the others, and there isn't one scene where he isn't the show-stealer. Rush also impresses a lot with his crazy take on Captain Barbossa, while Bloom & Knightley deliver good performances in their given roles.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a powerhouse of action, spectacle & humour that's loaded with all the ingredients one requires to make a great blockbuster, which it is in every sense of the word. A work of ingenious craftsmanship that packs in a whole lot of fun, absolutely nails its comic timing, wonderfully balance all its aspects, delivers an entertainment worth your time & money, and is a highly enjoyable, unforgettable & swashbuckling ride that presents Johnny Depp at the pinnacle of his talents while permanently engraving Captain Jack Sparrow into the annals of cinema & pop culture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Johnny Depp takes the part of a half maddened pirate who lost his ship years ago and subsequently arrives on an Island whereupon he encounters the blacksmith who has no expression.

"A good, but overrated movie which was improved on all counts in the sequel","The Curse of the Black Pearl was almost loved by many critics and according to some of them, it was a masterpiece. Then, why? You know, critics don't like such kind of movies, the movies which they call blockbusters, they underestimate such kind of movies and don't give high ratings. Even the sequel can be an example. As I see, they did not like the second movie as many people did not. Firstly, I want to say that I don't categorize movies as blockbuster and non blockbuster. What I am trying to say is that Curse of the Black Pearl has nothing different or unusual that would make even critics appreciated, instead, it was engrossing, entertaining, but a so so movie. Just another adventure movie. I slightly enjoyed it, it was entertaining, but mildly entertaining, so I cannot say a lot of fun here. I had expected much more by trailer. I think that I can tell my thoughts more clear above The King Arthur. Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie. I was entertained by The King Arthur, but just by some scenes, it was not uninteresting, it was engrossing, but no more than that. I had rented it, watched, was entertained, then gave it back. It was a so so movie, it was not a new Gladiator, it was not a new Excalibur. This first movie, Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie, if you ask me. It is an engrossing pirate movie with ghosts who look like flesh and blood, but turn into ghost by moonlight. Cool! As for Johnny Depp, one of my all time favorite actors, Jack Sparrow is remarkable, interesting, but he cannot even touch Jack Sparrow in Dead Man's Chest. In the sequel, this character is much more interesting, eccentric, colorful and funny. However, his performance in all The Pirates of the Caribbean movies is outstanding, especially in the second movie! Jack Sparrow hides a secret, it is unfolded at the last part, but it ruins the character, it kills the humor of the character. I was just disappointed, but not so important. Before the sequel was released, I had been sure that the second movie would surpass the first movie by far on all counts and I was not mistaken about it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I look forward to the sequel, though I'm not sure how the third one will turn out. Anyway, it has a great plot(which will remain a secret), a great cast(Johnny Depp + Orlando Bloom=HOT!!=D), and a wonderful performance. Jack Sparrow is hilarious!!

Yo-ho-ho! Shiver ye timbres at a bonafide guilty-pleasure and fun from beginning to end; Depp is perfect!,"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN : THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003) ***1/2 Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Jonathyn Pryce, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Damian O' Hare. Rip-roaring adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction (!) about a cursed platoon of pirates haunting the Caribbean in search of gold (and their souls) leading to a final confrontation with the owner of a certain trinket that holds the curse intact. Depp is a marvel of physical shtick and with comic aplomb steals the movie with his unusual choice of vocal (think a particularly cagey Keith Richards) and acrobatic maneuvers from swordplay to flights of fancy. Bloom holds his own as the straight-man like hero out to save the damsel in distress (the fetching Knightley) while battling the raggedly nasty villainous Rush as the captain of the doomed. Fun, fast and a true treat for all audiences that sends-up the genre it clearly embraces and salutes thanks to a witty script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio with Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert; an amazing production design by Brian Morris and skillful direction by Gore Verbinksi.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Swashbuckling Adventure Like No Other!,"Oh boy, where do I even begin with this movie? Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an absolute gem in the world of cinema. I mean, who doesn't love a good pirate adventure, am I right?First things first, let's talk about the plot. We've got a blacksmith, Will Turner, who teams up with the one and only Captain Jack Sparrow. And let me tell you, Captain Jack is a character like no other. He's eccentric, he's unpredictable, and he's got that swagger that just makes you want to be a pirate yourself. Together, they embark on a mission to save the love of Will's life, who has been kidnapped by some shady pirates. And guess what? These pirates are not your ordinary, run-of-the-mill buccaneers. Nope, they're undead! Talk about adding a supernatural twist to the story.Now, let's talk about the performances in this film. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is an absolute scene-stealer. He brings this quirky charm to the character that is just so entertaining to watch. You never know what he's going to do or say next, and that's what makes him so lovable. And let's not forget about Orlando Bloom as Will Turner. He brings this earnestness to the role that perfectly complements the madness of Captain Jack. And of course, we can't leave out Keira Knightley as the governor's daughter. She's strong, independent, and definitely not your damsel in distress. These three actors have such great chemistry on screen, and it's a joy to watch them interact.Now, let's talk about the action and adventure in this film. From the very beginning, you're thrown into this world of pirates, treasure, and epic sword fights. The action sequences are top-notch, and the special effects are just mind-blowing. The way they bring the undead pirates to life is so cool, and it adds an extra layer of excitement to the film. And let's not forget about the iconic music by Hans Zimmer. The soundtrack is so catchy and memorable, it's impossible not to hum along.But what really sets this movie apart is its sense of humor. The dialogue is witty, the comedic timing is spot on, and there are so many hilarious moments throughout. Captain Jack Sparrow's one-liners are pure gold, and they will have you laughing out loud. And let's not forget about the physical comedy as well. There are some great slapstick moments that will have you in stitches. It's this perfect blend of action, adventure, and comedy that makes Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl such a joy to watch.Overall, I would give this film a solid 8.5 out of 10. It's a swashbuckling adventure filled with unforgettable characters, thrilling action, and a whole lot of laughs. Whether you're a fan of pirates or not, this movie is definitely worth checking out. So grab your popcorn, set sail, and get ready for a wild ride with Captain Jack Sparrow. Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
COULD AND SHOULD BE BETTER...,"...judging by high ratings on Imdb. But still watchable enough that 2,5 hours goes by pretty fast. On the other hand, this movie will soon be forgotten, why?Well, for the story itself, i believe. It provides already seen stuff: a love story (a terrible part of the movie, since you can't feel any chemistry between Will (lousy play by Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (a mediocre play by Keira Knightley), pirate duels (some of them way too long) and a simple story (meant for kids and not so intelligent adults), without any twists.On the other hand, there's Johnny Depp, which is the main star, what he proves by great acting. With a slightly more capable director and screenwriters which could change the script and made it in a love story with Jack & Elizabeth (heh, like in Beauty & Beast), this movie will certainly gain some points with more demanding viewers and become a classic romance movie. Too bad, since the sound part is also great.Since it's not a classic, but somewhat between, only (but still good)7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Critical Voice In The Cinema Wilderness,"This is a perfect movie if (A) you are a twelve year old boy, (B) you like to see stunt men ejected from explosions over and over and over again (C) you will watch anything with Johnny Depp, regardless.For more discriminating adults, the two and a half hours of noise and chaos unrelieved by any semblance of careful plotting becomes tedious. Depp is certainly fun for the first half hour, sending up the pirate image by coating his eyes with kohl and sending up the Disney image by acting a little less than wholesome, but after a while, one longs for more than people screaming with swords in their hands backed up with a bombastic music score that underscores the emptiness of the enterprise.One longs for the sense of heroic purpose and genuine derring-do exemplified by Errol Flynn/ Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, or Burt Lancaster in such grand adventures as The Sea Hawk, Captain Blood, Sinbad The Sailor or The Crimson Pirate, all recently released on vivid, family-oriented DVDs; Pirates From The Carribbean is cynical corporate entertainment, the humor ironic or tongue-in-cheek, and, though marketed as such, is really not for children unless they are so desensitized to blood and savagery from video games that nightmarish visions do not bother them.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

BEST DISNEY MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"And by far the best of this year. Johnny Depp proves once again why he is one of the best actors ever, giving a hilarious performance as Capt. Jack Sparrow. With a great supporting cast but no one comes near Depp's performance save for maybe his rival of Geoffery Rush but even he cannot Blow Johnny out of the water. I was glad to see that this lived up to my expectations, but also and maybe even more importantly didn't deface the name of the beloved Disney ride like ""the Country Bears"" did. Of all the Pirate movies I have never seen a more well-rounded one. It has the perfect mix of action, superstition and reality of a pirate life. And for fans of the ride this film will be even funnier and much more rewarding featuring as advertized great tidbits from the original plot-line of the attraction.Anyone looking for a change of pace from the usual summer Blockbusters I urge you to go see this.

Wooden ships,"I love the idea of wooden ships. Crusing the known and unknown world for thousands of miles. The first ships, however, were metal ships.

Since the centre of the world then was Istanbul, then known as Constantinople. You can still vilify the Brits because British Constantine ruled that world. The 'East' India Company and 'Eastern' Levant Company were both located in that area, Constantinople and Ankara. Brits refuse to teach on the India Company in school, because you're allowed to lie to anyone except kids.

This is the first movie of the famous Pirates of the Caribbean series.To be honest this movie has made me the biggest fan of Johnny Depp. The movie has many other good actors but Johnny Depp deserves and stole most of the limelight.The movie is made beautifully well and the VFX adds to the grandeur of the movie. The screenplay is good and background music is terrific. The acting by other supporting characters are also nice.The movie is well known for fights, sea, ships and black pearl but the highlighting part is despite of lots of fighting scenes bloodshed is almost minimal and that due to obvious reasons.A very nice, engaging and entertaining movie to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A fun adventure, but silly and pretty shallow","As pirate movies go, this one's pretty good. But there's not much competition - I probably prefer Spielberg's Hook as well, especially in terms of music and ""magic"". But PotC has good production values, a decent story and cast and plenty of general action, comedy and drama.But rewatching it, it feels less special than I'd remembered. Depp is the main highlight, with his weird, drunk, halfway between dumb and smart but very likeable Jack Sparrow. He doesn't have a filter so he can just say what everyone's thinking, like comedians do. The other characters have their traditions, manners and alliances to adhere to. Jack is much freer.Rush is also entertaining as Barbosa, more of a traditional pirate, with the famous accent, cutthroat attitude but also respect for arbitrary rules, sometimes. He's both menacing and funny.The special effects hold up pretty well but are not that exciting anymore. It was new at the time, but now we need more than seeing skeletons and internal organs to be blown away. The movie relies more on entertainment than any solid or meaningful story. And for the most part, it is fun. But I wish it had a bit more heart, danger or proper plot to hold it together.The stunts, sets and costumes are among the better aspects of PotC. It doesn't just rely on CGI. We get to see real water battles, sword-fighting, swinging on ropes, cannon fire, double crosses, tricks, etc. But already in this first movie, it can be a little confusing what everyone's motivations are or whose side we should be on.PotC feels like it should have gone further in some direction and more fully committed. Either become a real swashbuckler and make the action even bigger and keep the story logical so we really get invested. Have real stakes. Or instead, go further with the comedy and really put the characters in some hilarious situations. Maybe play up the fantasy/horror aspects of the story.As it is, I suppose PotC achieves a kind of ""balance"", but it ends up being safer and less interesting because of this. It's never actually scary, the laughs are good but too spread out and the plot is too confusing to care much about what the characters do. None of the threats seem real and we never fear for any of the characters much.It works best as an action with comedy, but could have been more. Hook explores nostalgia, forgetting who you were, facing your destiny, the joy and pride of being a father, etc. PotC is vaguely about love, adventure and breaking the rules.

"Full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing","This is one of those movies you hate to pan, everyone on screen seems to be trying so hard to make something out of the material. Sometimes, even the best efforts can't rescue a plot thinner than the skins of the villains. And therein lies the problem. All the special effects, all the fencing, and ship to ship fighting, can't rescue this film. Given the lack of a story worth hanging a hat on, Johnny Depp does his best to give the film a center, but he is undercut. On one side is Geoffrey Rush chewing scenery faster than it can be built. I keep hoping to see him in a role that requires some subtlety, because I believe he is capable of greater things than anything I've seen him in recently. On the other side are Orlando Bloom and Kira Sedgewick gamely trying to give the film some romance. If only they were given some material to work with.

How Movies Should Be Made,"This is one of the most fantastic movies I have ever seen. Brilliantly done. This will be one movie that will be remembered for years to come.The story works. I ride the Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland all the time. It's so refreshing to see that they just didn't copy the ride story like Haunted Mansion did. It's original and doesn't feel like you're just going on the ride. They used parts of the ride but only when it fit into the story. They could have perfectly well made this story without the ride at all and it still would be good. The scene where Jack is in the prison and the others are trying to get the dog to come over is hilarious, if you've been on the ride. But it's not like the whole movie revolves around that dog. Just one of the subtle touches that people love.I could go on forever on the acting. Every character is perfectly cast. But the two that I must point out is Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. While every single actor and actress does a good job, these two stand above the rest. Barbossa is no nonsense and completely threatening. A villain worthy of the ranks among Darth Vader, Sauron, and Hans Gruber. Jack Sparrow is . . . well he's different. Completely unique. Like none you've ever seen before. Depp plays him almost like Christopher Walken would. He does goofy things with all seriousness. He steals just about every scene he's in. And when those two characters meet it's like when Batman and Superman meet. Two great characters, great on their own and even better together. I just love the way they play off each other.The CGI also terrific. It's not over the top like some movies tend to get. When they need CGI they use it but don't use it everywhere. Just the right amount. The most incredible scene is the Barbossa-Sparrow fight. The two go in and out of the moonlight, both turning into skeletons, and yet the CGI doesn't take away from the fight itself. The CGI use is so great you'd have to go through the movie frame by frame just to get it all. The CGI is just used to enhance the already good story.The soundtrack is outstanding. The music never overwhelms the movie. It fits in perfectly. It's also a great soundtrack to listen to on it's own. It's one of my favorite CDs.Now, no movie is without it's flaws. The rules for the curse seem to change. Like how exactly did Bootstrap Bill get out of the curse? Why does Barbossa die when he's shot before Will drops the coin? It seems that a movie of this size should have had such an important part of the story a little more defined. But unless you really stop and think about it or are just picky like that who cares. Also the last fight scene seems a little tacked on. They just had this huge climatic battle and then they decided to add just one more. It sort of seems like a pistol shot after a cannon blast. It is nice to see Will and Jack working together but after the previous fight it seems to drag the movie on longer than it needs to be. But the movie works anyways.A great movie for everyone to enjoy. Go out and rent this, then go and buy it. You'll love it. A movie you'll never regret seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
As Rare This Summer As a Black Pearl.,"In a summer where most everything has been little more than shark bait, it is refreshing to see a truly enjoyable blockbuster like ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"". A production that is very reminiscent of those old Saturday serials and even more closely the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy that dominated the 1980s, the movie is a dominant success by the time it completes its voyage. It is the mid-1700s and the breathtaking Keira Knightley (who has already made a name for herself this year with ""Bend It Like Beckham"") has been kidnapped by a band of ghostly pirates led by the always dependable Geoffrey Rush. It seems that Knightley possesses a medallion that may bring Rush and his crew back to life. However the medallion is far from one of a kind and it is far from certain if Knightley is even the person they need for their deviant scheme to work. Now it is up to blacksmith Orlando Bloom (who has become an international sensation with ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and outrageous pirate Johnny Depp (in arguably his finest role) to save the day. Knightley's uptight father (Jonathan Pryce) and would-be fiance (Jack Davenport) add well-timed comedic turns in limited action. Director Gore Vabinski (who impressed me verily last year with the atmospheric thriller ""The Ring"") is beginning to show a real knack for handling large productions. Admittedly the film is a little long and suffers from sometimes uninspired writing, but the strong cast and the mind-blowing visual effects are more than enough to make ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" one of the more likable productions of 2003. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent movie,"I will firstly say that after seeing the trailer and previews for this film I had serious doubts. I was afraid that the producers would just try to cash in on the original's success, and forget about any content.I was pleasantly proved wrong. This is the most fun I've had in the cinema in the longest time. I can't remember the last time I was so entertained.Although it is a bit slow at times, and a bit predictable (although fun in it's predictability), it hardly lets up and continuously entertains.If you loved the original, you will DEFINITELY love this film. The ending not only makes you laugh, it makes you think ""What the hell?"" and will make you eagerly anticipate (major understatement) the third installment.There are some great lines, the same fun characters, an inventive and fun story, and some brilliantly staged action sequences.In summation: SEE IT! See it on the big screen. If you miss it, you will surely regret it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Something to remember when you're into your second century.,"The theme of pirates is a very common one in movie-making. There hasn't been a high enough level of mathematics invented yet to number the pirate cartoons made. Several of the 'immortal' classics such as 'Treasure Island' are about pirates. And of course, Hollywood has it's share in the pirate stories: 'Cutthroat Island' (I don't know why it flopped), 'Treasure Island', and variants have all graced or disgraced our screens for decades. And then this...I truly think that pirate movies aren't going to get better than POTC. The plot is original, surprising, and impossibly dynamic, the humor fresh and unforced, the filming absolutely stunning, and the acting thorough and enjoyable. Watching Jack Sparrow (by the way, the entire image of Jack Sparrow was left up to Johnny Depp. I can't imagine how it could've turned out better) clamber, sway, and in extreme cases fall through trembling holds, cages, and rigging was something that I know I will look back upon in about twenty years with just as much relish as I do now. The brilliant dynamic created by the sarcastic, irreverent Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and the uber-eccentric, hilarious, infinitely scheming Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is something that cannot accurately be described by anyone on this earth. Add to that some semi-peripheral roles that only enhance the humor and action, and you get a masterpiece.The sets were filmed on location using real ships (well... 2/3 real ships), real ocean, real islands, and a specially constructed real fort, giving this movie an authenticity that serves to endear it even more.There is something in this movie that will appeal to anyone: action lovers, wisecracks, the romantic souls, those that like to tickle their nerves with semi-scary images, the thinkers, ANYONE. Should you watch this movie? Of course! And bring the kids along too... the skeletons and such, they're not even really scary. The whole movie is almost like a story, in fact. A very fast-paced, engrossing, exciting, and profound story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Depp plays Swann with a variety of eccentric quirks and once you get used to it he is quite funny and engaging. Rush chews the scenery just enough to make his undead pirate captain a larger than (after) life monster who still oozes a nasty charm.

"`Pirates of the Caribbean' is worth seeing for its unpretentious fun for the family, just like Disneyland.","`Shiver me timbers!'Matey, we have the coolest pirate film of the summer with Gore Verbinski's (`The Ring') `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Jade.' The coolest pirate of all time may be Johnny Depp's (`Chocolat') captain Jack Sparrow, a fey swashbuckler with androgynous mannerisms and a slightly besotted mien possibly from too much wine or just an overactive actor's imagination.At any rate, Depp steals the booty and the film in a gracious act of saving the summer from the absence of any unforgettable performance. Verbinski clearly let Depp do what he wanted, and he did. Fortunately, unlike Marlon Brando on the loose, Depp can contain his genius and entertain while still showing formidable talent of the very best in film today.Inspired by the Disney theme park ride of the same name, `Pirates' tells of Sparrow pursuing the ghost ship Black Jade, run by a real skeleton crew and headed by the sordid Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). They seek to break an ancient curse by kidnapping the luscious Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, `Bend It like Beckham'). Most of this is parody of all the pirate films ever made, right down to the talking parrot on the buccaneer's shoulder, swordfights, treasure coves, and a post-modern pirate's code interpreted as just `guidelines.'  Even Orlando Bloom as Knightley's love interest looks like a young Errol Flynn.With over 600 visual effects shots as well, Verbinski succeeds in making a rollicking good story while satirizing the genre at the same time. But at 143 minutes, with several returns to the same locations and a tedious father-daughter tiff, `Pirates' is too long and repetitious.  Without the watchable Depp, it could have been the sunken `Cutthroat Island' of mid-nineties infamy.The bard as always catches the cavalier spirit:'Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage, And purchase friends, and give to courtezans, Still revelling like lords till all be gone . . . .'As it is, in a summer of mediocrity, `Pirates of the Caribbean' is worth seeing for its unpretentious fun for the family, just like Disneyland.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

He can make a some kind serious movie relay funny and that's why i like this movie.This movie combines humor that will have adults and children laughing , and although it is a bit scary at times, is not too scary for younger children.I would say if you like pirates, Johnny Depp, or a good movie with action, comedy and romance then you really should watch movie.If you not see this film you miss this entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A new classic, just good summer fun. The best film of 2003","I didn't think I would like POTC when I went to see it but I couldn't have been more wrong! The movie was pure entertainment from start to finish filled with humor, action, and adventure. Once again Johnny Depp does what he does so well by getting lost in the character of the infamous Jack Sparrow. Depp is sensational, this is why he's the best actor out there right now. Newcomer Kiera Knightley was a pretty face and very good in POTC and Orlando Bloom fit the bill proving his talent past Legolas of LOTR. And of course, Geoffey Rush was just so fun to hate as the grimy and nasty Barbossa, a superb villain, the summer's best villain. Gore Verbinski is on his way with The Ring and POTC, even though he sadly looks not to come back for the 2005 sequel to POTC. This movie is great, forget Cold Mountain and everything else, this film is the best of 2003. The only film I could do this to this to this year.

Pirates FTW!,"For a movie based on a attraction ride, this is pretty good. But I still found it a bit overrated because of the big praise it got when it first came out. This movie is something kids and adults can enjoy, but it doesn't excel to something more than that. The trailer for this movie was more better than the movie itself, but for going in a direction where it's watchable for the whole family. It's done pretty well for the most part, although it comes off a bit silly at times because of it and not really in a positive way either. I personally didn't really like the humor in this although some of the audience might like it. Johnny Depp has created a iconic character because of this movie, and he liked this character a lot himself. Jack Sparrow is a fun and interesting character to watch on screen and is the character that stood out the most. The other cast members did really well with their roles especially Geoffrey Rush who plays Captain Barbossa. The movie was fun a ride, however it got pretty old after it got shown in school way too many times. Overall it's a good movie that the whole family can enjoy, but it's still a bit of a overrated movie.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Above-Average Summer Blockbuster,"The pirates who infested the Caribbean in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries may, in real life, have been a murderous bunch of cut-throats, but Hollywood has generally seen them as swashbuckling heroes, as in the Burt Lancaster vehicle ""The Crimson Pirate"" from the fifties. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a modern film in the same tradition. It is said to be based on a Disneyland theme park ride, although in this context the phrase ""based on"" probably means little more than ""sharing a name with"".The film is set in Jamaica during the late seventeenth century, presumably before the destruction of Port Royal in an earthquake in 1692, as part of the action takes place in that city. There is, however, little attempt at period accuracy, and some of the costumes and uniforms on display seem to date from a much later period, in some cases as late as the 1770s. There are a number of other goofs; why, for example, would anyone need a warming-pan in the tropical climate of Jamaica? The plot is a complex one, which I will not summarise in full. It centres upon the rivalry between Will Turner, a blacksmith, and pirate captain Jack Sparrow for the love of Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful daughter of the British Governor of Jamaica. Despite their rivalry, and Will's detestation of all pirates, the two men have to join forces to rescue Elizabeth who has been kidnapped by Hector Barbossa, captain of the pirate ship the Black Pearl. Barbossa and his men are under a supernatural curse, laid upon them when they stole a treasure of Aztec gold. It transpires that Jack Sparrow was once the captain of the Black Pearl, but lost his command when Barbossa, against whom he has sworn vengeance, led a mutiny against him.The studio did not hold out great hopes for the film; at one time Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner even wanted to drop the production. In the event, however, it proved an unexpected success, both critically and at the box office, and has spawned three sequels to date. The fact that a major character dies towards the end of the film might suggest that the producers were not anticipating a sequel; the character in question was miraculously resurrected in time for ""Dead Man's Chest"". There are, I think, two reasons for the film's success. The first is that, despite a complicated and often nonsensical plot, the story is an entertaining one which moves along at a fast pace. The film stays true to the traditions of the pirate film with some good action sequences, including an excellent hand-to-hand duel between Will and Sparrow.The second reason for the film's success is some highly inventive casting. This was the film which first made a major star of Keira Knightley. The lovely Keira had already had a big success in Britain with ""Bend It like Beckham"", but was less well-known in America or internationally. In a traditional pirate movie, Elizabeth would doubtless have been played as a helpless, fragile damsel-in-distress. Today, feminist theory frowns upon this sort of portrayal of female characters, so Elizabeth becomes feisty and determined, but Keira is able to suggest an underlying fragility and vulnerability even when her character is at her feistiest. Geoffrey Rush was rather cast against type; I had always previously regarded him as the star of serious films like ""Shine"" or ""Elizabeth"", but here he plays Barbossa as a swaggering, semi-comic pantomime villain. Orlando Bloom has a difficult task; Will is, nominally at least, the romantic lead, but he is also rather strait-laced, and at times he seems rather dull by comparison with the film's real star character, Captain Jack.For it is undoubtedly Johnny Depp who steals the film. Depp is sometimes an eccentric actor, but he is hardly ever a dull one. (OK, he was dull in ""Chocolat"", but then that was a very dull film). The original intention was that Captain Jack Sparrow should be played as a straightforward swashbuckler, based upon the pirates played by the likes of Lancaster or Errol Flynn. Depp, however, subverted this intention and turned Sparrow into a sort of 17th century rock star- he claims the character was based on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones- with a slightly slurred diction and a more than slightly camp manner. To traditionalists this must have seemed like an outrageously eccentric interpretation of the role, and yet somehow it works brilliantly, contrasting nicely with the more straightforwardly masculine Will. Depp even received an Oscar nomination for ""Best Actor"", a remarkable achievement for an action-adventure summer blockbuster. He, more than anyone else, is responsible for lifting ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" well above the normal standard of such blockbusters. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""The Fog meets ""Treasure Island"".","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" has to be one film I'm addding to my ""Worst Films of 2003"" list.""Pirates"" has to be ""one"" of the oddest, strangest, most over-the-top, far out, blockbuster film's of the summer 2003 lot. For starters, director Verbinski isn't enough of a stylist to pull off the script's delicate balancing act. As he showed with the ""The Mexican"" Verbinski has problems finding just the right tone between humor and adventure. The film is never quite funny enough to make us forget that dramatically it's pretty slim stuff. With is combination of action, comedy, over the top acting, big sets and one-liners this movie couldn't be taken too seriously for an action film and it so far off the map that it couldn't be called a comedy.For one thing Johnny Depp, who delivers what has to be the strangest lead performance in a $150 million Hollywood production to date, and has to be the only one brave enough to play a gay drunk pirate this side of the Caribbean. Wait until you see what Depp does here. You can't take your eyes off him!! He is funny, crazy and he over takes every single scean he is in. Even Geoffrey Rush is over shadowed by Depps's over the top performance.Geoffrey Rush was great in his role as Barbossa, and it shows what a great actor Geoffrey Rush really his; and how multi-talented he really his even when he sells out to crap like ""The Banger Sisters"" or ""pirates"" He can make a really bad role work for him. But it was Depp's film and he ran with it!Keira Knightley, well not much to say except she is a really bad actress and how many times do we have to set her either wet or getting her clothes ripped off with out once having bad hair or runny make-up?Orlando Bloom was flat, his character was a cardbaord cut out of every single character out to rescuse the woman he loves and finds himself an adventure.""Pirates"" was a bad movie, but Depp's over the top performance was the best thing and the only thing besides the over top F/X and interesting story line that keeps this mess afloat!Yes folks; the story had promise. Real promise. But somewhere between directors Gore Verbinski ideas, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's ideas the story somehow merged 2 diffrent out looks with no real mediuem. The whole film felt like ""Treasure Island"" meets ""The Fog""!With a running time of two hours plus, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" feels terribly flabby, even the over the top battle scenes are so drawn out we start to lose interest.Depp's odd performance should probably make this film live on as a cult classic and become recognized by film buff's as a bad film that we love.One word to describe ""Pirates"" is ""BIZZARE""!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than I expected!,"I had a hard time deciding if I wanted to see this movie. The fact that Johnny Depp was in it guaranteed that I'd have to watch it at some point, but with Bruckheimer producing and some non-impressive trailers I wasn't that excited about it.X2 was a fair effort. Terminator 3 sucked. I was convinced this was just a summer of duds. Thank God for Pirates. It blew those other films out of the water. Johnny Depp is a God send. Never before have I been so enthralled in a character. He was unbeliably fun to watch. His performance alone raises the film from above B-movie level. The actual script isn't funny enough to be a lot of fun, nor is it creepy enough to be a genre effort. But Depp's interpretation of his character transforms this movie into something awe inspiring. It gives it a completely different feel and actually helps it retain that sort of innocent goofiness the ride has.Geoffrey Rush was also great as Captain Barbossa. The sword fight between him and Sparrow was a stand out moment in a film full of stand out moments. Orlando Bloom was pretty boring, but then again the role didn't require much else other than a 'straight man' to Depp's colorful Captain. I'd heard all these comments about how Depp was the best reason to see the film and I can sincerely say that none of that was exaggerated. It truly is reason enough to go see the film.The special effects are average. Nothing spectacular but nothing horrible. The scene of the two ships doing battle is awesome. And all of the landscapes and towns they created digitally look perfect. From start to finish you are immersed in this world. Speaking of start to finish... waaaay too long. While it rarely ceases to entertain, there a few patches where you'd wish they could just move on to the next thing.Bottom line: I thought it was a great movie. Better than the previews made it look and a lot more fun and worthy than other summer fare. I don't think it's bold to say Depp has created one of his most memorable characters. No small feat for a man whose resume is loaded with memorable characters. While its essentially a B-movie, the A-List cast and tongue in cheek attitude help raise Pirates to something else entirely. Well worth checking out. I give it an A-",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Aaar-gh!,"One of the drawbacks to seeing a big movie, an immensely popular film from a few years back is that you enter into it with such preconceived notions that the flick will be . . . good? I saw Pirates of the Caribbean over the weekend and it was just so much fuss and feathers, a gory, tedious mess. Since you already know the story, I'll tell you why POTC stunk (stank? stinked?). I don't think this movie knew exactly what it wanted to be. It could have been a jolly, smartassed romp or an exciting and suspenseful thriller or a story of love and devotion. Since it tried for all three, it missed.The female lead (something Knightley?) was bland, the Orlando Bloom character was also a nothing, the baddies weren't even there unless the moon was out, and Johnny Depp left me totally confused. His simpering, effeminate Jack Sparrow spent the movie lurching and reeling as if Depp wanted to impress you with his Foster Brook's impression.I wasn't.Needless to say, if anyone reads this review, I'll be earning my one zillionth ""unhelpful"" vote on IMDb.

Surprisingly Good,"I was a little bit skeptical when my girlfriend and I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean...not being a big summer movie fan, I braced myself for huge explosions with very little plot development and intelligence.  But I was greatly surprised and genuinely riveted to the screen, especially to Johnny Depp's performance.  Had anyone else portrayed Jack Sparrow, the film would merely have been OK, but Depp gave the Captain a swagger that few could achieve.  He walked, talked, and handled himself like a rock star (like Keith Richards on a boat!) and provided humor not in fart jokes or lewd behavior (generally the type of ""comedy"" seen in summer movies) but in style and voice inflection.  Is it an Oscar caliber film?  The answer is no, but Pirates will still provide good, funny entertainment this summer season to those who want to turn off their brains for a few hours and enjoy the ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

great film,"I thought this was a great movie. It was good to see Depp in a film that wasn't so gothic or dark like his past films; Sleepy Hollow, The Ninth Gate and From Hell.

Geoffrey Rush did a great job as the villianous captain, and Orlando Bloom had a nice follow up outside of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Just an average Disney story, a well known, good looking actor and a huge marketing hype, so that even all the movie critics and the Oscar jury believe that it is a good move doesn't make it good. If it's not entertaining or contains a great, unusual idea, it could at least have contained some serious message, but of course also didn't - so I just don't get it why everyone likes it.At least I got most of my money back, but I still hope that some day there will be a real movie using the Monkey Island Plot.What I've learned: Never buy a DVD (at least not for full price) just because everyone says it's great.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates is one of the best movies this year!,"That's right, ""Pirates"" manages to be an epic, entertaining movie on all levels. I was in shock at how good the movie actually turned out to be. It has all the formulas for success: a great cast (Depp is perfect, and everybody else is more than up to par.), fantastic visuals (with help from ILM), and a great story. Being the first Walt Disney movie (under the Disney banner) to be given a PG-13 rating, I was surprised at how violent the movie was. While it is nowhere near an 'R' rating, definately not a PG rating either. Parents, think twice before bringing the younger ones.I can't think of too many complaints. Humor and action were well-balanced. I suppose some more sword-fighting would've been nice, but a minor gripe with an otherwise fantastic action-adventure. Compared to recent summer movies that weren't really all that good (Terminator 3, Matrix Reloaded, Hulk), it was nice to see another movie that, while no X2: X-Men United, manages to blow you out of the water!

Often movies fade as time goes on, but this one moves from strength to strength and builds up to a finale the way it's supposed to be done.I don't like Disney and don't understand anyone who does. So it just doesn't feel good this coming from such a financial - and even political - empire. But it's good fun all around.The soundtrack, made by Zimmer collaborator Klaus Badelt, moves along just like a Zimmer production would. It keeps things going.Masterful entertainment without being profound - and the lasting memory will always be Captain Jack Sparrow.

"Arrrg! Dar be talent in dem Lands of Disney, matey!","True to the ride I guess. I think we all wondered what the plot of Disneyland's ride was, considering there never was anything it was based on (yet it was one of the COOLEST)Plot: First you wait in line. Then sail through lovely seas of the Caribbean. Then there's a skull saying something mean to you, your boat falls down and splashes. Things get dark. Then Pirates happen.Like Disney's family ride, you get great scenery, you get some thrills, spills, and some good honest humor, particulary with Johnny Depp's crafty swaggering character. Bloom and Knightley fit in nicely when it comes to the tale of a damsel in distress and her true love saving her. Rush commands his army of pirates well with a matured manner, yet he can still be quite evil. What really deserves some credit is the Special Effects and the Pirates themselves. We get a good gathering of savages and thieves, giving the ride lovers what they wanted. Good swordplay and great ship battles, what more could you want? A less sappy ending I guess.

A Great Mix of Old & New Hollywood,"In the summers of the 1930's and 40's, if you wondered into your local movie theatre chances are you'd see a daring pirate off on some swashbuckling adventure.  Walk into the theatre today, and find a barrage of f/x laden sci-fi/fantasy films.  Pirates of the Caribbean is the best combination of both.The success of the film is thanks heavily to Gore Verbinski.  I've always liked Gore's style, but felt he never had the movie to let him realize his potential (see ""The Ring"").  Verbinski and his cinematographer paint just some beautiful scenes in the film.  Some are enhanced by digital grading and other effects features, and it lends the film a great atmosphere and epic look.  He also directs his actions scenes expertly, not going edit happy like most directors.But of course, you can't have a great adventure film without a great hero. And you can't have a great hero without a great actor.  Enter Johnny Depp, the ultra-hip, charismatic leading man who is always the highlight of the film he works in.  Captain Jack Sparrow is just a downright cool cat, thanks largely to the help of Depp.  Depp himself added much the his characters costume and personal quirks, and his Depp's comedic timing is a spot on as ever. Just pure genius Johnny, as always.   Orlando Bloom does nicely as well, but it really felt more like he was warming up for his role in the next Lord of the Rings movie.  Geoffrey Rush found a even balance of subtlety and over acting, not extending the use of either, and though while not too memorable, it is still a good performance.  Keira Knightley is nothing really worth mentioning.  Typical damsel role, typical performance. Any actress could have handled the part, though must wouldn't have been as attractive.The story and screenplay is very much ""Old"" Hollywood, a more slick line of dialogue that is light and fun without being cheesy.  It's levity is not forced, but transcends naturally from the actors and Gore's dream like directing.All in all, it is one of the most fun movies too come out of hollywood in a long time.  It's a nod to the golden age of Hollywood with the visual conscience of a modern blockbuster.  The actors are great, Verbinski provides the smooth look, and the screenplay as joy written all over it.

Disappointing film:(,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in My opinion is not one of the greatest movies of all time. Sure, it has a huge budget, a different cast (which included Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce!), great special effects, and a lengthy two hour plus run time but this film never did anything for Me and here are the reasons why it didn't.The following is in My opinion.1. Johnny Depp is a good actor but I just didn't know what to think of his character whether I should like him, hate him, or feel sorry for him.2. I'm an action movie nut and there was a lot of action but the action just wasn't exciting enough that its so great it'll be one of the films I'll see over and over. In other words nothing special or spectacular happened in this one.3. The music by up coming composer Klaus Badelt was ok but most of it was just recycled of Hans Zimmer's one of a kind score from the greatest epic called Gladiator (2000)! Badelt composed an excellent score for the Time Machine and retooled the music and this is what we get for this? Why?4. Some of the things that happened in the film was supposed to be funny but I didn't think it was and I didn't think the comedy stuff was needed.5. The late great Trevor Goddard had a brief role in this movie and I believe it was his last one. Why give an actor with an incredible muscular build, a unique accent, and amazing talent a scene where it makes him look like a complete joke?You may be thinking why I am saying this. How can I say this about a movie that is so high in fame and stature? I am just saying how I feel about the film. The film had all the potential and everything going for it but it just didn't do it. I wanted to like the movie but it never changed. I don't agree about it being on the IMDb's Top 250: #235! In fact, I think it shouldn't even be on the list. There are many other films that deserve to be on the list more than this film! You mean to tell Me that this is on the same list with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy? Plus there are many more movies with much more excitement similar to this movie like the Planet of the Apes (2001), The Mummy, and The Mummy Returns, and Cutthroat Island! In My opinion Pirates of the Caribbean's competion The Hulk and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was so much better and exciting in My opinion! Anyway I feel if you wanted to watch a much more epic pirate movie instead see Cutthroat Island, its much more exciting! I hate to say this but Pirates of the Caribbean is awfully dull, boring, uninteresting, uninspiring, it has no depth, and it should be avoided like a flood!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great movie, pity about the sound track","The casting is good it works. The scenery is good. The special effects work well too as they are used to support the story and are not a gimmick unto itself. The music however is a bit awkward. The theme tune is fine but it is repeated incessantly and in the major fight scene where you are trying to follow the swordplay and effect and characters it is totally wrong. The music is distracting and doesn't follow the events on the screen, as it should. It breaks the scene down and distracts, which is a great pity.A great movie, go and see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Creatively Entertaining!,"The Curse of Black Pearl brings a new perspective to pirate movies:Pirates are the heroes,and also the villains!

Well-made.. Worth seeing more than once.,"Pirates of the Caribbean is a well-made movie and is worth taking the time to see. Its excellent story and wonderful selection of actors and actresses has drawn in many people of all ages. What makes this movie so good is it's never ceasing action, which was brilliantly choreographed. Its musical score is quite good also. It might just seem that is the best movie ever made, or that it can be shown anywhere to anyone. But it is obviously not the greatest movie, nor can it be shown to whoever wants to watch it. Let me remind you that this movie is PG-13. This is because of its crude humor and intense fight scenes. This is why only people that are teens or older should watch it, hence PG-13. Other than that it is an excellent movie which deserves being watched more than once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

What an Awful Movie.,"This movie was so stupid I couldn't finish it. The beginning to this movie dreadfully long. I couldn't believe I sat through half of this movie. One of the major problems with this movie was that it was so unrealistic that it ruined the whole movie. The real pirates were nothing like the pirates in this fake piece of trash. I would rather watch my finger nails grow than watch this stupid movie again. If your into the fake stupid pirate movies than I would recommend this movie, but if you like movies that are realistic than avoid at all costs. I don't know how this piece of garbage made it to theaters. Hollywood has really gone down hill their new movies. This movie was a real disappointment to say the least.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I think this movie rocks,I love Orlando Bloom in this movie BUT Johnny Depp is so on to it his character is really cool and is facial expression are the best I have seen yet he is awesome in this role and deserves a lot of the credit. I had fun with this movie and found it somewhat intriguing. I saw it twice so far and i still want to go and watch it again its that kind of movie for me The Hunks in this movie are brilliant at looking good even if it is in costumes i couldn't have chosen a better movie for my Saturday night out.Why's the rum gone!!!!!!!!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great!!!,"The film is such great fun, all through you are bombarded with action, romance, comedy and amazing cgi. Geoffery Rush delivers a wonderful performance as the evil Captain Barbossa and Johnny Depp MAKES the film with comedy that just brings tears to your eyes (from laughing so hard), his best role yet!!! As for Orlando Bloom he is also in one of his best roles to date, although playing Legolas in LOTR catapulted him into stardom, this is without a doubt the role he shall be remembered for....at least, I believe he shall.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"When a movie has a great script, a great actor, and humor, it works","Unlike some reviewers, I actually watched the movie and saw that it was the Black PEARL it was about (not JADE), and that Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) was NEVER the beloved of Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), but of Will Turner (Bloom). Inspired by the carefree and fun-loving nature of a pirate at rest, 'Pirates' has excellent comedy throughout the movie that accompanies the wonderful action sequences to roll it on with a great pace that always keeps the watcher happy and enjoying the experience with a smile and a laugh. There is, however, no sparing of the viewer from fights of many types and on many venues. The action is inventive, the lines are memorable, and yes, Captain Jack Sparrow makes all of the other actors dance a great dance around his magnificent performance.

It's quite a creative storyline that has now been over used in Disney movies like Jungle cruise, dr dolittle and even uncharted these days. Original pirate movie. It's quite a fun action movie a bit long for my liking though with twists and turns. The casting of the movie is really good liked all the actors it's a good assembly of British and American actors and it's well acted by the whole crew. Can't fault the acting, it's good.

One of the best franchises ever made 8/10,"""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is one of the best movies to ever been made. It's good and even required of Disney to get of their system once in a while and create better movies: movies that are fun, amusing, scary and serious but at the same time catchy and funny. A fantastic idea to create a movie about pirates that has all sorts of mystery going on and magic. Every detail in the film is eye catching and perfectly shot. And after years of watching this film over and over again, it is truly a pleasure. I'm a huge fan of this franchise, I've loved it sense small age and feel like it deserves more appreciation. Johnny Depp is truly a fantastic actor (one of the only ones who can be granted the title G.O.A.T). His charisma and portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow is wonderful. Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush are great actors each and every one of them. The best movie out of the whole franchise.

The perfect Summer movie!,"You have to love this movie. When I knew that this movie was coming into theaters I knew I was going to love it just because it's a pirate movie. This movie is what every summer movie should be about. It has action, a lot of laughs, a cute adventurous story and settings, and lots of fun. The characters are just lovely, and Johnny Depp is just too hilarious. It was worth watching this movie just because of his character and the way he transformed himself into ""Jack Sparrow."" This priate is such a genuine guy. He is smart and funny, and above all good looking. He made me laugh every time he said something. This movie is so much better than Bad Boys II which I thought had a really stupid plot. On top of that, it was too dragged out, and even though some of the scenes make you laugh, they are way too exaggerated to the point where you stop laughing and wonder how easily amused the rest of the audience can be just because they sound like they are talking like to gay lovers in a public record store while being filmed and while the rest of the people in the store are watching them. Well, anyway. Like I said, the cast was terrific, and this is now my favorite adventure-movie. The fact that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie helped in the creation of such a daring vision of a priate movie. I don't think there is one action movie that I do not love by this guy.Pirates of the Carribean had spectacular special effects, and the landscapes that they chose to film on were just too beautiful. And Keira Knightley is just one smokin' hot brunette. She has the most beautiful face in the whole wide world. I would have given anything to have been Will Turner at the end of their adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Do not monkey around with Aztec gold.,"Miss Elizabeth Swan as a child was intrigued by pirates. She has an opportunity to save one. In the process, she pilfers what looks like a piece of pirate gold. This simple act will ether lead to death and destruction, or romance and intrigue.This well-paced movie has every cliché ever spoken in the classic pirate movies. It also has all the elements, gold, and sub-plots, and is sure to point them out to you should you miss one.This is a well-designed movie with attempts to be authentic in many ways such as using real pistols from the era. There are several crew members, and you will notice that the extras change from one scene to the next. They did not skimp on the actors either. As with pirate movies of old, the main actors took the lion's share of the action.Of course, you will have your eye on Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), his cronies, and adversaries. However, I was surprised to see their good taste in giving Guy Siner the part of Harbormaster; you may remember him as Lieutenant Hubert Gruber in the series ""Allo 'Allo!"" (1982)There are no bones about it, this is superior to other Depp movies and will leave a good after taste. You may need to see it several times to pick up the tightly packed scenes and dialog. I have viewed the dual DVD package and found instead of just rehashing the movie scenes that they give different insights that you may have missed in the first viewing. Even the deleted scenes allow you to see the way the movie could have gone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates kicks a**,"This was by far the greatest movie I have ever had the honor to gaze upon, and I have seen a lot of movies. Johnny Depps winning personality and talent was perfect for this movie, and Orlando Bloom's career is starting off on the right foot being in both the Lord of the Rings movies and in Pirates of the Caribbean. Kira Knightly also shows incredible talent and should be a promising actress. I'll admit the only reason I went to see the actual movie was because I'm a Depp fanatic and also a big Orlando Bloom fan, and I expected the movie to be boring, because I didn't know what it was about. But i was so wrong, it was AMAZING, and I recommend everyone see this movie. It is good for all people because it was a comedy, love, drama, action, horror, and family movie all in one amazing little package.

X Marks the Spot,"From the moment this cinematic treasure hoisted its colors, it whisked me away to a world I had yet to explore-a world of sweeping landscapes, romance, curses, and a language as mysterious as the depths of Davy Jones' locker. It was like a love letter to a part of history and culture that had eluded me, encompassing all I ever dreamed of as a wee scallywag. I yearned to be a pirate, sailing the Caribbean in the 18th century! But alas, as is often the case with grown-ups who lack the pirate spirit, my dreams were dashed when one of them took it upon themselves to rain on me parrot's parade. They claimed that a pirate's life ain't all rum and plunder, that I'd never lay eyes on me dear family again, and that the glamour was but a mirage on the horizon. Aye, me heart sank like a sunken chest o' treasure.The story, you ask? Well, it's a tale of cursed Aztec gold, vengeful undead pirates, a damsel in distress, and Captain Jack Sparrow, trying to reclaim his beloved ship, the Black Pearl. And, of course, there be that dashing Will Turner and the feisty Elizabeth Swann caught up in the midst of it all.The action, it be as fast and furious as a cannonball, with sword fights atop swaying masts and battles against skeletal foes who can't seem to stay dead. The special effects and stunts, they be as grand as a Kraken's tentacle.And the humor-the clever quips and the antics of Captain Jack, the most lovable rogue with more charm than a chest full of doubloons, ever to grace the seven seas. His rum-soaked charisma and his knack for escaping dire situations make for a rollicking good time. And he be the first swashbuckler to steal me heart as a young sea pup. Ingenious and mesmerizing, Johnny Depp be the very soul of the film's fantastical core-the idea that a pirate's life be one of endless excitement and freedom. His portrayal be like no other, a unique blend of eccentricity and cunning that befits a true pirate. There never has been, and likely never will be, a pirate or a man quite like Jack Sparrow in the vast sea of cinema. His every move, every quirk, it all be showin' the result of a lifetime's worth of rehearsal. Remove him, and what's left be a mere imitation, a lifeless vessel adrift in a sea of mediocrity.It's a cinematic treasure chest filled with humor, heart, and enough pirate swagger to make even this ol' pirate proud. So, set sail, and let the wind carry you to a world of high-seas hijinks and buried treasure. Savvy?Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Funny,"There is only one real reason I liked this film and can be summed up in two words - Johnny Depp. He really made the film what it is - a funny action adventure. In fact, although the the main focus seems to be around Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters (and their romance which was not very believable), Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow was the real focus and what a riot he is! The visual effects was pretty good too. Other than that though, the story itself is okay (I thought Cutthroat Island had a better story and that's saying much) and the music was average (Hans Zimmer has done better - i.e. The Lion King). But still see this film because of Johnny Depp, actor extraordinaire!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Depp is the only real treasure here,"God bless Johnny Depp, for without him ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" would be just another empty big budget studio extravaganza - juvenile, bloated and over-reliant on stunt work and special effects. But thanks to Depp's brave and witty performance, the film rises above its own inherent weaknesses to become at least a halfway entertaining picture. He is the real treasure here.""Inspired"" - if one dares use so lofty a term - by the Disney theme park attraction of the same name, ""Pirates"" takes us to the never-never land of swashbuckling heroes and shiver-me-timbers foolishness. Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who was left for dead on an island by his mutinous crew. Sparrow, captain of the legendary Black Pearl, a ship with the reputation for possessing evil, unearthly powers, has now returned from his exile and is ready to exact revenge on the mates who abandoned him. There's really no point in thrashing out the complicated but essentially simpleminded plot here. Suffice it to say that it involves a diabolical curse, a literal ghost ship with a literal skeleton crew, a feisty damsel-in-distress and enough repetitive swordplay and ""avast me, hardy"" dialogue to keep the action adventure crowd purring with contentment.For all the care that has gone into the look of the film - the costumes, set design and computer-generated special effects - ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" would sink pretty quickly were it not for Depp giving his all to keep it afloat. His lisping, flamboyant, over-the-top approach to the character is exactly what this stale little tale needs to lift it above the ordinary. One has only to see Depp mincing around - where anyone else in the part would have been swaggering - to verify what we have known all along about Depp as an actor, which is that he is willing to take risks and explore different avenues when tackling a role, even one as lightweight and insubstantial as this one. He turns what could have been a mere walk-through, check-cashing part into an inspired comic turn. One can only imagine what a boring movie this would have been without him. For, indeed, the story itself is silly and the other characters (except for Geoffrey Rush's evil Captain Barbossa) stiff, dull and uninteresting. But Depp is the real deal, and all I can say is that I hope he received a large percentage of the film's phenomenal box office booty. Like any good pirate, he deserves it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Curse Is Upon Us,"What can anyone say about Pirates of the Caribbean except that it's BRILLIANT!!From the beginning of the movie, you set sail on a journey through the Caribbean. You can almost smell the air and feel totally absorbed into the movie.The plot is good for a pirates' story with so many twists and shifts and gets you into the story step by step.The set design is very good. So realistic and so rich you see that nothing is out of place, everything is where it's supposed to be.The direction is excellent. The fight sequences were done in a humorous mode but with good skills.The graphics is OUTSTANDING. You can look with the examining eye, you can not find a single moment of inconsistency in the graphics. It took my breath away.The leads (Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport) were brilliant. They contributed positively to their roles, especially Johnny Depp. He was so funny and so in character that you couldn't imagine anyone else doing that role but him (savvy?).In Total...I think that this movie gave Disney a peak that is HARD to surpass.I really doubt if anyone could do any better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

His character is not one we will soon forget.Geoffrey Rush is awesome as the cursed Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom weren't bad, but I just found their characters to be boring.Coming in at just under two and a half hours, some view Pirates as too long, while other, more obsessive fans, didn't want it to end.So, all in all, if you want a fun, swashbuckling, good for the whole family but you actually WILL enjoy it unlike some other movies who said that too, check out Pirates.

"A fun movie, and I own the DVD, but I don't find it quite as good as so many do.","Johnny Depp is a fine actor. I enjoy him in all his roles, and in fact just finished seeing him (again!) as Don Juan Demarco, an underrated movie where he and Brando interact so well. He also did a fine job here as Captain Jack Sparrow, the pirate without a ship. Keira Knightly is fine as the beautiful maiden in distress. Geoffrey Rush, one of the great and versatile actors of our time, is superb as the evil and wiley nemesis Captain Barbossa. The special effects are very well done, and the cinematography is beautiful. However, both times I have seen it, I was never able to get into the story, the curse, and the pirates who appeared as skeletons under moonlight. It is a good and fun movie, but maybe more for the younger crowd, as my 15-year-old neighbors and my two young grandchildren enjoyed it very much. I don't believe it belongs in the top 250, nor does it warrant the (so far) 34% of '10' votes on the IMDb.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A new kind of a movie,"Jerry Bruckheimer created a completely new genre of movie with the Pirates of the Caribbean. It's not just a pirate movie, not just a ghost movie, and not just a comedy, but all combined into one strange tale of curse, legend, and adventure. Not to mention some romance along the way.The movie also created a new character, Capt. Jack Sparrow who's not even human as the hero.The story is bit convoluted and difficult to understand. Why the curse started in the first place, why Jack is cursed, where the heck Davy Jones' locker came from etc. etc. Even if you've paid attention, some of the details still remains unclear, and remains that way in the subsequent sequels.The movie is beautifully made, although bit creepy at times.

Starring A lovable feline pirate ...,"I saw rented this movie for the first time in the middle of 2004. It's kind of a silly movie, and it's extremely violent in parts. We had hoped to show it to our young children but the violence was too great after the first 10 minutes so we shut it off and watched it later ourselves.What kept me watching this entire movie was Johnny Depp. He does an absolutely awesome acting job of playing a cunning but effeminate / feline pirate. half the time he says something his mannerisms just crak me up inside. in the movie he is definitely a heterosexual but there is something just slightly effeminate / feline about his performance that is very amusing. i don't know why this fascinated me so much, but his personality and character were just really irresistible and i kept wondering what he would do and what he would say. it's not often that you see a movie that stars a lovable effeminate / feline pirate. And yes, I'm male too, so this was quite a surprise to me. Anyway, the movie rates about a 6, but johnny depp's performance is a 10 ( by the way, were there any other actors in this movie ?? I didn't notice any of them - Depp stole the show ). Go see it if you haven't seen it, it's a silly movie but its fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Well, I guess it's a Disney movie...","Yeah, it was produced by Disney and the budget had ""Disney"" written all over it, but I have never seen a Disney movie quite like this before... and I like it!  It wasn't easy getting me to this movie: I don't see Disney movies in the theaters... ever and I never see pirate movies, but my friend convinced me to go and to be honest the commercials looked good.Well, I'm glad I went.  This was an experience to behold.  The landscapes and cinematography is beautiful and the acting is terrific.  The story is the only thing in this movie that's Disney and that is only the basic framework. I.g.: Don't expect a surprise ending, be prepared to say, ""Well isn't that ironic?"" In a sarcastic way.  But that is okay because a movie that ends like that is okay now and then.  Besides, what is inside the frame is totally un-Disney and it made me like pirates.There are many sword fights and many people die... I think just one is a record for Disney.  The over all tone is dark and foreboding and the solution to the plot is more like an Indiana Jones film.  While there are more senses on land than in the ocean, all the scenes are beautifully done and look like something you should see in a pirate movie.Now onto the best part of the movie: Jack Sparrow.  I have a new respect, actually I have some respect, for Johnny Depp; no one could have made the role better.  He plays a headstrong, not-not-so-up-to what he thinks he is pirate.  In fact, most of the amazing stuff this guy pulls off is totally luck and total stupidity on the part of his enemies.  He also brings a level of humor that goes between sarcastic and blunt and back and forth that really makes you wonder what he's going to say. The one liners and over all mood he gives the film makes it all that more enjoyable.  He's like a modern day good for nothin' wannabe hippie that had everything dropped into his lap and if it isn't given to him, he gives up... finally a pirate I can relate to!  Anyway, I hope he returns for sequels.Keira Knightly is, well, a perfect balance between talent and beauty.  While anyone could have acted the role she makes the heroic portions of the role all that more believable and she looks damn good doing it.  She's a woman that you can believe four guys would be going after at once.  She is sexy and strong and I loved her in the movie.  Wish I could say the same for Orlando Bloom, but he really wasn't in his element and obviously hasn't developed enough to make the best of what he's got... he seemed to method act a lot of it.  Geoffrey Rush played Barbossa really well and looked especially well.  I really felt hate towards him.In all this is a terrific movie that deserves it's success.  Anyone who says other wise is looking to deep into the movie... it's Disney, and you can't expect Forrest Gump.Go see it even if you don't like pirates or Disney films, I did and I liked it.How it stacks up to me: Forrest Gump: 10/10 snatch.: 9/10 jackass the movie: 8/10 *Pirates of the Caribbean... ect: 7/10* Phone Booth: 7/10 Tears of the Sun: 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Visually stunning but ultimately the usual Bruckheimer tosh.,"I've got to admit this is one of the most disappointing films I saw this year. It was nothing more than a two hour pantomime, featuring some credible acting talent. Has Depp been watching the BBC's ""Stella Street"", as he has an uncanny likeness to Keith Richard's character in the show. He's probably the best actor in the film as well. Bloom was wasted. Rush was surprisingly not evil or nasty enough. The supporting cast was decent enough including some stand out performances from the British actors. The only people I can see enjoying this sort of tosh is children and underdeveloped adults.Can they be making a sequel.

B+/A-... Savvy?,"Pirates of the Caribbean starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, that girl, and that guy, and a monkey.Now, before beginning this review, I'd like to point out that this is a Disney movie - yes, the same people who brought us Finding Nemo and Pocahontas. Indeed. So I figured it could go either way, but would probably get bad reviews and bomb at the box office. Imagine my surprise then, when I arrived at the movie theatre and the movie was sold out for the 6:25 show. Who goes to see a movie on a Wednesday night?? So I bought my ticket for the 6:55 show and sat in the theatre for forever, waiting excitedly for the film to begin. Johnny Depp is hot. Seriously. Big hottie. Especially when you add eye makeup, cool hair, a good outfit, an excellent accent and a cool hat. Plus, he was crazy. As evident in Fear and Loathing, he plays crazy pretty well. The CGI in the film was very good as well - people turning into skeletons and all. Well done. I'm not an Orlando Bloom fan really, seeing as I didn't see either of the Lord of the Rings. So I didn't know what to expect from him, but luckily his role was monstrously overshadowed by Depp. The chick in this movie, whatever her name is, wasn't as good. Her accent needed a little work, she made horrible facial expressions, and it seems as though she got all the crappy lines. The plot was classic Disney - one twist towards the end that would shock the hell out of little kids, and they spelled out the entire plot for you as it happens. Sometimes that's good, when.. say.. you're too busy drooling over Johnny Depp to pay attention.. but still. You have to take that with a grain of salt (why isn't it pepper?) because it's Disney. Okay. So overall I'd give the movie.. well.. a B+/A-.. it wasn't amazing, but it *was* hilarious, and there were good fight scenes and good cgi and it wasn't boring, and very very good Johnny Depp. I think it's one of my favorite movies for him (of course, I haven't seen him in many movies I actually like - he favors scripts that make me drowsy just hearing the titles), so that's my final answer. B+/A-. Savvy?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirate's Life for Me!","There were many reasons to expect a particularly bad film, despite the list of talented actors that included Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, and Orlando Bloom. The fact that the entire is based upon a Disney theme park attraction makes one expect to see a cheesy kids movie. And let us not forget the horror of a film that was thrown at us the last time movie execs came up with the same brilliant idea: The Country Bears.But alas, Disney may have struck gold in Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of The Black Pearl. It is a wonderfully fun action flick, albeit slightly too long, coming in at a padded 2 hours and 23 minutes. Granted, no academy awards will be won for the picture (except possibly for special effects or costume design), but it does not disappoint. It is filled with a thorough plot that leads us through some epic adventures and extremely fun battles.The acting, in particular, is top notch in this movie, led by the great Johnny Depp. It is hard to come up with the right words that can describe the way in which he portrayed Captain Jack Sparrow, but either way, it was nothing short of fantastic. Nobody else in the cast can seem to match the level of intensity that Mr. Depp does, but they all do an admirable job trying. Geoffrey Rush, as his arch-villain ex- first mate, Captain Barbosa, creates a believable villain that movie goers will love to hate. Orlando Bloom (the reason many young ladies will be seeing this movie I suspect) also does a great job portraying Will Turner, a blacksmith and childhood friend of Elizabeth Swann, played by the lovely Keira Knightley, whom he is very much in love with, unbeknownst to her. There are also several supporting actors who add great depth to this movie, such as Jack Davenport (Norrington), Jonathan Price (Governor Weatherby Swann, Elizabeth's father), and several others.Not going into many specifics as to not spoil the fun for those who have yet to catch the film, Jack Sparrow, as captain of The Black Pearl, was ambushed by Barbosa and his men and left for dead. They went on to find a great treasure, which came with a great curse: under the light of the moon, it is revealed that they are nothing but skeletons; undead. Ms. Swann owns a piece of the treasure that is needed to erase the curse, so she is kidnapped along with said treasure. Will Turner, her childhood friend and secret admirer busts Sparrow out of jail and they are off to save his love. Adventure and excitement ensue.The effects in this movie are particularly great, not as much for their visual portrayal, but for their originality. It would have been very easy to make the skeletons of the crew of The Black Pearl white and ordinary (like the kind in the classroom of a high school Biology professor), but they didn't. The fight scenes between the real life actors and the CGI skeletons are also fantastic.The bottom line is that this movie is solid all around. There is nothing about this movie that makes for a great movie, but I imagine that it was never really supposed to be one, and that is admirable. In the end, this movie is exactly what it was meant to be, a good, fun adventure.My rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The First and Best,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)** 1/2 (out of 4)The evil pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps the daughter (Keira Knightley) of a Caribbean governor and heads off but the woman's admirer (Orlando Bloom) asks Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to help him track them down. He reluctantly agrees because he wants revenge against Barbossa who led a mutiny against him years earlier. The first paragraph in Roger Ebert's review perfectly sums up my feelings on this movie because he makes it clear that there's a nice 90-minute ""B"" movie trapped inside an incredibly long and drawn out 142-minutes. Seriously, 142-minutes for a pirate movie? I know this movie has a large group of fans and I know it made hundreds of millions of dollars throughout the world but there are so many great things here that I can't help but feel that they're all wasted simply because someone didn't know how to shout cut and then leave stuff on the cutting room floor. We'll start off with all the good stuff and one can't help but be visually entertained by everything going on. I really loved the look of the sets, the pirate ships, the costumes and of course the dead pirates look terrific as well. I'm not a fan of CGI but I thought they did a pretty good job mixing up the make-up with the special effects and the visual look of the pirates is incredibly good and quite realistic as well. Another major plus is that you can't help but feel as if you're really in the 17th Century. I thought the filmmakers did a terrific job with all the outfits and this here helped add some creditability to the movie. The action scenes are all incredibly well-staged including a terrific bit where the under-maned Sparrow boat must go up against Barbossa's using any item that they can. Another terrific battle happens at the very end but with a summer Blockbuster you expect the action to be good. Then we have the nice performances by Rush, Bloom, Knightley and various other supporting players. I thought Knightley was incredibly good coming off quite sexual as well as being believable in the toughness of the character. Then there's Johnny Depp who picked up an Oscar-nomination for his performance. I can't say I'd call it that great but there's no question that Depp makes the role all his own and even manages to make the performance original, which isn't all that easy to do with a pirate. I really loved the tough of Keith Richards that he threw into the performance and I think any fan of The Stones will enjoy it. However, most of this is wasted because everything just gets dragged out so long that after a while you can't help but feel as if you're got some great eye candy but nothing that tastes overly good. Edit out thirty-minutes and I'd say you'd have a much more entertaining film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Enjoyable Summer Flick,"I took my 14 year old son and his friend to see this movie. It was an enjoyable, but predictable flim. The story was fairly interesting but tended to drag in places. I felt it would have been better if about 20 minutes had been deleted.Johnny Depp was very engaging as Capt. Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly were appealing in their roles as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan.  Geoffrey Rush gave a very solid performance.  Good flim to see with your younger teen family members.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Stupefying!,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is absolutely incredible.I'm very aware that many of the girls (ok, most of the girls) in the world that went to see this film probably just wanted a gander at the lovely Orlando Bloom.... well, I must say, it was really Johnny Depp who stole the show as Captain Jack Sparrow. His hilarious antics and insane actions made me laugh until I nearly cried.Mr.Bloom shows a lot of promise in the future as a successful actor. As Johnny Depp is considered the Marlon Brando of this generation, Orlando will most likely be named the Johnny Depp of the next. He plays Will Turner very well, starting out as a kind of awkward, geeky boy... and slowly molds into a brave and charming young man.Keira Knightley also deserves a word of recognition. Her beauty and talent are undeniable, and her character, Elizabeth Swann, was sweet and independent. I admired Keira's performance and look forward to seeing her in many more movies.Besides all the talented actors in this film... the visual effects were fantastic, and the screenplay was witty and exciting.I Definitely Recommend THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Suprisingly Good (7/10),"[I saw this in the theater, YMMV]First off, I have to say I am a fan of the ride at Disneyworld and looked forward to the movie.  Although there were four or five different parts of the movie I remember from the ride, the movie is not just scenes from the ride strung together inchoerently.  Instead, we slowly learn the story of Captain Jack Sparrow.  For a movie aimed at teenage girls with the inclusion of Orlando Bloom and a feel-good fairy-tale story ending, it is suprisingly good.Finally, I have to say that I was suprised at the end of the movie to see this was a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.  If I had known that, I would never have gone.  He makes terrible, over the top action flicks like Days of Thunder, Bad Boys, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon and Blackhawk Down.  And in retrospect, his grubby fingerprints can be seen in the overly-long action sequences.  The cute computer trick of having the actors move in and out of the moonlight to look whole then like a skeleton is neat the first five minutes of the final fight.  But, as in all Bruckheimer movies, the action for action's sake is dragged on far too long.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good film,"I liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt's performance in Children of a Lesser God , and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner's in JFK, has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp, 'Pirates' is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), you will enjoy 'Pirates'.That is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa, and Orlando Bloom's performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future.Let us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph, for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft, unconscious, wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later, the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor's daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly), now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you're a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates, save Elizabeth, and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight, swordfight, swordfight, and that's about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Depp At His Weird Best,"It's impossible to deny that the first Pirates of the Caribbean is a brilliant film. Is it for kids? Not sure, maybe, but it's something that everyone can enjoy.The story unfolds perfectly across the film, giving rhyme and reason to every character. Insofar as a pirate film can be, it is quite an intelligent plot! Characters each have their strengths and mix together really well. Funny, excitig, with some decent choreography throughout as well. Visually it's impressive for the most part, the CGI at times shows it age (despite not being too old), and design is perfect.It's Depp at his best, and probably the most iconic of his 'weird' characters. Knightley can get irritating but that is probably more from character than anything else. Bloom very much plays a Bloom character, but that isnt so bad. All secondary characters flesh out the story and have excellent interactions due to a witty script.Everyone can enjoy this. Can you say that for the subsequently franchise? Probably not, but the original stands strong.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Truly Amazing,"This film is amazingly stunning!!! I have been to the cinema 7 times to see it, and each time see something new, I didnt see before hand!!!

Solid swashbuckling adventure,"Pirates of the Caribbean is a solid swashbuckling adventure of the type that reminds of me of better times.  In fact, it made me recall The Princess Bride, another film in a similar genre.Performances are fine here, if a bit over the top on many occasions. Johnny Depp is a scene stealer: the audience is just waiting for him to reappear while the other characters get serious screen time.  The heroine is sexy, Orlando Bloom is the typical white hero, lots of funny situations.  Cliche ending, but what do you expect?  The film should have ended sooner, and some of the snappy comments were rather stupid.So, it's not a masterpiece but, all in all, a very solid piece of cinematic entertainment.

Bloom makes another appearance in a big movie, but both his and Knightley's characters are fairly shut out due to Depp. Some great dialogue; the script is absolutely hilarious. I have to admit I loved the costuming and makeup (it's unfortunate that all its Oscar nominations occurred during the year of Lord of the Rings). The music is also wonderful, fitting the adventurish theme perfectly.

Great Entertainment,"I must confess, at the beginning I was not very enthusiastic about seeing this movie. I wondered ""What new thing can be told about pirates?"" not to mention that pirates movies were not precisely my main choice, due to terrible flicks such as ""Cutthroat Island"" (yuck), but then I said, if I'm going to criticize a movie I have to see it, right? OK, so I went to the movie theater with my pals, expecting to see a big waste of money, but, you know what? You can imagine, I LOVED IT! yes, I found it really amusing, but not banal, you know, everything was perfectly synchronized to work, to make laugh, even to scare. I have to say that Mr. Johnny Depp's performance is OUT OF THIS WORLD, fantastic, I'm not saying that his previous films were not superior, actually, some of them are; but I rediscovered Mr. Depp with this film, he is really a comedic actor. I can even suggest the Academy a well deserved award for him. Or for Mr. Geoffrey Rush. AMAZING! he is another great actor who doesn't take himself so seriously, giving his character a special dose of sarcasm and fun. Then, the lead couple, Orlando Bloom & Kyra Knightley (hope I wrote it right), they just do their job, I'm not saying they're bad, but their characters are not really as appealing as Depp's and Rush's roles are. But I must say She is gorgeous. Then, the delirious crew of the Black Pearl, they are simply funny! What else, oh yeah, the art direction, the costume design, the special effects, the makeup; those characteristics that can even be more important than the story of acting (Terminator 3?), but in this movie, they just combine perfectly to deliver an excellent product.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not bad but not great either,I had high hopes for this film but I was a bit let down.  The story is great and so is the acting.  In fact if it weren't for Johnny Depp's excellently done character then I wouldn't even recommend the movie at all.  The biggest problem (and it's a big one indeed) is that this movie is really slow in spots.  If they would cut it down at least 30 minutes then it would have been better.  Too many spots where it just dragged on and on.The fight sequences are good but too few.  Over all I basically enjoyed the film but not like I had hoped.  Personally I think League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was better.  This movie is worth seeing though it just could have been better.  But you'll LOVE Johnny Depp as Capt.

Moreover, the writing is much better than I remembered it to be. The dialogue always builds characters or moves the plot forward, with minimal exposition. The right balance of comedy, action, and pirate mythology is achieved flawlessly.The only issue I had with the movie, which is a significant one, is that I found Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, to be quite unimpressive.

And the computer simulated scenes took it into the realm of fantasy and more like the Disneyland ride it was based on.

Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and Keira Knightley also perform superbly in the film.These performances, combined with a magnificent soundtrack, fun swordfighting scenes, and a good plot make a great movie.  That said, there were some plot elements that I didn't quite understand, but they were few and not so confusing that I couldn't enjoy the movie.I recommend this movie to those who love pirate movies or movies that are fun, funny, and exciting with a bit of romance thrown in.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

His Name Is Jack Sparrow...,"Johnny Depp made an amazing performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, a funny, silly pirate that is definitely looking for trouble. He has some cursed ""friends"" that he has to stop before they take over the sea. This is a classic movie, I have watched it many times, this is a very rewatchable movie, that is very entertaining and fun, many pirates and for fans of ocean fiction this is very good👍The best part is that Jack Sparrow isn't an aggressive bad pirate, I mean, he is kind of bad, but what I mean is that he is not a angry, grumpy pirate as in all of the pirate stories. He is something new and a different pirate, where I laughed of him many times. Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow was phenomenal, he played with good humor, and besides Johnny Depp is a good actor himself. The story was showed very well, too. Great ghost pirates, spooky and creepy, the pirate fight were bloody and full of action, great camera work and very well directed. The iconic Pirates of The Caribbean theme by Hans Zimmer and Klaus Badelt is so rememberable, fantastically composed and fit the movie perfectly! You should watch this movie, it's original, iconic, funny, especially with Johnny Depp's scenes, very entertaining and if you like movies about the sea and pirates, this is the prefect movie for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
...and a bottle of rum! (Or two. Or three even.),"I watched this last night at a sneak preview here in NYC and I came away impressed. Johnny Depp has proven that he is the man, once and for all. I swear, from the moment you first see him, you're gonna have a big smile on your face. He's hilarious. That entrance was priceless. I kid you not when I tell you that it is worth shelling out the ten bucks just for his performance alone. Think of him as a Raoul Duke toned down for the Disney audience. As for the rest of the movie, I found it very enjoyable and the only thing that I'd complain about is the length which was a tad bit much. You start feeling it a little after the two hour mark. Also, there's something about a Bruckheimer produced movie that makes me want to throttle the man. It gives the movie a slightly canned, ""Bruckheimer Style"" flavor that makes me want to jam a finger down my throat and purge Monty Python's Meaning of Life style. The music, the chaotic action, I don't know. I'll say it upfront, I don't like the man but you probably figured that out already. Keira Knightley is damn fine. Thank god seventeen is legal in New York because I was kind of starting to feel bad thinking about how I would have liked to plunder her treasure. Filthiness aside, she played her part well, though her character's importance became irrelevant after the halfway mark. Orlando Bloom, while well cast, needs to be given a part that stretches his abilities a bit more. With a two hour plus runtime, there was no excuse for not having his character fully fleshed out and simply having him stare angrily at any of the villains. Maybe I'm wrong but I just felt he was sadly under used. Speaking of villains, Geoffrey Rush seems to be perfect in these types of scenery chewing, teeth gnashing roles. His performance here reminded me of his unapologetic performance in ""House on Haunted Hill"", the best thing about that particular movie. He makes for a good bad guy, so much that you never really hate him. He's a joy to watch as well. The direction by Gore Verbinski was surehanded and whoever was responsible for the writing gets kudos also. I found myself laughing a lot more than I thought I would, believe it or not. The action was pretty chaotic but on occasion goes on for longer than it should. The special effects were pretty good but I think ILM has been falling off as of late. I'm not trashing their work but it just seems uninspired these past few films (cough... cough...Dreamcatcher... cough) In the end, it's Depp's picture all the way. Thankfully this movie knows that it's supposed to be fun and not self-important. Not a bad way to spend two and a half hours. And if you do end up watching this and you don't enjoy hearing Captain Jack Sparrow slur every other word, I don't know what else to tell you. Rating: ***1/2 out of *****.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Best of Films, The Worst of Films","Pirates of the Caribbean wasn't the best movie I've seen, but it wasn't the worst either. If nothing else, it was just plain escapist fun and a swashbuckling adventure ride. It's more style than substance and pretty much just captures your attention because of its cool effects. The plot itself is pretty much nothing spectacular or very surprising. Even though the movie has great actors like Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, and Geoffrey Rush, I kept on getting the impression that each of them could have somehow done better. Especially Orlando Bloom who didn't really seem to be making much of an effort. I'm told that there's a sequel in the works - two, in fact. So either the producers are leaving room for improvement, or just looking to make a quick buck.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fantastic achievement,"I was really looking forward to this film, and I'll admit it was mostly because I am a huge Orlando Bloom fan, but I was amazed and astounded by the greatness of this movie. I actually expected mediocre and got mind blowing amazingness. After seeing so many disappointing films lately it was great to see something that simply blew me off my feet.Every aspect of this film was wonderful and I can think of nothing bad to say. The script was well written, the plot actually worked and wasn't just silly, the action was fast and intense but easy to follow which I love, the effects were ASTOUNDING!!!! The love storyline was there but didn't take up much screen time which was great because that's not what the movie is, it's an adventure, not a romance.But the dialogue was so crisp and Jack Sparrows really made this movie something special. Even without saying anything, just a look or hand gesture worked great, but his spoken words were cutting and extremely delightful. The rest of the cast was also phenomenal, though Depp clearly sticks out as amazing. Bloom did great in his first real lead I've seen and was a perfect straight man for Depp, Knightley surprised me with her abilities and her great screen look. The supporting cast did their job as well.Overall I gave this movie a 10/10 because I believe it is possibly the most entertaining film I have EVER seen and I have seen many. The hours flew by and I actually wished it was longer. I have absolutely nothing bad to say, and I can't express enough how much I loved and enjoyed this film. I will be seeing it again several times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A lot of people really loved this film. I'm one of them,"Until about a month ago, The Two Towers was unique for being the only film I had ever gone to see in a cinema on more than one occasion. It's not unique any more, and to a great extent, it's also overshadowed. I've been to see this gem more often...There are a lot of high points to this movie...namely, it's what a trip to the cinema is all about, transportation to another place, if even for a couple of hours. Oh sure, Middle Earth is another place too, but it's not exactly fun, is it. I enjoy looking at it, but do I really want to walk through the cinema screen into the battle at Helm's Deep? I think not. Escapism. Sure, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush give the ultimate performances in it. But lots of things about this movie worked for me. The set design, the special effects, the weather...and tiny little details that you wouldn't miss if they weren't there, but which added to the movie big time. If I had to list a favourite movie of all time, I used to say The Princess Bride, or the first Matrix or whatever mood I am in. But I've seen this one five times now and it still is not tedious, still fresh...and it's pretty much there. I'm not surprised people loved it.

Gack!,"Okay, what the hell happened?  Yesterday, I checked here to see what people were thinking of this movie, and judging by the comments, it looked like a good movie to see with my girlfriend.Ugh, not even close.  I gave this movie a 3 in the vote, and that was for its only redeeming feature, Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow.  Without the characterization he gave, this movie had nothing, nothing to hold my interest.The love story was uninvolving.  The pirates were kind of cool, and the action was decent.  But you know things are going bad when at one point in the movie, you're laughing because the lead actress's lipstick glaringly sticks out considering her circumstances at the time.  Set in colonial times, and lacking access to anything remotely resembling Revlon, I couldn't decide to laugh or groan at such poor makeup, direction, and review.The only reason I would recommend this movie to anyone is if someone is a fan of Johnny Depp.  He was excellent.

Pirates of the Caribbean was a good movie with three story lines blended into one.,"Pirates of the Caribbean was a good movie with three story lines blended into one. There was the love story between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, Jack Sparrow's story of revenge towards his former first mate, and the Black Pearl's crew's story of wanting to be free of the curse.The actors all did a wonderful job, Johnny Depp at Jack Sparrow was superb. Geoffrey Rush as the not alive but not dead Captian Barbosa was excellent. Watch his eyes in the scene where he is watching Elizabeth eat. You can see the through his eyes alone how he covets the fact that she can eat and enjoy food and he can't.Johnny Depp is always excellent in his films, and he does not disappoint in this film.There are many links throughout the film, for instance, the two captains are linked from their entrances. Jack Sparrow is first seen from behind sailing into Port Royal on his boat, then the camera shows him from the front. Captian Barbosa is first seen from behind on his boat, then we see him from the front.There are two comical Royal Navy sailors who are never apart, one short and stout with dark hair, and one skinny with blonde hair. There are two comical pirates on the Black Pearl who are never apart, one short and stout with dark hair, and one skinny with blonde hair. This sends a message that sailors are not much different whether they be legit or pirates.When they open the window in Elizabeth's room, you see a peak outside. Remember that peak, it will show up in other parts of the film.It's interesting that three skeletons of pirates are hanging on the way to Port Royal, the first skeleton pirates that Jack sees. Now that's what you call premonition.I certainly hope that everyone stayed past the credits to see the last scene from the film where the monkey takes one piece of gold out of the chest, thus putting the curse back on again.The music is mesmerizing and each section is fitting. When jack sees the dead pirates, the music changes from a rousing pirate theme to a somber theme with a male chorus humming, much more reverent. I bet a lot of people didn't catch that.It's true that this film takes some attention span, those lacking that will not like it. It also requires a good grasp on vocabulary, as there are many words and phrases that some people have probably never heard.Of course, I'm sure we all remember who Cortez was and what he did.Anyway, there is more, but that is all I will write now.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
cute,"Fun film.  It's the first time I've seen Depp do a crowd-pleasing lead.  His Jack Sparrow is pretty much standard Deppian posturing which really works for me, but I was surprised to see it as the centerpiece of a Summer blockbuster.  Between Scissorhands and Fear and Loathing, he always seemed to me at least as smart as the script, but in this case he pretty much soars above it and delivers his lines with a real relish for camp.The rest of the film was sorta okay, which is saying a lot since I generally loath the work of The House of Bruckheimer.  Like a lot of other 2.5 hour braindead epics, this one could have edited down for time.  It's not Bergman for heaven's sake - the characters beyond Depp's and Rush's (and theirs are all style) are almost cheap cardboard cutouts.  The advantage of stock characters is supposed to be economy.The story is excellent compared to general summer fair, especially in this summer plagued by stories ripped from comics, old TV shows, reality TV, and, in Bruckheimer's other Summer film, a bunch of cop show cliches mashed together.  It's not so complex a story that 2.5 hours is necessary.If producer Bruckheimer has a signature shot it's either 1) that much overused A-Team stunt explosion in the middle ground while a person is catapulted away from it in the fore, arms and legs kicking, or 2) special effect shots THAT NEVER END.  In almost any Bruckheimer film there is an effect or stunt that makes you say `wow' and you want to see it again, like the melting heads in Raiders of the Lost Arc once did.  With Bruckheimer you can count on seeing that effect over and over and over again during the course of the film until every drop of techno magic is drained.The shot of the undead pirates walking on the ocean floor was great.  It is exactly the sort of imaginative storytelling that has been lacking in many recent blockbuster films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

As Fun as an Amusement Ride,"""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is an over-the-top romp that's just plain fun. Gee, much like an amusement park ride.Too bad the roster of good actors (including from British TV comedies ""The Office"" and ""Coupling"") were clearly directed to lay it all on broadly (except Jonathan Pryce who is very atypically laid-back and therefore wasted).Orlando Bloom doesn't get to do too much, Geoffrey Rush has a ball being a villain, while Johnny Depp steals the show with his loopy pirate captain (I like most folks comparison of him to Keith Richards). I figure the only reason he plays it sort of drunken and crazy is to not add an unintentional romantic triangle with a very contemporarily feisty Keira Knightley.For all the action, there's too many close-ups and not enough opportunity to take it all in from a broader perspective.Stay through the extensive credits (and, evidently yes, they did film some of it in the Caribbean) to see a cute plot coda.The music is so bombastic and continuous that it's not completely attributed to just Hans Zimmer but to a large team.(originally written 7/16/2003)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Whoa is me.,"Whoa is me.  Johnny Depp didn't take this film very seriously.  I know it's not a serious film but actor decisions are and either he or the director made some very bad choices for the Captain Sparrow character. He was so swishy.  Who is the hero in this film?  No one.  I didn't care about any of these people.  In addition, this is a two joke movie: 1) Look mom. The pirates turn into skeletons in the moonlight at least 1567 times.  Isn't that fun?  2) Look mom.  An eyeball has a fork in it and it rolls along the ground and it falls out of that guys face and...Isn't that fun?  Nope.

One of the best soundtracks of all time - watch it just on the music alone,"Watching this 17 years later this is still holding up as an excellent action movie full of great wit and humour. Some movies do such a good job somewhat smaller cogs that make a movie, that makes it seem so important, it leaves you wondering why this much focus isn't spent on other films. Pirates does this in many areas.
-Costume design for one. The costumes are such a strength, made even better alongside the intricately detailed props. Everything feels and looks authentic.
-The ships are also very cool! This is one film's set design I would love to visit and be a part of.
-The soundtrack has been one that has been in my head, stuck for nearly two decades. Equal to the greats like Howard Shore or Hans Zimmer. It brings so much action and joy and makes you want to move around for sure.
-Lastly the actors. Such a good cast and hard to think that this was the early breaks for Orlando and Keira, who are now pretty big deals. My most favourite role of Johnny Depp, don't really like him in anything else, but he's awesome in this!

Some Complaints,"I was not thoroughly impressed with Pirates of the Caribbean, as I had heard several glowing word-of-mouth reviews.  I have to admit that Johnny Depp's performance was quite hilarious and was the best thing about this movie.  One complaint is that the movie is way too long.  They could have easily chopped 30-45 minutes from this film without sacrificing anything. Another complaint is the level of violence.  I am a horror fan, and certainly am not against violence in the movies. However, the impression this movie gives prior to watching is that it is a Disney-esque film.  I think the PG rating is too leniant and the given the stabbings, shootings, and blood that abound in this film, they should have raised it. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Keira Knightly Ruins It !!!!!!!!!,"I usually love anything that Johnny Depp is in, but this film is an exception, mainly because they picked the worst actress in the world to play the leading lady.

She is truly terrible, the only bit i thought she was good was when she fell off the castle wall. But otherwise this film is quite good, i thought Johnny Depp was brilliant playing Jack Sparrow and also looked gorgeous in the process, which isn't very hard for Johnny Depp. Unfortuanatly i could only bear to watch this film once because of keiras unemotional presence and Orlando Bloom being overcast by Johnny's shadow.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The night my dog was poisoned.,"What an incredible, dashing, romantic and fun-filled adventure was the unexpectedly good film ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"". Johnny Depp's performance is universally extolled and rightfully so however for me the tour de force performance was that of Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. Rush morphed into an 18th century pirate from the golden-age of piracy and for me his performance is the gold standard for portraying a pirate. Good performances abound in the first installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean series (it should have been the first and last but greedy studio executives had to soil a good thing for a buck) it wasn't merely the Depp and Rush performances there was also the performance of lovely and delightful femme fatale Elizabeth Swann (aka. Keira Knightly), the noble and proud Norrington (Jack Davenport), the amusing but sinister Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and many other convincing performances as well.

Better than first,"The films opening scene was fantastic. It was fun and creative and really captured the essence of the Jack Sparrow that we love. It kept going for a bit. The first 20 minutes of the movie were the most exciting and fun parts of the movie except for one scene which I feel may be second best scene in all the Pirates films.The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. It was very reminiscent of the powerful underwater march of the dead from the first film.Lets move onto the acting. Most of it was decently solid but Ian McShane as the villain, Black Beard stole the show. He actually seemed like the only one who cared to make the film interesting. Another newcomer to the series was Penelope Cruz. She was nothing fantastic but completely necessary to bring in a much needed sex appeal to the film. Geoffrey Rush returned as Barbosa, I felt he was very confused as to if he was a bad guy or good guy which caused his acting to seem very indifferent. There were a few scenes that you knew he was having fun but otherwise he was just a drag. And of course Johnny Depp reprized his role as the witty fun loving Captain Jack Sparrow. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes.The story was super simple, which I guess is understandable considering the convoluted mess of 2 and 3.There was an unnecessary sub plot that never got resolved, which I wish they spent a little more time on and made it a little darker. I am not going to spoil anything though, but you will see what I am talking about when you see the film. As you wait for the scene after the credits you want it to be the conclusion to this sub plot but nope. The climax could have been a bit more climatic and more exciting, but I guess they did what they could. Most of the action happens in the dark so I would not recommend the 3D transfer of it. I saw it in 2D and I thought the 3D wouldn't be worth it.It was nothing special and definitely not Gore Verbinski. The way the film turned out, it looked like the director was even bored while shooting.Positively though it is a summer blockbuster where your brain needs to be left at home and will be enjoyed by lovers of the series. It may not stay with you but for an hour and half of the movie out of the 2+ running time you will be enjoying yourself which I guess is not too bad.On initial reaction to the film I gave it a 7/10 because at the time it was enjoyable. Then I thought about it and the reason I almost fell asleep twice was not because it was late, it was because the story was boring and nothing was really happening in this lengthy piece of work. Therefore on second reaction it gets a 5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So damn entertaining from start to finish!,"This is a great, entertaining period adventure comedy drama. Johnny Depp as the charming, hilarious and morally ambiguous pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow is the highlight amongst the cast.

The score is terrific and memorable. The sets and costumes are apt and transport you into another world. Disney struck gold with this concept! For 2003, the CGI is quite impressive.

I'm cursed by the black sleep (dad),"In 2011, i tried opus 4 with Penelope and it was so slow, so dark that I felt asleep in my seat ! Now it's the second (!) time i try to watch this DVD because of Keira and it happens again ! even if the production is baroque and visually stunning, the pace of the movie is terribly dull and its attraction wagon moves faster and is more exciting ! Sure there is efforts to have a dense story and there are strong characters and funny back roles as well, but the way it's told and filmed isn't dynamic : so it's a pure Disney movie as every age can follow what happens on screen, old or young ! The action sequences are quite boring and repetitive, Deep gets irritating with his pantomimes, Pryce with his usual dandy manner (he is not John Cleese !) and getting aboard and out of ships isn't really exciting at the end ! With this dragging ambiance, i felt again asleep when Keira was abducted ! At least she was here because she is really the revelation of this movie as well as the fighting skeletons by moonlight ! Withtout them, i couldn't have sustain such a long movie for which i have the big feeling to have seen it already before !",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Da Movie aint bad,"i just saw the movie and even though i had no intention of seeing it in the first place i got to say it wasn't that bad. I'm not usually into big pirate adventure back in the day kind of movies but this was pretty good.  The fighting scenes are pretty decent and may i compliment Johnny Depp on an excellent performance.

Worth it's hype,"This was, to say the least, an interesting watch. For the longest time, this was a franchise I avoided, to an outsider not introduced into the world of swashbuckling pirates, it looked absolutely foolishly stupid.But then as the end credits roll, I'm a changed man. From the beginning till the end, I was frankly speaking, enraptured by it. The soundtrack, the cinematography, and most of all the cast. Johnny Depp simply has an unexplainable air about him that makes him perfect. Kiera Knightly's performance was also spot on.If you're one like me and dubious about it's popularity, I'd say just give it a try.

I LOVED this movie!!,There has rarely been a film that I wanted to watch 2 times in 1 day..but this is definitely one of the few.  There was just something about the movie that draws you in.  The acting for one is great.  I thought Johnny Depp was hilarious..just the way he walked and talked..but it fit the character perfectly and really made him stand out.  He couldn't have done a better job.  And Orlando Bloom..besides the fact that he's a great actor is of course yummy as always and apparently has great tastes in movies (first LOTR and now this).  It's nice to see Hollywood producing movies that don't have the same feeling of 5000 movies before them.  Definitely a 10/10.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Johnny Depp saves 'Lord of the Rings' meets 'The Mummy',"Let's get one thing straight up front and that is that I am only comparing this film to 'Lord of the Rings' in terms of its gothic action sequences with the ghostly skeletons.  The lighting on these scenes is almost identical to some parts of 'LOTR'.  The shadowy cascade of computer special effects mimic parts of 'The Mummy' with a hero and the damsel in distress fully in hand.Other than that, Johnny Depp is absolutely outstanding.  His charasmatic and eccentric qualities save this movie and it ranks a 9 out of 10 whenever he is speaking or engaged in the important moments.  Geoffrey Rush is also quite good in his role but when the other actors are present, the film comes off as superficial.Directed like a pure popcorn summer movie, it's odd that this really isn't a family film because a lot of the dark moments of horror are definitey NOT for young children.  The film also suffers from overlength at almost two and a half hours.  The attention span of children and teenagers is being stretched at such a length.This movie is worth a look but that's about it.  It makes a good movie as an alternative plan to what you're going to do.  Our party was rained out at golf and we decided to take in this flick.  To make a special trip out to see it would have been a task and Hollywood is already full of tired stories like this and the search (if there is one by the movie industry) for originality goes on!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Well...It's Not That Good,"It was hard not to be biased going into this film. Jerry Bruckheimer has been responsible for some of the worse movies in recent memory: Kangaroo Jack, Pearl Harbor, Coyote Ugly, Gone In 60 Seconds, Armageddon. Nonetheless, the prospect of pirates occupying the bigscreen for a couple of hours was quite appealing.There, unfortunately lies one of the film's weaknesses: it's too damn long! A half hour of this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor...maybe reappearing for the DVD release.Johnny Depp is brilliant as Captain Jack Sparrow...but i'm sure you've already heard that in other reviews by now. Jeffery Rush's performance is also noteworthy, however the rest of the supporting cast is mediocre at best.Depp is amazing...but that in itself does not warrant throwing down $9 for this movie. Perhaps if you stay in the theater and check another mediocre movie afterwards it would be worth it. Otherwise, wait for the DVD. At least then you have a remote available!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Okay-ish,"Why is it that every blockbuster now thinks that it has to come in at over 2hrs, some judicious editing especially in the fight scenes and this film could have come in at about 1hr 40 and been much tighter for it. Instead the film finds itself in the doldrums for long periods at a time.Johnny Depp as the eccentric Captain Sparrow is wonderful, Orlando Bloom is so-so, in several fight scenes you were half expecting him to whip out his bow and fill the enemy full of arrows.Jack Davenport, plays Jack Davenport, a stiff English middle class guy, just as he plays in Coupling and Ultraviolet but it's nice to see him getting exposure on the Big Screen",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
There's no way this should have worked,"This was realistically little hope that the third straight attempt by Disney to turn one of their amusement park rides into a movie was going to be any better than it's dismal predecessors.There was realistically little hope that a big budget pirate movie would fare better than the big budget pirate movies that failed critically and commercially in the previous two decades.So why did this work so well?Gore Verbinski had pulled of the equally unlikely feat of making a good American remake of ""Ringu"". He seems to bring to this film an appreciation for what makes traditional swashbucklers so enjoyable while not simply trying to reproduce them ... it's a successful update of the genre.Johnny Depp's eccentric performances can go off the rails, but his pirate-as-a-drunk-Keith-Richards idea is really inspired madness. Both he and Geoffrey Rush play BIG here, but they wisely play it straight too.Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are good straight heroes. Updated versions of the traditional hero types. Neither of them go BIG.The films probably a bit too long and a bit too in love with CGI, but on the whole ... this is an example of how to do mainstream blockbuster filmmaking right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun but hugely overrated,"I saw POTC at the cinema and wasn't that blown away by it to be honest. So I rented it to see if maybe I liked it more second time around, seeing as how everybody seems to rate it so highly.But no, I still think it's overlong, unfunny and...just average really. It's not the worst film ever, but it certainly doesn't deserve the 'best film of the summer' taglines either. There's too much talk and not enough action IMO, and the leads are pretty to look at, but utterly bland in the acting stakes (Bloom and Knightley have all the sexual chemistry of two wet towels being thrown together). And Depp is just annoying. What's so 'brave' about a performance that basically comes down to pretending to be drunk for the entire movie. Brave? I'd call it lazy if anything. And I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, before you beat me with clubs.Cutthroat Island however, is a much better pirate movie IMO. Hell, all the best action in POTC is stolen from this very movie (the monkey, the ship-to-ship firefight, characters getting trapped in the hold before the ship blows up).Don't get me wrong, I liked POTC, but can't help but feel it's hugely overrated, especially compared to the bombastic action in Cutthroat Island.

OK but too cartoonish for me,"A bunch of pirates have been cursed and need the blood of a certain individual to break the curse. They end up chasing two englishpersons, Elizabeth played by Keira Knightley, and Will played by Orland Bloom. Helping them out is the good guy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow played by Depp.Depp gives an energetic performance to be sure but this movie goes way over the top with outrageous scenes and dialogue that would never happen in real life.

I personally think this is one of the weaker and slower Pirates movies and many modern movies like Jungle Cruise, provide a crazier and more entertaining adventure.

Dreadful,"The screenwriting is so dreadful. They lead you to confrontations and constantly sneak out the back door, avoiding action, interest and movie magic. The film is a near joke, despite a few beautiful boys being cast in it. And the good performance by Johnny Depp? Actually, it's quite bad.

"Swash, swash, buckle, buckle","I remember when this movie came out in 2003. It was a bit of a cultural phenomenon just thrilling people left and right. I saw it in theaters at the time and thought it was a generally fun adventure movie with a strong visual sense brought by this guy with a weird name, Gore Verbinski. I never saw the rapturous experience that others of my generation seemed to get from it, and here I am, twenty years later, after occasionally watching it from time to time, wondering about the difference in opinion. Well, I still think it's a perfectly fine adventure tale, and I think I understand why I've been kind of muted in response compared to many other people.The film isn't an ensemble picture, Orlando Bloom's Will Turner is very much the main character and protagonist, but it's so ungainly in focus that it ends up feeling like one. One of the film's strengths, that it actually takes time with some of its characters to give them some level of depth, actually, I think, ends up working slightly against the film because there are so many different competing ideas at play all throughout that the film ends up being about several different things at once while never really giving any of the ideas the kind of attention it needs to develop in an interesting direction. It's just a silly adventure movie, though, why should it matter? Well, it matters when the movie itself introduces these ideas, treats them seriously for several minutes, and then drops them completely.I see three big ideas that movie is trying to address to some degree or another. The first is the idea of fables growing from real stories, like the dreaded tales of the Black Pearl or, most particularly, the stories of Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) past. The second is the idea of a ship being freedom. The third is the most interesting of the three, the idea of pirates, creatures of the physical, material, and sensual, being doomed to spend eternity without any sensation whatsoever. The first would be best for a simple adventure story, the second gets all kinds of mixed up with the idea of piracy being a moral good (which is how the film ends, making it super weird), and the third would be best for something a bit less swashbuckling. All three together, though, create a mishmash of ideas that just cause thematic confusion in a movie that really should just be about the swashbuckling.Anyway, the movie itself is about the adventures of lovelorn Will Turner trying to get back the object of his affection Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) after she's kidnapped by the ghost pirates of the Black Pearl led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) while the British Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) is also in pursuit with Swann's father, the governor (Jonathan Pryce). There's an island that can't be found except by those who already know where it is, cursed Aztek gold, piracy, ship battles, and a lot of sword fights with unkillable skeleton monsters.I have a theory on how the majority of people enjoy films, and it's pretty much exclusively about plot. Most people want a plot they can't predict but still makes sense, first and foremost from their entertainments. Interesting characters are secondary while themes and style are simply not important to most. Well, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl delivers on that kind of entertainment. Boiled down to its essence, the plot isn't that complicated about a boy trying to get back his girl, but the script by Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott introduces so many double crosses, twists, and turns that audiences, especially on first viewings, are left guessing, feeling like the movie is really smart. There is intelligence to the intricate nature of the plotting, how everything gets set up and paid off, that is fairly satisfying, but I always find that a thin kind of entertainment. I'm not denying that it works, I'm just saying that it's amusing but not that fun.Where the fun really comes in is through performances. Johnny Depp in his Academy Award nominated role brings a levity to the film that is honestly sorely needed considering how often the film gets kind of ponderous especially in the beginning. Rush takes to his tortured role of Barbossa with incredible relish, savoring every exaggerated syllable as he speaks. Orlando Bloom is fine as the straight man in all this, providing us the grounding in the adventure, while Kiera Knightley is both pretty and a bit feisty as Elizabeth.The action is also clear, energetic, and propulsive, rarely falling into repetition with a lot of variety in how things get done with good use of special effects on the ghosts. Visually, the movie is often quite just nice to look at, providing a certain painterly aspect to key shots like the pirates walking along the seafloor to overtake a ship.There's a lot to recommend in the film, and it's a fun overall experience. However, it's bumpy along the way. I'd be entertained by a supercut of the film that was just every time someone said the word ""pirate"", showcasing the super-serious take on the word that oozes out of most people's mouths (especially Davenport as Norrington), providing an oddly serious air to the internal world of the film that seems caught between realism and fantasy. Also, the conflicting ideas that never really get time to shine (and the really odd way the movie excuses piracy at the end as well) move the film in directions it's uninterested in actually pursuing. Still, the buckles are swashed good and fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not bad, but not really all that great","I cannot help but think that this film could have been much better in more capable hands. As others have noted, it runs way too long. Roger Ebert rather astutely observed that somewhere in this 143 minute movie could be a decent 90 minute movie; perhaps he is correct, though we might never know. Gore Verbinski should re-edit this movie for a director's cut and leave out about forty-five minutes; perhaps that would help resolve at least some of its shortcomings. The acting is nothing special, which is to be expected given the way the film plays like a combination of a slapstick comedy and a children's movie. Johnny Depp is a very good, serious actor, as evidenced in ""Blow,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" ""Finding Neverland,"" etc., though I didn't really like his performance in this film. He does much as much can be expected to develop his character, though I cannot help but wonder if he (along with the rest of the cast) considered this from the onset as simply a paycheck because it appears many of the actors didn't take it seriously and merely phoned in their performances. It doesn't help that they didn't have much with which to work, either. I'm not certain why the principle leads would sign on for two more entries to this series, though money would again be the prime suspect. Action-adventure movies can be fun and entertaining without being shallow and resorting to clichéd tactics as this movie does; the recent Harry Potter and Spider-man movies are good examples of movies that successfully combine entertainment and action with competent, intelligent scripting. Furthermore, it seems to me the makers of this movie could not decide what the target audience for this movie would be, and the result is that it appears to be intended for children, yet is entirely too long to retain their attention and contains entirely too much violence and too many gruesome effects for children. This seems to be a problematic trademark for Verbinski, whose ""Mousehunt"" (1997) seemed to be clearly intended for children, yet contained some decidedly adult humor. I cannot really recommend a movie that has me wishing it would end halfway through it, which this one did. That is not to say it is bad or that it is dull because it is undoubtedly ambitious and there are moments throughout the film, until the last frames, which show undeniable sparks of energy. Some of the scenes work well and the action is more than adequate. Also, we don't see very many pirate movies any more, so it does have that going for it, you know, which is nice. Ultimately, however, the film meanders about, loses focus and is simply not good enough to warrant a viewing. With two more movies on the way, perhaps there was enough material among this trilogy that would have warranted making 1.5 or even 2 movies from the first the one. I received the DVD as a present, watched it once and must say I am not in a hurry to sit through it again.

Simply amazing...one of the best films of the year...savvy?,"OK. I went to see this film full of doubts. My friend is a few years younger than me and loves Orlando Bloom since his appearance as Legolas and she liked Johnny Depp to so not surprising she saw it on opening night. After dealing with her gushing over the male leads and for a few days and constant bugging by my brother to see the film I eventually went with no expectations. I wasnt a great fan of 'Legolas' and Id only seen Johnny Depp in Sleepy Hollow which was (IMHO) rather an odd film.From the second Depp appeared on screen I was hooked. Orlandos first appearance in the governors house had left me swooning but it was Johnny Depp that left me glued to the screen. Jack Sparrows introduction was amazing and had me in stitches (my condition for most of the film)The performances by each of the main characters was absolutely flawless, the chemistry that played between Will, Elizabeth and Jack was sparkling. The special effects were brilliant and the story was enthralling.I have to say that I left the film deeply on love with both Orlando and Johnny...but more so Jack Sparrow! Johnny Depp stole this film. His performance was faultless and as unlikely as it is he deserves an oscar for this performance - he was flawless!I left the cinema with the film still fresh in my head, and went to see it the next day...and 3 times the week after. I have also already managed to obtain the film on DVD and its already been watched at home 4 times and is in danger of melting! Im even starting to pick up some of Jacks words...savvy? :-) Now thats not a good sign...LOLIMHO I give this film top marks...10/10 fantastic performances from the 4 leads: Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom in particular but Geoffrey Rush and Kieira Knightley were on top form too.

Love me a good pirate,This movie was hard for me to decide exactly where I want to rate it compared to other movies I like where it's an all around fun film with decent jokes and good ideals with a fun cast that interact well. I wouldn't say there's much substance to it but it really doesn't need it. The pacing I think was the best part of this movie it has 2 and a half hours yet it was able to fit so much in without making it feel like it was dragging so it was a very fun watch like I found myself being like oh it's been a while the movies probably gonna end soon and then I was like OH THERES STILL AN HOUR AND A HALF LEFT Yippee!!

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003),"Directed by Gore Verbinski. Starring Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Kevin R. McNally, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Giles New, Angus Barnett, Damian O'Hare, Zoe Saldana. (PG-13)Bloated pirate swashbuckler, superficially based on the Disney theme park attraction (because a Broadway musical about log flumes was considered too daring?), accompanied by supernatural elements that co-mingle with the usual cannon fire and swordplay. Depp is the grogged-up and swishy Jack Sparrow, former captain of the ""cursed"" ship, the Black Pearl; he reluctantly teams up with a blacksmith (Bloom) to thwart the villainous, ghostly Barbossa (Rush), who has kidnapped Bloom's lady love (Knightley). Stylish, atmospheric, intricately-designed production has plenty of action and humor, dominated by an enjoyably amusing performance from Depp, even if a little less of him would have made him more endearing. Unfortunately, the film is also fatally overlong, with at least one too many large-scale action sequences, not to mention repetitive fights that go on and on, long past the point that mild excitement transitions to tedium (overall interest dies out sometime in the middle of the broadside-bombarding sea battle...and there's still almost an hour left to go!). The first film under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to earn a PG-13 rating, which no doubt helped it attract the lucrative teenager crowd and turn it into a major blockbuster; big enough, it seems, to warrant four sequels to date.55/100",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A rousing good time! Definitely an ""E-Ticket"" Movie!","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is, quite simply, the best movie [so far] of the summer.  Certainly the most satisfying.  It has everything you could possibly want from a pirate movie...and more.   The perfect blend of action, jaw-dropping visuals and tongue-in-cheek humor. As one would expect, there are numerous, yet subtle references to the Disneyland Park attraction on which the film is based and moviegoers will have fun identifying them.  Even the famous song ""Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirate's Life For Me!"" makes sporadic appearances in the film, in fact, the movie opens with it.  But it is presented in such a way that it never comes off forced or ""cheesy.""While Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom are all excellent in their respective roles, it's Johnny's Depp's movie all the way.  Depp commands your attention every time he's on the screen and clearly he's having fun with it.  Very few actors could pull this feat off without going ""overboard"",  so to speak.  Only Geoffrey Rush comes dangerously close to fulfilling his destiny as a true pirate and stealing the movie away from Depp.  It is an honest pleasure to watch these two professionals on screen together.Summer moviegoers, tired of film disappointments and over-hyped sequels will be delighted by this cinematic thrill-ride.  Bring your sword and your eye patch, the swashbuckler adventure is back!NOTE: The PG-13 rating is for mild violence; TV show and video games contain far more graphic violence.  There is also no profanity or nudity. However, I dare the viewer to miss any of these with the well-written script!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Bringing Swashbuckling movies back,"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is truly an adventure that is worth 4 times the price of admission. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and a young blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are after the fabled ship, The Black Pearl, after the dreadful crew lead by Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Will's main squeeze, Elizabeth Swann (played by the lovely Keira Knightley). On the way, Will learns that the Black Pearl used to belong to Jack, who lost it after Barbosa lead a mutiny against him. But, Jack is lucky, because soon after the Pearl was stolen from him, the crew had a nasty curse put upon them. Which makes them invincible, but turns them into skeletons in the moonlight. Not only that, but the crew needs the blood of a Turner (Will Turner!) to break the curse! This movie is an exciting, swashbuckling tale that doesn't fail to entertain you with eye popping battle scenes and asurbic wit. The running time is about 2 and a half hours, a bit long for a summer flick. But it doesn't bore you at all. The entire time your into the story and being dazzled by the action (and beauty of Keira Knightley). Movies like this aren't made...ever! When was the last time you saw a pirate movie? Cutthroat Island doesn't count! Anyway, this movie is one of the best of 2003 and manages to make pirates cool again.RATING: **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Modern Classic,"It is no accident that Pirates of the Caribbean became such a massive franchise in the early 2000s and it all stemmed from Curse of the Black Pearl. While the sequels exceeded the original at the box office, there are few action-adventures that click on all cylinders like this one. Fundamentally, this film works because the plot is balanced with twists while remaining concise. Because of that, Curse of the Black Pearl has energy and purpose throughout its runtime. The production design is also key here because the excellent costumes, sets, and locations create deep immersion that is necessary for this type of movie.However, no Pirates of the Caribbean review would be complete without mentioning the cast. Johnny Depp really does deserve all the credit in the world for delivering such an iconic performance. He steals every scene he is in and nails his sharp dialogue. Meanwhile, Knightley and Bloom may not be as tantalizing but they bring essential heart to build around. Also, Geoffrey Rush is underrated and electric as Barbossa. So, overall, Curse of the Black Pearl contains an abundance of strengths that synergize quite nicely and create a truly captivating experience. No wonder the film is widely loved and considered a modern classic.Writing: 8/10

GRRReat Cinema!,"This movie conjugates great acting, particularly in secondary roles (Geoffrey Rush, Jonathan Pryce), superb FX, larger-than-life sound, sexy actors (Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom), and overall great production values. It has a plot that you can follow, rather than just a perfunctory story that is used to hang a bunch of CGI images on.Four thumbs up form my kids, too!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Swashbuckling action flick is a good summer blockbuster.,"I have to admit I was hoping this film would be bad. Never really been a fan of pirate movies, and judging by the trailers, I thought this would be phoney and shallow. `Pirates of the Caribbean' has been receiving mass critical praise since the opening week and I can see why. It has that certain charm about it which is very hard to resist. The plot follows a very familiar outline, but the film comes to life in the swooping visuals and brilliant fight scenes. Essentially, `Pirates' is a B movie but a rather good one at that. While it is immensely enjoyable, is this really a five star movie? It's a big-budget large-scale blockbuster in the vein of `The Hulk' and `Terminator 3' but it hardly pushes the limits of cinema.The movie is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer- the helm behind similarly themed efforts such as `The Rock' and `Pearl Harbour'- so I can't say I'm surprised that there are so many big bangs throughout. Technical credits are top-notch all across the board. The cinematography, in particular, is a huge stand out. The CG work is good as well, but over showy in parts. Case in point is the scene in which Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa) turns into a skeleton and then drinks alcohol that we see as if we were wearing x-ray specs. While the animated work for that scene is good, the `It's-the-21st-century. -Look-what-we-can-do' effect comes across in an overtly preachy way. But this part is brief so there's no need to go into too much detail with it.And as your classic adventure movie, there are the three main characters- the hero, the significant other and the hammy villain. Also in there is a jilted lover/ hero #2, but he's perfectly relevant to the plot. Of course, the media are constantly saying `the film has everything! Action, comedy, drama, romance'- virtually 90% of all movies have all those factors. As I said, it all comes down to the action. The cheesy jokes, romantic subplots etc. are okay, but hardly what `Pirates' will be remembered for.Johnny Depp has the charisma and quirkiness to carry the role of Jack Sparrow. Better yet, he makes the role his own. With the offbeat swagger and cheesy one-liners, no one could have executed the role better. And the hammy villain is perfectly portrayed by Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush, who does this comic-style part just as well as the tougher ones. Keira Knightley (I hate that name) would seem like the perfect stereotype, but her character is well written and she brings life to- what could have been- a very flat performance. But Orlando Bloom seems out of place. His character has no charisma, no characteristics, no quirky one liners. And the lines are delivered without credibility. There's such thing as `playing it straight', but this is more wooden than the plank which he walks off of.And while the closing moments may go on for a bit too long, there's enough treasured moments to be able to forgive all that. And while there is no emotional core that elevates above the level of `a flashy action packed adventure-fest', you probably shouldn't expect one. So if you want an old-fashioned crowd pleaser, you won't go far wrong with `Pirates of the Caribbean'- a film which I'm almost ashamed to say that I enjoyed. My IMDb rating: 6.9/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Follows the Hollywood Formula,"Pirates of the Caribbean is a pretty predictable movie. It has the oh-so-lovable, slacker of a semi villain, and then it has the hero out to get the girl he loves. The other pirates are of course all comic reliefs, and the rest is just spent idly with special effects and rescue after rescue. Fun to watch but that's as far as it goes.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Everything is good except Johnny Depp,"This is exactly the kind of story I'd wish to see when I was a kid. Action, horror, lady to save, and so on... SFX are good and surprising. Acting are good (great Geoffrey Bush !) except for Johnny Depp and his character.His character : a teenage-looking pirate who is SUPPOSED to be an old friend of the father of a man. But the son (Will Turner) looks older than him ! Unbelievable ! And more : this kid-pirate is supposed to have been the great chief of the worst pirates of Caribbean, twelve or twenty years before ! Sorry, I can't swallow that !It's clear : Johnny Depp is really too young for this part ! I know, it's a sex symbol. But what for ? He's not the one who got the girl at the end ! I think a more mature man (like ""Jack Nicholson"" for example) would be a better choice.And what about his make-up ? He looks like a ""transvestite"", he just missed the lipstick. That's a bad choice, again.To fight all these bad choices, this poor Johnny overacts loudly to gain credibility.

Good...and bad.....,"Well, I have to say, this movie was such an exciting experience!!!!! I rented this one stormy night on DVD and boy, this movie was so exciting!!!!! This movie, of course, is based on the theme park ride at Disneyland and Disney World. I liked all the action and stuff in there; it was awesome!!!!! I especially liked the bonus features, too: there were the bloopers (""Is that a plane?????"" - Johnny Depp heard a small jet rocket by the ship), and of course, the excerpt from ""Walt Disney Presents,"" which I actually remembered seeing on the old Disney Channel one night in 1998.Buuuuuut, there is a problem. (OH NO!!!!! is right!!!!!)This is a ""BAD PERIOD"" movie!!!!! That's right, for one, this movie totally changed the way we go to the parks now!!!!! The ride was changed to make it look like the movie now, and even worse, there are rumors that the Tom Sawyer ride at Disneyland will go away with - get this - a new ride based on this film!!!!! Plus, the worst part????? IT'S RATED PG-13!!!!! Yes, you heard right!!!!! A ""Disney"" movie, given such a controversial rating so that families can't see this or any other movie in this series because it's too scary!!!!!

"You're off the map mate.  Here, there be monsters!","This is a fun movie that reminds me of The Princess Bride for it's great fight scenes and  Johnny Depp's and Geoffrey Rush's wonderful characters. Though it's not nearly as witty  overall, it's full of great lines (most of which go to Jack Sparrow), funny references to  Disney's PotC ride, and good visuals.  The special effects are keen and not made to  scare, though young ones might be wary.  The movie can run on a bit, but I really didn't  mind (It meant more Jack Sparrow).  I've read reviews stating that Johnny Depp is channeling a drunken drag queen in this movie, and that's a good thing. There truly is  something hypnotic, sexy, and worth swooning over in the way he plays Jack Sparrow.This movie also encourages kids to eat their fruits... particularly apples.And if none of this has convinced you to go see this movie, then go to see the staggering amount of dental work.  I'm not kidding, watch the credits and count the  number of dentists who worked on this!  Depp's and Rush's mouths alone must've kept  several dentists busy for weeks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
seen it 4 times..and counting,"This film was by far the best I saw over my September holiday period. In fact it was probably one of the best movies I have seen...ever!The reasons for this are numerous: Clever casting, interesting story setting, love story meets action..the list continues. I will say that the plot is not particularly extraordinary but that just shows how well the other elements of the film contribute to its overall greatness.Firstly, and most importantly, the cast was fantastic. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were hot!! Not only physically, but their acting was superb. Johnny's character (Capt. Jack Sparrow) was played with such realism, and the humor he brought to the movie made a great film an excellent film. Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightly were also remarkable.The cast aside, everyone loves pirate films. The dark mystery that comes helm with the pirate way of life and the quaintness of the island settlements enriched the film with a glorious setting that is original. There have not been many films based on pirating in the Caribbean, let alone to the standard of this one.The film is also one which all can enjoy. Hot guys for the girls and a gorgeous love story, but sword fighting and skeleton pirates for the guys (By the way GREAT visual effects!). It's also child friendly, a family movie.I have seen this movie 4 times but am not nearly sick of it yet. The movie is not so much great because of it's story but because of its novelty. The witty humor brought by Johnny Depp and the amazing acting along with the audience it appeals to and the fantastic story setting make this movie one of my favorite EVER.

"Very, very entertaining","'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is one of the most entertaining films I have seen in years. It is not really great, but every single aspect is terrific and that makes sure you don't see its flaws very easily. One of the flaws is the logic, but in a film like this things are not supposed to be logical, so why bother asking that kind of questions.The story, pretty standard with the usual twists, is actually quite good, or at least good enough to keep our attention. I could tell you about it but I think it would sound too silly; it kind of is. We have stories about a curse and a pirate ship called the Black Pearl with its Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), we have a pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), we have a young man named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who loves Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). She loves him too but she is about to marry Norrington (Jack Davenport). Her father is Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce), not the most unimportant person.What curse there is on the Black Pearl you have to see for yourself. Neither am I going to say why the curse is there. Let me just talk about the good stuff. The visual effects are marvelous. Everything looks (and sounds) great. Locations, costumes, makeup. The sword fights and the battles between the English and the pirates are exciting, there is never a moment you are bored.It is not all fighting and visual effects. In the quiet moments we have the most wonderful performance from Johnny Depp. His Jack Sparrow is one of the characters from the movies you are going to remember and the fact that he earned an Oscar nomination for this part says enough. He is so good you almost forget the other actors. Geoffrey Rush comes close to Deppp as the villain Barbossa and actors like Bloom and Knightley play their parts quite well. Unfortunately for them they are always in the shadow of the perfect Depp.There are more good things that make this film entertaining, but I would have to go in detail. I think I have given you enough reasons to see this film (and believe me, Depp alone is reason enough). For a very good time 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black pearl' is as good as it gets.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best movie this summer,"WOW.It's not often I watch a whole movie with a smile on my face, but I did with this one. It was a delight from start to finish, and I can't think of anything bad to say about it aside from the fact that it bugs me that Jerry Bruckheimer actually produced something I liked.Here's the top ten things I loved about this movie:1) Johnny Depp. A simply amazing, scene-stealing, MOVIE-stealing performance. Pure genius.2) Restrained use of CGI. It was thrilling to see REAL PEOPLE swinging from the ropes on those ships. And the CGI is effectively employed when it is used, especially during the underwater march of the cursed pirates.3) Johnny Depp.4) A great cast. Orlando Bloom doing an amazing impression of a young Errol Flynn and holding his own in scenes with Depp. I look forward to watching this guy's career. Geoffrey Rush doing a great job as the villain and making him almost as fascinating as Depp's Jack Sparrow. And Keira Knightly as a beautiful, smart, believably spunky heroine. Can't wait to see more of her! Uh, I mean, in other movies. Acting. That's what I meant. What did you think I meant? Get your mind out of the gutter. Oh, and Johnny Depp is great, too!5) Everything you'd expect in a pirate movie, including a talking parrot, a monkey, Spanish gold, a ship battle, a young hero of uncertain lineage, the governor's daughter, walking the plank, ""Avast!"", ""Davey Jones' Locker"", hats with big feathers in them...and yet it NEVER seems cliched.6) Johnny Depp.7) The exhilarating music.8) A movie without one use of the F-word, not to mention a restrained amount of swearing since this IS a pirate movie. Oh, and no nudity or car chases or buildings exploding. It is summer, isn't it?9) Amazing fight sequences; the early, acrobatic sword fight between Depp and Bloom, and the ship battle, were stand-outs.10) Oh, yeah, and Johnny Depp is great! Did I mention that?I'm a big fan of the two recent Mummy films, and I think this one falls into that category of enormously fun, endlessly entertaining adventure flicks. There's nothing profound here, but hey, it's summer, and this movie is great fun. This is one of the few times in my life when I've said this, but God, I hope they do a sequel! 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing,"This is the best movie I've ever seen. I consider this movie the best film of the year ! It is simply amazing.The actors are great, especially Johnny Depp(as usual). He plays an eccentric pirate, no one could have played Jack better. With all the special mimics of captain Jack Sparrow, it makes this movie very funny. Johnny even looks good behind all his makeup !This is a mix of adventure, comedy, and love. There is tons of unexpecting twists that makes the time pass really fast. I've seen this movie plenty of times and I'm still captivated with the story.If you haven't seen this movie yet, you really should rent it, or buy it !",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Too Many Rules to Follow,"I certainly enjoyed this movie. Johnny Depp's mugging and swashbuckling. His sly expressions. The conflict with the power structure which would like to see him hanged. The special effects are quite impressive. There are two problems that kept me from giving this the ultimate rating. It is way too long. I don't know if they edited anything out of this. The thing with the ghost ship was endless. Secondly, like a video game, there were all these rules we were supposed to remember. The ones that mortals are supposed to play by and the ones the ghosts must play by. I'm starting to feel that for some films, we should be given a handbook to keep it all straight. Perhaps an in-service of some kind. When this is mostly a pirate movie, it is great fun. There are battles; there is tongue in cheek commentary. There are beautiful women who can stand up to any man; you name it. When the supernatural element enters in, it is also fun. But there's something about being forced to kill people that are already dead. Just exactly is it that you must do? Again, play by the rules. Anyway, it's a wonderful romp. It almost gets resolved in the end, and we're ready for more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Enjoyed it!,"When the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), is proposed by Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), she faints, fells into the sea and is rescued and saved by the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) but he is arrested and sentenced to death for piracy. Meanwhile, the town is attacked by the ship Black Pearl, commanded by the former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leaded a mutiny against Captain Jack Sparrow years ago. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. Along their journey, many secrets are disclosed about the course of the Black Pearl and her crew.The supernatural adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Barbossa are so spectacular that really deserves to be included among the best movies (Top 250) in IMDb.

This is the Kind of Movie That Improves the More You Watch It.,"When I saw this movie, I was surprised ---no--- out right stunned as to the kind of movie that could be made based off of a Disney ride. This isn't some simple point ""A"" to point ""B"" plot, these characters aren't mechanical merry-men and the score isn't the work of some back-stage maestro on a keyboard. Everything about this movie was incredible and surprising, and the more I watched it the greater it seemed to become.The acting of this film was outstanding, with a full and able a cast as could be wanted. The greatest was, of course, Johnny Depp's performance. He always chooses very quirky, very unique and singular, characters to play, and Captain Jack Sparrow fits Depp's natural tendencies. He's a quirky and awkward character who acts as if in a perpetual drunken and ataxic stagger. Accompanied with typically slurred words and uncomfortable body language, this would, in the hands of most other actors, be an awkward and uneven performance. But Depp pulls it off flawlessly in this striking and memorable addition to his acting repertoire.Orlando Bloom, fresh off of his work as The Lord of the Ring's Legolas Greenleaf, plays the blacksmith William Turner, and easily holds his own next to Depp. While his part is not nearly so... colorful... it is, nonetheless, equally memorable. He is a believable performer who has noticeably grown from his Lord of the Rings performance. He acts as the antithesis of Depp's character; a serious and emotional individual to contrast with Depp's quirky and aloof character.This, personally, is my favorite performance of Kiera Knightley's, even overshadowing her Oscar-nominated performance in 2005's Pride & Prejudice. While this role is clearly not meant to showcase her talents, nor is it as necessarily deep or spotlighted as Elizabeth Bennet's, it is a clear and charming performance. She takes on a somewhat comedic supporting role and really shine in it. Her timing matches up well with her costars'; her comedic delivery leaves nothing to be desired. She's rather impressive in a role that could have become another ""damsel in distress"" awaiting rescuing in the hands of a lesser actress.The remainder supporting cast all deserve mention for their talents. Geoffrey Rush shines marvelously as the villainous Captain Barbossa, Jack Davenport gives a stiff yet convincing performance as Commodore Norington and Jonathon Pryce give a light comedic performance as Governor Swan. Even David Bailie and Lee Arenberg played pleasant comedic performances as Cotten and Pintel, despite also playing the parts of decent villains.The score was absolutely outstanding, a singular masterpiece all its own. Every song, every line, every measure, every note, is so striking that by simply listening to the score on its own you can tell exactly what part of the movie would be playing alongside it. It stands as one of my favorite movie scores, and Klaus Badelt has nestled himself along such greats as John Williams, Howard Shore, Danny Elfman and Elmer Bernstein. I personally preferred it to Return of the King's score (Which is really, really saying something, as that was a masterful composition), and the fact that this wasn't even NOMINATED for best score is a travesty to the history of the Academy Awards.Visually, it was outstanding. The special effects for the undead pirate crew were pretty impressive. But they weren't overly obtrusive; for how obvious they were, the effects were actually rather subtle still. The only part where they become a little hokey is when Kiera Knightley's launched into the air on a sort of trampoline. Other than that, the effect were flawless.Overall, this is an excellent movie; perfect for families, action fans, comedy fans and fans of any of the main actors/actresses. It is certainly deserving of all the praise it's received as well as it's position on the IMDb top 250 (currently 237). This is a surprising gem of a movie, and one that it's quite difficult to find a person who absolutely dislikes it. It's a very safe movie to recommend to everybody.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A nice, entertaining and funny adventure","Ever played Monkey Island? This film is a pirate movie in true Monkey Island style. In case you've never played that game it means lot of fun, crazy pirates, a beautiful lady and a bunch of zombie like pirates.First of all the story is good. The whole love thing is simple and not original, but who cares?! It works and the setting, characters and the whole curse thing spices up the story a lot and makes it very interesting. The dialog is very nice. It's funny, but not all too funny. That keeps the focus on the story. The characters are good and they work well together creating contrasts and showing development through the film.Johnny Depp is very good. He pulls off this whole pirate act really good and manage to take on an English accent. Orlando Bloom is nothing worse. His performance in believable and good. All together the cast is strong and preform very well. The use of English actors makes the whole thing more believable.The effects are well done. In the beginning you'll see some not exactly impressive CGI, but the rest is much better. The skeletons looks good and the explosions too. The fights are well coordinated and the rhythm of the fencing in the blacksmiths workshop is really nice.The music is also good. It's piraty and gets you in the mood. It builds up around the action and fits the movie very well. You don't pay attention too it, witch is a good thing. It means it fits the movie and the action and subconscious just affects your feelings like it should.It's a good looking movie, meaning the cinematography is good. The composition is good and so is the lightning. No shots stood out as extraordinary, but no one stood out as bad neither. It's nice shooting with some playful shots here and there and all together good cinematography.The sets and decorations also make this movie good looking. The mix of CGI and real stuff is good and the look of the costumes and the settings are believable and nice.All together I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was way better than I expected. It added a lot of comedy, but still focused on the story and managed to remain serious. I would definitely recommend this movie if your looking for a high quality, cool and funny adventure movie to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Ah-har!,"Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are two of the main reasons to see this film. Their note-perfect and seemingly effortless portrayals of rival pirate leaders Sparrow and Barbossa fills the screen whenever they appear. Other actors are allowed their chance to shine as well, thanks to Gore Verbinski's generous direction.The action is plentiful, the laughs come like a volley of cannonballs and the special effects don't overwhelm the story. What's not to like?Well, er, Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, unfortunately. Shrewish and drippy respectively, neither of the two young leads has the screen presence to create a credible romance. Knightley gets more annoying as the movie progresses and I found myself hoping that someone would kill her character with another 45 minutes to go. Bloom is fine and athletic in the action sequences, but fails to convince as soon as he stops moving and starts to open his mouth.Fortunately, the energy, charm and quality of this movie outshine the damp squibs of Knightley's and Bloom's performances.

"Great, Modern Swashbuckler","I've always liked this movie. It's lighthearted and grand all at once, with an iconic character and performance at its center that still feels wholly fresh and original despite the overbearing nature of the character in subsequent films. And his introduction is so good; iconic even.Despite the presence of Jack Sparrow, it's Elizabeth Swann that's the true protagonist here (and the first 3 films). She's solid, and so is Keira's performance, and it allows the strangeness of the story to creep in from the margins without overwhelming the main narrative. The romance with Will Turner is definitely the weakest aspect of the movie, but it doesn't detract from the fun of the story and it's certainly necessary for the film to work as a whole.I love the throwback to the era of sword fights and battles with cannons on pirate ships. When I think of adventure, I always look to this movie. The rousing score definitely helps, but also the open ocean and the tropical locations. They really make the best use of the blue waters and palm trees.Romance, daring escapes, backstabbing, ancient curses, comedic bumbling; it's all here, with great production values and a sharp eye for the visual witticism.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"typical pirates story, but astonishingly catching","Jack Sparrow is a pirate without ship, the evil Captain Barbosa has stolen the Black Pearl (jack's ship) and he wants to recover it. Qill Turner is a young smith that is in love to Elisabeth Swann, the noble of the island. When she is kidnapped by Barbosa, he and Sparrow will work together (more or less) to defeat the evil Barbosa. This is the curious thing that surprised everybody, it has anything new, special effects are nowadays typical, it should be one senseless unknown film, but it had a great success. Why? Depp's acting as Jack Sparrow was just superb (nomination to Oscar included), he is able to make o charismatic character that all becomes easy when he is by there. Showing us one of the best character presentation in the last years, he is the one who really supports the movie. Rest of characters are correct and charismatic, but it is not SO impressive, this is the main thing of the movie, all actors make a good and catching part. In addition, the special effects are fabulous (as expected in such a expensive-to-make film), it is filled with stupid funny jokes (which you laugh because they are them) and a very confusing plot (who is friend of who??), but the result is funny and absolutely enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Unbelievable,"This is my single favourite movie in the entire world. I'm serious. Ever since I got it on DVD just a week ago, I've watched it every single day. I'm close to memorizing all the dialogue and I know every shot. As I write this, it's paused on the television in my room.The reason I love this movie so much is mostly the character work. The cursed Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) instills such fear in me, and at the same time, draws a burning sense of pure pity for his plight. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), while a fine lady in all respects, is feisty and vivacious as well. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is a good friend and a fine man, modest and brave.However, the character of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is by far the most excellently played character I've ever seen. You can see deeply into his personality, simply by the motions Mr Depp goes through. It is clear that Jack, while a pirate, is indeed a good man. He is honourable and stands by his word at all times. His main goal in life is simply freedom; all of his crimes were to further that goal. He also dislikes taking away the dignity of his adversaries. He would never commit mutiny or murder for that reason.The one thing I even remotely disliked was Orlando Bloom's wooden acting. He seemed to be only able to deliver his lines in one tone, one personage. It was fine for the first half-hour or so, but after that I was mostly just waiting for his parts to be over and so we could get back to Jack Sparrow's screen time.The score for this movie is absolutely STUNNING. It's filled with powerful strings and strong brass, and it has been soaring through my head ever since the first time I saw this movie.All in all, this is a masterpiece. By all means, I encourage you to see and purchase this amazing film. You will not regret it, I guarantee you of that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
a one man show,"a few months ago i stumbled across the poster for this little ditty. and without a second thought, lumped it down to being rubbish. so months later when it comes out to rave reviews, i was suprised to say the least. a good pirate movie? never. but i went to see it. and what can i say, i enjoyed it immensily. a good old fashioned pirate yarn for the modern audience could be difficult to get off the ground, but this film has everything a story needs. drama, intrigue, scares, action, and most unexpectedly, comedy. this movie is as funny as it is adventurous. the script on paper may not be so funny, but the actors add their own humourous invention to it. with johnny depp stealing every frame he's ever in. with his drunken swagger and delivery of lines, he becomes the king of comedy. the most refreshing character seen in years, and by far the most memorable ting about this picture. with decent support and a thrilling storyline pirates comes out storming. a tad head scratching at times due to lots and lots going on on screen. but the overall enjoyment of it seems to blot all that out.oscar nom for johnny depp? lets hope so",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
how could this piece of crap get ANY academy nominations...,"this is straight up kids fare. I mean I just saw the last twenty minutes on TV and it was horrible! It reminded me of the original Treasure Island, which I saw at age 10 or so. The ""romance"" was horrible, the dialogue was horrible, it was unbearably corny, Johnny Depp turns into a skeleton man and then back, why I don't know, Orlando Bloom was cute but not much use. Johnny must have done this in order to get the free dread extensions, which were also horrible and changed ornaments every five minutes---would he have time to do his hair while waiting to get hanged???????????

Depp and Rush shine,"Everybody likes pirates! (Well, not the music industry, but whatever...) Johnny Depp shines as Captain Jack Sparrow, a cleverly klutzy pirate who is in search for the Black Pearl and the crew that mutinied it from him. Leader of the mutineers is Captain Barbossa, a mean dirty pirate with a curse that sends him searching for the pieces of some ancient Aztec gold... and the blood of a good pirate's son.It also involves a side story about that young son (Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom) and the love of his life (Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley), but nobody cares.Honestly, Johnny Depp MADE the movie. His perfect characterization of a quirky swashbuckler is both funny and memorable. His personality and charisma shines from screen to screen as he tries to figure out how to get what he wants when everybody else seems to be against him.Depp by himself, though, would have made for a strained and bad movie indeed. Even a good actor with a good character can be dire and silly in a movie that doesn't compliment them. Thus we have Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa, the driven evil that compliments Depp's Sparrow well. Rush obviously had a lot of fun with the role and it's a real joy to see him, especially when working off of Depp.It also has some pretty good dialog, stuff to make you laugh in between action moments. Very quotable, stuff like, ""Where's the rum?"" which is bound to stay in fanboy lingo for ages to come.--PolarisDiB",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie did everything right,"To be honest, I didn't expect much from this movie when it came out. Everyone was talking about the SFX, noone really mentioned the story, so I didn't consider it worth watching in the theatre. However, when a friend borrowed me the DVD, I changed my mind completely.Nowadays, when a movie comes out, it usually falls under at least one of these categories: a) it's made after a book (or a comic), b) it focuses on SFX rather than on storytelling, and c) it belongs to a genre which has been completely exhausted during the last couple years. Now none of these points mean that it is a bad movie, however when at least two points apply, it's mostly bound to be a flick you watch once and then forget about. It was truly refreshing to see a movie which for a change didn't apply to any of these categories.Meanwhile I bought the DVD, and I catch myself watching the movie or parts of it over and over again. 'Pirates of the Caribbean' basically does everything right. It has a gripping, immersing story, a great cast and dedicated crew, great photography and a wonderful musical score. It belongs to a genre which has been nearly extinct in the last years, it has a story which strays from the usual stereotypes, and it uses SFX to make the movie better, not just to show off with latest technology.Johnny Depp is just brilliant in the role of Jack Sparrow, he makes you laugh over and over again. As does Geoffrey Rush, who plays Captain Barbossa. Some of the cast stay a bit pale, like Orlando Bloom, who I think can do better. The SFX blend perfectly into the movie, these skeletons are great. The music is wonderful as well, worth buying the soundtrack. The score is so catchy, I find myself humming or whistling parts of it constantly.This is entertainment at its best. Not an alltime classic, it doesn't have too much of a message, but that wasn't the goal of making it anyway. Worth watching several times, since you discover new details every time. Right now it ranks pretty high in my favourite list. 8/10 stars from me for this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It was a great pirate tale.,"I thought that Pirates of the Caribbean was a great movie. i thought Johnny Depp was great as the sexy captain Jack Sparrow. I cant wait till the 2nd part of this story comes out to see more of Johnny and Orlando. The computer graphics were great, they really made the damned crew come to life. Johnny Depp was the best man to cast as Captain Jack Sparrow, he really grabs the character and brings him to life. The action sequences in the movie were extravagant, how Orlando and Johnny danced around sword fighting and the visual effects of battle between two 18th century battle ships. This is definitely the kind of movie that brings the whole family together and has viewers asking for more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Watch this film!,"Pirates of the Caribbean (The Curse of the Black Pearl) is about a governor's family who find o boy in the water when they are out whit their boat. The daughter of the governor is finding that the boy wear a pirate-necklace and she take it. When the daughter (Elizabeth) is older, she gets taken by some evil pirates. She tells them her name is Elizabeth Turner. But it isn't. Turner is the name of the boy her family find in the water, some years ago. The boy, Will, doesn't know he is a pirate and now he is a friend of Elizabeth and her family. The evil pirates, think Elizabet is a pirate, because she is named Turner. They are taking her to a cave, together with the necklace and there they are going to take some of her blood and they are going to cancel a curse that rest over the evil pirates. But it doesn't work. So now they know that Elizabeth is not the right human to take blood from, she is not the daughter of the Turner (the father of Will Turner). Now they start searching after the pirate who can cancel the curse. Will Turner, who's working as a smith in the town where Elizabeth lives, meet Jack Sparrow one day. Jack is a pirate too, and they take a ship and go away to look after Elizabeth. On the ship Jack tells Will that he is a pirate too, but Will isn't believe him at first. But afterward he recognize that its true. Jack and Will goes out on a big adventure, and Will is prepared to die to find Elizabeth, and save her..I think the film is a good film. You can see it in nearly every ages and its both funny and exciting. The actors is very good in acting, and of course it makes the film been better. This movie is definitely worth to see!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not bad,"I wasn't expecting much from this (after all it's from the same guy that brought us Armageddon). I ended up enjoying it however. Good popcorn fun. It did run a little long however.SPOILER Some of the CGI ghost pirate scenes were over the top, for instance, their introduction as ghosts. There's a discontinuity between the live action and the CGI action and back to the live action. SPOILER OFFJohnny Depp did a good job as the lead pirate and Bloom did okay as a lead although I thought his delivery was lacking occasionally. Keira Knightley was stunningly beautiful and did a decent job acting. Concerning the fights, as everyone is saying, they do go on a little too long and are also choreographed and scripted such that they could only happen in a movie. I prefer realism. The movie also manages to fit in every pirate cliché it could: there's even an ""Arrrrgh!"". Summary: Go see it. Don't expect much but receive more than that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Johny Depp is great!,"An intriguing pirate movie.  Johnny Depp's character (Cap. Jack Swallow) is exceptionally well fleshed-out and Johnny Depp plays it ""to the hilt."" The other characters in the movie are also well done and the plot line is complex enough to be interesting, but not too complicated as to be hard to follow.  The special effects are also impressive--it's easy to get ""lost at sea"" in this movie.  The movie succeeds in making pirates look clever and attractive, while the traditional British navy types leave something to be desired.  All-in-all, this is an enjoyable flick, but one that I wouldn't want my young grandsons to watch, as I don't think they would be able to follow the plot!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
swashbuckling adventure story,"Good old fashioned swashbuckling adventure story hitting all the right beats. The tone is upbeat, fun and the action is well captured. The performances are really good and the film is well cast. The soundtrack is also very impressive. The film is PG 13 so everything is a bit watered down. Lots of cliches and borrowed ideas too though which fans will probably just excuse. The violence is cartoonish and the swearing is laughably tame I'm afraid. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom do good job in their roles, (Knightley was only 17 at the time of filming) but the film is completely stolen by Johnny Depp and the character he created.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Non-stop action,"I  viewed this film with our 12 year old son July 10.  I was a bit dubious about the fighting and skeletons but  he handled  all the action just fine.  It's a fun film with beautiful cinematography and costumes.  It's also 2 1/2 hours - so get the big sack of popcorn!  I would not recommend this for children under 10 years old, it has some scary scenes with those skeletons and stormy seas.  Our son, when he was 9, was very frightened when we rented Titanic because of all the flooding.  I'm a Geoffrey Rush fan and he was great but I have to agree with everyone - Johnny Depp stole the show by his charisma, not  fighting abilities.  There's a great duel scene in here, too.  The leading lady does a fine job for her part - she just needed to be a bit feistier.  Thank you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Absa bloody lutly brilliant,This has become one of my favorite movies ever. Not a Depp fan (hes usually to creepy) I find myself captivated with his antics and acceptance of bad luck. his English accent is downright excellent..specialy if he MEANT to sound half cut throughout most of the film. As for Bloom He is most definety an actor with a future...I wonder if Legolas is to Frodo what Han Solo turned out to be to Skywalker..(In other words Mark Who..??) And Miss Knightley what a beauty. A REAL beauty. And dear Jack Davenport after coupling how great to see him in a movie playing quite the opposite and still be excellent bravo Jack. (and twas nice to J Pryce on screen again after been gone a few years..something wicked this way comes is still a fave..:).This film still has my lmao even after a dozen re runs...my 4 and 6 year old kids love it my 15 y/o girl loves it even my hard to please hubby loved it...At last a movie for both sexes and all  generations.

A swashbuckling joy for every fan of classic film,"It just goes to show, this movie was created to promote a ride, but it has turned out to be one of the best movies of 2003. Set around 1700, a ship of cursed pirates scour the oceans for a piece of Aztec gold to lift the curse. Their search leads them to Port Royal, a port town, home to the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Knightly) and her secret, blacksmith admirer, Will Turner (Bloom). The pirates, lead by the evil, Captain Barbossa (Rush), kidnap Elizabeth in an attempt to break the curse but when Turner finds out, he tries to save her by seeking assistance of the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp). The plot is pretty mediocre- the true sparkle of the film is Depp and the wonderful script. Johnny Depp's flamboyant Keith Richards impersonation is fabulous as Sparrow- probably his best role yet. Orlando Bloom is cringe-worthy as 'nerdy' Turner and portrays the character brilliantly- as does Keira Knightly who brings the feminine energy to the rather over masculine film. This is a film that could have easily sunk like the ships in it but it is ridiculously well casted and brilliantly directed. The script is Oscar-worthy, which could be down to Johnny Depp who made many adjustments to his lines. Full of charming, fun characters, convincing special effects, energetic action sequences and an array delightful accents, this film will transport you to sun, sea, sand and a swashbuckling masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Rollicking and amusing,"Just watched this on DVD.  Very amusing, and pretty good family fun, too. There were several scenes where you could see the scenes from the ride. Other scenes were very cool.

Ok but needed subtitles.,"Certainly the chunks of the film that were not in English could have done with subtitles. Orlando Bloom was the only one who seemed to speak clearly all the way through.A slightly below average film. A ok plot but with an ending you could clock from a mile away. The fighting scenes (which 99% of the time never interest me in any film) seemed particularly pointless here given that the enemy couldn't be killed.As said several times the two pairs -the 2 pirates & 2 guards (English too- there was a surprise) were pathetic characters. That was the biggest problem with the film it tried to be funny & failed and couldn't seem to make out whether it wanted to target itself at kids, adults or everyone. Consequently, with such a laid back plot, it became difficult to keep concentration with the plot, who was cursed, why, how etc etc.Still, it was an ok story, had some good scenes, kept me reasonably interested and was acted well.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
the movie was excellent,"though it has been a long time since the release but i have already seen it for the seventh time. i think the movie was great and very entertaining. i also liked johnny dept in the movie. he was looking very cool and sexy as always.Orlando bloom and Rush was good.but i didn't like the acting of knightley, it was the only thing i didn't like. the story was basically good but i had to concentrate very hard to understand every single aspect of the movie. but the reason i rated the movie 10 out of 10 i because i thought that everybody's acting was good, and it was done according to the situation (the acting is supposed to be good when you have great actors like Rush and Depp).the whole set and settings was done accordingly. but the biggest applause goes to the pirates who did a wonderful job. they really looked like real pirates though i haven't seen one.the animation was very good though a little shaky. if i write too much, i might tell you guys the whole story. but fortunately i am not gonna. see ya.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An Entertaining Movie,"If you want to see a entertaining, light, shallow movie, you've come to the right place. Pirates of the Caribbean's blend of comedy and action works wonderfully creating a truly fun movie to pass the time. The cast, for the most part, is great, especially Johnny Depp, who turns a interesting character into wonderful, show stealing one. This contrasts with Orlando Bloom, whos character is already boring compared to jack sparrow without Blooms acting adding to it. Yes this movie is one of the most entertaining movies i've ever seen, but it is little more. While Depp's character is memorable, i can hardly remember the details of the plot any more and the movie has little artistic value. If you want to see johnny Depp, I can suggest What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Edward Scissorhands, or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as some alternatives, but if you're just in the mood for a movie that lets you sit back and relax, look no further than Pirates of the Caribbean.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"McDisney dreadful. 2 violent for kids, 2 dumb for adults.","How sad. I was so looking forward to this movie.  I love Pirate Lore. From the director of that smash hit The Mexican, this movie sucked. It should have gotten more Disney treatment, or none at all. The story was so shallow, the characters were so shallow, that it would have maybe been a terribly entertaining film for the kids, but the movie was too dark and violent for the little ones.  I thought Depp would work wonders with this, but the script was so inane. There wasn't enough meat for the adults.  I didn't care at all about any of the characters.  I kept wating to hear ""Ding, please turn the page.""Some nice moments, but just a few.  Over all, a let down. Rent the Musketeer for swordplay, or rent Mutiny for munity.

Depp saves this unbearably long film,"If I had to tell you whether or not to see this movie in one sentence, I would say this:  Go see this movie purely because Johnny Depp is in it.I know that that is what virtually everyone has been saying, but there is so much truth in it.  As my subject line says, the movie was decent.  It had action, a good plot, and good actors.  The script was not too awe inspiring, there were few (but very clever) funny lines, and the special effects were not as good as we've seen in other recent movies.  On top of that, the movie drags on for what seems like close to four hours (it actually runs about 2 and a half).  The movie drags on and on, and after a long day of work and other activities I was tempted to go home and get some sleep because it seemed like the movie would just never end.  However, one thing kept me watching: Johnny Depp.He is absolutely brilliant in this film.  He stands heads and shoulders above everyone else in the cast.  His take on the role was completely original and the few funny moments that there are seem to always be led by onto the screen by him.  You just don't ever know how he's going to react to things next, and you never know exactly whats going through his mind.  From the minute he came sailing onto the screen you could tell that he would command this film, and indeed he did.  Even the ever rising Orlando Bloom (who I had a serious hard time not looking at him and thinking 'Legolas') was barely noticable when next to Depp.Besides Depp, the movie also scores points for its score.  It's not always something you think about when reviewing a movie, but the music in this film really fit perfectly with the action/adventure theme and gets you into the battle scenes.Overall, its an entertaining movie but one that will keep you checking your watch almost constantly.  The pace can be slow, and the lines cheesy, but its saving grace is Depp's astounding performance.  If for no other reason, go see it just to see Depp.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not a particularly brilliant movie,"I wanted to like this film.  I'd wanted to see it since I'd heard about it, it got glowing reviews from friends of mine, and it really stands as a mediocre piece of cinematography.  Depp just changes from ship to ship, and any eye-popping special effects are detracted from by fog, silly lighting, and Disney.The story, what little there is, is amusing, but I always felt this little element of wrongness, as if at any moment the main villain would be unmasked and say ""I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those damn kids!""I was amazed that I stayed awake the whole way through.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Maybe more engergy or a enthusiasm, I'm not sure.Some of the fight scenes got a little silly but for the most part they were concise and not too drawn out.  However, one idea did strike me as odd.  If the bad pirates could not be killed because they were undead...then why didn't the good characters help them lift curse, thereby taking away their ""powers"" and making them mortal?

A pretty good pirates movie,"This film shouldn't need introduction lol. Everyone has heard of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". And, tons of people consider this as a classic and a gem. I don't necessarily agree with that statement but. This is a pretty good pirates movieThe action in this feature was done extraordinarily. And you don't have to worry since there were a plethora of action sequences and all were equally amazing to see! Jack's a great protagonist and Deep did such a great job on this one. Pirates of the Caribbean nails it at the visual department and works flawlessly as a pirate adventure.The cast of this feature was ginormous. But there were really only 4 characters who is focused on. Jack's a great lead, and some of his twists do genuinely catch me by surprise. Turner and Elizabeth was a servable duo and then we have the main villain. He works in this one because he was intimidating and sometimes funny.But I do find the story to be a bit messy and mushy. It takes a long time for the plot to become clear. Some moments come out of nowhere and often takes a predictable route. Also, since when was Turner Spanish? I love Spain but he previously mentioned that he lived in England.Overall: 7.6/10I'm pretty confident that you most likely know this film more than I do but if you're looking for something action packed and fun.

We didn't know that this movie was supposed to be a comedy. Sometimes other Depp characters come across funny but I think that is his own little ""edge"" when acting. He has fun and it's contagious. Anyway, this time the character charmed us into loving him.How can you not love this goofy pirate?The film itself was done beautifully. The stunts and special effects were brilliant.

Pretty so-so.,"I love pirates but I thought this was a pretty disappointing movie.  Sure, Depp was great--he usually is.  His lines were some of the best in the film. I did enjoy the boats and sets a lot. However, I did not like Orlando Bloom and found him dull and irritating. Keira Knightley was clearly just chosen as a pretty face, since she wasn't too exciting, either.  It's a shame to see someone as talented as Depp paired up with two such inadequate actors. The film itself was long and without real substance.  I did enjoy the ""cameos"" from specific parts of the WDW ride, though.Oh well.  I'd watch it again, but probably with the sound off.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This Summer's Summer Movie?,"This might be well the summer movie of the year. The audiences at least seem to prefer it to Terminator 3, or Matrix. I saw it a few days after the release here in Israel, and the theater was much more populated than with the previous summer movies, and the reaction of the public was more sympathetic. I think the reason is that the film does not pretend at all to be more than it is - Disney-level entertainment. When you enter a Disney park you leave out any big cultural experience expectation, you get in childhood mood and enjoy the ride. Do the same with 'Pirates', and you may enjoy it. Backed up by some decent acting, and with special effects that will fight for the Oscar with the Terminator stuff, the film is decent entertainment - probably some of best you can expect from the US studios this summer. 7/10 on my personal scale.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Clever, witty, and very entertaining","At first, I wasn't at all interested in seeing Pirates of the Caribbean, but, after I rented it and watched it, I realized what a cool movie it is. Its really clever.I likes most of the actors. Johnny Depp never really caught my attention before this, but, since now, I have been waiting anxiously to see him reprise his role as captain Jack Sparrow. Kiera Knightley and Geoffrey Rush are excellent as well. Now, on the other hand, Orlando Bloom sort of bugged me. He didn't seem to fulfill his character as well as he could have. But, luckily, this didn't detract from the movie too much.Pirates of the Caribbean had a very original story line. Packed with witty, funny lines and very clever dialog, it never ceases to entertain. While I found some lines a little bit hard to understand, I thought it was very well done.Last, the special effects were really amazing. When the pirates turned into their ghostly form, I found the skeleton effects incredibly real looking. Never inconsistent or weak, the effects were done to best possible degree.So, having said all that, the bottom line is this: I would recommend Pirates of the Caribbean to anyone who enjoys an action/comedy about some pirates of the high seas.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Action super, story meh.","Such a disappointing experience. I heard so much about this movie, and I'm a fan of the action and adventure genre. However, I want a strong storyline to be the backbone of any action films. I'll tell you that the action sequence is marvelous, colorful, and dynamic. Not just the sword fight but street fights with different gears in various settings. The setting of sea and pirate ships itself is hard to find in good-quality movies. However, the premise of the whole work, the legend of Black Pearl, is only explained through Barbossa's two lines and Pintel's two lines. Amidst wonderful fights and battles, I keep questioning 'what the heck are they fighting for so ardently'. Because the story is so weak, it's hard to justify whatever's going on. Plus, the ending is too weak and easy. Everything is resolved by itself. Again, what the heck was all that for?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Good vs. bad, love and the funniest pirate you probably ever is going to see.Johnny Depp as (Captain) Jack Sparrow is not your everyday pirate, and some will probably still wonder what is he doing? Johnny does a great job and get every part of Jack to work so well. It makes me want more of that character. Orlando Bloom as Will is I my opinion good as well. Who else could be a little bad boy and still have some nerd-style over him? Keira Knighty as Elizabeth challenges the god girl question. Can you really be a god girl, like you have been your whole life in a pirate-world? Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is more dominated than the others characters, without make the other characters look small. That's a god balance between them all. And lets not forget even the smaller parts, but I think you need to see the movie to get to know them.You mat think: Is it still worth it? AYE! Specially if you are going to the the next 2 movies..

Mediocre Roller Coaster Ride + Outstanding Johnny Depp,"I have to admit that I also really enjoyed this movie a lot in 2003 when it was showing at the cinema and I also thought it was one of the best movies of this year. The strange thing is: I ve seen it again on DVD now and it - for some reason I can not explain - rather bored me. It has great actors, fantastic settings, but the story is not more than ""okay"" (it has some far-fetched useless halfhearted twists in it) and in the end one feels like having seen a teaser for Walt Disney parks ... and that s probably what the film actually is: a roller-coaster ride with some narrative lengths (it s far too long for a real exciting roller-coaster ride).Johnny Depp s acting is absolutely outstanding though (selfironical overacted, rather camp without being really gay). I also believe that Depp himself would not say that it s one of the best movies he played in (hopefully not), but probably one of the best payed jobs he s done (hopefully). Without Depp the movie would probably be quite boring and ""cheap"" (in the meaning of ""cheap tricks""), with Depp it s at least well entertaining and particularly quite funny.At last: this is definitely not a movie one has to see twice. While other movies develop a higher quality after being watched for the second, third,... time this movie loses a lot of quality when seen for the second time.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Arr, this movie be overrated!","There's a slew of classic films that haven't made it into the IMDb top 250, but at the time of writing, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has achieved a comfortable place among the best films of all time - presumably because Kiera Knightley is hot and Johnny Depp is funny, right? I mean, I can't think of any sensible reason.Truth is, this is a fun little potboiler that is way too long (people complain that Harry Potter is padded?) and completely lacking in anything resembling drama. The script has the same cringe-inducing qualities as the average Hollywood blockbuster, including the Mandatory Irksome Catchphrase that is continuously spouted by characters even though it wasn't funny the first time (""they're not rules...more like guidelines!""). If Depp didn't spend the whole movie wobbling and acted brain-fried, viewers would all be bored to tears.I must confess that the sets and costumes are impressive, and I enjoyed seeing the spectral pirates marching to attack the ship. I can see liking this movie - I can even see loving it - but a classic? I think everybody gave ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" an ""8"" because it's a crowd-pleaser, and somehow that's enabled it to rise way above where it ought to be in the rankings, which is definitely somewhere below ""The French Connection.""P.S. Forgive a quick aside about Roger Ebert. I like his reviews of classic movies, but he seems out-of-touch when commenting on recent ones; he thinks ""Van Helsing"" is better than ""Spider-Man,"" for example, and he labels the third Harry Potter the weakest in the series. Most bizarrely of all, he argues that Kiera Knightley is not attractive in this movie. Does anyone, in the entire Universe, agree with that assessment?",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Jack Sparrow, chameleon extrordinaire.","I enjoyed the film in the theatre and the DVD  adds yet another layer to that enjoyment.The background information reveals that the producer, director, writers, and actors were relatively relaxed, but thoroughly dedicated to creating a very entertaining story.  They were doubtless intimidated by the recent theatrical failures of the pirate genre, and that only spurred their dedication.  To our benefit.But the leading man and the writers were not completely trusted.The deleted scenes are quite telling.  A number  of them illustrate Sparrow's more sober and somber and ruthless characteristics and reveal him to be an even more ambivalent character...perhaps more than the makers of the film could credit the audience with accepting....but what a fascinating character he is.  Hopefully, the sequels will allow Depp to fully inhabit this chameleon. I look forward to the possibilities.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Could have been better,"This is, as so many have already noted, a great pirate movie, in fact one of the best ever. But it could have been better, I think. I'm not exactly sure just how, but somehow.

Some kind of pandering to an unseen and irrelevant ""political correctness"". I don't know exactly.

An epic adventure; my favourite film of 2003.,"The first time I saw ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" in theatres, in the summer of 2003, I knew that it was the first of many viewings.  I ended up seeing it four times in theatres, and I then acquired the DVD.  PotC is a truly great action-adventure film, perhaps the best pirate movie ever made (although that genre hasn't faired well of late). Johnny Depp does an iconic turn as Jack Sparrow, the bizarre anti-hero that captured the audience's imagination, and earned Depp an Oscar nomination (he should have won, if you asked me).  Sparrow is a truly unique creation, and he overshadows everything else in the film.  Doing his best to match Depp in scenery chewing is Geoffrey Rush, playing another of his memorable villains, Captain Barbossa.  Somewhat more subdued are Orlando Bloom, Jack Davenport, and the stunningly beautiful Keira Knightley (in the role that put her on the map).  Knightley is just about the only woman in the production, but she is a great screen presence; hopefully she will have a long career ahead of her. My favourite scene is the dinner scene onboard the Black Pearl, where Elizabeth sits down with Barbossa and he gives her food to eat; unable to enjoy the food himself, Barbossa draws an absurd amount of enjoyment from watching her eat and drink; he then follows it up with an excellent monologue, one of the most memorable film speeches I've ever seen. I give ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
As fun as it looks!,"From the first scenes with Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, you know this is a movie meant for fun.  Sparrow is not serious and brooding, nor is he portrayed as a typical action hero.  He's quick on his feet to be sure, and fast thinking as well.  But he's also bumbling and prone to mishap.  He's a *delight*.You see the Commodore, played by Jack Davenport, and you immediately expect the tired ""self-righteous pompous person of authority"" stereotype... but they don't use it.  Norrington turns out to be decent and honorable which is another refreshing change.Even the undead pirates are presented in a humorous (not comical) light, rather than serious horror.  That's a testament to the skill of director Verbinksi who certainly knows how to do horror (see: The Ring), for the undead are shown in full rotting, guts-bared glory.  Yet, like the rest of the film, they are elevated into adventuresome fun.As for the story itself, Pirates is fair.  This is an adventure film, and to try to make more of it is to recognize its failings.  Popular film for a long time now has glorified the wrong things.  Evil over good, etc.  Pirates doesn't do any better here, but at least it's not heavy handed.Remember, this is a ""summer movie"".  That has come to mean action over story, style over substance and lots of adrenaline.  Pirates succeeds well here.  As with most ""adrenaline movies"", you won't remember many details afterwards but you will be left with a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction. Pirates won't make you think, but that's the point.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

When you watch Jason's adventures on the Golden Fleece and Ulysses wanting to return home after 10 years in the trojan war., you see much better written adventures and very well developed characters.

Little do they know, Barbossa along with his large crew, are under an ancient curse, doomed for eternity to neither live, nor die.

This is a movie for all the men and boys who have ever dreamed of making women swoon by skillfully wielding a sword, all the women and girls who have ever dreamed of being saved by a dashing young man.Leave logic at the door, because like all those childish fantasies, this movie exists for the thrill of the moment, the clash of swords, cheeky one liners, and a bombastic score.  The whole thing would be completely ludicrous if not for the performances of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, who give a little class to the whole affair.  They handle the material by going completely over the top, and winking conspiratorially at the audience as they do it.  In his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, Depp combines equal parts drag queen and fiersome pirate to arrive at a character that captured my attention every moment he was on the screen.  Geoffrey Rush isn't as good, but is good enough as the evil Captain Barbossa.  Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly get to play it straight, while simultaneously giving audience members something pretty to look at.The plot is too complicated to adequately summarize in a short space, and why bother?  The plot is inconsequential anyway, serving merely as a means for these actors to fight with their swords, swing around on ropes, and go broke for laughs.

The most entertaining movie of 2003,"I didn't expect this movie to be so funny before I got into the cinema. Johnny Depp's performance was marvellous. He made me laugh all the way from the beginning till the end. The script was nicely written and there are so many memorable quotes that still make me laugh whenever I read them. People are surprised of the 2004 Oscar nomination for Depp but not me. I think he deserves it and it's been such a long wait for such a talented actor like him. Of course I hope he wins but with strong contenders like Bill Murray and co.... okay, I still hope he wins. I'm glad they're planning to make a sequel but I hope the script is equally great as the original one. Can't wait til the sequel's out!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Ah, but you have heard of me.","The crew of the Black Pearl are cursed by something most unimaginable, the only way to lift the curse is to return a lost Aztec coin to its treasure chest home. In the way of them achieving their goal is the British Governor's daughter, the son of Bootstrap Turner, oh and a former comrade by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow who the crew had left to die on an island some time ago.It's now common knowledge that Pirates Of The Caribbean is a film based upon a theme park ride of the same name, tho that ride is not actually a roller-coaster, it's fair to say that this film most assuredly is. A swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can and pouring on layers of charm at every turn. Into the broth goes romance, comedy and striking adventure, and director Gore Verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin.It's unashamedly commercial, produced by that purveyor of OTT entertainment values, Jerry Bruckheimer, it was to be expected, but few blockbusting movies of the new age can lay claim to being such an out and out reason for having fun, and this this is the reason why Pirates has few peers, it knows its reason for being, it's not taking itself seriously, the audience is not being hoodwinked in any way, it is having fun because so is the film and so is crucially, its impressive cast. Johnny Depp as Sparrow is having the time of his life, basing the character around the dubious mannerisms of Rolling Stone icon, Keith Richards, it works to its highest potential and Depp is simply wonderful in the role. Keira Knightley {perfectly cast}, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and Mackenzie Crook all do what was asked, which is essentially say your lines right and have a blast with it, it really is that sort of picture.The subsequent sequels would forget what made this first offering so enjoyable, foregoing the outrageous sense of fun for a dark sheen and character development. That is a shame, but at the least we still have this wonderful picture to go back to time and time again, to lift you up when one is down or to keep one happy when one is already in that happy place, The Curse Of The Black Pearl is a joy from start to finish. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfection! This film is FAR from cursed!,"This is a fantastic film, with an all round perfect balance of action, drama, comedy and horror, supported by increadible special effects (the walking crew of the damned in their moonlight guises are really quite impressive) aswell as a rather good story and VERY good acting (in particular on Johnny Depp's part as Captain Jack Sparrow, he is the source of much hilarity while also being the most complex of all the characters on screen).

"Without a doubt, the best pirate movie of all time!","This an absolutely excellent movie. It has humor and great action and is entertaining from the very beginning to the end. Johnny Depp's acting is fantastic. Some might say that they missed more of walking the plank in this movie. Well, then just remember that walking the plank is actually a quite made up story, very much brought to life by movie's like disneys Peter Pan. When the pirates actually managed to take a prisoner the did a lot more awful things then walking the plank. Torturing the people they managed to capture was the way the pirates entertained themselves.

Over-hyped garbage.,"My movie review for this particular film is only based on the first two hours of the movie. The reason being for this is that after I saw that it had been over two hours and the movie was still going on, I just got up and left.I'm not sure whether or not you'll enjoy this movie. To be honest, I didn't really like it much. However, every other person that I have talked to who has seen this film has said that it was cool. I just didn't feel that way personally.I found it to be just another boring, typical pirate movie with predictable plot movements and unfunny comic relief. There was way too much dialogue and not enough action. And, well, I realized that I had been sitting in the theater for an hour, but I thought that I was only just FEELING like I was in there for so long just because it was so tedious and I was just waiting for it to end. However, it never ended.Although I didn't like it personally, everybody else did. So, I don't know what to say. I guess if you're into those kinds of movies about pirates and such, then you may enjoy it. I just found it to be predictable and lame.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
the undead(scenes) lack good fx,"voted this movie as a 7, would have got a 9 from me if the special effects were better, when they came out in the moonlight the moved so strange and awkward, I thought I saw Evil dead III or something they could have made the moonlight scenes smother, way smother. first they come walking in a ""normal"" pace, then they suddenly take on the ""zombie"" pacethat were the only thing that I got annoyed at, it felt that they released the movie to soon...but this is a great movie I suggest you go and see it",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
& really bad eggs ...,"Pirates of the Caribbean; the Curse of the Black Pearl is one of a kind. The movie is very fantastic & the staff must have worked very hard to accomplish such a legendary film.

Choosing Johnny Depp for this role made the character perfect. I believe he's the most hilarious person you might ever see & his performance as Jack Sparrow was the most flawless & the most powerful work.I've seen it so many times I can quote practically the whole movie start to finish & it never gets boring, mostly because Johnny Depp is so tremendous.It 'is' a family/kids movie & it is 'not' too scary, but you would enjoy it anyway, & if you wouldn't, i wouldn't argue, wouldn't call you stupid & would respect your opinion.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"Having been deposed by his crew, ""Capt. Jack Sparrow"" (Johnny Depp) arrives in Port Royal with little but the clothes he stands up in. He turns up just as the governor's daughter ""Elizabeth"" (Keira Knightley) is having to fend off the rather unwanted matrimonial intentions of ""Norrington"" (Jack Davenport). She has designs on the blacksmith's apprentice - ""Turner"" (a handsome but insipid, sorry, Orlando Bloom) whom she rescued from a pirate raid many years earlier. ""Sparrow"" would prove an excellent catch for ""Norrington"" but thanks to an hot poker, a donkey and some legerdemain at sea, he and ""Turner"" are soon abroad on the trail of his old crew and of the legendary pirates who sail the seas in the ""Black Pearl"" seeking an odd sort of salvation! What now ensues are some pacily directed escapades with loads of attitude, swash and buckle. Some pithy dialogue and a rousing (if slightly repetitive) score from Klaus Badelt take us criss-crossing the Caribbean constantly jumping from frying pan to fire. The star for me here is certainly Geoffrey Rush. A man who rarely disappoints, and on this occasion brings a comically potent degree of menace as his ""Barbossa"" character ensures that the plot thickens and the story gathers momentum. It's a bit on the long side - there are a few sagging moments now and again, but a solid supporting cast led by Kevin McNally provide some borderline slapstick humour, occasionally tempered by the dignified persona of an underused Jonathan Pryce's ""Gov. Swann"" and an whole suite of powdered wigs. The visual effects are top drawer and the story well worth a watch on a big screen to do justice to the imagery and the best traditions of seafaring yarns.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

9/10 [with explanation],"My rating: 9/10Before the featured presentation of LotR: The Two Towers came on the screen, a preview for Pirates of the Caribbean aired. My first thought was 'Uggh.' I forgot about it for a few months, then read a few critics' reviews, which praised a movie so different from what the preview hinted at. I got interested, and decided to see what people were raving about. Then the next day, I went and saw it again...Fun and adventurous, 'Pirates' was not at all what I expected from a pirate movie, yet it was exactly what a pirate movie should be: swashbuckling fun and adventure, a bit of violence, treasure, etc. Twisting humor, romance, violence, adventure, and fantasy into a fast and involving plot, the film keeps the audience's interest the entire film.Johnny Depp [CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow] carries the movie, complete with brilliantly ridiculous attire and movements reminiscent of Keith Richards. Depp adds most of the humor to 'Pirates' with memorable one-liners and speeches. Keira Knightley [Elizabeth Swann] played her part quite well, too. This was the first film of hers I'd seen and judged her performance as excellent, fitting into all the facets of her character. Orlando Bloom [Will Turner] was watched even closer by me, since I had recently seen his debut in the LotR trilogy. He acted up to par and accented Depp's character. Geoffrey Rush [Captain Barbossa] played the evil and clever 'bad guy' and brought the cunning ship captain to life.One last aspect of this film captivated me-- the score. I can nearly hum the entire musical score from listening to the soundtrack too many times. The music is exciting and enthralling, pulling you into the action scenes and softening the deep tones for the romantic ones. In fact, that's one of the only times I've waited through the credits, just to here that final rendition of 'He's a Pirate'. Be sure to pay attention to the music--it will make your viewing that much more exciting.All in all, 'Pirates' is a well-wrapped package of entertainment and adventure that will keep you spell-bound 'til the end.

Piracy on the high seas never looked so good (on DVD)...,"Borrowing traditional elements from films like CAPTAIN BLOOD and THE SEA HAWK and many other '40 tales of piracy on the high seas, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN goes further than all the other pirate tales by adding strong bits of fantasy that give new meaning to the phrase ""a skeleton crew"".You'll see what I mean when you watch the moonlight scenes where the cursed pirates become shadows of their former selves--effects that are guaranteed to cop a nomination for the Best Special Effects Oscar. So too are the gorgeously detailed sets and costumes (all of which have an air of accuracy), as well as the make-up wizardry involved in turning these actors into reasonably convincing 17th Century pirates.Standout among the performers, of course, is the central role as played by JOHNNY DEPP as the rogue pirate who teams with ORLANDO BLOOM (who looks like a young Errol Flynn here), a man with pirate blood himself. Their combined efforts to rescue a damsel in distress (nicely played by KEIRA KNIGHTLEY) and search for hidden treasure in a cave while fighting off the villain (GEOFFREY RUSH) is all done in almost comic book style and flair. Everyone seems cast to perfection.Artistically, it's a stunning film to watch, especially on DVD where the images are richly detailed and the mammoth production costs are clearly evident in every frame. Beautifully photographed and with a busy background score that is reminiscent of the kind of rousing music that Erich Wolfgang Korngold composed for the swashbucklers of the past.Summing up: A jolly good show!! A fun ride all the way.Only drawback: its length. Could have been trimmed by at least twenty minutes of running time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Feels like it was intended to be an animated film...,"Ok, I must admit, I went in to see this film with rather high expectations, but I was aware of the danger of it being overhyped and tried to watch it as openminded as possible.That being said, I still cannot deny that it has left me dissappointed. When I heard it was supposed to revive the pirate genre, show some awesome specialFX and would feature J.D. as a pirate, I half expected a dark and erie story that would keep me at the edge of my seat and make me mumble ""woooow"" every now and then into the bucket of popcorn I am holding on to.Well... none of it came through. Don't get me wrong, I did find it entertaining, but all throughout the movie, I kept thinking that I watching a film that was meant to be animated and reminded me strongly of former disney antics, just that (thank god) they didnt break into sing every now and then...The story is barely more than ok, slimly suits the audience of 12+, the characters are flat and stereotype, the Fx are awesome but sometimes not put to use too well I feel - the zombie pirates didnt really scare anyone at all - and the humor was often flat and failed to hit its mark more than once...It is a sunday evening film for entertainment, even of the family sort, but certainly not what I would spend the saturday night start-off money on... I'll give it a 6 out of 10, barely missing a 7, and it is 100% absolutely NOT the best film that came out this year.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Overly long,"Lots of action but overly long. Could have been cut by a half hour very easily. Some interesting special effects but the characters are difficult to relate to or really care about. Sheer fantasy that might appeal to those who want some mindless escapism. There are better films to spend your 140 minutes on. The special effects seem to be derivative of other modern action or horror films like Matrix and The Mummy. Most of the acting in this film is rather wooden and the actors seem to be just going through the motions, hoping it will soon end. But it doesn't. It just keeps going on and on and on. The musical score is the best part of the film. It is hard to believe they are making a sequel to this movie, but money talks. It was obviously a big hit and must have brought in a ton of money at the box office. I will take a rain check on the next installment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Oscar that have that movie because the music is absolutely deserved.Like a fact Pirates of the Charibean is based on a Disney game and I think that won 5 Oscars because of the best actor (johny), the best visual effects, the best makeup and hairstyle, sound and sound editing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Once in a while, a Hollywood film wins","Make no mistake; this is a true Hollywood movie, through and through.  But it's an entertaining one, to be sure.  I was skeptical of its integrity when I learned it was ""based"" on the Disneyland ride, let alone a Disney film. But again, it does entertain from start to finish and despite moments of cheesy humor, it's serious enough to satisfy those seeking a more ""real"" approach.  For the most part, it's historically correct.  Thankfully, they used fictitious characters instead of tarnishing the reputations of true high sea swashbucklers such as Ed Teach (Blackbeard) and John Rackham (Calico Jack).Depp pulls off a convincing character in Jack Sparrow, especially when you think he based the character on Keith Richards (mannerisms, hair and all). Rush also shines as Barbossa, while Bloom and Knightley fulfill their roles fittingly, though their performances are hardly outstanding.  This has more to do with the script than their abilities.  The cinematography and CG effects are outstanding and very convincing.Another thing this film does pull off well is character development.  They successfully illustrate 8-10 mainstay characters (lead and supporting) without bogging the story down or leaving things incomplete.  This is quite rare in a film and I was pleased at how well it was pulled off.All in all, if you haven't seen this film, do so.

Great entertainment,"This was the most fun movie of 2003. The story was original and above average, a pleasant surprise for a story based loosely on a theme park entertainment. The ghost ship and crew was a nice touch, but the show remained essentially an old fashioned adventure story, enhanced by a really good production to make everything seem believable. It had a good pace and special effects, but the strongest thing in its favor was the really good acting.

And I don't mean just cute stars either, but Orlando and johnny aren't hard on the eyes!

A good entertainment,"Jhonny Depp adds to his list of already enigmatic characters played probably the one he is most famous for playing - Captin Jack Sparrow , during the 2 hours of curse of the Black Pearl it was hard to think of anybody else who could pull it off as well as he did. The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of those summer time movies which you have to be in the mood to view and many years later finally... that mood had arrived for me. On the whole I was not left disappointed as it kept me hooked through its swash- buckling antics and I can see how the angles were curbed to keep this a good family film. The plot was fairly straight forward with our anti-hero pirate trying to recover his ship back whilst taking revenge on a group of super natural foes along with the entire naval fleet and the meeting a few characters along the way . The special affects were very good , not to mention the stunts and the sword play all brilliant although its never really taken to the level I had hoped for but hey again this is a family film!!! Jhonny Depp was the man who kept me in my seat , whether it be the action or the catchy one liners he makes it very apparent why he is one of the most versatile actors to have emerged onto the big screen. Orlando Bloom although I am not a fan of his he pulled his weight through out the film very well indeed UNLIKE in Troy where he was nothing short of an annoying pep-squeak and I really enjoyed Keira Knightley's performance through out the film (not just eye candy)and every body made full use of the scenery to the brilliant make-up and costumes really made it worth while. Too conclude The Curse of The Black Pearl is one of those films which are worth a check at on summer's day with your family or worth a rental if your looking for a bit of light action/fantasy I mean I may just be a little too old for Pirates now days and the action was not taken to the level I had hoped for but instead it was saved by brilliant performances all round.THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL: 8.1 OUT OF 10'You best start believing in ghost stories Miss Turner, after all your in one!' - Captin Barbossa (played by Geoffery Rush.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best film of 2003.....,"Pirates of the Caribbean was easily one of the best films of 2003.The story was brilliant, the acting was amazing and the characters were some of the most interesting and creative to have graced the silver screen.It was about time a pirate movie was made that didnt disappoint. there was action, comedy, romance...there was something for everyone....even my step-dad liked it.Personally, i dont think that the casting could have been much better. Geoffrey Rush and Johnny depp, two of Hollywood's most talented actors....how could they go wrong?Johnny Depp more than deserved an Oscar nomination, although the other nominees were equally deserving, and i think that its a shame he missed out. he has played so many interesting and challenging roles so well that i think he truely deserves one.Overall this is an amazing film that will hopefully stand the test of time, and in ten years time i will be able to sit down with my children and they will enjoy it as much as i have.However, the only think that worries me about it standing the test of time is the graphics. the speed at which technology is improving that will look awful in a matter of years.Other than that, i give this movie an impressive 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
You will probably like it... though it doesn't deserve it.,"Disclaimer: I saw a moderately crappy cam-version with a crappy dub (50% translation, 50% own creation).Most people seem to enjoy this flick and I guess that chances are that you will too. I saw it (better to say some parts of it) yesterday and to say I was disappointed is to say nothing. After about one hour my dad said he can't bear it anymore and walked out. I followed him, but later returned, since I had to kill time somehow. My mother and 19 y.o. sister moderately enjoyed it (or may be just thought it would get better), but after less than two hours said they will watch it sometime later (read 'never') and stopped it.Well, my impression was that the movie was pretty stupid and cliche. May be not the worst script, but nothing to write home about. The acting was either over the top (Johnny Depp) or bland and boring (everyone else). There might have been some brilliant special effects that I missed on the cam-copy, but I doubt it. There was hardly any sea worth looking at, and everything else was taken out of the Hollywood library of generic effects.If you have nothing better to do, see it on the big screen, may be it will look cool (it probably won't).

Better than expected,"I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this movie because, quite honestly, I really did not expect to enjoy it at all.  Although not a classic piece of filmmaking, the movie was never intended to be such and did exactly what it intended to do - entertain. The make-up and costumes for the pirates were very well done and most of those same pirates were very well played.  The town of Tortuga and the ships were also quite impressive. Geoffrey Rush was very good in his role as Barbossa, although perhaps he should have been more evil.  Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce were very good in their roles as Commander Norrington and Governor Swann. However, as already mentioned a million times, Johnny Depp completely steals the show with his wacky performance as Captain Jack Sparrow.  This character should have been pretty one-dimensional but instead he's larger than life. Sparrow is a very memorable character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley had perhaps the two worst performances in this movie.  Their characters were so flat that one truly doesn't care what happens to them.  Looking handsome or pretty just doesn't cut it. Another complaint is the extended scenes involving fights with skeletons. Although the CGI pirates were impressive, the fight sequences near the end go on far too long. That said, the movie is still surprisingly good and very entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The action sequences were all great, with good sword fights, Daring escapes and even ship to ship battles. The Humour is probably the best thing about this film, its just fun and light hearted you can't help but like it. This film also has some great one liners.The acting in the film is also very good, Depp being the best. He has created a great classic, anti-hero lovable rouge who is up there with the likes of Indiana Jones and Han solo, he's just campy(but trust me that works). The rest of the cast is also good.The set pieces and special effects are also great. a good mix of real effects combined with CGI have combined to make a great looking picture.If you want a good swash buckling adventure action flick with a big dash of Humour and a pinch of romance mixed in for good measure. Then this film is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Could have been much better,"The Lighting and color was OK in some areas but for the most part it wasn't colorful enough and the lighting was underdone. There needed to be more focus on shiny appearance of gold and classical cherry wood and golden lighting.I remember some of the Disney stuff from the early 80's a picture book in particular that features the dog holding the keys at a dungeon and a massive cave system with beautifully illustrated treasure. This movie was nowhere near the standard of that. It came off looking as synthetic as the black pearl pirates in their ghost form.I'm all for CGI in movies but it was very poorly done in this movie, some of the worst I've seen.I wanted this movie to take me to the place i remember from the picture book I had as a kid unfortunately it failed miserably.

"Don't Walk The Blank, See this movie!!","Probably the best movie under the name Disney.  Based on the infamous ride at Disneyland, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, is a movie that gives pirates a whole new meaning.  This swashbuckling film has a great action and performed brilliantly by a amazing cast.  I must say Geoffrey Rush stands out as the cursed pirate.  He gives an outstanding performance as he always seems to do when playing a villain.You will get blasted out of the water!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I defintely suggest this movie to anyone who wants to see a truly great movie.,"This is the best movie I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot! Absolutely brilliant screenplay and acting, I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Johnny Depp creates an original personality for his character, Jack Sparrow, a pirate looking for revenge after the mutiny 10 years ago from his first mate, Captain Barbossa.  Geoffrey Rush gives Barbossa an amazing character, full of wickedness but also just that touch of pity and laughter.  When the pirates of the Black Pearl, Jack's old ship, attack Port Royal, they take the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), with them onto the ship.  Keira has definitely launched her career with this role as she displayed some wonderful acting.  Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, is determined to rescue her and teams up with Jack. Orlando has done it again - made a great movie even better.  But only Jack knows that a curse has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever.I just absolutely adore this movie; it has everything - adventure, comedy, romance, action, you name it.  Not to mention impeccable casting, wonderful costume and makeup, astonishing props and scenes, and amazing music.  I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a truly great movie.  11/10!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Real Surprise.,"Pirates of The Caribbean is a great spectacle of a film that is really a great surprise. Johnny Depp solidifies himself as a superb actor with this film, and Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are just as good. The special effects are great, and the landscape of the film is breathtaking. Kudos to Geoffrey Rush who is a very versatile actor for giving such a great performance as the villain, and To Jerry Brukhelmer for not letting this film become another watered down Disney product like The Haunted Mansion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"That rare bird, a decent modern pirate movie.","Pirate movies have fallen on hard times as of late.  There hasn't been a decent one since the mid-fifties.  Attempts to revive the genre have generated a series of expensive flops like Cutthroat Island and Roman Polanski's Pirates.  Despite the dismal track every ten years or so there is yet another attempt to get it right. With the latest, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl persistence is rewarded. Though not on a level with Captain Blood or The Crimson Pirate, Curse is still is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that successfully combines modern action with a traditional sea saga.The Black Pearl is a ship with a cursed crew doomed to an undead existence until they return all the Aztec gold they unwisely pilfered. After years of ghostly plundering they manage to gather all save for the one piece currently in the possession of the beautiful Elizabeth, the Royal Governor's daughter. Can her true love, the pirate hating blacksmith Will, keep her safe from the crew's boney clutches?  Or does she need the help of the completely loony Captain Jack Sparrow?Sparrow is a hilarious addition to the Hollywood Pirate tradition. He is a seadog sure to strike terror into the hearts of the fiercest scallywag though not because of his dazzling swordplay.  Johnny Depp plays Sparrow as if he has downed one too many grogs on the way to the gay pride parade. He flounces, weaves and mumbles his way about the Caribbean absolutely sure that he is the very model of a modern pirate captain. That his adversaries aren't as sure of his seafaring abilities as he is doesn't register in his hazy worldview.  Depp's Belle of the Poop Deck routine works fabulously. He gives the movie a pixilated charm but if it's an old fashioned shiver-me-timbers pirate you want there is Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa.  Rush `arrhs' it up for all he's worth and even makes you feel a little sorry for the murderous old sea dog.As Depp and Rush keep the glorious tradition of ham acting alive others in the cast are left struggling to keep up.  While Orlando Bloom seems stogy as Will the insanely beautiful Keira Knightley is in no danger of being overshadowed.  Her Elizabeth comes across as the most competent character in the movie. You get the feeling she could have sorted the plot out quicker without the blundering help of Sparrow and Will.  The rest of the cast is filled with a great assortment of character actors who fill out their colorful parts nicely.  In fact, it's safe to say it's the performers who make this movie despite the extensive special effects on display.Curse suffers from the usual modern summer blockbuster problems what with frenzied editing, sloppy plotting and a leaden approach to comic timing. Complicating matters is an out of control sound design.  Background creaks, booms and clangs are blasted out of proportion and every footfall thumps like a brontosaurus tread. All this drowns out the actors so potentially funny lines are lost.  Art direction is also problematic. For example, the skeletal crew is so stuffed with detail that between the quick cuts and frenzied pace they come across as a perambulating blob.  A further drawback is the cinematography. For some reason the normally sunny Caribbean looks as bleak and cold as the North Atlantic. While all this is annoying it shouldn't stop you from seeing Curse. It's a charming movie filled with the sort of enjoyably preposterous performances you rarely see nowadays.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
But isn't piracy BAD for movies?,"Lame joke, but I can't think of a good summary. Pirates of the Caribbean is a pretty decent summer blockbuster that received much acclaim thanks to massive marketing. It's not terribly original, it's not terribly funny(lots of the lines meant to be funny really doesn't work very well) and in the end, it's not terribly satisfying either.As movies come, it's solid and well-made and there's nothing to complain about in directing or the score, which both are good. The acting is one of the disappointments. Orlando Bloom is totally wooden as usual, Kiera Knightley doesn't exactly leave an impression, and Johnny Depp, although he is a god of acting, doesn't take his cool role nearly as far as he could have(with a script like PoTC's, there's no room for anything outside the frames of well-tried movie/money-making guides).The plot is the standard damsel-in-distress scenario and some Incan curse thrown in for good measure. Add a bit of Dawn of the Dead or the work of Ray Harrihausen in ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and you have the storyline.I've watched PoTC two times and it has failed to impress me both times. It's a bit too violent to be appropriate to the audience I think would have appreciated it best, and a bit to childish to appeal to the rest of the movie-goers. Not something you have to see.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Johnny Depp as we've never seen him before!,"Arrr matey, it's about time these landlubbers made a good old-fashioned pirate movie! I for one felt the need for this kind of action and in my opinion, this movie is brilliant. Just the breath of fresh air you need after the usual gore fest in movies today. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a great achievement, successful in being both fun and thrilling at the same time. It's the kind of movie that you either love or hate, but for a fan of the genre, it's a true blessing and a must see. I haven't been so excited about a movie in a long time and I believe that we need more movies like it, because it appeals a lot to the kid inside everyone. We've all imagined ourselves sailing the seven seas, sword fighting with anyone that comes in our way. ""The curse of the Black Pearl"" really fires up your imagination and the special effects add to the great feeling of reality the movie gives you, as it takes you into a world long forgotten. Johnny Depp surprises with his role as a pirate captain and is probably one of the last actors you would expect to play such a part. Nevertheless, his performance is outstanding and I can't remember him being so witty in any other role he's played. In conclusion this is a movie you can really enjoy and something the movie industry forgot about, that certain something that makes the seventh art so great: a fun adventure. You'll feel like you're 12 again! I certainly hope there will be a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Swashbuckling Adventure with Unforgettable Characters,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), directed by Gore Verbinski, is a thrilling and wildly entertaining action-adventure that redefined the pirate genre for a new generation. Packed with memorable characters, sharp humor, and exhilarating action, it's a standout blockbuster that's as fun today as it was at release.Pros:
Johnny Depp's Iconic Performance: Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow is nothing short of legendary. His eccentric mannerisms, razor-sharp wit, and unpredictable behavior make Jack one of the most memorable characters in film history. Depp's performance elevates the movie and adds a unique charm that sets it apart from other adventure films.Engaging Storyline: The film blends action, adventure, and supernatural elements seamlessly. The plot, revolving around a cursed crew of undead pirates and a race to break their curse, is intriguing and keeps the audience hooked from start to finish.Strong Supporting Cast: Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner provide compelling and grounded performances, balancing out Jack Sparrow's eccentricity. Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa is a standout, delivering a charismatic and menacing antagonist with just the right amount of theatricality.Spectacular Action and Visuals: From epic sword fights to thrilling naval battles, the action scenes are expertly choreographed and visually stunning. The film's special effects, particularly the skeletal transformations of the cursed crew under moonlight, were groundbreaking for their time and still hold up well today.Memorable Score: Hans Zimmer and Klaus Badelt's score, particularly the iconic He's a Pirate theme, perfectly complements the film's adventurous tone and has become synonymous with the franchise.Perfect Blend of Humor and Drama: The movie strikes an excellent balance between lighthearted humor and serious stakes. Jack Sparrow's antics provide plenty of laughs, while the curse and its consequences add a layer of tension and depth to the story.Cons:
Pacing Issues in the Middle: While the film is consistently entertaining, the middle section can feel slightly overstuffed with exposition. Some scenes drag a bit compared to the fast-paced opening and climactic finale.Predictable Character Arcs: While the characters are well-acted and engaging, their development-particularly Will Turner's journey from a blacksmith to a swashbuckling hero-follows familiar tropes. This predictability doesn't diminish the fun but might feel formulaic to some viewers.Over-the-Top Moments: At times, the film leans into exaggerated humor or action sequences that might feel a bit too cartoonish for certain audiences. However, these moments fit the film's overall tone and charm.Conclusion:
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a wildly entertaining adventure that combines thrilling action, a captivating story, and unforgettable performances. While it has a few minor flaws, its charm, humor, and swashbuckling spirit make it a classic that stands the test of time. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Almost shipwrecked...,"True to the tagline, I was blown out of the water by this film; for two reasons. I was more than a little afraid that ""Pirates"" would steer the same course as ""Cutthroat Island"". Which ended in a major shipwrecking, as I recall.The good part is the actors are giving everything they got. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are playing the eye catchers (blame the scriptwriters) and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are clearly amusing themselves, which works contagious on the audience. In fact, Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow kinda reminds me of Mick Jagger. Same accent, same moves.The story is the bad part of this film. In short: it drags too long. We could have done without an hour at least. The special effect are quite good and the sword fights are nice, but it takes the actors (especially Depp and Rush) to keep the boat from running on the rocks.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Fun fun fun,"I saw the previews for this movie in the theatres, but thought that watching it would probably lower my IQ somehow. When I heard that it was a summer hit, I scoffed thinking ""it figures."" But after a friend told me it's not that stupid and Johnny Depp gives a good performance, I rented it. I'm glad I did, since it's really fun, but not mind numbingly preposterous. Depp is stunning. Captain Jack just oozes charisma, and I eagerly awaited his return when he wasn't onscreen. I had no idea what this film was about, so the little twist was a complete shocker and quiet scary! I think Johnny Depp deserves the Oscar for his performance. Granted, the other guys gave powerful performances and what not. But Depp did too, and he took a lot of risks in his! None of the other nominees stole every scene of their respective movies. Also, their character portrayals were easily dictated by the script. But Depp created someone refreshing and new. The only thing I could say is that this movie is waaay too long. Three hours? And the fight scene in the cave had a few to many 'twists.' It didn't really need them. Oh well. It's still good over all.

"So many great aspects, you should see it many times.","The first time I saw Pirates, like most other teenage girls, I went for Orlando Bloom. The second time I went for Johnny Depp's outrageous character Jack Sparrow and for the incredibly complex plot twists. The third time was for the rest of the characters. The most intriguing of these characters is Commodor Norrington. He is in a position, especially given that this is a Disney movie, for the audience to despise him: he is not evil, but he is the competing love interest for Orlando's girl. Yet Norrington is selfless, perceptive, and a strong leader. Unlike anyone else in this movie, he is everything he claims to be. I won't describe the plot twists here, but I will say that all of it was unpredictable and brilliant. The staging and the music impressed me as well, from Sparrow's majestic appearance, to the treasure cavern, to the heartstopping final gunshot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

These Pirates Stole my Heart,"Pirates of the Carribean is not your average film. Action, special effects, a good score, romance, and great acting encompass this film and make it an adventure that you want to be a part of.

Johnny Depp is without a doubt at his best in this film, and most definetly delivers an award-winning portrayal as the adventurous, swave, and disillusioned Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley, along with others, light the screen also. However, in the end it is Depp who bedazzles the viewer. A great movie to rent and watch with others.

Reminds us that Hollywood was once wonderful...,"..and uplifting. There was a time when this is why people went to the movies. No pretentious advocacy. Just high caliber entertainment. (Good music too) What? Johnny Depp can even take his young kids to see it. Pirate Jack Sparrow is an all-time characterization. Geoffrey Rush boosts the wonder of storybook pirates to a level not seen since the original ""Treasure Island"". The Brit officers are great foils for Depp and the pirate crew is all that one could hope for. Great lines sprinkled throughout. Rush's response to the Lady's demand on pirate ethics is classic. ""..it was more of a guideline than a rule"". The old adage -always leave them laughing- was transgressed for me as the film went a tad long.

I mean, seriously, they already have a domestic gross of over 300 million!, that's pretty good for a lousy movie, don't you think? I think that is was successful because of the fact that it connected with the most visited ride in America, and that it was a jerry bruckheimer film which gives it quality right away. Plus the fact that it had Johnny Depp and his character that just blew me away. In closing, this was a movie that might not get an Oscar but is still an excellent movie. -Ryan",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Fun Flick that will make you sit at the edge of your seat,"I was extremely anxious to go see Pirates of the Caribbean last year in the summer when it came out. I saw it two days after it came out and I really liked it. In a way, I think it could be seen for all ages. Heck, it was a very fun film with lots of funny lines by my favorite character in the film, Jack Sparrow. The action was neatly done and for a PG-13 film. The shooting on the ships were so cool like Master and Commander's. Johnny Depp could've been an oscar worthy actor in it. Keira Knightley was great to and she is really hot, indeed. Lucky Will gets her. Ha funny stuff. Overall, this was a great film with impressive action and a perfect comedy mixed very well into it.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates Scores Big Booty at the Box Office!,"Inspired by Disneyland's classic ride, Pirates of the Caribbean is a film of lovable characters, an eerie underscore, and action-packed plot. The story runs a bit long and becomes slightly tedious to watch towards the end, yet a typical Disney happy-ending saves the day just in time for the viewers to walk away pleased with the movie and secretly wishing they were pirates themselves.The film possesses all the classic characters and scenarios of a romantic Disney adventure, including the young, fate-seeking hero, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the comedic relief and clown, witty Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the uptight straight man, Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), and the ruthless villain, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Of course, let us not forget the leading lady, young miss Keira Knightley, playing the governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann.Situated in the British, Caribbean colony of Port Royal, Swann wishes to live the life of a pirate and not a governor's daughter, while her admirer, the impoverished blacksmith, Will Turner, wishes to deny his own pirate roots. Once mischievous Sparrow enters the town with his agenda of rounding up a crew, stealing a British naval ship and retrieving his rights as captain of the Black Pearl pirate ship, havoc ensues.The entrance of the damned Black Pearl's crew into Port Royal is quickly summoned by the last missing piece of treasure, which calls them when Swann falls into the water with it (a gold coin) wrapped around her neck. The pirates sac the town, stealing Swann and headed to return the treasure and break their curse. The chase is on, once Turner springs Sparrow from jail, for the ship and its desired possessions. And that's just the first 20 minutes of this event-filled 2 hour and 23 minute movie. The hero's luck runs out, but just when all hope is lost, Sparrow devises a plan to save his ship, get Will his girl and escape the grips of both the cursed pirates and dim-witted British navy.Filled with an excellent cast and first-rate special effects, Pirates makes it easy to truthfully accept the unbelievably fantastical events of the film including sword fights, pirate ships on the open seas, cannon warfare, and caves of treasure. Director Gore Verbinski brings out the best of his actors, who enable the sometimes-cheesy script to flow smoothly and as convincing dialogue. Depp's typical ability to create a quirky and enchanting character is again fulfilled in his drunken pirate role. He brings out the character's bad luck but determined nature, making him the admirable good/bad guy. Depp's humorous line delivery and outstanding timing nicely accompany his scruff appearance, adorned with eyeliner, a bead-embellished wig, and braided goatee.Rush also performs his role of the evil pirate convincingly and with his usual gifted acting talent. Bloom slips nicely into his usual typecast role as the love-driven romantic young lad, and his opposite, then seventeen-year-old, British actress, Knightley brings the adventurous, bold, and beautiful identity of Swann to life.Though none of these characters exist in the Disney adventure ride, there are two similar scene's that lovers of the ride will recognize, one being the stop at pirate infested Tortuga Island. The storyline does become a bit boring and redundant, as the minutes turn to hours, creating the feeling of déjà vu. Yet, the scheming scoundrel Jack Sparrow saves the day, and the audience's attention only to sacrifice himself to capture by the Royal Navy. Don't worry, though, it all ends well as a good Disney movie should.Along with watching an action-packed, historical fantasy and obtaining some great new words to add to daily jargon, such as 'savvy' 'parlay' 'commandeer' and 'ecumenically,' I somehow feel more complete. And just when that sense of completeness fades, the sequel, promised by the title's saga specificity The Curse of the Black Pearl, will probably be in theatres.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Mr. Depp and the others were perfect for their roles... and, even though the special effects were spectacular, they didn't seem to be the reason for the movie... other motion pictures of late seem to be made just because some guy sitting at his computer can do something amazing and have it look fairly real, to which they then build a story around... the effects in Pirates simply added to the movie... and the references to the Pirates amusement ride made the whole experience even more fun...

A pirate schemes to regain his ship by helping a young man rescue his love from pirates.,"Pirates of the Caribbean is an excellent movie. It shies away from the excessive violence, sex, and profanity so common in today's films to present a funny and exciting adventure about pirates. It is not a highly realistic story, but that is what gives it so much charm.Captain Jack Sparrow leads the ideal pirate life, stealing and swindling instead of murdering. As a character, he is laid back and scarcely ever seems serious. He also has a seemingly never-ending supply of great lines. Jack's resourcefulness and wit are his greatest assets, and the ego he totes around is comical as well.William Turner, blacksmith's apprentice, balances out the light-hearted Jack. Will is intense, focused, and dedicated. He has goals and he goes for them. Jack and Will are an amusing pair throughout the movie, especially when Will's intensity and seriousness are shot through by one of Jack's witty retorts.Elizabeth Swan, the beauty of the picture, is by no means helpless. She is fearless and resourceful, witty and intelligent. Elizabeth seems to be more of a happy medium between Jack and Will, and complements the others quite well.The effects are great, and this prevents the movie from taking a cheesy turn. While the accursed pirates may be a bit much for some of the younger kids, it is still a great family movie as it is clean and enjoyable for both kids and adults. It has action and adventure, with an exotic aura to it. The fight scenes, especially the sword duels, are well done.Overall, this movie earns a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Depp deserves the Oscar,"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is one of my favorite films of 2003.  Johnny Depp deserves an oscar for the starring role, and owns the film from the time he hits the screen.  Great job all around, the film looks cool, and the special effects are flawless.Admittedly, when I first heard about PIRATES, the idea of a motion picture based on a Disney theme park ride seemed just plain asinine.  When I saw the trailer it seemed like it may work, but I wasn't totally convinced just yet. But when I saw the film in the theater, I was completely blown away. Now, having watched it again on DVD, it still holds up as one of the best of 2003.Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow is incredible.  He says that much of the persona was inspired by Keith Richards, either way it's an outstanding performance all through the film.  The mannerisms, gait, look, everything totally works.  Geoffrey Rush turns in a fine performance as Sparrow's nemesis Capt. Barbossa, and clearly loves this role.  The rest of the cast is totally solid, and there are also references to the Disney ride, which totally work in the context of the film.This movie is visually stunning, and the effects look flawless.  I actually preferred the look of the undead pirates in this film to the somewhat similar treatment that the army of the dead had in RETURN OF THE KING.If you have not seen PIRATES, by all means check it out.  It's a great popcorn movie that entertains without being condescending.  Cool to see Depp get the Oscar nom, and it would be even cooler to see him win.  Now that he's won the SAG award, it will be interesting to see what the Academy has to say.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Brilliance. Sheer brilliance.,"This was an excellent piece of work, in my opinion. It was a movie that balanced good acting (Johnny Depp was awesome, and Orlando Bloom was surprising), good action (any fan of fighting and war and adventure should see this), and sheer knee-slapping humor! Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) provided many one-liners and spur-of-the-moment quips that made me laugh my butt off....The skeletal pirates were well-done and the score was very fitting. I can't think of any flaws right off the bat, except that Tim Curry could've been a great addition! The movie is a tad on the longer side, but you won't notice, because you'll be so busy laughing and crying to the bumbling, dimwitted antics of the worst pirate you've ever heard of....but you HAVE heard of him!I highly suggest this movie....10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great except for one glaring mistake,"I love this movie. The grandeur of the music and scenery, the subtle ties to the Disneyland ride (always my favorite), are exquisite. Johnny Depp was born to play Jack Sparrow, and the rest of the cast, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, are perfect as well as the rest of the supporting cast. The glaring mistake is Keira Knightley, and I rated this movie a 9 instead of 10 because of her. I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion, but I think she's a terrible actress. She just looks totally out of place, and doesn't fit the part of an old-world pirate movie. She doesn't seem to embrace the character she's playing, instead it always seems like she's acting instead of living the part. And I'm sorry, but she looks like she's perpetually posing for a duck lip selfie. If it weren't for her, this movie would be perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

One of the gr8test films depp has ever done!,"Johnny Depp the tremendous actor stars in yet another strange, yet wondeful film where his charactor is always wacky!

Johnny takes on the role of captain jack sparrow magnifisenly, he makes the charactor totaly unique and simply marvolous. Plus which makes things even better is that he looks really sexy too! hehe. next to the almost normal charactors William Turner and Elizabeth Swan, Johnny looks out of place, yet BEAUTIFUL!! This is one of my favourite roles that Johnny depp has played aswell as he in sleepy hollow, edward scissor hands, chocolat, once apon a time in mexico, blow, from hell and many many more including his most recent film secret window (which was a success!)

Great show.,"I recently rented Pirates of the Caribbean, and it was a great show. The best thing about this movie is that it was very entertaining, and it is easily the most entertaining movie I have seen in a long time. This film has it all - humor, romance, thrills, action, mystery, and suspense. I wish I had seen it in the theater, but the DVD was great anyway.As far as the plot, I honestly wasn't really expecting anything too detailed or deep. After all, this is a Disney film, and one based on a ride at a theme park. However, there are several unexpected plot twists and turns, and it's hard to know which people you're actually rooting for in the film. The characters are interesting and they do some unexpected things from time to time. The plot was much more interesting and enjoyable than I imagined it would be.One thing that really impressed me was the CGI. I'm not a big fan of computer-generated graphics, and especially when they're inserted into live action films alongside human actors. But this was very well done - as well-done as any film I've seen.Finally, a comment about where this movie ranks. Don't get me wrong - this is a very entertaining show, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I rate this film pretty high on my own list, but I'm surprised to see it on the IMDb Top 250 films of all time. It's a great show, but I don't think it deserves a spot among the top 250 films of all time. Nothing against this film, but I would think there would be at least 250 films made since 1940 that would be better than this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The other characters are perfectly cast as well, especially Bloom whose performance harks back to Errol Flynn and Kira Knightly who pulls off the strong and surprisingly funny damsel. Geoffery Rush is the most perfect pirate villain we've seen in forever and you just can't get enough of he and Johnny's scenes together.

Arrrrrr!,"Great to see that careful planning, structuring and audience studying pay off sometimes. The audience can at times be a strange beast, and can sink pictures in the same turf where others have been glorified. But Disney couldn't allow this movie to suffer the fate of Roman Polanski's ""Pirates"" or ""Cutthroat Island"". First major rule: stick to what you know, and always trust the school of Hollywood -  thus, create a buddy-buddy formula, add the love interest, and then create a baddie, or even better, an army of baddies to go chase the heroes. The cornerstones of the typical american blockbuster are all right there, splattered on the screen, just pick them out. Second major rule: give the audience the very thing they're looking for when in the movies - exactly those things that they're not expecting. So assume the pirate theme and adapt it to the 21st century - and then come the bombastic the special effects. These two rules are usually gold, and when you tackle a movie genre that hasn't been touched for almost ten years, it isn't difficult to give people what they want to see. But this apparent ease of thought would trap Disney, so thank God for brilliant ideas - and one brilliant actor. Johnny Depp steals the show right from his unforgettable entrance, and never thinks of allowing some space for other things to provide comic relief. And neither do the filmmakers, and the public. As Jack Sparrow, the gallery of Depp-ish weirdness is complete with a full-on, iconic buckaneer, brilliantly crossing pirate stereotype with pop culture in a performance of rare dedication and method for a summer blockbuster. The result is the most memorable character of the picture, and also the entire blockbuster season. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" could be in many ways another flop, but the producers made this movie by studying everything that made the others sink to the bottom. And also did Jerry Bruckheimer, whose ""Pearl Harbor"" left more bitterness in his mouth than memories in the entire audience. A refined sense of style, bombastic CGI skelletons and a script that only feels muddled when it seeks help in some of the chapters of the ""Hollywood book of screenwriting"", make this a winner, and one of the best popcorn-munchers of the year. Expect Peter Weir's / Russell Crowe's ""Master and Commander"", expect ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2"", and most probably seafaring adventures are back into the silver screen. Ahoy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"it's the script, stupid...","Due to circumstances beyond my control, I have watched this film three times in the past six months. To be frank, it's taken me that many viewings to get to grips with the plot, and to appreciate that the main star is not in fact Johnny Depp - who seems, albeit understandably,  to have emerged as the new Valentino - but the scriptwriter. Those wonderful understated supporting performances, notably by the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of the British navy, were enabled - as was the virtuoso and richly-imagined representation of Jack Sparrow - by their witty and precisely crafted speech.  And as for Depp, are we all absolutely sure it isn't his character we've fallen in love with?

Pirates is the best movie,"This is one of the best movies of all time correction this is the best movie of all time.Johnny Depp is genius in this film one of his best roles.With One of the best casts with Johnny ,Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly and Geoffery Rush this film plunges the deep Caribbean with action drama romance and even comedy. That is probably what makes this film so good there isn't just one genre there's several. Also this isn't the classic and very overused Good vs. Evil we have The Black Pearl crew the bad guys then we have Commodore Norringtons navy which is the good guys but kinda are the bad guys also when they are keeping Elizabeth from rescuing will and then we have the crazy crew of captain jack sparrow which are pirates and bad guys to the Royal navy but good guys to the pirates of the black pearl and then we have just Captain Jack Sparrow who we never really know what side hes on.Another thing that makes this movie so incredibly awesome is the hilarious quotes. Jack sparrow is one incredible character hes always funny but serious its to hard to describe he has the most hilarious facial expressions all the time and is never scared but always 3 steps in front of everyone else.I have a friend who had never seen it because she said the previews scared her but i begged her into watching it and now thats all she talks about she bought the cereal she has a countdown for the second and shes just about as obsessed as i am my dance troupe has made our production dance pirates thats how incredibly awesome everything in this movie is!!!!!If you haven't seen this movie you are missing something incredible !

STILL one of the best fantasy action movies ever made.,"Ah, yes, the first, the original and the ONLY 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film I enjoyed. The film sees Johnny Depp in his most iconic role, that of pirate Captain Jack Sparrow - a role that fits him like a glove. He was original and funny, whereas the character became annoying and overbearing in the sequels and the humour became silly slapstick.A Young pirate boy, William Turner, is rescued from the ocean after being spotted by young Elizabeth. Noticing a pirate medallion around his neck, Elizabeth realizes he is the son of a pirate, and takes the medallion in order to save him.Years later and Elizabeth still has the medallion hidden away. William turned out to be a respectable young man. On the day Elizabeth's father buys her a new dress to wear for an occasion, she decides to wear the medallion. With her corset too tight and Elizabeth unable to breathe, she faints and falls into the ocean, and the medallion magically calls to the Black Pearl.Enter Captain Jack Sparrow, who saves Elizabeth from the ocean. However, her fiancée wants Jack executed for being a pirate. Jack manages a daring escape. That night all hell breaks loose as the Black Pearl sails into the harbour, with its cursed crew. When Elizabeth is taken hostage aboard the Black Pearl, it's up to Jack and William to save her.And this is the start of a fantastic adventure filled with incredible action sequences, stunning visuals, a host of unsavoury characters, and loads of humour, suspense, fantasy elements, and interesting reveals.

Impressive. Their acting is good. But you could have put a bunch of unknowns in this film along with Johnny Depp and the film would still have been a hit.Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, who goes along with blacksmith Will Turner (Bloom) as he tries to find Elizabeth Swann, his love (Knightley). She is the daughter of the governor and has been kidnapped by the awful Captain Barbossa (Rush). Barbossa and his crew live under an old curse. They're not dead but they're not alive either. The curse can't be broken without returning all of the gold with each pirate's blood back into the chest.Because of the medallion Elizabeth wears, Barbossa believes she is the one he wants. If he gets her medallion and puts her blood on it, the curse will be broken. He's in for a shock.There are some great special effects, suspense, and humor in this overly long film, as well as some wonderful acting, but Johnny Depp steals the film.

BEST FILM ABOUT PIRATES...EVER!!!,"That's right. This is the best film about pirates and the high seas. Everything here works, this is the most perfect summer slice of blockbuster escapism that has emerged in a long time. High brow critics may bulk, but this is not meant to be a film that is all about characterization and emotion, it's meant to be fun, fun and fun and we get a lot of it.First of all, Johnny Depp is great. The surprising thing about it is, he seems well suited to being in a blockbuster film, more so that I thought before, and even more surprising is that his role as Jack Sparrow isn't the type that is taking advantage of his movie star good looks. Here is has dirty teeth, rag tag long hair and is playing basically a crook, but a lovable one of course. His performance is perfect, from his mannerisms, the slurred speech and the Keith Richards like accent, he should definitely be a favorite for the Golden Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy. The rest of the cast are well filled out too, with Orlando Bloom magnificent as the straight man Will Turner, Kiera Knightly is very lovely as the damsel in distress and finally Geoffrey Rush is great as the evil villain with a nice sideline in comedy.The script is surprisingly witty here, but coming from the writers of Shrek, this isn't surprising. It's not high art, but the script is a wonderful adventure laced with magnificent humor. Gore Verbinski as director handled the material rather well, which is a surprise. As the director of The Ring and Mousehunt, I wasn't sure if he were the right choice to be doing this film, especially considering that it is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, but alas, I wouldn't be surprised after this effort if Verbinski joins Michael Bay and Tony Scott in the esteemed list of Bruckheimer directors.Of course the special effects are brilliant also. The sequences involving the dastardly crew of the Black Pearl turning into skeletons (the CGI monkey is terrifically well realized) are amongst some of the best special effects of 2003, while the shot of all the pirates of the Black Pearl walking on the ocean floor is spine tingling.Overall this is a fantastic film and ranks as one of the best blockbusters to have emerged from this decade so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Keira Knightly was only 17 when this was filmed and her acting skills bring to mind Lauren Bacall at the same age. I must say, too, that POTC made a Johnny Depp fan out of me - it really does show what an amazing talent he possesses. Johnny Depp IS Captain Jack Sparrow, having stepped right into the persona of a pirate who is more comfortable on sea than on land. Ruthless in his quest to retrieve his beloved ship and stay ""afloat"", as it were, he keeps us guessing as to what really lies in his heart, what makes him tick. Half the fun of the movie - most of it really - comes from watching to see what he will do and say next.

If I am honest I fell asleep about three quarters of the way through the film, out of sheer boredom, i think Knightley's famous line 'try wearing a corset' set me down for the night. I saw this film last year, and had expected a masterpiece since many people had such high praises for it. The storyline is mediocre, the acting of two of the key actors, Knightly and Bloom (sorry I don't know their characters names, there is a simple reason for this!) is very average. I can remember very little from the film, as it has mere substance. Unfortunately, I have to now deal with people having panic attacks over the release of the sequel..oh well.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Reminded me of Saturday AM matinees.,"I did not rush out and see this film.  I mean, it is based on a theme ride at Disneyland/World.  Ah, but that was my mistake.  I kept hearing good things about it and finally did see it.  I immediately found the sound track and also purchased the 2-disc DVD set when it was released. Johnny Depp has produced a masterful characterization in CAPT. Jack Sparrow, borrowing perhaps a bit from the barge gypsy in ""Chocolat"".But Depp truly hones and defines the swash and the buckle in Jack Sparrow. I realize the film was released in Summer 2003 to probably help build concessions at the Disney Parks, and the Caribbean, islands, ships, and pirates are perhaps more conducive to summer movie audiences. But perhaps a slightly later release date might have helped the film garner more Oscar nominations.  I regret that the music and the costumes have not been nominated.  I am pleased that the Academy did single out Johnny Depp for a Best Actor nomination.  I realize his chances of winning are as great a long shot as Seabiscuit's were in his career, but I, for one, hope Mr. Depp wins. Captain Jack has a thrilling physical introduction in the film and his energy just goes on and on.  He has a single purpose and he keeps to it, manipulating the winds, waves, and folk that come his way.  Beautifully written and acted.  It is not often that a choice role combines with a commercially successful film to push an actor up into star range, but Captain Jack Sparrow has certainly done this for Mr. Depp. Mr.Bloom, Mr. Rush and Ms. Knightley are good support. Quite a romp with great swordsmanship. A really good crew assembled.  ""Yo ho!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A below-average action comedy,"Having fond childhood memories of old pirate movies and stories, I was really looking forward to watch this one. I certainly didn't expect some brain challenging epic, but good entertainment. I was disappointed.Many things may be said of old, classic movies, but one thing is certain, they generally had good scripts. What has happened to good Hollywood scriptwriters? Don't they exist anymore or are they all working for TV at HBO? This film has a potentially good story and a completely pathetic script that results in a plot that most of the time makes no sense whatsoever, with bad dialogue lines, and awkward twists trying to disguise as ""complex turns"". Simple bad writing.At least they got someone witty to write Captain Jack Sparrow's lines. Without doubt, the one outstanding thing about this movie is Johny Deep's character and his rendition of it. It is very funny and thoroughly enjoyable. Depending how you look at it, Deep's performance is either wasted in this movie, or saves it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best action movie about Pirates in a long time!,"This film has everything - Action, Romance, Mystery and a little bit of Horror and History thrown in. This should be the film to give Johnny Depp the recognition and respect he deserves as one of our most talented actors around. Disney really made a winner this time - a definite Must See!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic Voyage!,"A true classic!  The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle.  He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead.  He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself.  The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez.  With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after.  Well, not exactly like that but almost.  This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film.  Rated PG-13, which is the number of times you should see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
wary of joining the bandwagon?,"Having been disappointed many times by big blockbuster movies that, er, don't really hit the spot, I anticipated PoTC to be another movie to enjoy a bit then forget. It was, after all, branded as a goody-goody Disney movie with a bunch of heartthrobs casted in it. Big deal. How much can an undead pirate ensemble hold our attention and keep us in our seats?Well.Directed by 'The Ring' man Verbinski, produced by big time Bruckheimer, scripted by the writers of Shrek, and casted with eccentrics like the long-lost Depp, PoTC was a project that called upon an unusual combination of dedicated adventurers and artists who unabashedly engineered the movie to the extreme, purely for the audience's enjoyment. I mean, Johnny Depp with real gold teeth and eyeliner, and Geoffrey Rush with a pesky monkey on his shoulder?And it's not just the big guys who did all the magic--watch out for those supporting characters and little details in the set that would keep you smiling.Oh. And, I'm not the only one who has been surprised--and impressed. PoTC garnered FIVE Oscar nominations today, including a Best Actor nomination for Depp's, shall we say, savvy performance that won't be easy to forget. Trust the Academy on this.And why was PoTC so great? Because the people behind the movie simply delivered their all, man. PoTC is romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and horror, all in one package, perfect for the cynical, the innocent, and those in between.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Johnny Depp is Awesome, Pirates is Not","Pirates of the Caribbean is a huge movie. However, quite a disappointment. Pirates starts off right. The first appearance of Jack sparrow is quite funny and effective. Johnny Depp is wonderful as Sparrow. His performance is top notch as the dubious and ragged pirate. The story is unconvincing. I truly never understood the curse at all.Pirates does have some excellent sword combat. We see one between Sparrow and Turner(Orlando bloom)does quite well. The dialog here is mostly lame. It would have been better with good dialog or if these two just fought without saying a word. Some later combat is just lame. Your opponent is a undead monster that can't be stopped by your sword. If the two were living, then the combat would be much more satisfying. The sword combat does suffer from being repetitive as well.Johnny Depp aside, the acting here is okay. Nothing breathtaking. Keira Knightly is great eye candy, but seems like wasted talent here. Orlando Bloom is not bad, just over-acts his role. Keep it simple kid. There are many others but the only other one worth mentioning is Geoffory Rush. He has one line in this movie that is just juicy. Every time I hear it, it just rules.The Special FX are amazing. Convoluted story aside, the skeletal pirates are dazzling to just look at. Never has the undead looked this good. Most of the comedy does not work well here. There are exceptions to that though. Example, Jack Sparrow, no matter the situation always gets annoyed when he is not referred to as ""Captian"". Another is The Black Pearl is getting damaged during a sea battle and during all the danger, Jack shouts out: ""Stop putting holes in my ship!"". Depp is good like I say.Pirates also suffers from overstaying it's welcome. It's just too long of a movie. Also, one sequence of scenes that should have been immediately sent to the cutting room floor are the scenes with the Govener dealing with a severed hand. Useless and plain annoying. I did not much care for the pirate with the fake eye either.The Last Word: Pirates, not a terrible movie is not engaging enough either. There are some high marks and lows. To many characters and a difficult story. Depp is the best. Jack Sparrow is very likable. Pirates just could have been a much better movie. **1/2/*****",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very funny and very cleverly done,"Every now and then a movie comes along that is nothing short of sheer FUN This is one of those movies Johnny Depp adds to his already impressive list of performances  the ""swishbuckling"" Captain Jack Sparrow Other people have said so many wonderful things so I won't need to add to them JUST SEE IT and prove me right",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie--Saw it twice,"This movie had it all:  Action, Romance, Humor, and Mystery.  It was good enough to go see it more than once, and I'd go again if you asked me to. Johnny Depp was hilarious, and I wanted to kiss all over his Pirate face. It was well directed, and certainly not slow moving.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie,"Pirates of the Caribbean was a Great Movie filled with action, adventure, humor, romance and suspense. My favorite character was Jack sparrow played by Johnny Depp. He was comic relief and made me laugh out loud. Of course, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) was also great as the romantic lead with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
High production values do not cancel out the mostly hollow affair,"This big budget swashbuckler reinstated Hollywood's interest in pirates, reaffirmed Johhny Depp as a bankable mainstream leading man, and refocused the industry with it's surprisingly high box office performance, followed by an even more surprising (though widely regarded as inferior) net gain from it's sequel. So why did I not have half the fun as I was anticipating with The Curse of the Black Pearl? Despite having all the key ingredients at making this rousing adventure come to life, Pirates still flounders with a repetitious script, an overkill of production, and of course the general disengaged, auto-piloted mentality that one immediately associates with any massive studio release. Yes, Depp's inspired take as the woozy captain Jack Sparrow does breathe some fresh air into the stale script, though his acting, more often then not, devolves into processed caricature rather then the engaged perceptiveness we are used to seeing from an accomplished actor such as Depp. Also, the casting of uber-talented Geoffry Rush did help break up much of the monotony the time-killing script wished to parlay. Ultimately though, these elevated Hollywood performances are buried under ten tons of sheen, smoke, and explosions that could only be appropriately titled ""The Bruckheimer effect"" which finds the mega- producer, as usual, filling in any actual emotional content with a barrage of over-excessive special effects and action sequencing. Shame too, because with Depp at the helm, and the few scenes that show off the inherent humor, personality and flavor this franchise could have offered, it became obvious that this could have been so much more memorable then the hollow ride it turns out to be. As far as popcorn family entertainment goes, I can justify the massive amount of success the movie has reaped, although to elevate this movie past the point of good, into the realm of great, as many reviewers have done, seems well overrated, as I mostly spent my two and a half hours waiting for the resolution in this lackluster plot.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
