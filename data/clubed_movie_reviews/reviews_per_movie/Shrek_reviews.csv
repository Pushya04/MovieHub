Groundbreaking.,"For younger viewers, they might not understand the impact of ""Shrek"" on the film industry and CGI movies. However, being an older guy, I remember how groundbreaking and amazing the computer animation was when the film debuted. It was head and shoulders better than the few CGI movies that had come out in the previous decade...and it finally gave Pixar a serious run for the money. In addition, the plot was very adult...and the film's appeal was much greater than a typical CGI story. Great animation, great story telling and great voice acting, while the movie isn't quite impressive to see today, it still holds up very well and is well worth your time.I could easily say more but this film has over a thousand reviews....so I'll just end it here!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Beautifully computer-animated fairy tale: a gentle morality play, very skillfully done.","I'm an old dude, 75 to be exact, and in my working days I was everything from a mainframe programmer to a HiTech startup Tech Admin. This sentence is here only to show why I am interested in the productions of Dreamworks and, of course, Pixar. Coming from a computer background permits me to be very, very impressed with the wonderful skill and creativity that go into making movies such as Shreck.Now then: The movie itself is marvelous! The characters are gentle and funny; there is no gratuitous violence; there are innuendos, of course, but skillfully done in a way that the ""libretto"" if you will can be ""read"" at least two levels. The story line itself is charming, and the ending is a real, nifty surprise!I add here that I've watched this with my younger G_Kids, who loved it; and also with my bride of fifty years, who loved it.It is in all ways in a class with the best that Mr. Jobs has so far produced, which is saying a great deal.HIGHLY recommended as good, funny, charming entertainment for a whole bunch of ages.Nick Fortis Los Altos California",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A timeless masterpiece,"A movie suitable for children, but really made for an adult audience. It's funny, has many quotable catchphrases and teaches us so much.

Left-field fairy tale left us rolling in the aisles,"9 OUT OF 10!!!! We went to catch the matinee preview of ""Shrek"". We were still giggling by the time we got home afterwards. Two hours later, we dragged a friend out and went back for the evening show. Some of the shock value was lost, but we caught a few of the background sight gags we missed the first time, and anticipation of some of the other scenes had us in tears before they even happened. Interesting to see the different audience reactions of different age groups, too. This is a *very* funny movie, but it should be noted that most of the kiddy humour is on the burp/fart and yucky dining habits level - Shrek is rather closely related to Raymond Briggs' Fungus the Bogeyman without the orange mohawk. The dialogue and main action quips are mainly aimed at adults and sophisticated kids. One little voice in the afternoon audience piping up ""WHAT's he compensating for?"" cracked me up...Be warned that this movie is a non-stop send-up of all things Disney. If predictability and saccharine is your cup of tea, you may not like it. On the other hand, if you are cynical about theme parks and like the idea of fairytale classics getting the Monty Python treatment, you'll love it. Every time a scene looks familiar, it means it is about to go pear-shaped. And it's not just old classics that get the treatment. I spotted (mis)quotes from films that are just being released, both Disney and non-Disney. You name it, it gets an affectionate pie in the face at some point in ""Shrek"".As a fairytale, however offbeat, ""Shrek"" is tighter plotted and better characterised than most Hollywood dross.The parodic twists, a love story subplot that owes more to Shakespeare's comedies than fairytale formula, and the ""ugly is the new beautiful"" Message more than make up for the derivativeness due to extensive quotation.As for the acting, confinement to voice-overs keeps the egos of Myers and Murphy in check, and they do a fantastic job as the big fat green smelly recluse and the obnoxiously manic donkey respectively. Diaz is great as a feisty princess who reminds me of Lloyd Alexander's Eilonwy crossed with Lara Croft. Lithgow's Farquaad is a wonderful Bad Guy, modelled on Olivier's Richard III apart from his Little Problem being different. And the Fairytale Creatures...excellent, all of them. The graphics, of course, are state of the art for at least another 2 weeks. We're talking freckles, skin pores and stubble, pupil dilation, and amazing light-and-shade. They had to tone down the realism of the humanoids to stop them looking creepily android-like.Highly recommended, except for overly precious schmalz addicts.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Brilliant humor!,"Shrek is completely new.  Never has a fully CGI movie taken on the twists, turns, and surprises as Shrek has.  It's a full parody of numerous fairytales, and its humor is, well, humor at its best.  Grown men will laugh at the jokes of Farquaad's Stature and the hidden meaning behind every little comment.  Of course Shrek, like all other movies, has its emotional moments (so what if I lied about it being completely new?).  And these moments aren't cheesy or anything.  They are kind of funny, but at the time of viewing you won't really feel like laughing.  You'll feel like the characters.Like its CGI, Shrek has taken a new dimension.  It stretches out.  You're in the movie.  No, wait, you're watching a movie.  It's so hard to tell.  The characters are so real, so lifelike, it makes you feel you're there.  The environments are realistic, yet still animated.  The wind whispers through the grasslands and the characters' hair; the lightning and clouds are really there... aren't they?I was stunned and absorbed in this movie.  And unlike other movies, it has more than just CGI.  It's actually got a plot.  And what a plot it's got! This one is totally new.  Shrek is ordered to rescue a princess from the fiery keep guarded by a dragon in order to clear out his swamp of the menacing fairytale creatures.But it doesn't stop there.  The movie is full of surprises and stretches on further into what actually happens after.  The dialogue demands your attention throughout the movie, and then the dragon comes in.  Whenever you see the dragon, you'll know good things are bound to happen (but not necessarily for the characters in the movie).  The dragon is a comic relief, but still provides most of the action in the movie.  She chases Donkey and Shrek through the keep, she flies to help rescue Fiona from a despicable marriage, and she even has the satisfaction of swallowing a midget.Now some disputes have arisen about certain things.  But I must say what I always say:  this is only a movie, and it has no deeper meaning (despite the parodies).  Take it as it is.  There can be nothing offensive from Shrek unless you have something against overthrowing tyrants and good-natured humor.I must take a moment to speak about Donkey.  He is, and always will be, one of my most favorite characters in the world of movies.  Eddie Murphy was, no doubt, the perfect actor for him.  He is so funny, so unique, and so... fluffy.  What a perfect donkey!  His design is flawless and his dialogue perfect.  I can find nothing bad about this character.Shrek is perfect for everybody to see.  The little ones will love the vivid colors and lush landscapes.  The adults will enjoy this as well as the intelligent humor and deep plot.  And no one could dislike the arrangement of songs.  They fit really nice into the movie.  Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell's composed music is impressive (especially the theme for Escape from the Dragon).Shrek is brilliant moviemaking.  With a groundbreaking DVD, an all-star cast, great music, excellent graphics, and a great parodized yet original plot and storyline, Shrek is no doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of Dreamworks' best!,"I did not get to see this in theaters though my family got the movie on DVD that fall and it was one of my first DVD movies. The cast was excellent, especially John Lithgow and Mike Myers and the visuals were stunning. Many parts of the movie were spoofs of old films and there were many laughs to be heard. Cameron Diaz as the princess was good too, though she's hardly a damsel in distress. Which works nicely considering her abilities (which I won't say here). Some good songs and even a cameo by Disney cartoon veteran Jim Cummings. The CGI was good and very meticulously done. It could give Toy Story some good competition. The sequels were decent, but I prefer the first one. There's even music by Smash Mouth and many fairy tale creatures and characters.Bottom line: if you're tired of usual and cliched fairy tales and want a strong female lead, this is your movie. See it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

What a classic!,"Once upon a time - not too long ago - a writer had an idea to write a fairy tale made up of various fairy tale characters. And thus, a franchise was born.You can't help but love 'Shrek' - the character and the film. Shrek is one of the most unconventional yet most lovable characters seen in an animated film in a while. His sidekick, Donkey, almost steals the show thanks to his witty dialogue and FANTASTIC voicing by Eddie Murphy. He's just adorable!Together, they embark on a dangerous and exciting journey to save a princess, but for very different reasons you might think. They have absolutely no interest in the princess whatsoever - or, at least, that's what Shrek thought...'Shrek' is a delightful and very funny action adventure film, with several underlying messages. Children will adore the film for its characters and funny moments, while the film will also appeal to a mature audience on a deeper level, which children wont really understand.This is a very clever, excellently executed script. The inclusion of the song 'Hallelujah' was just awesome, and very appropriate. And what a beautiful ending - the stuff fairy tales are made of!! I love it!'Shrek' was a huge box office sensation, earning $506 million on a $60 million budget. It also raked in 99 award nominations, winning 39, including an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. This is a classic!Would I watch it again? Absolutely.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Did I miss something in viewing Shrek,"There was little to no story, and what was presented as a story in the advertisements was done away with at the very begining of the film, I doubt that Shrek will hold this high of a rating for a long time (look how fast it took Phantom Menace to fall down the charts).In terms of animation it looked nice, but sheesh this movie was just another excuse to take cheap shots at Disney, and while most Disney animated films have morals, there was no redeeming value in this movie at all. The moral of the story was what? its okay to be ugly just not short?The characters were all pretty much annoying, and at the end of the movie which was where the Princess transforms its pretty predictable as I was thinking to myself as the smoke covered her body (okay so she's gonna change into a Ogre I'm wayy Ahead of you guys) its a direct cop out of a the Beauty and the Beast story we all know. I think it would have been a heck of alot better had she transformed into her female human self, and fell in love with the Ogre, at least that way it would have presented a message.Only message I found here is Peter Kratzenberg hates disney and well he can SUCK MY tape of Toy Story a film that still exceeds every 3d animated film ever made.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"""Do you know... the muffin man?""","The Simpsons has been one of my favorite TV shows, and for the same reason that I like the Simpsons is what makes Shrek so good. The Simpsons takes the children-only medium of cartoons and makes an adult show out of it, with jokes in it that only adults will find amusing, some for adult eyes' only. Shrek is animation, a beautiful computer animation that looks realistic and bold, has enough kiddy humor in it to make the kids like it, but has even more jokes that adults will love. It's the cross between childhood innocence and adult knowledge that brings Shrek so many laughs. Mike Myers supplies the voice of Shrek, an ogre who enjoys living by himself in his swamp on the outskirt of Duloc, a near-perfect kingdom ran by the insecure Lord Farquaad, voice with wonderful swarmy-ness by John Lithgow. When Farquaad begins to deposit all of the mythical creatures that populate his kingdom into Shrek's swamp, Shrek demands to see the king, and only the smart-ass Donkey knows the way. Donkey is a sassy talking, well, donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy and is the Lou Costello to Shrek's Bud Abbot--to say Shrek is the straight man in this odd couple is an understatement. After meeting the king, Shrek and Donkey then have a quest of finding Fraquaad Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), an imprisoned lady guarded by a dragon. I personally would have gone with Snow White, but to each their own. What also sets Shrek apart from other animated movies is the music, mostly rock music, mostly from Smashmouth. I do not think a Disney picture would have made the same selections. It gives it a different feel from the usual animated fare, Shrek for sure has it's own identity. Getting back to the animation, the computer generated scenery and characters are great to look at, very lifelike, even the human beings. Pixar, who has made films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, has made it clear that human beings are the most difficult objects to animate on computers, but I think DreamWorks got it right in Shrek--there is nothing there that makes me say ""that does not look right."" There are great in-jokes about the world of childhood stories, while sprinkling in some very adult humor. The best sight gags for me revolve around Farquaad interrogating a gingerbread man and threatening a magic mirror. Shrek will entertain and amuse the young and old alike.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

State-of-the-art computer animation used to tell a cracking little story,"Shrek is a green ogre who lives in a swamp, but his king sends him on a mission which he must complete to get his own land back.You only have to watch ten minutes of this film to realise that this is going to be a classic. Eddie Murphy being employed as a wisecracking donkey was a casting dream and plays well against the more plain Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers.Ok the plot is old, new, borrowed and blue (all recaps and references to fairy tales), but I don't care. It is all so much good fun and better than that, the kind of thing that can be enjoyed by young and old, male or female. It is really a dream of movie and some brilliant pop tunes are employed that really work fantastically against the images. Real tear-to-the-eye stuff.A real bliss-out of a movie and all parties should be congratulated for making it so great. A real DVD buyer, because it can be enjoyed over and over again. Bring on the follow up, I can't wait.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Wicked,"Shrek is one hell of an animated ride, and right when you're certain you know where to expect the next gag it one ups you. If you need a reason to see Shrek, here is that reason: imagine Eddie Murphy as an annoying not to mention obnoxious talking donkey. Yeah. Eddie Murphy gives Robin Williams a serious run for his money in terms of greatest animated side kick. From there we get Mike Myers voicing a big green ogre, who plays off Eddie Murphy with perfect comedic timing like the two were meant to do this film together.Shrek is merciless in its humor. Targeting everything from fairy tales to Disney films to narrative clichés to bad puns, sliding in its own commentary, all the while giving the typical fantasy story a few modern twists and turns to deliver a strangely original unoriginal story with original unoriginal characters . . . that doesn't make sense, but Shrek does, does it well, and doesn't care. And you never know where this humor is going to come from, either  either visual gag, musical nod, or spoken dialogue. All three provide their share of narrative and commentary to the concepts in Shrek.I think the beauty of Shrek is it's taken the typical fairy tale (which all of us have heard), and it answers the silly 'what if . . .' and 'why don't they ever . . .' questions we tend to ask. But that's not the core of the story - the core of this story is the friendship between Shrek and Donkey, which works in a funny goofball, but touching and unique way. If the audience can buy into Shrek and Donkey's relationship to one another, then they can believe entire film (which more or less focuses on the adventure the two share together). True, Shrek has a love theme . . . but it's Donkey and Shrek who sustain the film through most of the picture.As for Cameran Diaz and John Lithgow, while not on screen as much as our two heroes, still play an important role. I wouldn't want to downplay Lithgow and Diaz who do bring their respective characters to life, but Shrek is a tale about an enduring friendship with a romance story on the side.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Green Power,"""Shrek"" is fun. People who haven't seen this movie, and are wary of seeing what's popular, should give it a try. It's worth watching, and will probably win you over.Taking a Fractured Fairy Tale approach to a ""Beauty And The Beast""-type plot, throwing in a few mild profanities, flatulence jokes, and Michael Myers' over-the-top faux-Scots accent, ""Shrek"" shows off a very snarky humor, full of jokes that will likely go over the heads of a cartoon's target audience while registering with their parents. 'Sure it's big enough, but look at the location,' Shrek observes upon seeing a giant castle in the middle of nowhere. The kids, though, will love 'Shrek' every bit as much. It's impossible not to be carried along by its merry madness.Myers, as the title character, is certainly easier to take than he was in his last Austin Powers movie, his voice work registering real tenderness as well as the expected laughs as a misunderstood ogre who would rather tell a group of frightened villagers about the cruelties he will inflict on them and their dead bodies than cause those villagers any genuine harm. He's a bit of a softie, actually, and scared to let anyone know it.Cameron Diaz is as beautiful to listen to hear as she is to look at in her other films. Her character, Princess Fiona, doesn't have as much room to shine as Shrek (the balance turns out better in the sequel) but she does well with what she's given.The comic highpoints in terms of voice characterization is Eddie Murphy as Shrek's donkey companion and John Lithgow as nasty Lord Farquaad, who wants to rid his domain of Duloc of all fairy tale creatures. Murphy never stops being funny even as he helps set up key plot moments; in fact he's never been this funny since the first ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movie. ""We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles,"" the donkey tells a much put-upon Shrek, and you still laugh the fifth time you hear it. Lithgow just makes you smile whenever he opens his mouth, like when he grills a hapless gingerbread man in such a convoluted way it turns into a nursery-rhyme recitation.Why exactly Farquaad is grilling this gingerbread man so closely isn't clear, and there are similar plot holes throughout the movie. Shrek may be too tame a character; we never really feel any worry around him. The donkey falls into a relationship with a dragon that screams ""plot convenience,"" and there are strange little bits of cruelty, like turning a frog and snake into balloons, which just is thrown out there and let be.But the central story, about how Shrek and Fiona struggle to overcome the odds and find true love, is really sweet and well-rendered. The animation is spectacular, a revolution for the eyes in its deep-dish panoramas and remarkable attention to textures. And the jokes keep flying, the major ones as well as hilarious bits of filigree you won't notice the first or second time but reward you for paying attention.This is not a Disney movie, something ""Shrek"" makes very clear not only with its PG-13 humor but its knocks at Disney characters like Snow White and at the Magic Kingdom in the form of Duloc, where an array of ""It's A Small World""-type dolls lecture Shrek and Donkey on all the things NOT to do. Frankly, ""Shrek"" could use a little injection of Disney heart, but Disney could use some of this picture's freshness as well. A very charming movie worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Has hidden messages,"Shrek has hidden messages that will likely sail right over the heads of its target audience. The resettlement of the fairly tale creatures in the villainous Farquaad's (ruthless and cruel Anglo-Saxon) kingdom is an allusion to the resettlement of Jews in ghettos carried out by many European principalities during the Middle Ages (at the time of Martin Luther, I think they were expelled from England, France and Spain but tolerated, with restrictions, in some German city states). The filmmakers seem to be suggesting that just as Farquaad did not appreciate the fairy tale creatures and their magical and unique abilities and may have in fact been afraid of them, so, too, were Europeans afraid of Jews and their foreign culture and thus unjustly persecuted them. Apparently, all for no good reason. Shrek, the ogre, of course, represents how the African would have been received in medieval European society. He is feared and misunderstood as a stupid, grotesque, and violent menace. Of course, we are shown that in his private moments, he is anything but these undesirable qualities and his moral fibre transcends his physical ugliness. The fact that the fair princess Fiona is revealed to really be an ogress is to confirm that well worn cliché that we are all the same inside. In a classic fairy tale, which Shrek is the antithesis of, written by someone like Hans Christian Anderson for instance, Farquaad would be the hero, Shrek the villain, and Fiona would indeed be the fairest maiden in all the land.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Funny is one word for it,"The movie Shrek created in 2001 was definitely one of dream works more eye opening children's films. It is filled with hilarious components for children but also there are some more adult jokes snuck in. I am not sure I am the only one that noticed this but when Lord Farquad tells the mirror to show him a picture of Fiona again, while laying shirtless in bed. He lifts the blanket and casually looks under it. This seems to suggest something is happening in this scene. If you know what I mean.
It has all the parts for an inclusive movie. And the surprising part of the story line that has to do with Fiona is most certainly unexpected and makes the story most not ordinary. When watching this keep in mind that this is not a normal fairy tale.
On the more negative side of things was how the story moved. Throughout the movie everything is very fast pace. The story just being set up, has far too many unnecessary components. This makes the time spent on the more important parts of the story shortened and rushed. And frankly it makes it a little repetitive since it's just one extravagant part of the journey after another. It's almost exhausting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Safe Jokes, a Regurgitated Plot and Loads of Really, Really Bad CG","In this slightly off-kilter fantasy comedy yarn, Mike Myers plays the title character: a grumpy, antisocial green ogre who's unwillingly nominated (along with an obnoxious talking mule) to rescue a princess and thus bestow royalty upon a conniving small-time noble. Shockingly, on the road back to town, our little troupe of misfits discovers the true value of love and friendship and judging books by their covers and all that. Terribly formulaic and predictable material, but at least the film's love of skewed nursery rhymes and a dynamic cast of vocal talent provides some spice. Myers breaks out his famous Scottish accent in the lead role, familiar to anyone who may have caught him as the cantankerous father in So I Married an Axe Murderer or Fat Bastard in the Austin Powers films, and delivers his usual blend of tame, family-friendly laughs and heart-on-sleeve sentimentality. Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow provide varying degrees of support beneath his extra-sized performance.Although it generally looks and acts like a clumsy student film, maybe an exercise to work out the kinks of its now-prehistoric animation software, Shrek is actually the second fully-CG movie released by DreamWorks Animation. What lessons they learned with 1998's Antz, I can't imagine, because surely this must've represented some kind of step forward and it looks reeaaallly bad. For such a visual-driven genre, that's a backbreaker. The voice actors do generally good work, Murphy and Myers especially, but not enough to overcome such a stiff, boring aesthetic and an unremarkable plot. Did this become a meme because so many internet trolls grew up with it, or because it's so painfully inept? Maybe a little of both?",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Shrek is a delight for all ages!,"Shrek is a movie like no other.  It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line.  Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is ""She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy.""  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp ""farting,"" that amuses children.  The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations.

I loved the background images, the schtick that Shrek does because he is an ogre and as gross as they come. But it went by so fast. Since I saw a stage version of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, I have thoroughly enjoyed films and plays that have a bunch of significant action going on around the characters that are currently being focused on. The ""real"" plot, so to speak. The fairy tale world that is the setting of this animated joy, is what I really want to see. These characters, who are parts of lots of little stories, go about their daily business, running from big bad wolves or being left to follow bread crumbs. Meanwhile Shrek, being a kind ogre, must put up with the constant pleas of the fairy tale populace, who make nuisances of themselves.Eddie Murphy's donkey, of course, is the most soul testing of them all with his excessive verbiage and quick wit.

really good,"its a excellent film with great comedy. donkey is the best. I think Shrek is really great for different ages. Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy-comedy film directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their directorial debut. It features the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow.. It is loosely based on William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book Shrek!, and somewhat serves as a parody film, targeting other films adapted from numerous children's fantasies (mainly animated Disney films). The film's soundtrack includes music by Smash Mouth, Eels, Joan Jett, The Proclaimers, Jason Wade, Baha Men, and John Cale (covering Leonard Cohen).The film grossed $484.4 million at the worldwide box office, and an estimated 47 million tickets were sold in the US. Shrek also received promotion from food chains such as Baskin-Robbins (promoting the film's DVD release) and Burger King. It was acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humour to appeal to children. Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was also nominated for six British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy for his voice-over performance as Donkey, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's main (and title) character was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"With subtle and funny writing along with likeable characters, Shrek has aged very well after 20 years","A grumpy ogre who lives alone in his swamp finds out that a mean lord has exiled dozens of fairytale creatures to his swamp. In order to get them out of there, he must make a deal with the lord to rescue a princess in the highest room of the tallest tower guarded by a fire breathing dragon. Aided by a fast-talking donkey, the two set off on a quest and get his swamp back in time.I remember seeing this movie when it was on video and I enjoyed every moment of it. 20 years later, it has aged very well. The characters are likeable especially Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona (who all share some great chemistry together) while Lord Farquaad makes for a very good villain. Yes the story does have the misunderstanding cliche we've seen in dozens of movies, but it does something unique like giving some depth to Fiona and the reason to her ugly form. Shrek also gets some character depth as the film explains the reason why the ogre is feared by many people. Not to mention that it does a subtle job in it's satire of fairytales with some of the most hilarious moments. The voice work is great especially with Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow, the animation is superb especially the look of Shrek's swamp, the dragon's keep, Lord Farquaad's castle, etc., and the music score from both John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams is both haunting and magical.Overall, Shrek still holds up after 20 long years.

A Delightful Fairy Tale,"Shrek (2001, Dir.

With a very loud donkey by his side, Shrek sets out to 'persuade' Farquaad to give his swamp back. Instead a deal is made. Farquaad, who wants to become the King, sends Shrek to rescue Princess Fiona, who is waiting for her one true love. But once they head back Fiona, it starts to become apparent that not only do Shrek like Fiona, but Fiona is keeping something secret.What the you call this movie 'Shrek'? Is it a spoof? Is it Homage? Well, whatever is it, it's very enjoyable. Everything about the film seems perfectly crafted. The film has a large number of songs, which have been carefully chosen and suit the atmosphere at that point. The story is cleverly well written and the characters are enjoyable. The right voice talents have been brought together with a cast of characters which can really be stretched out. It's the animation which really brings his film to life though. In 2001, the animation was very impressive and still looks a treat. It doesn't look too fake and doesn't try to make it too realistic. There is so much detail in the picture which shows that the animators really spent hours working on it. 'Shrek' will last for a long time with generations of families enjoying this soon to be classic.""Chicks love that romantic crap."" - Donkey (Eddie Murphy)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Wonderfully irreverent family film with lots of laughs,"The filmmakers obviously have some irreverence regarding Disney, and it's about time I say. Especially with the rather un-Disneylike behavior the studio has engaged in for the past dozen or so years. The anti Disney jokes are so much fun (our favorite is the ""small world"" parody!). I have to wonder what DULOC means! I have listened to the commentary on the DVD, done Google searches, looked through the trivia on IMDb, all to no avail. I wonder what the big secret is. Anyway, this is a family favorite of ours. The jokes may go over the heads of small children, but they will still enjoy the animation. The music is fantastic. My teenager even bought the soundtrack to it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Original and funny: delightful for kids and adults alike!,"I liked the incidental music very much, especially in the escape from the Dragon scene. I wasn't hugely fond of the pop music featured, but putting that minor quibble aside, this was still an original and funny animated film, that will please any animation lover. The animation is faultless, never stiff, and lovely backgrounds. The script is laugh-out-loud funny with the fairytale characters, Gingerbread Man especially, and Robin Hood. The characters are definitely memorable, and the terrific voice cast brings the film to life. Mike Myers voices the ogre with feeling, but it is Eddie Murphy who steals the film. Though Cameron Diaz is lovely as Fiona, and John Lithgow is delightfully villainous as Lord Farquad, though his villain isn't the most memorable villain ever in an animation. The film sparkles with heart and humour, it is impossible not to like it. In conclusion, look out for it, you'll be glad you did! 9/10 Bethany Cox.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Super fun family movie,"Shrek (Mike Myers) is a green ogre happily living alone. Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has rounded up all of the kingdom's magical creatures into Shrek's swamp. Shrek wants his isolation back. It doesn't help that he is now followed by the talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Farquaad wants to have Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so that he could be a proper king. So Farquaad strikes a deal with Shrek. If Shrek rescues Fiona, Farquaad will return Shrek his swamp.This is simply a super fun family movie. Shrek is an unconventional hero, and Fiona is an unconventional damsel in distress. It turns some of the superficial aspects of fairy tales on its head without straying from the emotional truths. In the end, they are all about finding true love. And this movie is a reminder of a funny Eddie Murphy that is too often missing in his recent movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The story of an Ogre, a Princess and a Donkey","Everything about 'Shrek' has probably already been said but here's my little comment. 'Shrek' is definitely one of the most enjoyable flicks. There has been tremendous work put in the animation process. Yet, the makers haven't given the screenplay any less considerations and we are told a heartwarming but relevant story. Though the characters of Shrek, Fiona and Donkey are original (maybe Donkey is from the Musicians of Bremen?), we also meet various fairy tale characters spoofed into the screenplay providing us several hilarious moments.Among the voice talents, Eddie Murphy steals the show with his loud, expressive and vivacious voice. He also gets the best lines. No wonder Donkey remains the favorite character. Mike Myers is adequate. However, he doesn't seem to get the accent right all the time. Cameron Diaz is good and John Lithgow does his part very well.I consider the soundtrack a must-buy. It boasts of a compilation of famous song that fairly contribute to the screenplay as background score. The writers deserve more credit for providing those memorable hilarious moments such as Fiona singing with the bird, Donkey and Dragon's affair, the snake and frog balloons and numerous other sketches.However, on the downside, there are a few plot holes e.g. Dragon's attraction towards Donkey isn't explained and why does Lord Farquaad torture the Gingerbread man? How would the Gingerbread man know about the others? Yet, the main plot of Fiona and Shrek mostly makes up for this flaw.Without any doubt, 'Shrek' is one of the best family flicks of recent time. Kids will love the colours and the fairy tale characters and grown-ups will love the witty dialogues and intelligent humour and most would love the story.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Good quality entertainment.,"I'm not one of those persons who praises ""Shrek"" all the time as one of the greatest movies ever made, like many other persons seem to do. Quite frankly I never really understood what the hype was all about. But still you have to give credit to this movie, it's very entertaining and fun to watch over and over again.A good sidekick is always important, especially in an animated movie. A good sidekick can make the movie better but a bad sidekick can really ruin a movie. ""Shrek"" doesn't have a good sidekick...it has an excellent sidekick! Donkey is a wonderful and entertaining character thanks to Eddie Murphy who voiced him. The other main voices are provided by Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow.Further more I would like to add that I absolutely love the character Pinocchio in this movie.The story is told in a good way with a nice pace, I especially like how subtle some Disney movies and characters are spoofed. But for some reason I never really found the story in general that very appealing.The movie is well animated and it shows that DreamWorks is a worthy competitor for Pixar.The music is good and takes the movie to an higher level and I'm not just talking about the evergreen songs but also about the movie soundtrack by John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams who know how to compose a good and fun score for animated movies.Although it's getting more credit than it really deserves, it's still a fun and entertaining animated movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Funny anti-Disney...,"1st watched 2/27/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Andrew Adamson & Vicky Jenson): Funny anti-Disney, anti-cute fairy tale, computer animated, ugly ogre wins all story.  This starts out from the beginning as a big slap in the face to the usual Disney princess gets rescued by the handsome prince charming with many references to that other animation studio throughout.  And Dreamworks truly has gone another direction by adding some adult humor, cursing, and even sex references to it's recent movies like this and the well-made but overlooked Antz.  It's still ok for kids, but also bearable for adults and that's where I think they have really got something different in the way of animation.  There is also a lot of great music whether it's a remake or a new tune(for the most part not sung by the characters but a background to the story.)  All in all this movie is a pretty fun way to spend an hour and a half with a pretty basic story but humorous and entertaining throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Wonderful movie,"I've watched this movie several times now and one thing I can say is that it is wonderful.  The voice casting was well done, the comedic timing nearly perfect, and the animation wonderful.  This movie had me laughing almost all the way through it.  Who says you can't poke a little fun at the established fairy tales and get away with it?  This definitely does and has some good lessons that do NOT come away as preaching.  On the pywrit scale of 1-10, this one gets an 8.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The greatest fairy tale never told.,"Shrek is an awesome movie! Based in the ordinary fairy tales,the main thing here is to break the rules and the enchantment of those stories and show it all in a different way; Why the prince needs to be so perfect? Why the princess needs to be so beautiful?Why they need to live in a perfect castle?Why can't the royals be problematic? All of these answers are more than answered in Shrek. By the way, this is a movie with lots of humor. :)So, be prepare to laugh. (Donkey is annoying, but the biggest part of the fun comes from him!)Ps: All the cast is great as well. I already know Eddie Murphy's and Mike's(Myers)abilities as comedians,but I could never imagine that Cameron Diaz could be so perfect to do Fiona! Her voice is really cute, and I really cannot imagine a better one for Fiona ,than Cameron Diaz 's voice!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Funny, but not as witty as expected","I heard since this movie came out on how funny this movie was with its adult themed humor, but I avoided it because it is from the same people that brought out Antz.  I finally gave in and saw it.  This movie is funny with some laughs, it also had a good story about inner and outer beauty.  The characters and voiceovers by Mike Myers and Eddy Murphy were hilarious. Even the ending gave a bittersweet ending instead of the usually happy one.But I did not find it clever or witty enough with the pop culture references.  It seems many were just reference for the sake of it instead of taking a sharp jab.  As for many of the Disney characters, too many were just there again, for the sake of it with their few seconds of screen time to do its thing so that we know who they are.  It is not that they didn't do anything with them, it is just that some were quite duds.  They could have done something smarter or a lot more hilarious with pop culture references and Disney characters, but they did not.The concept of inner beauty did not quite gist either, since the portrayl of King Farquaad as a short person signifies somehow his stature is what is lacking and he somehow has to compensate for it.The film tries to attract young audience by gross humor instead of wholesome characters like the do in Disney animations.  In doing so, it probably took a shortcut in the developing of the story.  The building up of the relationship between Shrek and the princess involves her showing she is not a prissy by burping in front of him.To sum it up, it is a funny movie with some heartwarming central story. Good for the teenage crowd, and decent for the adults.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"""A talking donkey? That's the easy part, getting him to shut up is what's hard."" (Shrek)","""Shrek"" is a great little fun movie, with sharp,eye-popping computer animation and a knock-out Dolby Digital surround sound track. We have watched it a number of times since 2001.It is a story of a kind-hearted Ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) who just wants to be left alone in his swamp. A very animated talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) just wants to be friends with Shrek. Throw in a princess (voiced by Cameron Diaz) and a would-be king (voiced by John Lithgow) and the film takes fun to a new level. In what amounts to a very scrambled collection of famous cartoon characters (Three Pigs, Big Bad Wolf, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, etc) and techniques borrowed from movies like ""Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger"", the animation shows slow motion, martial artist suspended in air for a moment, etc.The script has a few slow parts, but overall is excellent, and we found ourselves either snickering or laughing out loud often. The film even has ""message"" with the creative ending, but 95% of it is just good, funny stuff. Many of the ""jokes"" will be missed by some of the younger generation, and on first viewing even many of the older crowd will miss some of the subtle references.Disk one of this 2-disk set has the movie plus a very interesting ""making-of"" special. Disk 2 has more stuff that I will get around to seeing one cold, rainy winter day. In my personal rating system, an animated film can get no higher than a ""9"" of 10. I rate ""Shrek"" a solid ""8"", which for me puts it in the same category as ""Toy Story 2"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Chicken Run"", and ""Monsters, Inc."" All of them are marvelous, fun movies that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Shrek: A rock and a hard place,"I'm not sure where I stand on this particular film. I am not a fan of Mike Myers particular brand of humour. That said I did enjoy Wayne's World. But I was younger then. Also I find Eddie Murphy particularly annoying. I guess that's why he was cast here. Leslee Feldman did a good job of putting him in the Donkey role.I do have a lot of respect for the artistry and work that goes in to all cartoons. It's a fantastic medium for story telling as the only real boundaries for expression are the animator's imagination. And this is no exception, despite my dislike for the cast I have to say the story telling and characterisation are both very, very, good, exceptional in fact.The crux of what I dislike is, conversely also what I like in it, that is the way it makes me feel. I am very much Shrek. I'm not a big green ogre though I do refer to my home as The Swamp, but that's more of a MASH reference. Like Shrek I have layers. I build walls, I push people away, especially if they look and sound like Eddie Murphy. No only kidding I liked Beverly Hills cop, so he's not all bad. Sorry I came over all Ben Elton there and digressed some what... Like Shrek I too am rather insecure and don't like the way watching myself in Shrek makes me feel. And it is that emotive stirring that makes Shrek a truly good and powerful film. There aren't many movies that reach me on an, well loathed as I am to say it, an emotional level.Freud could have an answer here. From an early age I was taught by my mother that cartoons, and especially Disney and anything Spielberg ever had anything to do with, were bad. Because and I quote: ""They have happy endings, and that's not how life is."" She was never a believer in false hope. Expect the worst and you'll never be disappointed I think is her ethos. Perhaps that's what makes me the cold hearted cynic I am today.Much as I'm loathed to admit it Shrek is a good film, despite the happy ending.

The brilliant film that launched eight thousand crappy wannabes,"Shrek really was one of the greatest and worst things to ever happen for animated kids' movies. While about eight thousand films tried to replicate it in the years to come of the early aughts which may have created cynicism and reactionary fatigue directed toward the Shrek franchise as a whole, it cannot be overstated how revolutionary of a product the original Shrek movie was. Revisiting it some 20 years later, the first two thirds are a hilarious and scathing parody of the Disney animated films of the '90s. I applaud Dreamworks for creating such a well-crafted parody that I understood perfectly as an adult (how did anyone hear the name ""Lord Farquaad"" and think this was a film for kids?).That being said-even if you don't understand the historical context it was released in and have intimate knowledge of the films it parodies-Shrek is a compelling narrative in its own right. While I do think in the last third of the film it sort of becomes the kind of film it seeks to parody, there is no denying the movie created a compelling set of characters and emotional beats able to stand toe-to-toe with the best of Disney. I don't really love gross out humor all that much (never loved it as a kid, either), but Shrek is a fun movie. Solid 7/10 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Over all, I think it lived up to it's hype","I don't know if we could live in this world right now if you have not seen Shrek. I wasn't sure if I'd make it, because at the time that Shrek came out, I refused to see it. I wasn't into the computer animation, so I refused to see it, not to mention all the hype annoyed me. You know when a movie is over advertised, and sometimes that drives you more away than closer? That was my situation, but I'm glad I finally decided to give Shrek a chance.Shrek is an ogre who is feared by all the town people and prefers living his life solo, but when a annoying talking Donkey drops into his life, Donkey just kinda puts himself into Shrek's life. But when a circus drops onto Shrek's swampy home, he goes to the king, the king promises him his home back if he can go get Princess Fiona, his future bride. Shrek and Donkey do so, but Shrek ends up falling for the beautiful princess, but she has some hidden secrets of her own that just might help their love for each other.I'd have to say that I really did enjoy Shrek, it was a very sweet story with some funny jokes and terrific animation. I loved the homages to certain pop culture moments, like the Matrix, as much as it's over used joke wise, it really worked for the film and for kids who were a little too young when the Matrix came out. It's a great family film and I'd recommend it very much.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best Movie of All-time,"The Holy Grail of cinema. Shrek teaches everyone that ogres are like onions-not because they smell-but because they've got layers.

A Dream World by DreamWorks,"Shrek is a sprawling surge into fairytale archetypes and stereotypes  the ogre, the noble steed, the damsel in distress, the evil lord, a fire-breathing dragon, Pinnochio, the three little pigs, the medieval tournaments and the festering forest swamp  it indulges and loses itself in the fun of these staples and it makes no pretense about it. The creators at DreamWorks Studios brush up on an old fairytale premise of a hero saving the damsel in distress from the dragon's keep with intelligent, deft strokes. The result is a meticulously animated, hilarious, heartwarming fluff of a film.The film's most prominent weapon in its arsenal is humour that takes the form of biting, comical, and even brilliant satire. Nearly every scene is peppered with pop-culture references, spoofs and homages  as has become DreamWorks' trademark of sorts  yet not quite as many of them as in Shrek II. Although it is an evenly enjoyable experience, a handful of scenes truly jump out and grab you. The brilliant rapport between the Gingerbread Man ""Gingie"" and the evil Lord Farquaad (voiced by funnyman John Lithgow) makes itself known at the beginning of the film in the interrogation room. The morbid lord has torn off Gingie's legs and is now toying with them: ""Run, run, run as fast as you can. You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!"", his wicked veneer transforming into a twisted, sadistic smile, to which Gingie boldly exclaims: ""Eat me!""Shrek, Donkey and Fiona are nevertheless the most thoroughly likable characters and they are given the most screen time in the film. The two former are an unlikely pair: an anti-social, misunderstood green ogre and a clingy, annoying, talking donkey. They reluctantly set out to accomplish a mission for Lord Farquaad  to bring home princess Fiona  but end up with more than they bargained for. It is this genius triumvirate of animated persons that take the front row in DreamWorks' Shrek; they are its goldmine, its heart, its soul and its most blatant source of comedy. It is however easy to see how the film's glorious, meticulous and aesthetically intoxicating setting could overshadow even its protagonist Shrek, yet this aspect is always firmly placed in the backseat of the story. Substance over style, in other words, but rest assured that animated visuals will not get much more striking than this.I am in fact pressed to find an aspect of the film that was noticeably sub-par. Everything truly is wonderfully created. From the crisp animation to the YMCA/Michael Flatley/Robin Hood spoofs to the rapid-fire pop-culture references to the deadpan deliveries to heartfelt story, all is well-sewn together in the story. Even the mandatory sing-and-dancer number at the end purposely avoids a cheesy approach (unlike Shrek II). I suppose, if anything  it is somewhat heavy on the 'message & moral' side of things and toward the end it often tips over into corny lessons.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Shrek is not just another Fairy Tale,"Shrek is an animated film that is original, funny and has an upbeat soundtrack.  The main characters are an Ogre named Shrek and a talking donkey.  Shrek (Mike Meyers) and his uninvited sidekick, donkey (Eddie Murphy) set out to rescue a princess. The princess has been locked in a castle which is guarded by a fire eating dragon.  Shrek was sent on this mission by Lord Farquaad, a very short and evil man.  Lord Farquaad is determined to become king and chose this beautiful princess to marry to achieve his goal.  Shrek agrees to rescue the princess to get his land back from the evil Lord Farquaad.  Donkey tags along because he has nowhere else to go.   Donkey has an unlikely love interest, which will play a major role at the end of the movie. Shrek holds our attention even if the plot sounds old.  Once the princess is rescued, the movie plot changes from a standard fairy tale to a whole new idea.  On the way back to Lord Farquaad's castle, donkey discovers an unsettling secret about the princess and promises not to tell.  Of course, the princess falls in love with Shrek, but that is not the secret. The princess's secret is the moral of the story and makes a good ending.Shrek is an enjoyable movie.  It has adult humor, but don't worry, young kids will not understand it.  The one liners are very funny.  The music is great.  The characters are unique and fun to watch.    Don't leave the movie before the credits roll, the fairy tale characters do an excellent version of an old Monkee's song.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Watched this again today - it's still fantastic!,"I saw this movie when it originally came out at the cinema, and I thought it was one of the best animated movies ever done - a great comedy too.Anyway, I have not seen Shrek 2 yet, but since my mother has decided she wants to see it too we watched the first Shrek today, as she had never seen that particular film.It is probably one of the funniest movies I have seen in the last 5 years or so - animated or live action. The humour appeals on so many levels - the kids watching get all the fairy tale jokes and so do the adults, and then there are a lot of one liners, especially from Eddie Murphy's Donkey character and from Mike Myers as Shrek, which only the adults in the audience truly get.And the story is really good too - there is a moral point in there that all the kids I know really got, and one boy (who is facially disfigured himself), said it was nice to see that even though she an ogre still at the end, Shrek loved her anyway and still thought she was beautiful - if only life was like that all the time!Shrek is a film that both adults and children will want to watch over and over again and it deserves to have made the millions it did for all involved.I rated this film as a 10 because it is a great movie, if I gave it less that would be saying there was something slightly wrong with it, but really I couldn't fault it.A great movie experience for all the family!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Hypocritical ""Shrek"" is too caught up in its own arrogance to be thoroughly entertaining fare","I've never been a fan of computer-generated films (i.e. the Toy Story series), because, to put it bluntly, it lacks any semblance of soul, as opposed to traditional hand-drawn or stop-motion animation.Then again, I may be biased; I saw ""Chicken Run,"" one of the best animated films ever made, 31 times in the theater and it was worth every cent.Still, there's a difference between the painstaking, repetitive process of drawing frames or moving stop-motion puppets in such minute increments and instead just sitting and clicking a mouse, letting the computer do 99% of the work.No matter how you look at it, though, what really matters in the end is the color green. Both movies turned huge profits for DreamWorks, grossing over $350 million combined in the U.S. and making Jeff Katzenberg look pretty darned smart for bidding adieu to Disney years ago.But, in this reviewer's opinion, ""Shrek"" doesn't hold a candle to CR in terms of story and characterization. No doubt the graphics are terrific, but it doesn't make up for the surprisingly weak plot.Visually, it's very stimulating, with an abundance of brilliant colors in every frame; nothing ever looks pasty or parched. The impromptu romance between a huge, lovesick dragon and the wiseacre Donkey, who is easily the film's greatest asset despite his lack of laughs (""Shrek! I'm lookin' down!"" and ""I'm makin' waffles!"" are some of his best lines), makes for a humorous subplot.However, the story of our heroes, Shrek and his sidekick donkey  simply known as, well, Donkey  attempting to rescue Princess Fiona from the dastardly Lord Farquaad in an attempt to rid Shrek's homeland of exiled fairytale characters, quickly becomes an afterthought in favor of potshots, self-indulgence and, at times, just plain mean-spiritedness.""Shrek"" rips off so many sources of modern pop culture that it would make Puff Daddy proud. For a film that is supposedly set in a Dark Ages-like era, it's an anachronistic paradise.It's not so much the ripping off that is bad, though; it just seemed that no attempts were exerted in making any of it look somewhat original.Mike Myers brings his Scottish accent out of mothballs (temporarily retired following the terrible ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"") for the portly, self-centered, Lou Grant-like reclusive ogre, who is now the most famous green creature to hit the big screen since Kermit the Frog and who has a weird penchant for eyeball dinners and outhouses.That's right, the latter opens up the door for the usual bodily function jokes. And apparently the filmmakers couldn't wait to get at it; the first comes during the opening credits. (Side note: It's not smart to include the voice cast in the opening credits either  this goes for any animated picture.) Things certainly do not get off to a good start when we are also subjected to Smash Mouth's ""All Star"" for the zillionth time, but I digress.John Lithgow gives a lively, spirited, and sometimes demonic performance as theer, short-tempered, tyrannical Farquaad, a creep I wouldn't want as my next-door neighbor anytime soon. You listen to that moniker enough times and it begins to sound like a certain four-letter word, considering that this movie is pretty much aimed at the kiddies. Just don't ask the young uns to try and pronounce it afterwards. His character is peppered with familiar yet effective ""short"" gags.Eddie Murphy runs roughshod as the wisecracking Donkey, and perhaps like Robin Williams, you get the feeling that, sometime during production, Murphy was allowed to insert some of his own frenetic, unrestrained material into the script. Sometimes it works, particularly when he's sweet-talking the fearsome dragon, but most of the time it doesn't. (It also permitted a few inevitable ""ass"" jokes to worm their way into the dialogue as well.) You may be tempted to call me a sourpuss, but he scarcely got a laugh out of me during the course of the picture.Little needs to be said about Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), whose only purpose was seemingly just to engage in a forced romance and a ""Three's Company""-type misunderstanding with our hero, and for the film to include yet another damned spoof of ""The Matrix,"" a gag that is now as old as used toilet paper. This all leads up to a predictable ending that could be seen from a country mile away.By the way, from here on out, anyone who spoofs ""The Matrix"" in any way, shape or form for the sake of a cheap laugh should have their eyebrows removed with Krazy Glue.We also must endure five minutes of tiresome WWF-style antics as Shrek takes out an army of knights in a wrestling ring, which he caps off with a Hulk Hogan-style posedown.But that is all small potatoes compared to what is perhaps the true motive behind this film. It's a shame that Katzenberg chose to turn it into one big piece of anti-Disney propaganda, clearly visible in such scenes as Farquaad's spacious theme park, complete with singing merchandise stands and big-headed mascots, among other things. On the side, it beats the ""don't judge a book by its cover"" moral over our heads with the subtlety of a lead pipe. ""Beauty and the Beast,"" anyone?Much to no one's surprise, ""Shrek"" easily made a killing at the box office. Despite its success, however, this film could easily have been a whole lot more, but it's sacrificed in favor of its misguided holier-than-thou opinion of itself. If you want a genuinely enjoyable animated picture with a superior plot, I highly suggest ""Chicken Run"" instead.But if Katzenberg's ludicrous goal was simply to stick it to the House of Mouse, it comes off as hypocritical, since ""Shrek"" goes through all the arduous trouble of borrowing extensively from the competition's product in the first place in a flimsy attempt at sculpting its own commodity. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I Despise This Film,I hate this piece of garbage film. Absolutely hate it. This give comedy a bad name. I can't take anybody anymore. Everybody loves it and everybody wants to watch it over and over again because they say they never get bored of it. This movie was corny and disgusting. Mike Myers has got to be one of thee worst comedians of all time. He has never appeared in a movie that I don't hate. He is just so irritating. I used to like Eddie Murphy back in the eighties when he was talented but he ruined his reputation with some of his later movies. I was so angry when they came out with Shrek 2 and now I found out there making a third. What the Hell? Kill this stupid irritating movie.,1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A new Green Giant for a new millenium,"Shrek (Michael Myers)  is an ogre who lives in a swamp by himself.  He wants to be by himself because he is very insecure about his looks and the way he's perceived.  Meanwhile, in the kingdom of Farquaad, many of the fairy tale characters that we all know and love including the three little pigs, the big bad wolf, fairies, the three bears and snow white are being banished. On the roster to be banished is one talking donkey by the name of....well, Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Donkey becomes a sweet and hilarious thorn in the side of Shrek.  While eating, Shrek is horrified when his swamp is disturbed by the banished fairytale creatures, at the hands of  Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Shrek learns that in order to get his swamp back, he has to talk to Lord Farquaad.   Meanwhile, Farquaad keeps one treasured fairytale item, the magic mirror from Snow White, for himself. He uses it to find himself a princess. The dialogue between he and the mirror is hilarious because it switches to an episode of the dating game with the mirror giving him three choices: Cinderella, Snow ""She lives with seven men, but she's not easy"" White  and Princess Fiona. The knights in full armor coach the prince to choose princess number three, the lovely Princess Fiona ( Cameron Diaz). Fiona is locked in a tower that is protected by a female dragon. When Shrek finally reaches the kingdom o' Farquaad, he is thrown in a WWF wrestling parody that is hilarious. Recognizing his strength, Lord Farquaad makes a deal with the ogre: get me the girl and I will give you the swamp back. Shrek accepts the deal and begins his journey with Donkey in tow.Shrek is a very clever film on many levels. It's a fairytale in every sense of the word. Listen to the way the lines are written, the way the characters speak, the way the story flows. The guys at Dream Works did a good job with this in that you could close your eyes and the dialogue flows as though you're having a story read to you. What makes this movie clever is the fact that it's a fairytale that spoofs fairytales. For example, in most fairytales, the prince is a tall, dark, handsome, kind and dashing man that isn't complete until he finds his one true love to give his heart to.  Yet Lord Farquaad is very short, sort of pale, not attractive, very evil, and lacking in the dashing department. Even his name is awkward in that he calls himself a lord when he is just a prince. In most fairytales, the princess is a beautiful, fragile, dainty and submissive young lady. That isn't the case with our Princess Fiona. She's an up front talkative young lady that kicks butt in a hilarious Matrix parody. The fairytale characters, unlike their particular stories, are at a dead end. Their stories can't end because they have no where to go.Shrek is a pure stroke of genius. It's campy for the kids and sarcastic and hilarious for the adults. It has a voice ( which a lot of movies forget to include in the recipe these days ) in that it preaches the age-old adage that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  From a technical aspect, the movie pushes the technological envelope. While watching the film and watching Shrek and the other characters move and frown, I was quickly thrown back to the time I saw Disney's Dinosaurs. You will notice a lot of the same computer animation (deep canvas) used in this movie. As for the voice-over work, the best of the best were assembled.  At first, I didn't like Mike Myers' voice or Scottish accent at all. It didn't it fit the look of the ogre that was created or the ogre we know from past fairytales. Then I realized that's what the guys at Dream Works were trying to do. They wanted an ogre that no one knew someone you would have to get to know. Once you get to know him, Shrek is very  likable.  His story is one that has the power to create sequels and spinoffs. The movie has been in the making for a long time.  It was reported that Chris Farley was originally intended to voice the  ogre. Never the less it is truly a great movie.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Give it an A for effort,"The field of animation has come to be regarded as strictly for children, which makes it all the more surprising when a gem like Shrek tries to aim for something other than the lowest common denominator. Indeed, this is almost a return to the days when fairy tales had something of a moral, and often a good one. The problem, as so often happens in animation, is that the performance of the characters is often reduced to a singular note after a certain point. Thankfully, the note they do play is pleasant to the ear, so to speak, for the most part.Mike Meyers really ought to consider doing voice-over work full-time. His performance in front of the camera has reached a point where he seems only able to portray stereotypes, and even his stereotypes all seem alike after a while. Behind a microphone, on the other hand, his performance becomes a whole different story. Granted, he doesn't sound like anything more than Mike Meyers trying to sound Scottish, but he does it well enough that the voice fits the character. The rest is sold by the exquisite animation. A critique of Ralph Bakshi's attempt at The Lord Of The Rings stated that while simple, subtle gestures are harder to animate, they are much more effective. Shrek is a case in point.Eddie Murphy is ponderously annoying as Donkey, the sidekick. This is where one of the fundamental weaknesses in Shrek becomes clear. There is nothing Shrek does with Donkey that he cannot do without Donkey. Granted, the scene with Donkey and the dragon is funny, but aside from that moment, Donkey's schtick gets terribly annoying in a hurry.Cameron Diaz, like Meyers, proves that she is easier to take when she is behind a microphone rather than in front of a camera. The character of Fiona, and the story behind her, is one of Shrek's crowning touches. The reason why she fears to be seen during the evening is explored with more satisfaction in the sequel, but it says something about the usual fairy tale canon.In the end, however, Shrek is just too short. Ninety minutes is not enough time to explore characters with such potential. I realise that the film is primarily marketed at a child audience, but there are numerous other films aimed at such an audience where character development, rather than short attention spans, has been treated as a priority. Or perhaps it is just economical use of the screen time. Much of Shrek's screen time is devoted to in-jokes about fairy tales and such, when a bit of time explaining exactly *why* Farquaad is such a killjoy would have done wonders.Nonetheless, I gave Shrek a seven out of ten. It isn't the best animated feature I've ever seen, and there certainly are better fantasy stories out there. What Shrek has going for it is that it doesn't take itself more seriously than the material demands. And unlike many that make this claim, it can truly keep all members of a family entertained. Such is getting rare in this day and age where ""all ages"" excludes anyone whose age can be measured with two digits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Lyazzat Utepbergen,"Almost 10 years have passed since the most moving, funny, smart cartoon - Shrek - appeared on the screens of the world. I was about 6-7 years old when I first saw this terribly good ogre on the screen of my VCR. This cartoon impressed me from the first minutes and has not been letting go for almost 10 years. I will never forget this Donkey, Shrek, Fiona and other fairy-tale characters. This cartoon has become a classic animation. And along with the Matrix - a classic of world cinema. This film should be seen by anyone who at least a little loves the movie. That ingenious humor that struck everyone and children and adults. Successful ridicule of all fairy tales, all fairy tale characters from the most ancient times. The unforgettable character of the Donkey, his questions ... I will never forget it, because it is great humor, it's funny. A donkey is a certain symbol of the film; without it, Shrek is not Shrek. He is one of the main components of the plot and the entire series of adventures of the green giant. Shrek himself is a fun ogre who simply lives in his swamp and wants only peace. But if everything was as he wanted, the world would never have seen those unforgettable, and therefore no less brilliant adventures of two heroes. A cartoon that does not age. There will never be an original film humor. History makes you sit still on the screen until the very end. This is what everyone should see. And, I'm sure that Shrek will cause you a lot of positive emotions. In short, you will love him just as I once loved him. Therefore, if you have not watched Shrek or watched, but for a long time, spend 90 minutes of your time watching this film. A charge of positive emotions is provided!

Fairy tales will never be the same again...,"Four years on, Shrek still is a brilliant, original, charming and very funny animated feature. Subverting the usual fairy tale concepts, it's a milestone in ""adult"" animation, thanks to its intelligent plot, awesome characters and great movie references, especially the VERY subtle jokes about Disney films.The movie is a perfect mix of satire, action, comedy and romance that keeps delighting the audience even after the, say, twenty-fifth viewing. A lot of its charm is linked to the politically incorrect story and characters, which are voiced by some amazing people: Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and, most of all, Eddie Murphy are the perfect vocal choices for the titular ogre, princess Fiona and Donkey, who is one of the best sidekicks (not just animated) in movie history, the motormouth animal having the same appeal and comic potential as Aladdin's Genie. This is one of those movies where you can say:""Eddie Murphy is a gas"". And the supporting creatures are incredibly good too: pick any fairy tale character you've heard of, and you'll find it in this movie (or the sequel), only totally different from what you expected (Pinocchio, Robin Hood, the Gingerbread Man, Snow White and the Dwarfs, everyone is included in one way or another and with a completely unexpected Dreamworks update that would make Walt Disney himself blush).Making the classic stories fresh and innovative for the new century (and millennium as well), Shrek demands to be seen by every kid, teenager and adult on the planet.Don't miss any chance to watch it!8,5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
20 Years of Ogarama,"In 2001, a little computer animated feature came out that nearly rocked the animation industry to its core. That film was based on a William Steig book called Shrek, and it was not only a critical darling, but a huge commercial hit as well, to the point where it became the first film to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. So after 20 years of sequels, spinoffs, memes, and the film being awarded a place in the National Film Registry, it's time to look back on this monster of a feature and see how well it ages. In this animation enthusiast's honest opinion, I would say I respect it more than I fully enjoy it.The film focuses on an ogre named Shrek, who finds his swamp overrun with fairy tale creatures who have been banished by the corrupt aspiring king, Lord Farquaad. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control of his swamp in return for rescuing Princess Fiona, whom Farquaad intends to marry, along with the help of a talking Donkey. And so, Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever. Admittedly, the film does have a relatively straightforward premise, but what does save it from being forgettable is actually the humor and tone. Unlike most family movies at the time which aimed to be more kid friendly first and appealing to adults second, this film feels much more onslaught with juvenile comedy and ""mature"" banter. What's really funny is that while there are some funny visual gags here and there, most of the film's humor is driven by the celebrity cast's dialogue, especially with Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz spouting pop cultural references and witty banter around each other.Now this form of humor could be a make or break deal for viewers, but given the film's ongoing love from people over the past two decades, it's clear that it has at least stood the test of time, especially for a movie that's soundtrack could date it so easily. Perhaps it's from the surprisingly heartfelt relationship between Shrek and princess Fiona that actually grows larger over the film's runtime and does put a shocking twist on the fairy tale happy ending (the first sequel would explore this more thoroughly). I would argue Fiona is a much more appealing character than Donkey, whose annoying personality does get old fast, but that derives from how much pain she has within her based on her fairy tale arc. Then again, a good chunk of the side characters range from fairy tale characters that are obvious parodies of Disney versions to bizarre interpretations such as a very feminine dragon and an overly sardonic gingerbread. Besides, how can you not love a movie villain whose name is a naughty word spoken fast and has more anatomically incorrect jokes than the priest in Little Mermaid?However, the one thing that really does show the movie's age are the visuals, as this film decided to go for a pseudo realistic approach that was distinctive from other mocap CG films that age even worse. While the environments are heavily detailed and full of grotesque colors, a lot of the character designs might come off a little unappealing to some viewers, besides the intentionally ugly looking Shrek. While the sequels would later look a little more colorful and streamlined, seeing this more crudely animated feature does compare drastically from the competition back then, like the far superior Monsters inc and the infamous Disney flop, Atlantis. Also, the film's juvenile pop culture spewings did sadly influence a lot of other copycats, and it's no wonder why some animation historians view this movie with a lot of disdain. While nowhere near as painful as its ripoffs and clones, knowing exactly where studio executives took notice for edgy computer animated comedies makes a lot more sense once you connect the dots, and it aint too pretty either.So despite not having the best legacy out there, Shrek still remains a fascinating look into how the history of American CGI animated features grew throughout these last 20 years. In a day and age where animated features have grown far past the influence from this film, it's at least interesting to look back and see where the influence over the 2000s came from. Nowadays, people might be more engaged in the memes and memories this film spawned than the film itself, but at least it's good to see where a corporate studio feature made its mark in both film and animation history in the long run.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Could be better,"Shrek is good but not great. The story(theme) and animation are good, the soundtrack is brilliant and the voice actors fit the characters convincingly (except Mike Myers, who I feel is miscasted).

Many parts of the film it tries to make me laugh but fails, at best a chuckle or two.Ironically, the only part that is so hilarious that I can't stop laughing is not even in the original film.

"Cynical, hateful, topical.","While many praise ""Shrek"" as clever for adults and charming for children, keep in mind the extremely long-lasting appeal of classic animation such as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Bambi,"" ""Fantasia,"" and ""Sleeping Beauty,"" based on timeless tales and hung out to dry by this film. Those movies, did not become timeless because they were funny parodies, or had fart jokes, or projected a sarcastic yuppie outlook onto more innocent, hopeful ideals. As such, this film will be forgotten in twenty years, just like more topical children's' films from twenty or more years ago, like ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes,"" ""WarGames,"" and ""Cloak and Dagger"" have been all but forgotten.

Finally!  A good 2001 movie!,"This has been a horrible year for movies so far--no doubt about it.  From horrendous comedies to lousy horror films to boring art fims it's been a sad year.  Finally, though, a really good film has come along.  ""Shrek"" is a computer animated comedy for all ages.  It's one of those rare films that adults and children can enjoy.  Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers with a Scottish accent), is a large green-skinned ogre who goes to save a princess (Cameron Diaz) from a fiery dragon.  Why?  Because evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is destroying his property but will spare it if he saves the princess.  An abrasive donkey (Eddie Murphy) comes along to help.  Murphy gets a little too loud and abrasive and the movie does have its dull stretches, but mostly the jokes are flying fast and furious, the animation is flawless and occasionally beautiful, and the whole thing has a happy ending.  There's also a few hilarious pot shots at Disney.  Go, see it and enjoy!  Well worth 10 bucks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
These Animation Movies Of The 21st Century Keep Getting Better,"I enjoyed this first and second times I saw it and that was enough.

Give it a rest, Eddie!The rest of the characters and the film are strictly fun and combination of kids' innocence and some adult humor (which hopefully goes over the heads of kids). Mike Myers' Scottish accent on the lead character ""Shrek"" is just right. The characters mouthed by Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow did little for me. This is mainly Myers and Murphy's show.The colors in this animated film are beautiful, spectacular at times. It's just state- of-the-art artwork.

This movie just didn't tug at my heartstrings the way I wanted it to. Donkey is very cute but Shrek is a little too vulgar to be likeable.  (I have the disadvantage of being a real adult, so farting isn't funny to me.)  There are some humorous moments and the story is fine, but you can see the ending coming a mile off.  It sends a good message and is quirky and original, but it isn't this excellent, wonderful movie everyone thinks it is.  It's a good movie with some good parts -and some parts that are just annoying if you're more than  8 years old - but overall it has the feeling that it's trying too hard to be cool and hip.  (The ending scene with the Smashmouth concert is over-the-top blah and will look dated in no time.. and it isn't THAT good a song to begin with..)    It IS better than this year's other CG offering, Monsters Inc, (which is just an unfunny borefest.) but Shrek is no Toy Story and doesn't deserve all the attention it's been getting.

Perfect!,"Shrek is a hilarious film that uses parody comedy to appeal to all viewers. The story follows an ogre, Shrek, who is on a quest to get his swamp back from an evil lord and gives a funny take on the friends he makes along the way. Along with tying in clever references to the real world, the entire story is a parody of the hero's journey, such as having a ""mentor"" character that is a talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) and through his heroic goal that is really motivated by a selfish desire. I would recommend Shrek to anyone who is looking for a movie filled with great laughs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Also, Eddie Murphey is in top form as Donkey, Mike Myers provides a passable Scottish accent for Shrek, and Cameron Diaz suits her part too. But if you are looking for good computer animation films then turn to Pixar.

All the Disney bashing is uncalled for as well because without Disney there would be no Dreamworks.This film will remain a favourite for families for generations because the messages are so timeless.

Shrek was very overrated.,"How could so many of the nation's critics be hoodwinked by ""Shrek"" and not see it for what it really was - a dumbed down, tiresome and thematically inconsistent bore.  First of all, this film panders to the lowest common denominator with the usage of a ""hip"" pop soundtrack and stereotyped characters.  I'm referring specifically to Eddie Murphy's step-and-fetch-it donkey role, the viewing of which should have caused riots at the NAACP, but didn't.  It is the most hideously and offensively stereotyped character in recent memory.  Furthermore, this film was dull and lifeless.  It relied so much on reference after reference to Disney films that I came to wonder when the references would cease and when the actual movie was going to begin. And because film critics routinely turn off their brains during animated films, they didn't notice the glaring thematic contradiction in ""Shrek."" The overall message of the film is that appearance doesn't matter, and yet the filmmakers have no qualms with making fun of the small stature of the Prince character.  I was really disappointed with ""Shrek"" - so much so that I actually fell asleep while watching it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The only movie that deserve a 10,"""Shrek"" stands out as a cinematic masterpiece, masterfully balancing brevity with a depth of content that includes rich knowledge, insightful wisdom, significant character development, and a wealth of clever puns. This film, while seemingly tailored for a younger audience, is ingeniously crafted for adults, employing double entendres and humor to weave a narrative that is both deeply reflective and philosophically engaging.The movie delves into the age-old debate of beauty and its true essence. It questions the conventional notion of beauty as found in perfection, orderliness, and pristine conditions.""Shrek"" challenges this idea by presenting an alternative perspective where beauty is discovered in the imperfect, the clumsy, and the untidy. These elements are not just depicted as mere backdrops but are integral to the story, suggesting that true beauty and magic lie in embracing and celebrating these imperfections.Furthermore, ""Shrek"" is a commentary on societal norms and prejudices. It cleverly satirizes the fairy tale genre, subverting traditional roles and expectations. The protagonist, an ogre, is not your typical hero but becomes one through his journey, highlighting that heroism and nobility are not confined to outward appearances or conventional standards.In essence, ""Shrek"" is not just a movie but a reflection of the complex layers of society, human relationships, and the internal struggles of accepting oneself. Its ability to blend humor with profound themes, all while challenging societal stereotypes, makes it a timeless piece that resonates with both adult and younger audiences alike. The beauty in ""Shrek"" is not just in its storytelling but in its powerful message that the most authentic magic and beauty are found in embracing and celebrating our unique imperfections.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of The Greatest Animated Movies Ever Made in the History of Cinema!,"I was blown away when I saw this because although I am 23, I really enjoyed this movie from the beginning, with Shrek that starts his day in his swamp, then he meets Donkey (my favorite character) and with his help try to rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona from the dragon's keep.Never in the history of cinema a movie had the twists and turns that Shrek has, and for three reasons:(1) The settings and backgrounds are fantastic, you feel like you are in the movie, they're so realistic with the wind that blows in the leaves and grass. (2) The cast is fantastic, with Mike Myers using his fake Scottish accent and using also some Austin Powersesque jokes, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, Cameron Diaz as the beautiful and tough Princess Fiona, and John Lithgow as the evil Lord Farquad, that after he declares himself King, he gets eaten alive by the dragon. (3) The soundtrack is amazing, not only with the Smash-Mouth songs, but with the Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell's music score in almost all the movie, it has also a starring role within the character's actions, especially in the Escape from the Dragon and Saving Fiona from Farquaad parts.I want to talk about Donkey, my favorite character. Voiced by the great Eddie Murphy (''Trading Places'' and ''48 hours''), he looks a bit annoying, like in the scene where he meets and follows Shrek all the way home, and he embarks on Shrek's journey to regain his swamp. He has always something to say and his best jokes are the funniest, like when he discovers that the Dragon is a female dragon, and she falls in love with him, or his first scene at the resettlement center with his owner and when he gets covered by TinkerBell's dust which gives him, although briefly, the capacity of flying.The story line it's great too because it has also his drama moments, but the comedy moments are larger. This movie it's also a satire about tolerance and the fact that a person should accept another person not for his physical appearance, but for the feelings a person shows. And people should learn this from Shrek; if you are mocked by other persons for something of you that is considered ridiculous, ignore them. I passed this also personally in my life.The only scene that scared me is the one when Shrek and Fiona find a snake and a frog and blow them as balloons, but the best scene for me was Lord Farquaad's torture towards the GingerBread Man.I also understand why it had a great success and even earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Movie back in 2001! And I also saw the featurette about all the making process and technology behind the Shrek movie.And for me it's without doubts ONE OF THE GREATEST ANIMATED MOVIES EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA!

Plenty for kids and adults alike,"An ogre lives happily in his swamp before he is invaded by a horde of other fairy tale characters fleeing persecution from the evil Lord Farquaad.  In order to clear his swamp of the squatters, Shrek agrees to undergo a quest to rescue a Princess from a dragon and bring her to Farquaad's castle. However on the journey back Shrek and Princess Fiona being to become friends, but can a Princess love an ogre?This is one of the best animated films that I've ever been able to see.  Not only is it really funny but the story is great - it's deep if you want it to be deep, but there's plenty on the surface if you just want that.  The whole thing about true love and love finding it's true form is very moving, and the characters are developed to the extent that you fully believe them (despite them being donkeys, ogres and mini-tyrants!).  In terms of comedy I expected more - but only because I thought it was a spoof film rather than a well plotted fairy tale.  However many bits are really funny, Murphy's Donkey gets the most laughs, but there are plenty of other great scenes that range from adult laughs to people falling down for the kids - the gingerbread man scene being my favourite (""the muffin man?"").Like Toy Story this succeeds by having a great story, great characters and a huge number of jokes for adults that are a) clever, b) funny and c) not forced in the least.  This mix makes for a wonderful film.  Mike Myers is great as Shrek - he gets very few jokes, I assumed that he would ham it up, but he plays the sensitive role very well and carries the emotional core of the film.  Murphy is brilliant as the donkey, gets all the best lines and is the best animated character - it's his role to carry the bulk of the comedy. Lithgow is great as Farquaad and the animation just reflects him perfectly. Diaz is OK as Fiona but at times her vocal abilities aren't good enough to bring the character to life.  This is especially evident during Fiona's transformation where the role needed a lot more emotion to win us over.Overall a wonderful film - there aren't many films that can combine great comedy, strong characters, moving and meaningful story and be original and inventive.  To find all these things in a cartoon makes for a great 90 minutes.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It was alright...nothing special.,"The way people talked about this movie I was expecting a laugh riot. Instead it was worthy of a few laughs here and there.

Then I saw the whole movie and most of the best jokes are in the first hour.  Still it was only worth a chuckle here and there...I definitely don't see what the big deal was. Myers does the voice of the ogre, and he is basically doing his fat-b&st@rd Scottish voice, but he does rather well.  Murphy basically does the character he played in Mulan.

A lovable ogre and his donkey friend steal the show...,"SHREK is probably more fun for adults than children, especially if you can recognize all the twisted elements derived from a whole flock of Disney films or Grimm's Fairy Tales.The humor is clever, although sometimes crude, and the animation has a 3D look with some very clever special effects, especially for the scene of the fire-breathing dragon chasing Shrek, the donkey and the princess across a rickety bridge over a pit of lava.The spirit of fun is more evident than ever in the Robin Hood sequence with the Merry Men bursting into song and dance.Of course, all the voices are expertly done by people like MIKE MEYERS, JOHN LITHGOW, CAMERON DIAZ and EDDIE MURPHY, none of them sounding conspicuously like their real-life selves except for Murphy.Personally, I still prefer hand drawn animation over all this computer generated stuff, so I'm not the most unbiased person to review this sort of animated film.Summing up: Funny with an odd sort of charm but terribly overrated by today's generation of moviegoers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

One of a kind. Great experience.,"This animated fantasy is far and beyond others in the genre. This is the standard others will be judged by for a long time to come.

Shrek is offered his swamp vacated if he retrieves the pretty princess Fiona(Cameron Diaz)and brings her to the midget ruler for marriage.The crude 'potty' humor is mild and does not distract from the clever written story line; and this comedy can't help but amuse viewers of all ages. Myers of course has the top billing, but I think Murphy steals the whole show. I think the witty donkey could carry his own movie someday. SHREK lives up to and deserves all of its accolades.

"Once upon a time, when Dreamworks actually cared about the film itself...","A grumpy Ogre and a talking donkey must venture to save a Princess and bring her back to a despicable Lord in order for the Ogre to reclaim his confiscated swamp...The original Shrek is better than most adults think, it has some very clever jokes that are aimed more at the people taking the kids to the cinema in the first place, it is also a reminder that Eddie Murphy was actually a funny guy a while back. Shrek cleverly toes the line between pleasing the kids and rewarding Mum and Dad for their patience.I'm on the fence about labeling it ""great"" though... There are a few moments that will have you reaching for the FF 30 seconds button, and a few jokes that will ""swooooosh"" right over your kid's head while you chuckle a little.This reputation is sullied by the rancid taste of sequels two and (especially) three, both blatant cash grabs that were more interested in pop culture references and shoehorning in rips from famous films and nudge-nudge nods to adults that were far more effective and classy in the original.

The result is a bargain.  Shrek will rescue a cursed princess from a castle in a lava pit that's guarded by a dragon and Farquard will remove the fairy folk from the swamp.It's a cute movie and there are definitely some funny scenes.

To Be Honest,"You have to have a very high IQ to understand Shrek. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of swamp physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Shrek's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature,for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Shrek truly are idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance the humor in Shrek's godlike catchphrase ""What are you doing in my swamp"", which itself is a reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

Wonderful,"7/10 because almost everything I've seen recently has been so poor  finally a movie (computer cartoon actually) that is overwhelmingly entertaining, visually spectacular, well written and directed.

If they gave out Academy Awards for voice-overs, certainly Mr. Murphy and Mr. Myers would be in the running.  Perhaps the Academy should consider a special award for this little masterpiece.Whatever.  The simple story of the outcast ogre and his hyperactive donkey out to rescue the trapped princess is wonderful.  The action and interactions never cease making this a super movie-going or movie rental experience.  The madness of Lord Farquat in trying to make a perfect paradise in which (the magic mirror tells him) only he can do if he marries a princess.  The social comparisons are obvious but never overbearing.  The quest of the ogre and the donkey is captivating. The rescue of the princess is an intense as can be and as surprising as well.

He can therefore be cynical and make funny comments about other people/films.  He has no need of a personality because he is ugly  surely one feature is enough for one person?  The Princess it tough!  Superb!  She can therefore have a fight.  Its so cool that a woman can do one other thing in a film apart from being a love interest these days.  But who ever imagined a woman hitting someone?!?  And the Donkey.  He is probably the most unfunny character ever.  Still, being witless does not necessarily mean the character is bad.  Unfortunately, he wipes the floor with Jar Jar Binks in the most irritating character ever awards.The animation is fantastic and inserts interest into otherwise boring set pieces.  The film looks excellent and pretends it is cool.  Therein lies its success.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Truly the greatest fairy tale never told...,"I've lost track of how many times I've seen this great film. I believe the number is below ten, but I'm not even sure of that. It somehow never gets old, the jokes remain fresh. Every once in a while, when I get the chance to see this film, I sit down and my laugh 'till my sides ache. It's about time someone decided to make a spoof movie making fun of fairy tales... I mean, they have been around for a few hundred years. In this film you will see just about every fairy tale creature poked fun at, and it's hilarious. The plot is very good, and quite original, for being based so much on typical fairy tale formula. The pace is great, you're rarely, if ever, bored; even on repeated viewings. The acting is pretty much flawless, and the talented main cast create an impressive number of laughs throughout the film. The characters are nicely fleshed out and interesting, for being based so heavily on fairy tale stereotypes. The humor is excellent; the comic timing of the gags and jokes is impeccable, and Myers and Murphy make a great comedy team(quite astounding since, according to the trivia, none of the voice actors actually met each other). The casting is perfect, and that is something that really, really, REALLY needs to be in order for an animated feature. As much as I love Steve Buscemi, even I can tell that he was completely miscast in the Final Fantasy movie. The dialog is well-written, with plenty of quotable lines. The whole thing is full of very talented and clever writing, both in dialog and in general... many memorable scenes as well. There's plenty of great music in there as well... not really one single piece of music on the soundtrack that I dislike. No loud or annoying tracks, but good, old-fashioned quality music. Not much else to say, except that I urge you to see this film, unless you can't stand fairy tales at all(which would require more hatred for them than even I have, a feat nearly impossible to accomplish) since it is, in the end, a fairy tale, no way around that. Happy end and everything. So, if you're not sure, go check out a trailer or the memorable quotes page. I recommend this to just about anyone who is at least a teenager and who won't completely fall apart when they see fairy tales being made the butt-end of jokes. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I Still Say the Second One is Better,"A breath of fresh air to the tropes of the fantasy genre true, but so much of this movie is bogged down in the mean-spirited self-loathing of the main character.

It even holds up today,"Everybody knows Shrek as a wonderful achievement in animation, and it's easy to see why. It evens holds up 22 years later!This film does a wonderful job with its worldbuilding, and establishing the characters, namely the beloved ogre, Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers), along with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), as well as a massive ensemble of supporting characters. It also takes jabs at the fairy tale genre in a good way, at every turn.The animation is top-notch by 2001's standards, easily even the best CGI animation of that year (besides Monsters Inc., of course, because everyone knows Pixar is still the golden standard for CGI animation), with excellent and unique designs for all the characters, beautiful sceneries, and excellent cinematography. Unfortunately, however, there are a couple areas that show signs of poor aging; most notably, some of the character movements are rather stiff and jerky. To be fair, it's the best DreamWorks' animators could do with the budget and technical limitations of the time. Of course, it gets better in the sequels. But I'm not saying the movie doesn't look amazing, it's just that some of its visual aspects haven't aged well.However, the humor has aged like wine. The story is packed with jokes and gags that still hold up, even two decades later! Great adult humor, blended with kid-friendly jokes, and it still makes me laugh every time. No cheap laughs, or forced comedy routines, or anything like that. Just great, delightfully irreverent-yet-pleasant fun throughout.The voice-acting is incredible, especially by Mike Myers, who gives Shrek the funniest Scottish accent ever to conceal his natural Canadian accent. But Eddie Murphy is also great as Donkey, giving him the perfect motor-mouthed quality. And Cameron Diaz is perfect as Fiona. John Lithgow is delightfully cruel and ruthless as Lord Farquaad.And of course, there's the music. Along with the gorgeous score co-composed by Harry Gregson-Williams (who, it would seem, is practically the go-to composer for DreamWorks Animation) and John Powell, the movie offers an incredible mixtape of rock and pop tunes, most notably the delightful ""All-Star"" by Smash Mouth. But it should also be worth noting that this movie also gave me two really great songs on a platter when I was about 7 (let me be honest, I actually saw Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third first when I was around 4, several years before): ""Escape (The Pina Colada Song)"" by Rupert Holmes and ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen (though the version of the latter used here is the extraordinary cover by John Cale).Everything considered, Shrek is considered a triumph for good reasons. It's great, it's charming, it's hilarious, and it has a great message about not judging others before you meet them! As such, it's the brainchild of the earliest years of DreamWorks Animation, and it marks the start of a proud animated movie franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Finally a film this Summer that ALMOST lives up to the hype...,"With it's rapturous reception at Cannes and box-office success both sides of the Atlantic, what I'm about to say may come as a bit of a shock.....sitting comfortably?.....pulse ok?.....Shrek is not quite as good as you think.Recovered? Good, because Shrek is still a damn good film. It looks great, is funny, and the characters are endearing. Myers' Ogre may be a little dull sometimes, but Diaz' fiesty princess and the Donkey (an absolute scream, and possibly Murphy's best role in years) more than make up for that. Most of all, it's brimming with an attitude and streetwise nature which many of Disney's films lack, which recognises that kids really can be nasty little sods at times, and are far from stupid. 'Shrek' really does pull the conventions of the fairy tale to pieces at times, and it's combination of body jokes and black humour (the Magic Mirror's 'Blind Date' style description of Snow White (""Though she lives with 7 guys, she's not easy"") for example) are an unceasing attack on Walt's whole back catalogue of kiddies classics.However, it does have it's faults. The script is a little light in the joke department. When it's funny it's really funny, but there's not enough humour for all ages to strike a perfect balance and you feel that, without Murphy's wisecracking ass, Shrek could have been pretty boring (the rumours were that Dreamworks cut much of the black humour out of the film to get its certificate, so this may explain it). The main premise of the film isn't used enough either. Aside from the start and end sequences of the film (with the exception of one hilarious fight with Robin Hood and his Merry Men), the fairy tale cast is anonymous - a shame, as it's a great idea.Despite that, Shrek is still a great piece of entertainment and shows that Dreamworks, although they lack the quality script of a 'Toy Story', aren't too far off of stealing Disney's crown.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An instant classic,"Shrek is a timeless classic and probably my favorite movie growing up! Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, this film redefined animated storytelling with its brilliant humor, imaginative world, and unforgettable characters.From the moment we meet Shrek, voiced perfectly by Mike Myers, we're drawn into a fantastical adventure that is as hilarious as it is heartwarming. The film cleverly subverts fairy tale tropes, delivering a refreshing take on the classic story of an ogre who embarks on a quest to rescue Princess Fiona, wonderfully voiced by Cameron Diaz. The dynamic between Shrek and his lovable sidekick, Donkey, played by Eddie Murphy, is nothing short of comedic gold. Their banter and chemistry bring so much joy to the film, providing endless laughs.The animation is stunning, with vibrant colors and beautifully crafted environments that immerse viewers in the whimsical world of fairy tales. Each character is uniquely designed, and the attention to detail is impressive, making every scene visually captivating.What truly sets Shrek apart is its clever writing and witty humor, appealing to both children and adults. The film is packed with clever references and pop culture nods that keep it fresh and entertaining, ensuring that it remains relevant even years after its release. The soundtrack is equally iconic, featuring memorable songs that enhance the film's emotional moments while keeping the energy high.Beyond the laughs and visuals, Shrek carries a meaningful message about acceptance, friendship, and embracing one's true self. It encourages viewers to look beyond appearances and societal expectations, making it not just an entertaining film but one with a heart.Overall, Shrek is an outstanding animated film that perfectly blends humor, creativity, and emotional depth. For its unforgettable characters, clever writing, and stunning animation, I give it a perfect 10 out of 10! This film is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the magic of storytelling in animation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
No bugs.,"Shrek is a solid crowd-pleaser. There is something for everyone, and is definitely worth seeing. However, this movie reinforces my belief that a movie that pleases everyone can never be really ""Great"" (with the capital G). Caveat: Through a kid's eyes, this is probably a 10, and I wouldn't argue. For me, though, I have to stick with a 7--Shrek just doesn't have the dramatic or emotional depth to really stick, and I don't do the Ebert thing, where one genre enjoys a different rating system from another.Basically, Shrek is the newest ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"", or ""Toy Story"". These movies all share the same kind of substance--really light overall fare for the kids, some ironic or risque humor for the adults, cutting edge computer animation, and the usual formulaic plot. There is no real complexity, no daring dialogue or content, no philosophical dilemmas. And of course, there shouldn't be--it is primarily a show for kids, which is the movie's strength and its weakness.What earns the 7 for me, as with all of the aforementioned computer graphic vehicles, is the animation, which takes the safe, mundane content to an enjoyable level. It is really stunning to witness the visuals that can now be rendered for the movies. We must be only a few years away from doing away with human actors altogether--today, you can still easily see the clumsy human movements, but it's getting harder and harder with each new film.Maybe that's why Shrek, while unquestionably entertaining, still leaves me with a bit of an empty feeling. It's too close to real, without the reality. It would be like watching Cameron Diaz act through a movie wearing a Cameron Diaz mask. But I digress.Shrek entertains. It is witty. It is cute. It is pleasant. It has no bugs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A true gem,"After months of bland and downright awful movies, Hollywood finally gets one right with ""Shrek"", the new animated fractured fairy tale from the folks at Dreamworks Pictures and PDI, who last collaborated on the 1998 hit ""Antz"".The movie is about an ogre named Shrek, a creature who greatly values his privacy. When an arrogant little prince by the name of Lord Farquaad banishes the fairy tale inhabitants of his kingdom to Shrek's private swamp, the ogre goes to protest. Farquaad promises to remove the inhabitants if Shrek rescues the lovely Princess Fiona from a dragon-guarded castle so Farquaad can marry her and become King. With a talking donkey as his sidekick, Shrek heads off on the adventure of his lifetime.Take that fairy-tale premise, sprinkle it with great voice talent (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow), a smart and often hilarious screenplay (co-written by two of the people who wrote 'Aladdin'), solid directing from Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson and some of the best computer animation put on screen yet, and you have a comedy that will delight all ages.

"A Film I expected to hate, but is one of the best films ever!","This is one of the best films, ever!Ya gotta understand, with all the media-marketing hype and the terms ""family oriented"" and ""Kids Film"" I grew to dislike this film, without seeing it. That was until I saw it all the way through for the first time on cable tv. Lesson learned: ignore the hype, view for yourself, make up your own mind.That's when I found out, this is a wonderful film for children, families and adults. Smart, witty and funny, a brilliant re-tread of fairy tales that will live on for a long time, to be included with all those ""other"" well-known timeless fairy tales.Shrek the Ogre, as voiced by Mike Myers was wonderful. He had all the elements, kids like. He's gross, he's loud, he's green and ugly. But he also possessed many traits adults liked, he was valiant and he had a heart. Everything a movie hero is made up of!I'm with everyone here as I cannot stop loving Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy. He should have won an Oscar for this. His vocal comedic stylings with this animation was brilliant, you cannot help but love Donkey.Princess Fiona, voiced by Cameron Diaz, was also wonderful and who could forget, Lord Farquaad voiced by the ever talented John Lithgow. I cannot tell you how hard I laughed throughout this film...and I loved the ending...I loved the ""twist"" of Princes Fiona and how, at least in this telling of the beautiful Princess fairy-tale story, beauty and love is in the eyes of the beholder.This film is a Dreamworks animation division triumph. Mr. Katzenberg out did himself in producing this one, an excellent choice and project well done. The Animation was superb. For those who don't believe me, take a look at ""Donkey"" during the film, or Lord Farquaad's hair for example. This type of Computer Animation is so ""scary"", you just KNOW real actors now have a ""shelf life"" and in the coming decades, this technology will advance and become a Hollywood norm. Good or bad as this ""shelf life"" for real actors may be, I am just commenting on what a great accomplishment, great entertainment and I hope as the technology progresses, it is used ""with"" and not ""instead of.""Anyone who hates this film, in my humble view, has a personal problem with it..because as far as an achievement, it is a great one, it is a spectacular film for all audiences -- loaded with adult jokes but in keeping it in line for children, which keeps everyone interested and very much entertained.

What the...?,"I thought the whole point of the movie, that is to turn Disney Fantasy archetypes and cinematic myths upside down with bad taste written all over it (on purpose!), was pretty clear to anyone. I thought the moral aspects were obvious either. I was wrong!... incredible.From the comments I've read around here, many people simply didn't get it. It's quite amazing, as I don't think the movie is ambiguous in any way. Weak plot? Bad taste? Sure, guys, it's the point! Can't you simply forget about your beloved archetypes, your hunger for ""beautiful"" stories, and look at the film for what it is, with fresh eyes? Gee, there's even a intelligent moral point for children, i.e. heroes aren't necessarily beautiful or rich! If Fiona stays an ogre at the end, it's to demonstrate this! The filmmakers want us to love Fiona for what she is, not what she looks like, unlike the Disney productions, in which heroines don't have any choice, they HAVE to be gorgeous (even when pretending the contrary, as in ""Mulan"").I never thought I'd have to explain this, it's so obvious. To my sense, people who only see bad taste and bad plot in Shreck have identity problems. They've been bread on Disney's productions and cinematic archetypes and myths, they consider these things as sacred, as a part of themselves, they take it personally, as if Shreck made fun of THEM (which is, to a certain extent, true..). Some may even be jealous of Fiona because they've been told since their childhood that heroines MUST be beautiful, so why on earth is Fiona a heroin though I'm not? Don't take it personally, it's the PROCESS that Shreck makes fun of, not you guys and gals.One could describe, in a way, Shreck as being an UNfairy tale... and that's the good thing about it. In its insanity, Shreck is among the most sane movies I've seen so far.Shreck is a parody of all modern cinematic myths, encapsulated in a pseudo-fairy tale as a mere pretext. Shreck is a movie-referential and self-referential clever story about the way people look at movies and the way they warship and praise cinematic myths, and that's the fun of it. The way people react to Shreck is quite interesting. It makes the movie even more meaningful, though I doubt the filmmakers were ever aware of that.Now I'm not saying Shreck is a fine piece of art, and I can understand some critics I've read about the ""cool"" aspects of the movie. But I personally think that Shreck IS a good movie, and the interesting story it tells is not in the plot itself, it's in the WAY this ""weak"" plot is told...

Dreck (5/10),"(I watched this on widescreen DVD, YMMV)Without Eddie Murphy, this movie would be a horribly painful experience. As it is, he makes it barely watchable.  Murphy has a longer leash here than he did in Mulan, and uses the freedom to create some truly hysterical comic moments.  But they are too few and too far between to recommend this movieShrek has terrible computer animation; terrible voice by Mike Myers [""Shrek, the Ogre with the Scottish Accent""]; and a painfully strange obsession with an assault on Disney.The computer animation is so bad that in every scene it overwhelms everything else.  Shrek and the Princess are rendered well enough, but the rest of the characters and the background look like they were designed by elementary school kids with Apple II computers.  When the town comes to storm Shrek's swamp in the beginning, I actually laughed out loud because the townspeople look so bad.  The pre-rendered scenes in many old videogames (like WarCraft II or Age of Empires) look better than this.Mike Myers does a terrible job as the voice of Shrek.  Shrek has a bad Scottish accent and I am beginning to wonder if bad Scottish accents are all that Myers can do.  I was waiting for Shrek to break out in ""If it's not Scottish, it's CRAP!"" [Stuart Mackenzie, So I Married an Axe Murderer], or ""Look at me, I'm sexy!"" [Fat Bastard, Austin Powers].  Shrek sounded like a bad blend of the two and never gained a voice of his own.Finally, the Dreamworks team has some weird obsession with Disney that comes out in creepy ways in this movie.  All kinds of ""fairy-tale"" characters that Disney made famous appear in unflattering ways.  Snow White is referred to as ""the dead broad.""  There is a recreation of DisneyLand with dolls that sing off-color songs, and the city is so ""perfect"" that there is no one there.  Why not?

This journey leads him to the scheming Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Farquaad asks Shrek and Donkey to fetch him the lovely Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). This is where the story really begins. ""Shrek"" is basically a parody of fairy tales in general. There's a wolf in Grandma's drag, a ""terrorizing"" female dragon, three blind mice dressed like modern blind men, among many others.

Shallow and unsatisfying,"I really can't understand why everyone rates this film so highly, I went to see it with two friends and we all agreed it was a huge disappointment. It could be argued that as 18 year olds we were not exactly the target audience, but I had been led to believe that this picture had universal appeal like the excellent Toy Story, and I really could'nt see any of this.I think the major problem with this film is its attempt to be satirical of fairy-tales when it's own narrative is so flimsy and predictable. Whereas some amount of predictability should be expected, Shrek sticks like glue to its pre-defined genre expectations on more than one level. The setting of the story in a land of castles, talking animals, dragons etc is OK, but some other details I really had a problem with. The princess for example is all sweet and pretty and wholesome and then she burps. I got the feeling the audience were meant to laugh or maybe be surprised at this but how many movies/ TV shows have you seen where the woman shows some ""girl power"" and acts all crude/kicks male butt or whatever. I would either like to see this sort of charecter made impossible weak and pathetic or maybe a psychotic serial killer type, just burping does'nt cut it anymore. I don't know if the people who made Shrek thought they were being wildly original or not, but to me everything in this movie seemed to be stolen from somewhere else, and not in a satirical way either. The other characters are predictable too, the donkey (Eddie Murphy) is annoying, and Shrek (Myers) is slow and boring. Myers also does the Worst Scottish Accent Ever which also slips every couple of scenes. The best role in the film is the evil guy (Lithgow), for once the voiceover is of good quality and suited to the charecter. Its a pity he does'nt get more screen time because the gingerbread man torturing scene was the best in the film, itself far too short though. This is typical of the script's tendency to skip from one gag to the next without trying to take the joke futher or refer back to it to increase comic effect. The story itself is too frail and boring to make up for the cascade of weak, underdeveloped jokes.

Every time you'd watch this movie, you'll notice small bits you didn't notice from before.I also like the use of parodies and in jokes on Disney. The choices for the main characters are clever. Including Eddie Murphy making the movie funny as Donkey. And Mike Myers fits the role of Shrek so perfectly.If you like mild humor comedies with action, and fantasy. Then Shrek is the right choice for that category.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pretty good movie for youngsters,"Shrek ain't my normal cuppa tea, but it was strongly recommended by a respected colleague. So off I went to a local Odeon to check out this tale of yore.This was at 5 on a Sunday, but there were only about 50 spectators, all adults with young children, except for your fearless reviewer. Makes you think that reports of problems in the movie display industry are not exaggerated.If memory serves me right, Shrek is close to Schrech, the German word for terror or fright. This would hopefully refer to the ogre, not the movie itself.Anyway, it took a few minutes for me to get my head around the fact that I was about to spend almost an hour and a half watching some kinda cartoon, several decades since the last time.Having done that, I was soon enjoying the antics of Eddie Murphy. Incongruous though it seems, his 1990s street slang was a super fit for the ancient times. But Mike Myers was all over the place.Those who recall his excellent work in SNL still affectionately laugh at his language renditions in the Scottish retail store. But here he alternated between a little of the Highlands, and more of his birthplace in a suburb of Toronto.There were two flatulence jokes within seconds at one point. Guess that was a device to raise the attention levels of the nine-year-old boys. But this audience of children was strangely silent throughout most of the movie.There were some delightful notes of incongruity. Perhaps the best was that of the appearance of a French-accented Robin Hood. Weird stuff!The fundamental point of the story --- not to judge by appearances alone --- was well made. And the ending was spectacularly done. Quite a surprise to me also, in that the fairy tale ending was not there.However, along with all of this mature understanding for diversity was a curious inconsistency. We may not have liked Lord Farquaad, but was it appropriate to fill the movie with jokes about his height and size? Surely our compassion should extend to the vertically challenged as well as the plain ugly?Anyway, I give Shrek a 6. By the way, the sunset outside the theatre was truly spectacular. A definite 10!!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Shrek is a perfect cartoon,"""Shrek the Monsters"" successfully breaks the narrative mode of traditional fairy tales through clever camera angles and unique film genres. For example, when Shrek and Donkey first met, the close-up shot emphasized the contrast between their personalities, with Shrek's indifference and Donkey's liveliness forming a sharp contrast. In the scene of rescuing Princess Fiona, the switching between long shots and close shots shows Shrek's bravery and the princess's complex emotions. In the dusk dialogue scene, the use of wide-angle lenses adds a warm and reflective atmosphere to the film. As a fantasy comedy, ""Shrek the Monsters"" combines the fantasy elements of fairy tales with a modern humorous style, telling a story about friendship and self-identity through anti-traditional character creation and plot development. This unique rhythm and aesthetics make this movie a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Light, fun comedy with strange plotting","Clearly, this is a film that wants to have it both ways--be a kid's film with enough ""adult"" jokes to keep older folks happy. There's enough charm and laughs to almost get away with it. I found the plot a bit oddly paced and just plain odd at times. For instance,  the motivation of why the John Lithgow king character sends the fairy tale characters to Shrek's swamp was a bit murky to me. And there were a few slow points. But overall, you'll get decent laughs out of the Disney references, potty/ass jokes and Eddie Murphy's antics. The Matrix joke was especially effective and out of the blue.

A cute film that effectively mixes old fairy tales with an unusual twist.,"I'll admit that I did not harbor any inclination to see this film, however upon seeing this, I must say that it was exceptionally well done. Of all the computer generated films (ie Toy Story, Ice Age, Monsters Inc. etc) this has been my favorite, and a favorite of my two year old brother. It never fails to keep him quiet, even during a tantrum. For that purpose, I recommend ""Shrek"" for any parents or babysitters to have ready.As for the film itself, I was pleasantly surprised. It took traditional characters, like an ogre or a princess, and assigned them to very untraditional roles. With an ogre for protagonist, the film subtley explored many themes unknown to the child-oriented fantasy world. Discrimination and self esteem, namely. There are many lessons to be taught from this film, and at the same time entertaining. The vocal performances on all counts were well done and unique. The humor could be at times rather vulgar, but the film never claimed to be seen through rose colored glasses. Anyway, the humor goes right over the heads of young kids, so there's nothing to worry about to that effect. Actually, I found the coarseness a refreshing break from the usual sugar coated reality that seems unavoidable when looking at other childrens' films.  Essentially, this film is for the entire family. Not too adult for young kids, and not too childish to keep the attention of mom and dad.

Pretty darn good,"Shrek is no Toy Story, but is still a pretty darn good film. Dreamworks has done a fantastic job of parodying a number of fairy tales and classic Disney animations in a way that is both hilarious and sometimes full out crude. It definately deserves a PG rating.The character animation and environment renderings are phenominal! It has a really unique and almost puppet-like quality that audiences will surely love.Unfortunately the writing is pretty weak and there are some jokes and conversations that are downright awkward to listen to. However, Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy pull off great performances which help to smooth things over.Overall, I'd give Shrek a 7/10. Good stuff. I'll definately go see it again.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Some real talent behind the microphone,"""Shrek"" has a big heart, and when it's in the right place, the focus is on the characters and the message of acceptance.

An Absolute Stinker,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and hemorrhoid sufferers around the world, it's time for a review of a movie that's been praised as a classic, but in my humble opinion, is nothing but a pile of swamp mud.

And speaking of pain in the butt, I'm currently recovering from hemorrhoids, and let me tell you, this movie was more painful than my latest flare-up.The characters are bland, the jokes are cheap, and the animation looks like it was done by a toddler with a crayon. Don't even get me started on the plot. A talking ogre falls in love with a talking princess, who's been cursed to turn into an ogre at night. What is this, Beauty and the Beast with a green twist? And let's not forget about that annoying donkey who just won't shut up. I'd rather listen to the sounds of my hemorrhoid cream being applied.And don't even get me started on the music. Smash Mouth? More like Smash Trash? The soundtrack sounds like it was written by a group of tone-deaf trolls.In conclusion, save yourself the pain, and skip this ""classic"".

Shrek,"If you liked Toy Story as a computer animated film, you'll like this. A fairytale never told about an ogre called Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers). He has lived in his swamp for a long time. Then one day he stumbles on Donkey (loud-mouthed Eddie Murphy). They do not get on that well together at first but they become better friends as the film goes on. When Shrek's swamp becomes crowded with fairytale people and creatures Shrek goes to Lord Farquaad's castle. Farquaad (John Lithgow) is the one who made them go there. But the Lord is too busy trying to become King, to do this he decides to make a deal with Shrek to let him have his swamp back if he rescues Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a lava surrounded, dragon guarded castle. After he had done this he Shrek had started to have a special relationship with the Princess, until eventually they had fallen in love. A charming story with some good comedy moments. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. It was number 2 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and along with the sequel, both were number 6 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons.

Shrek And His Merry Men,"I watched this film recently with my sister as part of our Dreamworks Movie Marathon. Shrek is a great fantasy-adventure film. The characters have good arcs, the sets are great for a fantasy film, and the movie does an excellent job at building the world surrounding our main characters. This is seen through the small details of the minor characters (the fairy tale creatures), and the Robin Hood scene in which characters are introduced and never mentioned again. World- building. The friendship between Shrek and Donkey grows very well, and is the high point of the film. I definitely must say this movie may entertain kids, but the script leans heavily toward innuendo and is clearly directed at an adult audience. This is not at all a detriment, it gives the movie the grit it needed to be a successful action/adventure film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Inexplicably popular, lowbrow hamimation.","Shrek is, according to the majority of the IMDB, a far better movie than Pixar's recent Monsters, Inc.Despite this, I still hold out hope for humanity. A spiritless, meagre-plotted exercise in digital imagery, ""Shrek"" makes its strength on fart jokes and a throwaway message about ""inner beauty"". The only saving grace Shrek sports is Eddie Murphy's spirited, laugh-out-loud Donkey; unless, of course, you've seen ""Mulan"", in which he made much the same appearance. Then again, I laughed at ""Mulan"" as well.Comparisons with Monsters Inc. are inevitable, but nearly impossible to make, given the drastically different drives displayed in each film. Monsters Inc., for its failings, is, like all other Pixar works, plot- and character-driven, concerning itself with a strong story first and digital spectacle second. Shrek is driven by spectacle, with the plot and character development running a distant second.

intertextual piece of ogre sized fairy tale fun,"Granted, the CGI in Shrek is different from e.g. Ice Age, Monsters Inc. or Final Fantasy but that doesn't make it bad CGI, it's just different, Ice Age had super cool Water Surfaces, Monsters Inc. had super cool Fur effects and FF had the hair but Shrek has an Ogre and a talking Donkey and that's hard to beat! i.e. effects aren't all in fact in Shrek these are secondary. As the plot thickens - and there's little time wasted before it does - we get entangled in so much cross references to well known fairy tales and popular movies that it's pure fun to watch (even if you don't get all the intertextual references).The voice acting is simply hilarious and I urge anyone to go see the original version if possible. While localized versions surely have their own style and touch it will not be the same as with Eddie and Mike on the helm. Let's just say voices like these ""come in short supply"".If you expect CGI mayhem and a genuine ogre fairy tale you might well be disappointed but if you like a fast paced fun ride through fairy tale land and if you want to know more about the Muffin Man then this is for you and please watch out for unwanted physical contact from she dragons.Fun for the whole family. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of DreamWork's Finest,"Shrek really speaks volumes to what DreamWorks can bring to the table as this is a very compelling comedy. Nowadays comedies have fallen flat and are rarely able to hit home instead of the foul zone. But Shrek and DreamWorks has such clever talent that the originality of the idea automatically makes this a one-of-a-kind comedy. Shrek would also begin DreamWorks' run as a real and legit animated film company. In fact legit is an understatement to what an impact this film has had on popular culture. As today it is regarded as one of there finest along with How to Train Your Dragon, and Kung Fu Panda. Shrek offers a mixture of laughter and satire, while also throwing in some drama and action. The voice talent is one thing DreamWorks knows how to do, and every single character is voiced by a major celebrity. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow, and Cameron Diaz, heck even Larry King has a role in this. I was so excited to see the second film, but that's for another time. Now to grade.

A Parody of Delight,"""Shrek"" is a great movie on every aspect; though animated, the characters look twice as real than any other cartoon character or CGI character for that matter. It's also a cruel movie poking fun at all of those 'soft' Walt Disney characters that people cherish in their time; now with the DreamWorks film, Shrek is a one of a kind and introducing a new hero and supporting characters.The synopsis of ""Shrek"" involves a seven foot green ogre who calls himself Shrek terrifies the people in the village. The beast has signs telling people to stay out of his swamp in which villagers want him dead, but yet, he's so harmless that in the prologue of the film, he reads ""Sleeping Beauty"" in the restroom, takes a bath in the swamp, brushes his teeth with goo and lives in an abandon rock house. In the film, he tells a creature that he is rejected by society.To those who recognize Shrek's voice, that is Mike Myers of ""Saturday Night Live"" fame and from the ""Wayne's World"" series. Though the original actor was intended for the late Chris Farley, Mike brings a presence to the jolly green giant in which not only do we laugh with the character, but we feel for him as well.Lord Farquea, (voice by John Lithgow) who resembles Disney CEO John Eisner, wants to get rid of every single fairy tale creature living in DuLac and the only way he does is by cutting off the legs of the Gingerbread Man and torturing him by drowning him in a vase of milk. As part of his quest, he wants to marry a princess in order to become king and during a parody of ""Love Connection,"" the magic mirror points out Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) out of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.Now all of the fairy tale creatures are captured by Lord Farquea's men and are paying those who have those creatures; we see the three bears, the three little pigs, the seven dwarfs, and Pinocchio in cages. There is one creature who manages to escape and that is Donkey (Eddie Murphy), a talkative donkey that never really shuts up, but in the end is always right. He is saved by Shrek after being chased by the guards and decides to stick with him, though Shrek didn't say anything, now Donkey wants to live with Shrek though the green creature wants peace and quiet.To skip the rest of the story, Shrek and Donkey decide to go after Farquea and go rescue Princess Fiona in order for Shrek to keep his land. Along the way, we get to see the comedy and relationship between Donkey and Shrek, like Abbott and Castello where no matter what situation comes between them they are a duo.""Shrek"" is a funny movie that I will leave the rest of the film for viewers to see; it almost reminds me of ""Young Frankenstein"" in which the parody and jokes were subtle, though it has the cruelness of ""Blazing Saddles"" (relax, they're no slurs) I still enjoy ""Shrek"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

How did his subjects feel about this ""perfect"" society?

A New Spin on the Fairy Tale.,"Visually stunning and technically impressive, but somewhat over-rated animated flick that makes fun of itself way too often. The princess is to be rescued by an ogre and a wise-cracking donkey after being forced to by an evil king who has kicked all fairy tale creatures out of their land. But she does have a secret that few could have guessed and the film tries to warm the heart during its final act, but by that time it was nearly too late. ""Shrek"" is one of those odd films that uses smoke and mirrors to make it seem a lot better than it really is. It is a good film, but to me it was much weaker than recent Disney films that have used similar animation techniques (""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""A Bug's Life""). Its story-telling is a bit out-there and that is the main problem I had with the film. It is also more adult-oriented as many children will not understand the gags and many adults will be turned off by some of the situations and dialogue. ""Shrek"" is historical as it is the very first winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar, but in time ""Shrek"" could be more of a curiosity than a classic. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Shrek Maybe Ugly But Here He Sparkles with Charm and Irreverence!,"Shrek (Mike Myers) is a green, obnoxious ogre who bathes (and gargles) in mud, is notoriously flatulent and makes a candle out of his earwax. He knows perfectly well he's not welcome in polite society and just wants is to be left alone in his swamp. But Shrek has a couple of problems. One is a stubborn, trash-talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has latched onto him and the other is the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow, subtly underplaying), who has dumped all the disenfranchised fairytale creatures of the land in Shrek's backyard. So the Seven Dwarfs hauling a dead Snow White around in her glass casket, the Three Bears, Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf and a horde of other beloved Disney characters turn up in the swamp of our misanthropic ogre and spoil his view with their squalid refugee camp. Shrek cuts a deal with the nasty Lord to get his solitude back: Rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz, surprisingly amazing) from the castle guarded by a fire-breathing dragon and his land will be cleared of the squatters. So the reluctant ogre goes on his quest, with the yammering Donkey at his side. They encounter the dragon, which has a soft spot for donkeys, and rescue Fiona so that she can marry Farquaad. Things then get complicated, and quite adorable, as Shrek finds a soft spot for the lady. But the Princess does not only have real chemistry with the ogre, but also a dark secret of her own.Some wise guys sure had a blast making Shrek. That's certain. You can feel the snap, crackle and the pop of creation here as talented animators take a classic story and twist it to make fun of both fairy tales and the Disney behemoth. No one has attempted to take the starch out of these beloved icons, never with such wicked glee. ""Though she lives with seven men, she's not easy!"" barks Shrek about Snow White while Cinderella is called ""a mentally abused shut-in"" – with riotous irreverence, they lampoon every once-sacred characteristic of the nursery kingdom. Whether any of this is actionable is for the courts to decide. But in the court of public opinion, it's hilarious! You can almost picture the makers giggling as they come up with non-stop wisecracks, stopping only to groove on the computer images they've made. From the lush countryside that Shrek roams through, to the amazing, textured faces on each of its characters, Shrek is a stunning achievement. The animation is used subtly and intelligently, with great humor, never pushing things further than the technology will allow. Its musical scenes are unusually powerful, its wit remarkably vicious, its central love story genuinely touching.What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers. Shrek may be a mean, green halitosis machine, but it doesn't take long to love him, warts and all, thanks to Mike Myers who reprises his Scottish accent to great comic effect. Eddie Murphy steals every scene he's in with equal parts bounce and warmth as the yakky Donkey and practically gallops off with the movie.With improbable finesse, Shrek buffs up some of the oldest tropes of storytelling and then gives them a mischievous tilt, so that we appear to be watching a celebration of a genre and a sneaky subversion of it at the same time. It is an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One word: Hype,"I really don't understand the big deal of Shrek. It's supposed to be this amazing movie because it has done so well and everything about it is great. I saw it on video and enjoyed it, but it really, really doesn't live up to the hype. Visually it's stunning, but that is the only thing that is stunning about Shrek. The message is so overdone and the ending is very predictable. Not to mention that the movie has no plot, and there's nothing to look forward to towards the end. Not to mention the ""choice"" words in the movie not intended for children. Good for kids to watch a few times, but not one to enjoy over and over again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Enchanting, but conflicted","The good: DreamWorks has pushed the envelope even further, somehow. The characters feel like they've popped right off the fairy-tale page, though a few of the drawn ""extras"" feel a bit cardboard-ish, given what we now know of digital capability in the animated realm. There are some breath-robbing humorous scenes and stand-on-the-table musical numbers (a remake of the Monkees' ""I'm a Believer"" will stick with you), which will keep the turnstiles clicking. Kudos to the writers for going to the edge for hilarity's sake. It pays off well.The bad: At times the pace is slower than Lord Farquaad's wit and there are too many run-of-the-mill references to bodily functions. The film tries too hard to please all of its too-wide demographic, and at times pleases no one. There were more than a few restless tykes at the theater. When they're not happy, few others are. And Eddie? We've heard that voice before. You mean none of the voices from either of the ""Nutty Professor"" movies was available, you had to go with (albeit far less raw) stand-up tones? Irritating, given the fact that Donkey is chattier than all combined on ""The View.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
passionless pastiche of pop-culture,"I did laugh several times during the movie. Yet some of the times I did, I could at the same time not suppress a feeling of uneasiness on account of the children sitting (and laughing) behind me. The jokes I am talking about were bordering on tastelessness and morbidity. Wiping one's behind  seems to be a major motif in the movie, but that should perhaps be expected from Myers (whom I do enjoy in films designed for a mature audience). Yet exploding birds and inflated frogs are something I do not want my eventual children to see. Certainly the tips-of-the-hat, as for example to every fairy-tale I have ever heard, are funny, but that is all that the film consists of. There is no originality, all is a spin-off or spoof. The dialogues between the donkey and Shrek are funny if you are five years old and haven't seen Mulan (there Eddie Murphy lends his voice to the same side-kick character, the little dragon, where his now cliche joke slang had far more intelligence and originality), Aladdin or Hercules. Same old jokes, and even triter for the repetition. The only times I laughed were the above mentioned instances of risque tastelessness a la There's Something About Mary; I am not contradicting myself here, all I said was that they are absolutely unfit for an audience of children. Shrek is certainly a mirror unto our American Culture. Pro-wrestling, hip-hop slang and Myers' fake British accent a la mode, theme park parking lots and pop songs. All that assembled in a better-than-life digital pastiche, voila. More money for DreamWorks. They have the technology but lack the creativity. They have the precision but lack all passion. I felt curiously empty after the movie.

Cute for all ages,"Shrek is a computer animation film that deconstructs the classic fairy tale and reassembles it, reminiscent of Neil Diamond's ""I'm a Believer."" The film, which premieres on the Croisette at the Cannes International Film Festival, is compared to Disney's Dumbo, which plays the tale of ""The Ugly Duckling."" The title character, an ogre with terrible table manners, is the epitome of a fairy-tale hero who hates everyone and lives apart from society in a swamp. A pint-size despot named Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) banishes all fairy-tale critters to Shrek's swamp, causing his tranquility to be disrupted by blind mice, dancing bears, homeless pigs, a wooden boy with a long nose, and a big, bad wolf. However, the magic of a talking donkey (played by Eddie Murphy) undoes Shrek's existence, as the magic would be if he could get Donkey to shut up. Shrek is expected to be a hit with audiences worldwide, as it expands the visual palette of computer animation and showcases the wit and compassion of CG animators at PDI/DreamWorks. Shrek accepts Donkey as his guide to the kingdom of Duloc, where Farquaad is ensconced in a castle and landscape of pristine cleanliness. They make a deal: Shrek will rescue Farquaad's Princess Bride from a fire-belching dragon and return his swamp. They journey to the Dragon's forbidden fortress, surrounded by a boiling lava moat. The Dragon turns out to be the female of the species, and she falls in love with Donkey. Princess Fiona (played by Cameron Diaz) is a modern princess with specific ideas about her rescuer's behavior. The film is filled with puns, anachronistic wisecracks, and sly naughtiness, with modern music leaning towards the modern. The film's chief problem is a structural one. Once Shrek and Donkey breech the Dragon's dark castle and remove the Princess, nothing opposes their progress. The Ogre and Fiona must come to terms with their mutual appearances and realize that looks can deceive, but the characters are never in real jeopardy, which undermines the dramatic tension.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Crying from laughter. Very funny animation and movie.,"Shrek is what you would NOT call your average romance comedy. You would call it an above average, with some hilarious lines and scenes in it. I really do enjoy this. As Mike Myers voices Shrek, Eddie Murphy voices the donkey, Cameron Diaz voices the Princess Fiona, and John Lithgo voices Lord Farquad. A delight. 10 out of 10!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"not bad, but, jeez, settle down, folks","The animation is pretty terrific in Shrek, but the story is fairly straightfoward, marginal stuff.  I don't know why critics and audiences trip over themselves to overpraise stuff like this and Chicken Run (which was a smidgen better than Shrek), and God, don't get me started on Spy Kids, Leaving Las Vegas, or L.A. Confidential.  I simply have to think that the audience isn't as saturated in film and plot as I might be, and critics are so desperate for anything worthwhile that The English Patient starts looking really, really good.Okay, so that's getting more personal than I usually like to be, so let's get on to the movie itself.  Naw, let's just summarize: if you can grab a matinee and keep your expectations in check (the Emperor wears SOME clothes), this is a decent amusement.  That's about it.  I burst out laughing once, precisely (a certain scene involving a bird and its nest of eggs), and caught a few grins here and there.  Word has been spread that the delight of Shrek is that it constantly does the unexpected; I simply can't agree.  That sort of mania happens precisely once (see above); everything else I saw coming before I'd bought my ticket.  It does its thing fairly well, but the main attraction here is the rendering process.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Classic,"With a terrific all-star cast, no pun intended, and an incredibly funny and tender screenplay- Shrek takes its fairy tale toots to another level in the best way possible. Mike Meyers is absolutely perfect in the role of Shrek, giving us the obvious humor we would expect from him and a surprising amount of heart as well. Eddie Murphy is also equally excellent as his partner Donkey, as well as the iconic Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona. The animation is fantastic, colorful, and delightful. Some of the cinematography has not aged quite well- feeling almost video game levels of quality at times, but the look of the film in general is quite impressive- and always fun to watch. The film can be a bit awkward with its take on romance, but it also fits quite perfectly for the scenario at hand, and in the end- truly embraces its amount of heart in the best way possible. In the end, Shrek is a brilliant and timeless animated classic. It may not hold up as well as its 2001 competitor Monster's Inc. But it still makes its mark.My Rating: 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Definitely all-time cartoon!,"Shrek is a cartoon that can proudly be considered a classic of animation. When I was a child,I used to rewatch it a lot of times,and I never got tired of doing this. However,I was really surprised that even now I take pleasure rewatching it again. Plot based on the 1990 fairy tale picture book of the same name by William Steig,nonetheless Dreamwork's directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson made incredible work!At first it may seem that the plot is focused on green org, who is trying to return his swamp. However, later it becomes clear that the real morals of the cartoon are hidden in the subsequent interactions of the main characters-the sudden love of Shrek and the secrets of Fiona.Due to the fact,that movie was created in 2001, it is still pleasing to the eye. Humor sometimes seemed to be potty,although children like such type of one. Moreover, voice cast are amazing- Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy etc. On the top of that music is goat! Musical accompaniment always stay in our hearts!To sum up,I can recommend to watch Shrek even ones in life.

Okay.  Worth a watch..,"It's not a bad movie.  There are some funny parts, but fart jokes just don't do it for me.  What in the world is so hilarious about passing gas, for crying out loud, besides it being utterly embarrassing?The animation by Pacific Data Images is first rate, although does not hold a candle in comparison to the scope, effort, and complexity that was placed in Square's ""Final Fantasy"".  As for story, I've actually found the story in ""Final Fantasy"" to be more touching and more involving than the story of ""Shrek"".  Don't get me wrong, ""Shrek"" has a decent story, but it's not quite as elaborate as ""Final Fantasy"".(In ""Final Fantasy"", you may have to watch the movie a second time to get it.

A fairy tale with a twist,"""Shrek,"" directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is a delightful animated film that turns the traditional fairy tale on its head.

Decent movie.  No really. it was.  Not joking.,"Sorry if I appear a little underenthused, but this one was just not all that it had been hyped up to be.  Sure, the technical achievement is amazing.  Some of the shots of Shrek and the environment WERE photo-realistic; others were borderline.  The inconsistency was shocking at times, especially in the beginning of the flick.  Some of the lip-synching with Fiona was just awful. Shrek went from being a full individual to a 2D cartoon without warning when the light changed.  But nevertheless, a new benchmark in the possibility of CGI has been set. As far as the story goes, I was less than amazed.  Cute individual scenes, and loaded with great one-liners, but never really flowing the whole way through.  You could tell that they had been through several re-writes, trying to please every target audience.  From the crude bathroom humor for the boys, the twisted love story for the girls, to the life lessons for the parents, this is another that aimed with an elephant gun.

So saying that Disney should never make another animated movie again is quite stupid. Has no one seen the classics ranging from Snow White all the way to The lion king and Alladin.But, my second favourite Disney movie is The Emperors New groove and *that* is a movie that deserved to make $250million not this load of trash.And Shrek is no where near the standard of Toy Story 2 and the original Toy Story. Even A Bugs Life was better.ALL HAIL DREAMWORKS..? yeah, they took pot shots at the company that started not only the original animation (with Snow White) but also started the craze that they are using. 3D animation. Yeah, Disney came up with it. Shrek isn't revolutionary. it's not ground breaking, it's been done before.

Now it seems a bit overshadowed by other entries, including ""How To Train Your Dragon"", but clearly they knew what they were doing with the computer-generated medium, and knew how to craft a story from classic elements.Some have said it is best to forget the film had sequels and just focus on the original.

Inspired animation,"I'm glad I finally got round to seeing this movie and I was pleasantly surprised because Shrek has the guts to follow it's own path and doesn't feel the need to follow the same old formula's used by so many film makers today. Yes we recognise that it's essentially a love story, BUT IT HAS A GOOD SCRIPT and it's also about the battle to be brave. I hope that children do see how the fairy tale characters we love so much are set free by this film. They are able to express their individuality as we all should. Children are much tougher and much more intelligent than adults give them credit and it's views such as those that we hear in these forums which dull a child's mind.The 3D character animation is top quality for it's day, intelligent and often subtle. This film breaks a lot of boundaries previously uncrossed in family animation. Take your children to see it, talk to them about it afterwards and see why they like it - find out who they are! Shrek addresses the world we live in today, it celebrates film making and story telling and it has a wonderful, broad range of characters. If anything there wasn't enough time to pack it all in. It wasn't perfect, but it was very good and certainly A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A New Journey: An Adults View,"When looking at the previews for Shrek, I thought it was going to be an animation blast, but at a child's mentality. Was I wrong! The film looks at the other side of life: That of the ogre who lives alone and is happy yet missing something. What that is, you decide for yourself. Shrek plays the part of the ogre for the village, scaring them away from his home. He does so with humor and wit, yet never forgetting that he will always be seen as the horrible, green monster that he is.Also, the humor in this movie is ""layered"" for all ages, so you can see that their is more to ""Shrek"" than meets the eye.It takes a Donkey, a quest, and a Princess, to make Shrek see that he is more than just what people see. He is a friend, a hero, and a knight in ""small"" armor, that makes this movie more than your average fairy tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent!,"This film set out to make fun of just about every sappy ultra-Disneyfied children's movie that has  ever been made, and it blows them out of the park!

"Far from being just another Mickey Mouse animation; Shrek is a good natured, well pitched animated film which ticks enough boxes.","Shrek begins with in a fanciful, overly romantic tone as what we assume to be an off screen narrator speaks in warm voice whilst dictating to us the words accompanying the images of your more stereotypical fairy-tale novella. After a few pages, it's revealed the narrator was, in fact, the titular character turning the pages before we hear him scoffing at such literature and verbally dismissing it as nonsense. What follows is the tearing out of a page from the book in order to use the item, now rendered a loose discarded piece of paper, for other such activities too crude to mention here; a plain-as-day rejecting of such unreal narrative notions and elements in order for other usages after the establishment that such notions do exist. While hinting at revision, one cannot deny that by the time all things have been said and done and the film has reached its emotionally charged climax, 2001 digitally animated comedy Shrek is, in hindsight, all too keen to resort to such codes in order to push home its would-be emotional drive. The film never really struck me as the great; fun-for-all; computer animated glory-fest is has done to others, but more-so as a decent adventure film with its politics all in the right place and an effective buddy comedy toing and froing between three very distinct, very irregular but highly characterised central performers.When the door to the outhouse in which the titular Shrek resides during that opening swings open revealing our lead, we get a good look at both the large green Ogre that Mike Myers voices and the sort of life he leads for the first time. Inhabiting a secluded swamp in the not so dense forest of an enchanted land, the beast has a grotesque but functioning way of living which sends up many-a human traits such as the brushing of one's teeth; preparing meals and taking showers thus burring lines between what might constitute as anthropomorphism and a character in a narrative framework you could just as easily humanify – in a world rife with both human beings and distinct fictitious, fairy-tale/nursery-rhyme characters, Shrek beclouds is the bridge between the two predominant interspecies. He lives a lonely life, but one which he very-much enjoys; a peaceful one, despite being somewhat ferocious but a functioning one despite the isolation. Early on, it's established the height he has over human-beings as well as the problems he appears to have with those of an authoritarian ilk; the fear-factor Shrek possess arriving in-tow and giving him a mark advantage over most.Around him sees a land ruled by the tyrannical, imperialist Lord Farquaad (Lithgow); a man besotted with rounding up each and every anthropomorphic character, ranging from Pinnochio to the three blind mice, that plagues his kingdom so as to place them in a ghetto-like locale which just happens to double up as Shrek's lonely pad. Farquaad inhabits a walled in central hub named Duloc, which sports a Disney World-like entrance, in which he distributes his evilness; the torturing of innocents and the ruing of not having a partner seemingly his day's norm. With the bad news dished out and a severe disrupture to Shrek's already established world looming, the ogre takes it upon himself whilst aided by Eddie Murphy's motor-mouthed Donkey, whom through one means or another stumbles into his life, to venture out and deal with this problem in the most direct and no-nonsense of fashions. However, Shrek's arrival at Duloc to see Farquaad only complicates matters when the ruler offers him the chance to rid his land of the creatures so as to retain his old ways if he so manages to bring Pricness Fiona (Diaz) back from a dragon guarded tower so as to marry him.The journey back to the kingdom following the obtaining of Fiona sees the film hint at some rather unorthodox traits that Fiona may sport, her ability to interact with the world around her in an uncanny fashion leading to later reveals. All of this gives way to the film's chief politic: that it's better to be who you are and admit to it than cover up and attempt to be somebody else, and in sticking true-to-yourself, you will eventually find more in the form of happiness than you would living a surface lie. There can be little doubt the team behind the film put an awful lot of effort into proceedings; the film sporting numerous moments that display their eye for detail, an instance in which the overly powerful lead accidentally yanks a door handle clean out of its hinges upon impatiently dragging a character from where they were in a room to the exit one of them – made even funnier when we realise that character is wittering on with poetic but humorous waffling, a slight instance which is easy to miss and yet has had precise craft to it. The film is a middling effort, a short and sharp and breezy tale of a somewhat self-centred lead operating with a free-spirited and friendly supporting character whose livelihood is itself in jeopardy; the reoccurring question as to whether the lead will be able to achieve a sort of parity as well as see the error of his ways essentially what's being tested. Its messages and ideas are explored in a routine and passable enough manner, the bulk of it fairly simplistic without exploring any particularly brilliant territory, but it isn't without charm nor some genuinely amusing or indeed heartfelt moments even if it is running on adrenalised formula.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Just what a ""kid's movie"" should be","In my mind, this is what a kids film should really look like.  There's enough to keep the kids entertained, so they don't start to moan, but enough to keep the parents dragged along glued to the screen.Myself, I'm a grown up lover of kids movies. This one really hits the spot. There are no running gags found in other movies, but a regular supply of one liners and surprises, keeping all viewers interested.I'm not a big fan of Mike Myers, but I have to admit, he fitted his character. But, I would have to say that the movie once again should go to the sidekick, played by Eddie Murphy.  As often happens, he gets most of the gags and one liners.  Surprisingly though, for a change, he doesn't actually bring all the attention upon himself, as the sidekick usually does, for me anyway.  The cast makes as many jokes as the character they play normally would.As a film, Shrek breaks the mould, shatters it, and grinds it to dust,  not only are there unorthodox parts (no knight, but an ogre, no sweet princess, but a girl with a mind of her own, and no tall, domineering bad guy, but a wimpy shrimp) but the even mention it throughout the film.To me, this is a spoof of every fairy tale known to man, all put together into a movie.  A must see for children, parents and those wishing they were young enough not to be self conscious to go and see it.  When I went to see this movie, a couple who must have been in their sixties were there, laughing with everyone else.  That really said it all.

"Not bad, but I don't get why people love it","I found some very funny things to laugh at in ""Shrek"" and managed to enjoy it somewhat. However, I simply don't understand why people are so crazy about this film. It's funny, but not that funny. Often times it comes off as just annoying and not very funny, with crude humor and jokes that don't make me laugh much at all. It can be a fun film, with great lines that you'll remember forever, particularly those from Donkey (Eddie Murphey), such as ""I'm makin' waffles"" or ""Pick me, pick me."" Those lines are great, but I personally don't see this as a monumental film at all. Sure, it entertains, but I don't see how it revolutionizes Hollywood. Eddie Murphey is a perfect voice for Donkey, but Mike Meyers doing a strange accent for Shrek just comes off odd to me. Cameron Diaz is also as annoying as always, and I wish her character was more lovable. It would move the film along better. Without giving it away, the way Lord Farquod is done away with (killed) is very unappealing and sudden to me. The ending doesn't really work. All in all, enjoyable, but not a film that should be so big and popular.

Donkey is an Outstanding Character!!!,This movie is perfect for all ages which is what all excellent movies are. The jokes are actually really clever and original which is pretty rare these days.

The lines of this character are just outstanding and when you add to that how well they are said by Eddie it just makes for the perfect character.

"Could have been, but wasn't.","Before getting around to viewing Shrek, I waited until much of the hype and product tie-ins faded. (This took a bit of time. Luckily, I was able to see Final Fantasy and Monsters, Inc.)On the surface, it seemed to have the potential to stand out in a less-than-exciting year. The films creators assembled a core of quality actors to provide voices, the music sounded familiar, it looked like the animation was top notch, and it even had a catchy name.I have to say I was mostly disappointed. Mostly.Shrek attempted to work on many levels at once, but as usually happens with films that try to be all things to all people, it was never able to sustain any momentum. It seemed to randomly appease parts of its target audience. There also were major shifts in plot direction during the course of the film.The plot was simplistic and predictable, the characters under-developed and disposable, and the music placement questionable at best. It's as if they amassed several of the basic elements that create good films, threw them into a giant pot, and hoped the stew tasted good. I'd hate to think that this much effort was wasted.This being said, I suppose it was the best animated-parody-comedy-musical-romance-action-fantasy-parable-family movie of the year.I guess it was unfair to see a Simpsons episode prior to viewing.I am glad, however, that it was the greatest film many people have ever seen.

Star rating: 5 out of 5,"Shrek is a 'fairytale' with all the traditional ingredients - a princess locked in a tower, a hero on a quest to save her, a scheming villain, true love leading to a happy (if somewhat unexpected) ending, and a supporting cast including everyone from a delightfully French Robin Hood to the gingerbread man.  However, Shrek is certainly not a traditional fairytale.For a start, the hero is, by his own admission, a big, smelly, ugly ogre. Secondly, this is not only a movie for kids - much of the humour will only be fully appreciated by adults.  And Shrek will have *everyone* smiling, giggling and laughing out loud.  All of the characters have their funny and memorable quotes and scenes, but the best lines come from Donkey (although occasionally he seems to be trying just a little too hard for comic effect).The computer animation is stunning and with a just a little imagination you can see that the characters somewhat resemble the actors who provide their voices.  There is definitely a bit of Eddie Murphy in Donkey anyway.  It is perhaps the attention to detail that is most impressive - the facial expressions are just fabulous.   Shrek is a must-see film, because almost everyone will find something to like about it (although perhaps not those who like their fairy tales to be predictable and perfect).

"A Clever, Creative & Comical Delight For Viewers Of All Ages","Establishing DreamWorks Animation as the first real competitor to Pixar Animation Studios, Shrek is a clever, creative & comical delight that finds its creators firing on all cylinders and is a wonderfully animated & endlessly entertaining tale that works for viewers of all ages.The story follows an ogre whose peaceful life in the swamp is disrupted when many magical creatures show up at his place. To drive them out, he strikes a deal with an evil lord for whom he must rescue a princess & bring her to him in exchange for his land, and is joined by a talking donkey on his quest.Directed by Andrew Adamson & Vicky Jenson, Shrek comes jam-packed with gags & parodies, all incorporated into a storyline that's simple in structure, easy to follow, and features elements that are more targeted at grown-ups, thus succeeding as an adventure that has something in store for all demographics.All the set pieces & characters are cleverly imagined, expertly designed & skilfully rendered. The relevant characters exhibit sufficient depth and are easy to relate to. Voice actors bring their A-game to infuse life & soul into these animated caricatures, with Eddie Murphy effortlessly winning hearts & stealing the show as Donkey.On an overall scale, Shrek is an end-product of clever imagination, intelligent writing & top-notch animation and though the latter aspect appears slightly dated today, the story hasn't lost much of its magical charm & hilarious wit. Taking a dig at Disney & proving its animation studio to be a worthy challenger to Pixar, Shrek is still one of DreamWorks Animation's finest films to date.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Even the dragon, another evil monster, is converted to goodness by love. This half funny half tender episode of the love between the she-dragon and the small donkey is another ingredient that makes this tale a wonderful story where all the traditional characters of almost all the children's fairy tales are also present though only for a short while turning it into some kind of revival of all those tales.

Good fun for both children and adults,"An Ogre and a donkey go on a quest to rescue a princess from a fire breathing dragon.Shrek is an enjoyable romantic comedy with strong voice performances.This take on the 'far far away' fairytale land is an amusing concept and puts an entertaining twist on the Princess meet handsome Prince theme. In this image-obsessed world where the fairytale princess reigns supreme, it is refreshing to be presented with a deconstruction of the Disney formula and a message that says beauty not only comes from within, but you do not have to look like Barbie and Ken to be happy. There are also some nice themes about prejudice and the judgement of outsiders that works well.The comic banter between characters generally works for both children and adults. Obviously it depends on your own sense of humour for how funny you will find it. Most of it I think is good, but it is loud, non-stop, and in my opinion prioritises the quantity over quality of gags in some instances. However, that is just my personal take on it, others my love it all.Voice performances are all superb thanks to a cast of famous comic talent. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are a great lead double act, Cameron Diaz is a perfect Fiona, and John Lithgow puts his distinctive voice and persona to great effect as Prince Farquaad.Visually it is much like the early days of Pixar in showcasing groundbreaking 3D animation. There is some humorous spoofing of Disney Princess movies and also the action style of the The Matrix.The soundtrack uses pop songs in addition to the original score and these are generally placed well, but I think overall it is slightly overdone.It kept my daughter's attention from about the age of 4-5 years old and this is held in high regard in my house.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The film's significance in animation history is also noteworthy; it pushed boundaries and set a new standard for animated storytelling with its unique blend of comedy and heart.However, Shrek does have some weaknesses. The plot is somewhat predictable, following a familiar pattern that becomes evident as the story progresses. While the animation was groundbreaking at the time, it now feels a bit dated compared to today's high standards. That said, considering it was among the early entries in CGI animation, this is understandable and forgivable.In conclusion, Shrek is a charming and enjoyable film with a clever story and lots of humor that still holds up well. Although it has some predictable elements and its animation feels a bit dated, these minor flaws don't overshadow its impact and entertainment value. It's a classic that continues to entertain and bring smiles, reflecting its well-deserved place in animation history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the best movies I've seen,"A true classic, this movie entails humor and a slight meaning that all Disney movies have of being yourself. It has many well known actors such as Eddie Murphy who plays the comedic character ""Donkey"" who, you guessed it, is a donkey. It is a light movie that is enjoyable to watch in your free time.

Beware of the Ogre,"Another winner from DreamWorks. Now that the golden age of animation that marked the turn of the century seems to be abating, looking back 'Shrek' can now be seen as a high water mark.The role of a great big ogre isn't exactly a perfect physical match for Michael Myers, who provides the voice (complete with a rather charming Scots accent); and whoever thought of casting Eddie Murphy as his sidekick - who certainly puts the ass into 'badass' certainly showed novelty.Knowing how fiercely protective of their copyright Disney are, I wonder how the fleeting appearances by the Three Little Pigs, the talking mirror, Snow White and Pinocchio all cost (although they're careful not to actually identified the latter by name).Two visual flourishes I liked were a scene in a field of sunflowers and Princess Fiona's green dress (she manages to look cute even as an ogre); while the scene with the eggs is memorably macabre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Very Good Animated Movie,"""Shrek"" is every bit as good as the classic Disney animation films (or at least many of them). Of course, animation has improved over the decades, ""Shrek"" being filmed using the new 3-D CGI. But animation is not what made the Disney classics great movies. It was the stories, the characters and the music. The full sweep of drama, comedy, and adventure that was available to live action, except with animation. These movies are for adults as much as for kids. ""Shrek"" is also in this class, although the story might seem a little thin and pedestrian.

"You will laugh! Excellent, humorous, sophisticated, entertaining...","_Shrek_ is an entertaining film that is simply funny, but also satirical and often sarcastic.

It's very funny, and does have something for everyone.The plot is fairly predictable, though it does have a few surprises, and it does leave a couple mysteries unanswered at the end of the movie.The animation is fantastic, but of course it does have a distinctive ""digitized"" style that feels like watching a PlayStation 2 game for 90 minutes. Really a wonderful achievement, but it may not be something everyone appreciates.The use of music was one of my favorite parts of the film: from Eddie Murphy's (as the Donkey) intentionally horrible, toneless renditions of a couple soul classics early in the film, to some well-placed sentimental, pop tunes later in the film, the music really goes a long way towards making the film more enjoyable and humorousFinal verdict: A fun, funny film that can entertain adults and children and which puts an affirming twist on the ""ugly duckling"" tale.

One of the best CG films ever,"There's a good chance you're deliberately trying to kill Disney if you put together countless fairy tale marvels and then mash them to pulp. 'Shrek' is a fairy tale story from DreamWorks, starring Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow. Shrek (Myers) is an ogre who lives in a swamp, not wanting to meet anyone, and dispatching the occasional band of torch-bearing villagers with consummate ease. Until a bunch of fairy tale creatures are relocated to his land by Lord Farquaad (Lithgow), a vertically-challenged tyrant who wants to cleanse his land of the magical creatures. When Shrek and Donkey (Murphy), a fast-talking jackass who tags along with the ogre to lead him to the kingdom, reach Farquaad's realm of DuLoc, they defeat all his knights. The Lord strikes a bargain with Shrek: if Shrek and Donkey can rescue Princess Fiona (Diaz) from her dragon-guarded castle, he will give Shrek his swamp back. So the duo set off. 'Shrek' is unlike any other animated film before. Instead of the righteous, heroic protagonist of traditional Disney fare, the star here is a temperamental, rather unlikable fellow, it being his inclination to be hostile as he correctly thinks everybody hates him. Donkey is his only real friend, the one who forgives Shrek for his despicable behavior, as he is even astier to Donkey than he is to most others. Fiona is the typical high-strung princess, not taking kindly anyone who compromises her dignity, and a true believer in true love, something Shrek scoffs at. The animation is revolutionary, looking more realistic than anything before. However, in three years, 'Shrek 2' and 'Finding Nemo' have surpassed it. 'Shrek' is something for all ages, except for the overprotective parents who mind the occasional rude joke. On the whole, the comedy of the film is what makes it timeless. 'Shrek' is a must-watch for anyone.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Animation gone wild.,"In this Dreamworks animated film, green ogre Shrek discovers his swamp has been bombarded with fairytale creatures by the scheming Lord Farquaad who wants to be King, and sends Shrek to fetch him the Princess Fiona in return for his swamp back. In the process, Shrek falls in love with Fiona, who has a secret of her own.This movie is one wild animation ride, full of mildly funny jokes and gags and adventurous scenes you've come to expect from an animated movie. This film also makes references or pokes fun to scores of other animated movies, mostly notably ones from Disney, and live-action movies such as Jurassic Park - almost like a Who Framed Roger Rabbit feature, but not as tastefully done considered the amount of modern twists and crude puns.Shrek is a typical fairy tale with a somewhat exciting story that also delves into the friendship between Shrek and Donkey, voiced by comedians Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. Put the two together, you could get an unending laugh-fest that keeps the movie going.Overall, it's a very average animated film. It's fine for the children, but with parent supervision.Grade C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Not funny at all,"This is one of the most over-hyped, underwhelming movie experiences I have ever had.  In short, the story is flat and the humor is empty.

But for those who demand a richer level of wit, you will be incredibly disappointed. This movie THINKS it is witty and edgy... but even its more mature jokes (i.e. When Shrek remarks ""I think Lord Farquaad is 'compensating' for something"" while staring at the Lord's giant castle), are old, tired, and boring.

"Definately an anti-Disney film, but has the same humble qualities to any pixar film","Shrek is truly a gem in the standards of animation, which it truly deserved any award that it received, especially the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Why? Well, it was just the best-animated film of that year!A truly unique adaptation to a children's picture book, where in the book Horribly hideous Shrek leaves home and terrifies everyone he encounters in his search for his equally ugly bride. While the feature film makes this somewhat simple children's story into a hilarious anti-Disney animated comedy! Now, according to the film, our title character (voiced brilliantly by Mike Myers) is an agreeable enough ogre who wants to live his days in peace. When the diminutive Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) evicts local fairy tale creatures (including the now-famous Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man), they settle in the ogre's swamp and Shrek wants answers from Farquaad. A quest of sorts starts for Shrek and his new pal, a talking donkey (played brilliantly by the incredible comedian Eddie Murphy), where battles have to be won and a princess (Cameron Diaz) must be rescued from a dragon lair in a thrilling action sequence! This plot is the kind of entertainment that certainly made the film the beloved classic that it is today!This is definitely suitable for anyone that hates Disney films (so I will like it as I cannot stand their over-rated pieces of work) as this spoofs most of their films, from Pinocchio all the way to Mulan, was ironically Murphy was involved! However, I disagree that it spoofs Pixar, except spoofing the good A Bug's Life. But, to be honest I find Pixar branded Disney, just because this conglomerate presents their work is a bit pointless, as all the work of Pixar is ten times better then the stuff Disney spew out to the public throughout the years. But I do not just make a contrast to Pixar films because that it is done wonderfully in computer animation, or that one of its films, Monster's Inc., was up for that Oscar too, but because it possesses the qualities that make Pixar films excellent. First of all the humour, visually and verbally, great music, by earning Bafta, Saturn, and Grammy nominations to prove it, and family appeal, colourful characters for the kids and interesting humour and spoofs of action films for the adults!So what I can I say to conclude my review. Great Voices provided by a brilliant cast to one of the best films to be based on a children's book! In addition, with many Annies for its impressive animation, this film has plenty of awards to prove its brilliance! Overall, definitely an anti-Disney film but has the same humble qualities to any Pixar film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Original and smart!,"Disney has often followed on a set of ""guidelines"" to making all of their films work: a beautiful princess in some kind of peril (ie: Sleeping Beauty is under a spell to make her sleep, Snow White ate the poisoned apple, Cinderella wants to go the ball, etc.).  These films often work on some level, but originality is often lacking in fairy tales, which always come from some source.  Plus, they teach lessons that don't exactly behoove the viewer, often the impressionable young child (lessons in infatuation--what fairy tale didn't have some prince with a superiority complex wanting to be king, and spotting a beautiful girl from across the room, and saying ""She's the one.""????  You NEVER see Prince Wonderful courting Lovely Lady around, do you?  Ok, ok, I'll get off my soapbox now.  ""Shrek"" completely goes against the grain in terms of fairy tale concepts by adding a whole new twist to the genre, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is an ugly green ogre living in a ramshackle house in the swamp by himself, without a care in the world.  When Lord Farquaad (voice of John Lithgow) banishes all ""fairy tale creatures"" from the land, Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy), who talks too much, escapes from his owner and the clutches of the people who are taking him away, and goes to Shrek's swamp and begs Shrek to take him in, and Shrek unwillingly does just that.  When all the fairy tale creatures are dumped on his property, Shrek complains to Farquaad. Farquaad, a diminuitive lord with a superiority complex, wants to be king, and after consulting his magic mirror, he sees the woman he would like to have for his bride, and tells Shrek that he will remove the fairy tale creatures from his property if Shrek can bring him his future bride, Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz).This movie is probably one of the funniest animated movies I've seen in a long time.  I'm a Disney fan, but I've strayed from their ""fairy tale"" pictures due to a lack of interest, and have geared my interest to different (and original) animated stories.  This one is truly original in every way, even though it recycles familiar fairy tale characters (the 7 dwarfs, Pinochio, Cinderella, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, etc), but in a humorous way.  The actors themselves (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow) are great in their parts, and the supporting voices and characters are what makes this film great.  There are so many inside jokes that this movie would tend to fly right over a child's head.  there are also alot of sight gags that the viewer would easily miss the first time around.I don't have one absolute favorite scene, because this whole movie was hysterically funny and smart.  However, some of them stand out in mind. The ""gingerbread man"" was classic, with the famous cookie lying on a cookie pan, legs broken off, with a glass of milk next to him.  His ""tourture"" was getting dipped in the milk and the threat of his buttons getting ripped off. When Farquaad tells him to confess, Gingerbread Man screams ""Eat me!"" and spits.  Another great scene was the ""Merry Men"" singing their song, which turns into the suspended-motion scene from ""The Matrix"" with Fiona lifting into the air in the ""karate-kick"" motion, the action freezes, the angle rotates, and Fiona kicks two Merry Men at the same time.  The part with the magic mirror was also hillarious.  I like how the mirror was honest with Farquaad, informing him that ""he really wasn't a king, and this isn't a kingdom,"" to which Farquaad gestures to Thelonious as to what happens to a ""lying"" mirror (Thelonious punches a small handheld mirror), and the mirror counteracts ""...but you can be king,"" and shows three different women, ""Dating Game"" style.  The scene at Farquaad's amusement park was hillarious, especially with the ""It's a Small World""-esque puppets singing.This was a great film, complete with a great cast, and is a fun story. This definitely breaks all those rules that fairy tales tend to set (and believe me, rules were made to be broken).  I am anxiously awaiting the sequel in 2004, and highly recommend this to everyone and their 5th cousin once removed (LOL!  just kidding). This is a great story of romance and wonder, and it is sure to be a hit for years to come.Donkey: Hi, Princess. Fiona: It talks!

"Funny yet strangely sincere, very well made.","A top film, clever, well paced and well animated, rather irreverent towards Disney movies and fairy tales, but far from a cynical, it was surprisingly touching in places.

As others have said it manages to both tease much of the early Disney catalogue while at the same time also making something that does still hit those timeless beats.

"A Really Funny Comedy, Sour Ending","Shrek is a hilarious spin off of a fairy tale in which Shrek (ogre, played my Mike Myers), is mad because for some strange reason all the fairy tale creatures are sent to his swamp where they create a nuisance for Shrek.

However, the style of comedy and the overall storytelling approach didn't resonate with me. While I can appreciate the creativity and animation quality, these aspects weren't enough to hold my interest or make it particularly enjoyable for me.Additionally, the characters, although beloved by many for their quirky personalities and memorable lines, didn't appeal to me in the same way. The film's reliance on pop culture references and slapstick humor, which are key elements of its charm, felt more overwhelming than entertaining.In summary, while Shrek is undoubtedly a popular and influential animated film with a strong fan base, it's not a movie that suits everyone's tastes.

Beauty is actually the keyword,"Before I start this review, I'm going to ackowledge a possibility of a sort of bias when it comes to Shrek. It is one of those movies I grew up with and lost track of how many times I've seen it over my anual rewatches. That being said, this is what makes Shrek stand out to me among many of the animated features I grew up watching. I will also just say that I'm taking a big scoop with this review meaning I will be writing about more than just Shrek itself, but it will be very relevant to the movie.First, the movies personality. Here is quite a lot to be said. I'm not sure entirely what happened in the 90s and 00s, but when it comes to mainstream media, especially music and movies, it seems that experimenting with genre blending and referentiality was all the rage.In music, it is the general rise of Hip-Hop, which is all about sampling other genres and mixing things up, in rock music spawning artists such as Linkin Park, Evanesence, RATM, RHCP and more, which were all experimental yet very mainstream, and then in pop music production we see a lot of hip hop and rock elements etc.In films genre blending was always just a bit more subtle, but some of the examples of a successful genre mixing films of this era were From Dust till Dawn, Kill Bill, The Matrix, Millenium Actress, Big Lebowski etc..Shrek has a place somewhere in there, in a really interesting era for pop culture. I'm unaware of Shrek's real influences or things Shrek itself influenced, but I imagine that with its box office succes across the series it left some kind of a last impact. I brought all of this up because I was meaning to say that Shrek might just be one of the best representatives of this era of pop culture referential, genre mixing, 'fresh perspective' type films. Also, for its time, it was a very mature movie, meaning it had a big appeal to older audiences, compared to other major box office hits as far as animated features went.The real reason why I find Shrek to be such a good representative of this era is because the fresh perspective it gave on fairytales is truly a timeless one and one that would tingle just about anyone as fairytales are no doubt deeply woven into our cultural consciousness. It may appeal a little more to the western world because of this reason, but I somehow feel that it is still something that can be appreciated on a more global level.Now, into the movie itself. The movie is absolutely beautiful. Both in its message but also how well put together it is with creating a balance between its themes, characters, scenes and music.The relationship between all of the characters means something and most are interestingly conflicting, the themes are relevant to eachother, exploring one always makes you understand the other more, for example the theme of Shrek's loneliness immediatelly makes it clear that the same case works for Donkey, Fiona, Dragon and maybe even Lord Farquaad? The scenes don't overstay their welcome and the music is always picked just so right, telling us a story we couldn't understand quite so well without it, revealing something that might not be in the frame. For example how the choice of this modern music is tying us to the Duloc audience at the tournament scene. It becomes quite obvious that most of what we see in Duloc is a satire on modern society.I find that a lot of movies, some of the Shrek sequels are guilty for this too, tend to introduce too much just to do nothing with it, not use up the runtime to explore the running themes, which are sometimes overwhelming, but instead spend it on pointless jokes and other things that will keep the movie entertaining, also making promises, if only it was just to break them, but instead the movies forget about them, use them as a mere entertainment value.Shrek is the complete opposite, it just so satisfiyingly lands on its feet with each leap it takes. Shrek, the movie, is like an onion, don't take the movie at face value, so many of the scenes are packed with meaning, its fun to just think about this movie. There is no point in breaking it down scene by scene, at least I can't in this review, I believe it spoils the fun unless its a conversation. It is certaintly very rewatchable for this reason and it will most likely continue being my annual rewatch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Quite Possibly The Best Animated Movie of It's Time...,"Shrek had everything, humor, adventure, romance, and it was also good for all ages. Little kids could enjoy this along with teens and      s. Some of the humor was above the younger viewers head and the      s found these parts funny. Shrek (while many aren't) was a good animated film, and you don't find a lot of good animated movies. Classics like this come once every couple of years. (Some animated classics include Beauty and the Beast and Monsters Inc.)The only thing I have against Shrek is the fact they are making a sequel. The first one was very, very good, but many movies that were good the sequels... well they sucked. This does not happen in all cases though. Some (i.e. Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams and The Godfather 2) pulled of a box office hit sequel.If you have never seen this movie you should check it out.

The imagination, the intelligence, the music, the visuals such a delight for the eye, the fun, the humor, the warmth of the characters, and the beautiful thought that one can be loved for something other than physical beauty.  I am a mentor for grade school children and I just cringe when children want to read Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella because these stories place such importance on the fact that the heros and heroines are physically beautiful people and villains are portrayed as ugly.  When the little girls look up at me, I can see the looming question in their eyes ""Am I beautiful?"".  Of course, I am quick to assure them that they are.  But the fact is most of them aren't and never will be even close to Fairy Princess beauty. Reading fairy-tales and watching films and television, I too often find myself wishing society would give these children a fighting chance for self confidence by teaching them to appreciate each other more for who they are rather than their lovely long blonde hair and perfect, sensual physique.

"May have gone downhill a bit for me with my last viewing, but it's still a fine accomplishment from DreamWorks Animation","This was a very successful effort from DreamWorks Animation when it was released in 2001. I didn't go to see it in theatres, and don't think I knew about it until late in 2001, after it came into stores. I remember around then being asked it I had seen the movie, but the answer was no, I think until shortly before Christmas that year. When that happened, I remember I was not disappointed. I'm not sure whether I saw the entire thing from start to finish between then and this year, but I did so a couple nights ago (I know that was the first time in quite a while), and I don't think I liked it quite as much as before, but I think it came close.Shrek is a green hermit ogre and who lives peacefully in a swamp, and is generally feared by others in the land. However, one day, he meets a talking donkey in the forest who is running from captivity, and unintentionally saves him. After this, Donkey, who has no friends, begins to follow Shrek back to his swamp, and the ogre has finally met someone who isn't afraid of him, though the chatterbox donkey will find that Shrek is very unfriendly. That night, Donkey has to sleep outside, and Shrek soon finds that his swamp is crowded with fairy tale characters! He tells them to leave, but learns that they can't! They have been banished by the evil Lord Farquaad, and have no other place to go! So, Shrek sets out with Donkey to talk to Farquaad and get his swamp back. Farquaad wants to become a king, and plans to marry Princess Fiona, who is trapped in a dragon's castle, surrounded by lava, waiting for her true love, so he makes a deal with Shrek. If the ogre rescues Princess Fiona for him, his swamp will be back the way it was. Shrek immediately accepts, and sets out with Donkey to the dragon's castle, determined to get his swamp back, but on the way back with the princess, unexpected things happen!The last two DreamWorks Animation efforts I watched prior to watching this one again were ""Shark Tale"" (which I had seen before), and ""Madagascar"". Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy, is sometimes funny, but his chattering can sometimes be a bit much, with lines such as, ""And then one time I ate some rotten berries. Man, there were some strong gases seepin' outta my butt that day!"" I may not have found the character as amusing as I did before, but the parts where he gets on Shrek's nerves tend to be good for laughs. Shrek, with a voice provided by Mike Myers, can also add to the humour, such as around the beginning with the way he suddenly appears in the presence of a bunch of hunters, talks to them about ogres, and scares them off, and other scenes where he shows his anger. The film does have some gross-out gags, including much of the opening sequence, and Shrek pulling earwax out of his ear to use for a candle. I didn't care much for those, but fortunately, there aren't too many of them. Aside from the humour, there are also some moments of excitement, including Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona running from the dragon and trying to get back across the bridge over the lava! There are also some deep, maybe touching moments, such as Shrek telling Donkey why people look at him the way they do, and the struggling romance. Last but not least, unsurprisingly, this 2001 animated feature has great 3-D animation, something I can usually say about these CGI animated films.This effort from DreamWorks Animation isn't exactly one of the greatest animated movies I've ever seen, but it still has its charm, that's for sure, and I can see why it was so successful. I was a teenager (fifteen years old) when I first saw it, not long after it was first released on video, so I obviously don't know what it's like to see it as a kid. However, it seems the movie has been enjoyed by kids and adults alike, so I guess it's one of those movies. Many people have seen ""Shrek"" in the past seven years, and it seems it hasn't been forgotten, not that it deserves to be. If you still haven't seen it, but a rather humorous, clever, well-written animated feature, parodying numerous fairy tales, sounds like something that's right up your alley, and you don't mind a bit of crudeness and toilet humour, then I see no reason why you shouldn't watch ""Shrek"" the next time you get the chance, since it hasn't failed to please most people who have seen it, it seems.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Great Comedy and Animated Film,"I loved Shrek. It might not be the best animated film but it does have incredible animation which is worth definitely the price of your money to see the film. The Gingerbread man scene was very funny and I loved the character's voice. The donkey played by Eddie Murphy was outstandingly hilarious. ""I'm making waffles!""  I do like the fights also. It's kind of funny how Shrek is so big, he just barely pushes those knights of of him very easily. Dreamworks finally makes an animated film that is great without copying Pixar's work like the films that are called ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life"" But oh well. Surely you will have to see this because I know you will enjoy it as much as I did.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
the animation is amazing,"An early XXI. century fairytale. Or rather, a parody. The animation is amazing (what else did you expect boy, this is DreamWorks...), the story and characters are entertaining, so my general impression is very good. Still, a remark on the so-called ""message"" of the movie. It is supposed to teach us to be tolerant and respectful to other people (and ogres, too ;-))). However, some of the gags went against this very message (when the frog and the snake are turned into balloons, for instance): this shows that the creators themselves didn't really care about this message.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"An Ogre-sized Triumph of Animation, Wit, and Heart","Shrek stands as a triumph in animated storytelling, effortlessly blending humor, heart, and a subversive take on fairy tale conventions. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz lend their voices to a stellar cast, each bringing their characters to life with wit and charm. Myers' Shrek, a grumpy yet endearing ogre, becomes an unlikely hero as he navigates a world turned upside down by enchanting creatures and fairy tale misfits. The film's clever script is layered with both kid-friendly humor and sophisticated satire, creating a delightful viewing experience for audiences of all ages. Shrek's irreverent approach to classic fairy tales and its memorable characters has solidified its place as an animated classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I didn't laugh-out-loud once!,"I was really looking forward to this movie! I'm a huge fan of Mike Myers' I think he's one of the funniest people around at the moment and I always enjoy his work. I've also enjoyed the other actors/actresses previous work - Murphy, Diaz and Lithgow. I was prepared to really love this film. I'm really upset that I didn't...From the moment the opening credits blasted up, with Smash Mouths ""All Star"" screaming over the top of the animation I knew there was something wrong. The rest of the audience was in hysterics - one guy laughing distracting loud. But I just didn't think an ogre washing himself with mud was *that* funny. The rest of the humour was unfortunately the same. I don't mind the kind of humour in Shrek when used in small doses - but I need some subtle humour as well. Everything was so in your face LAUGH, LAUGH, LAUGH we *really* want you to laugh. Look, we're doing a parody of Robin Hood and now we're copying that scene from The Matrix. Well, ha-de-ha ha! Haven't we seen the effects used in The Matrix spoofed in enough films for one lifetime? Obviously not 85% of the audience laughed their heads of - I didn't.It's obvious from the other reviews that I'm not in the majority as far as opinions on this film go. I'm prepared to say chances are if you're reading this you'll enjoy the film. But I didn't and others didn't - as with all movies sometimes the *charm* is just lost on some of us. Don't let the overly positive reviews here have you entering the theatre thinking nothing can possibly go wrong. Loving this movie is not by any means a certainty - don't expect to fall in love with the movie - I did and was bitterly disappointed.Do you like humour so obvious it leaps out of the screen and slaps you in the face? I'm sure half of the cinema laughed because they felt they had to. Some of the laughter sounded really phony.So do I have anything good to say about this movie? Well, yes I do. The animation was excellent - the animators did a great job. The actors' who were cast were perfect for their roles! The storyline was good and I enjoyed following it - it just wasn't funny! I smirked at a few things but as I said I didn't laugh out loud once.4/10 for effects and casting!",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Brilliant,"This was an excellent take on an old fairytale. The animation was superb and the performances were excellent, especially from Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz.

Not that that matters much because if this movie didn't get you laughing till your gut hurt...than you must be a corpse!

A Great Movie for Children,"Of course I had seen Shrek when I was little, but I wanted to see it with my grown-up eyes. The Shrek I remembered when I was little was different from other animated movies because Shrek, let's say, was not such a cute character. How successful is a movie that asks us to be prejudiced against an ugly creature that looks bad and treats people badly, and then introduces us to how well-intentioned that character actually is and tries to turn the tables on children?Shrek aims to do exactly what I just described. This creature, who at first seems ugly and evil to you - and I'm sure he didn't even seem evil to most people when they watched it when they were older - later shows his good intentions. He also explains why he wants to be alone. It's actually a good story when I think about children. But when watched as an adult, the story doesn't expand much. There are very few details that go unnoticed, or characters whose plight we now understand. Maybe only Shrek is a character we can understand better as adults. But other than that, the story is very simple for an adult. Is it entertaining? Yes, that's for sure. The movie managed to make me laugh. Especially the character Donkey is really a source of joy for those who watch the movie. Apart from that, there are ""miscommunication problems"" in the movie, which is one of my least favorite things. I don't know if anyone has used this term before, but it actually means that two people never talk about the problems that they can sit down and talk and solve very easily, but they make it more complicated and cannot solve it by not listening to each other and communicating over the part they misunderstand. It seems like a simple and bland concept to me. Above all, it seems a bit far from reality. But considering how much the character of Shrek avoids communicating, it's not that irrelevant for this movie. The movie ends well. In other words, I don't think there are many pluses in terms of story, but I don't think there are many minuses either.I don't know much about animation quality, I don't pay much attention to it. I'm not a professional movie critic, my goal is to record what I think about the movie after watching it, while helping people who want to read a comprehensive review before watching the movie. So I don't think I can talk too much about the animation quality. Nothing bothered me. Only the fire effect caught my eye a little bit, but I silenced myself thinking that it didn't look bad for 2001. Other than that, I think the voiceovers were pretty good, but I'm not sure because I couldn't watch it on my headphones.As for the dubbing, I watched it with Turkish dubbing because it is legendary in Turkey. Actually, it is not as legendary as they say. Is it very good, yes, I think my Turkish friends should definitely watch the movie dubbed. The stuntmen did a very good job, health to their mouths. Afterwards, I looked at the original a little bit, but the Turkish version seemed much more colorful to me, no lie.In other words, the movie we watched when we were little and liked it very much was really beautiful. Does he have an extra great job? No, but it has a nice humorous and thought-provoking aspect that will never be a waste of time. I think everyone should watch it again as an adult.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Enjoyable but not Great,"Let me say first that I am clearly out of touch with most reviewers. I found the recent Bullwinkle movie great fun, yet the reviews here identify it as being among the worst movies ever.That said, Shrek is an enjoyable diversion. It has lots of fun gags that will get you to chuckle, especially if you get the Disney references. Unfortunately, it lacks a significant story.

It's worth your time to see it, but I just don't see the fun holding up for multiple viewings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

AAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!,"This is the worst film I've ever seen. There, I said it. I don't know why exactly I hate it so much. I like to think it's because after being hyped up for so long from across the pond, in the newspapers, on TV, crisp packets, toilet rolls etc, it turned out to be the unfunniest thing since impotence. IT IS DIRE. I never laughed once, and my skin hurt from the amount of cringing I was doing. John Lasseter and his Pixar team must have watched this film open-mouthed in horror as Shrek was uttered in the same sentence as Toy Story. I know I did. Shrek is lame in every respect, be it the obvious gags that I could see coming from across the horizon, Mike Myers' half-Scottish/half-something accent or the flat, lifeless, rendered-in-a-hurry graphics that Pixar wouldn't use on their mobile phones. It's difficult to understand how anyone could enjoy this tripe, and don't get me started on the recent Oscar victory... Excuses may be made, but I don't think that there's a valid one for sloppy scriptwriting and half-baked animation being bulked up with a few celebrities and a LOT of money. Kids like it: do they? Kids like lots of things, including bullying, picking their noses and soiling their underwear, so that doesn't make this a good film. And it did well at the box-office, which means it must be good: a third of the world is Communist - that doesn't make them right though, does it?...",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Do you know the muffin man?,"Shrek is a computer animated film starring Mike Meyers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow, and the fabulous Conrad Vernon. It won the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Film (by the way, Waking Life was unfairly unnominated...Jimmy Neutron?), and rightly so, even though Monsters Inc. was equally deserving. Shrek was not only one of the funniest Animation/Adventure/Comedy/Family/Fantasy/Romances you'll ever see, but it also holds an important message, especially in Hollywood from which it sprang. Shrek is a sort of rebel. Its statement is simple and clear: anything can be beautiful. You don't have to be doused in makeup and look artificially pleasing to the eye, which is so prominent in Hollywood and therefore prominent in America. Shrek states that beauty lies (yes...) in your heart. But besides its refreshing message and ending, it's also extremely funny. With countless fairy tale references, such as the muffin man, Pinocchio, Robin Hood, Snow White, little red riding hood, etc., this is one enjoyable and clever film. It does has its share of potty humor, but thanks to its ending, and its jokes, it has enough vulgarity to be rebellious and enough beauty to be wonderful.My grade: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A wee bit disappointing...,"I finally got around to watching this movie months after its theatrical run had come to a halt. After reading tons of articles of praise for the movie, my anticipation was at a high. Until I watched it - and I must say disappointment was the first feeling I got. Maybe it's because I waited too long, and the hype just got to me. Or maybe it's because I was expecting more comedy. Or maybe its because as a 26 year old, and 100 plus horror & action movies later, I have unfortunately lost the ability to enjoy an animated movie.With an excellent cast of comedic talents; Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and John Lithgow - Cameron Diaz can be funny at times - I was expecting a laugh riot or a movie (which wasn't). However, the middle part of the movie was a little slow and only Murphy had all the funny spoken bits. The puns were good, however, the storyline is ordinary, but I won't be surprised if Katzenberg gets the better of Disney's entry in the Best Animated Movie at this year's Oscars - but I'll make my judgment once I see the list of nominees.I would easily recommend this movie to anyone - great for families - but I wouldn't say this is the best animated movie I had ever seen (as some people are calling it) - just an enjoyable 90 minutes of your life that you'll forget in a few days time. And there's always Toy Story and Wallace & Gromit. A high 6/10. I would give it a high 7, if only there was more of Monsieur Hood.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Greatest Animated Comedy Ever,"Before we would know Shrek as universally popular meme, he starred in this comedy classic. Based loosely on the 1990 picture book of the same name by William Steig, the story is about a green ogre named Shrek(voiced by Mike Myers) who, along with a talking donkey(voiced by Eddie Murphy), is trying to rescue the wonderful Princess Fiona(voiced by Cameron Diaz) from a fire breathing dragon in order to send her to a pint sized lord. Along the way, Shrek and Fiona is starting to fall in love with each other and discover the meaning of inner beauty.As a spoof of Disney tropes like musical numbers, the main characters want something more in their lifes and even refrencing many of their most famous films, it works great. And as many have already pointed out, this film is nothing short of hilarious. So many of the jokes hit bullseyes and and I never, ever felt like the writing was getting lazy.This film holds up great, and if you are in the mood to see simply a great comedy, watch Shrek.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Delightful family entertainment,"I was sort of expecting the typical Hollywood-packaged fare reminiscent of the new turn we've gotten in the _Star Wars_ movies, but trusted the IMDb ratings enough to watch it in the theaters.

(After all, SOMETHING's gotta be there for the adults to endure an hour and a half in the theater with screaming kids.)  Don't be bothered by all the CGI animation that's gotten its (sometimes rightful) bashings these days. Just sit back and enjoy the comedy and sweet storyline.  I came out of the theater with a big smile on my face and maybe even a tear in my eye (though I'd never admit it!).  If you don't mind the screaming kids, pay the $5 (or whatever) to watch it.

As an (im)mature 30 year-old, I found Shrek to be both riotously funny and a great story too.  Judging by the reaction of the children in the audience, they loved it too.How was this achieved?  Well, the gags are a mixture of cartoon slapstick, film references and the fine interplay with Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers (and, later, Cameron Diaz).  Disney takes a (deserved) hammering throughout - but I wouldn't want to spoil any of the jokes by revealing them here. John Lithgow is also great as the prince who wants to create the perfect kingdom.  The mixture of material means there is plenty to amuse everyone and, unlike the recent Disney output, the plot is very strong too - entertainment with a message, what more could anyone want?!The one minor blemish is Myers' Scottish accent as the eponymous ogre - offputting for a British audience perhaps, more than in America.

It has such a charming fairytale story behind a funny, amusing shell which is almost guaranteed to keep viewers of all ages enthralled. It's not without its faults though. The comedy occasionally goes too far and you soon begin to see how Shrek gets so annoyed with Donkey as he is just SO annoying sometimes! That said, the film is a masterpiece and I would recommend it to anyone due to the shear entertainment factor, original story and great characters. Very clever film in many ways but be prepared - if you are looking for a serious film, look elsewhere although it has a few moral thoughts behind it.

"Realistic 3-d animation becomes fun, hip, even sexy","Animation is for kids, right? Wrong. We're seeing the evolution of a new medium that can give voice to more diverse thoughts than either hand animation or film. This film makes you wonder what is to come in terms of super-real computer animation. Self-aware and knowing humor combined with eye-popping exploitation of the new computer capabilities makes this a delight on multiple levels. Presumably we are on the verge of an explosion of creativity since anything that can be imagined can be represented.Delicious voice performances particularly by John Lithgow as the would-be King, and Cameron Diaz as the Princess.

"A good movie, but overated","This is a great movie. They did a very good job at taking a classic fairy tale and making it into something new. Also the dirty jokes in this movie did make me laugh. There is all this plot that are packed with emotion, especially at the end. There are some scenes that did make me a bit uncomfortable but nothing too major. I would highly recommend anyone to watch this movie, you will not be disappointed. However this movie is not the greatest movie ever made. Shrek is not God, he is just a movie character.

The greatest fairy tale ever retold,"I never really want to watch animated feature, because I think it's only for kids. I ever noticed the fuzz about ""Shrek"", and from what I heard ""Shrek"" is a fabulous film. But it's still doesn't impressed me, because it's only an animated feature, right?And then, yesterday, incidentally I watched it on video, and (as you can guess) I was wrong, because ""Shrek"" is more mature than I thought. It has everything, comedy, action, adventure and romance. I know a fairy tale is usually a simple romance for kids, but in ""Shrek"", you will find a kind of mature love story cloaking in a sweet romantic comedy. I was really moving by Shrek and Fiona romance tale.The plot line is quite simple and rehash the fairy tale that we ever heard, but made by the fresh many fairy tale used to do, but in such a very extreme different ways!

Murphy really stands out and has most of the funny lines.John Lithgow is the voice for Prince Farkward, a power hundred midget with a mean personality.  The music was an odd mix of oldies and newer rock tunes. Not effective for me but then I'm an old timer myself. I would not hesitate to take children over the age of 8. No younger!

Loved this movie,"The most endearing aspect of this movie is the ogre's face. It is huge, it is wierd, and his ears are like lotus-stalks, but nobody can deny the face is cute. I was able to sit with my daughter (not yet 3 years) and laugh at Shrek, and with Shrek, and she loved it. And even for slightly older children, the politically correct moment is both touching and very timely : an ogress believing a kiss from a true beloved would make her beautiful, and when it does not (and she wails, 'i am still ugly'), the guy very romantically corrects to say she IS beautiful. worth keeping at home for watching time and again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Into the Woods with Dream Works,"So if your swamp were invaded by hundreds of fairy tale refugees and a talking jackass, you'd probably turn into an ogre, right? If Moulin Rouge! can entertain us with time-shifted tunes and glitter, we shouldn't balk at a princess-matrix babe and reptilian balloon art. If you decide to see Shrek, prepare to be amused on one level and referentially challenged on another.So Shrek's (Mike Myers) an ogre with a traditional lifestyle -ear wax candlelight dinners, cheap-joke flatulence, targeted by the villagers - until Lord Fahrquar (John Lithgow) decides to resettle all fairy tale characters. Shrek's swamp becomes a refugee camp for the mythologically obsolete and he's not amused. In turn, Fahrquar needs a queen and is auditioning prospects. Magic mirror brings the usual suspects to consider and Fahrquar chooses - surprise! - Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and the dragon. This collides with Shrek's mission to return his blissful swamp to the reptilians. But the real snake turns out to be Fahrquar and his soldiers provide WWF-grade entertainment to the ""Disney world"" of Walt's dreams. Shrek's real adventure begins here. Eddie Murphy is the metaphorical ass (a pain in, Sancho Panza, etc) who gets most of the good lines and the big babes. John Lithgow never stood taller, Mike Myers never looked so good and Cameron Diaz is a force to be reckoned with. And you should expect messages throughout including the superficiality of prejudging only by looks, the importance of friends and more. I haven't seen a cartoon so loaded with spoofs on the movie industry since Aladdin.  Eddie Murphy approaches Robin Williams's nuttiness without the manic delivery but you may need a scorecard to identify all of the players. Computer animation is going through another predictable life crisis with Shrek. Can we look more real while maintaining cartoon-cuteness characters or shall we dumb it down and keep the audience entertained. DreamWorks has given the techies good reason to stay current or completely lose their edge. Take a kid and enjoy yourself.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Get better with every viewing,"I must admit that I was not very overwhelmed the first time I saw ""Shrek"". It wasn't as smart and heartwarming as I thought it would be and it had a mean edge to it's story and characters. Well, that was my first viewing. Another five or so viewings later I am willing to hail this movie as the masterpiece it is. True, it is not as cute and sugarcoated as your average Disney-saga, but now I consider it a big bonus. Instead you have some amazing characters who interact better than most live actors, a great but simple-to-follow story and lot's of funny lines and moments. And there ARE some heartwarming episodes! All the voices are superb in there parts, with an added bonus for Eddie Murphy (his best part in YEARS!) and John Lithgow. And I do like the interwoven fairytale creatures, especially the Gingerbread man whose ""torture"" is a hilariously funny scene. And Shrek himself is a truly likeable fellow even if he is somewhat of a slob. The animation is amazing! The best part is the rescue of the princess with it's firebreathing dragon and all (also a funny scene). The ending ,with the escape from the dragon's clutches, is pure ""James Bond meets Indiana Jones"" with a score to match and even the use of slow-motion! A delightful mix of suspense and humour! My only, minor, complaint is that the movie is too short!! But you do get a bonus after the feature to treasure :-) A MUST-SEE for children of all ages!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An Ogre's Conquest,"Shrek was, without a doubt, a cultural phenomenon that remains highly popular to this very day. Let's take a retrospective look at the original film that started it all:Shrek is about an eponymously-named Ogre (Mike Myers) who lives comfortably alone in his swamp until the area is invaded by hundreds of migrating fairytale creatures. With the company of a fast-talking Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek is propelled onto a journey which leads him to Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) - who requests that Shrek rescues a Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) in order to have the fairytale creatures removed from his property.There's a lot to like about Shrek, I really enjoyed the idea of taking classic fairytales and modernizing them for a wider demographic. It's done really well in this film, and is perfected by the time we reach the sequel. The film also uses this as a chance to parody the works of Disney, which is strongly apparent throughout. On that note, the humour present in this film is a good mixture of jokes and gags for both children and adults.It's common knowledge at this point that Shrek was based on a children's novel written by the late author William Steig, I'm not familiar with the source material but the film seems to be a good adaptation of the book. As a matter of fact, Steig spoke highly of this film upon watching it - so it obviously surpassed his expectations.Despite the fact that voice work was done separately by each of the main actors / actresses involved, it doesn't sound out-of-place in the slightest. In addition, the Scottish accent provided by Mike Myers to voice Shrek works incredibly well in the film's favour and provides an enriched, Celtic-like quality to the whole experience that would've been missing otherwise.While there's a lot to like about this film, it's not perfect by any means. One point that I would like to mention is that some of the music can come off as a bit dated for today's standards. The intro song of All Star by Smash Mouth is really a product of its time, but has become synonymous with the Shrek brand as a whole. I admittedly prefer the ending song of I'm A Believer.Another thing that is apparent to me personally is the lack of characters, which may also be interpreted as a good thing since it allows the story to be told without becoming too overwhelming. Some of the most interesting characters to me in the film were the fairytale creatures we are presented early on. Thankfully, a lot of these characters - such as the Gingerbread Man, the Three Little Pigs, and Pinocchio - are given much more screen time in the sequels. See this as more of a nitpick if anything, because I also liked the main duality between the title character and Donkey.I can't say this film is perfect, as a few of the jokes seem topical for the time that Shrek released in the early 2000s. But the film had a grossly unique charm unlike any other CG animated feature at the time of its release. Its unapologetic, fantastical style that it went for was entertaining to say the least. That is why I score Shrek a 7/10 - it's a good film that provides an invigorating story, likeable characters and off-the-wall comedy for anyone of all ages to enjoy. I can definitely see why people would rate this film higher than I did, but there's also a strong sense of nostalgia that comes from a lot of retrospective talks of these films.I would personally recommend this film for a family viewing, since Shrek's appeal has little to no boundaries. While I do prefer the sequel in comparison, you can't deny the original film was a strong starting point towards the Shrek saga.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Eddie Murphy is annoying and a stereotype, why can't he do good films again, and Mike Myers isn't as good as the olden days either, spy who shagged me, now this, though he was an okay ogre.

Surprisingly good!,"I have had this movie for a few months now, but I didn't really bother to watch it, because I just didn't think it'd be that good. Well, seems I was wrong, once again, and that Shrek simply blew me away.I see it as a fairy tale movie about fairy tales, but also about our life. You get all the so called elements of a fairy tale, like magic creatures and beautiful romance scenes...big castles and horrid dragons. Just that this movie is a parody of the fairy tale world. Of course, a parody that remains a fairy tale, but through this different vision we get the fun out of it.The story is quite simple, and yet it has more ""layers"" than you'd expect. We get three characters, Shrek the ogre, Donkey (the donkey heh) and Princess Fiona, the one with two faces and the dragon. All four are lonely, but in fact they form two pairs. Initially in both pairs we see some clear opposites:Fiona beautiful, Shrek ugly; dragon huge, donkey small. But these differences come just from the aspect of these characters, and not from what they really are. Their meeting represents the end of their loneliness.There are a lot of scenes from other fairy tales, as this movie is actually based on them. It may lack in originality at times, if you really want to hear that. But it compensates through great humor.Also, there would be this nice town of lord Farquaad, named Duloc. It represents a town that seems perfect, but you just have to take a sharp look at it and notice how horrible life really is there. The people are being controlled by their small, yet horrible lord. Like the viewers that are present at a show - they see ""applaud"" they see ""laugh""...it's what they see and what they do because others tell them. It's not something you can rely on. It's a manipulated society, something which does happen in our world too...much too often sometimes.It's not right to say we have a flawless film on our hands, still it is a movie which many will enjoy, and most important will probably make you feel better. Isn't that what movies are about? Or at least in some high percentage...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"A Hilarious Movie, Though It Has Some Mixed Signals","""Shrek"" is a laugh-out-loud, incredibly funny movie that manages to savagely shred the saccharine-sweet Disney film formula throughout most of its scenes.  Inexplicably, though, it suddenly embraces that same sweet Disney formula as it draws to a close . . . becoming, in many ways, exactly like the films it professes to mock.  ""Shrek"" tries to straddle the line between savvy adult-based humor and sweet family-friendly humor, usually succeeding, but failing miserably in certain spots.  Apparently, the strategy of aiming the film towards both kids and adults worked -- if judging from box-office revenue is any indication, `Shrek' was wildly successful -- but the quality of the film is dropped a notch or two by the occasionally awkward blending of adult satire and child sensibilities.  ""Shrek"" is still a very, very good -- and very, very funny -- film, but it could've either been a classic adult satire or a classic kid's movie, if only the producers of ""Shrek"" had fully committed to pushing the film in one direction or the other, instead of just compromising to appeal to the masses.""Shrek"" is the story of a lone ogre (aptly named, well, ""Shrek"" -- and voiced by Mike Myers) whose major goal in life is to live in solitude in his beloved swamp.  This goal is somewhat thwarted by the ruler of the kingdom, Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow), a diminutive, evil tyrant who is forcing all the fairy tale characters in his kingdom to relocate to Shrek's swamp.  Shrek, unhappy with this relocation program, makes an offer to Farquaad -- he'll find Lord Farquaad a princess, which will allow Farquaad to get married and become a King.  All that Shrek wants in return is his swamp to be made like it was before --empty. Lord Farquaad accepts Shrek's offer -- so, along with his loquacious sidekick Donkey (voice by Eddie Murphy), Shrek begins a quest to find a true damsel in distress -- the lovely Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz).With the possible exception of the ""South Park"" movie, never has a film managed to so gleefully and successfully tear apart the Disney tradition of animated musicals as well as ""Shrek"".  Scenes are set up in the traditional Disney manner, then shredded with such razor-sharp wit and flair; it's amazingly funny.  The humor ranges from over-the-top (Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode) to the wickedly subtle (the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White: ""She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled . . . she's not easy."")  ""Shrek"" veers wildly between loving reverence and sneering disdain for the traditions of Disney animated films -- the reverent scenes will most likely appeal more to kids, while adults will definitely appreciate those of disdain -- but regardless of the tone, the structure and the direction of ""Shrek"" is usually incredibly funny.  It doesn't hurt that the cast of voices adds immeasurably to the film, either: Mike Myers plays the ogre Shrek with an oddly peculiar but funny amount of patience and practicality (I also suspect he only agreed to the part so he'd have another venue for his outrageous Scottish accent); John Lithgow is perfect as the pompous, overbearing Lord Farquaad; and Cameron Diaz manages to bring just the right amount of outrage and sweetness to Princess Fiona -- I found her to be the best character in the film.  Personally, I found Eddie Murphy (as Donkey) to be the most annoying character in the film -- true, he is very funny, and has some of the best lines, but he's a little too much to take at times.  The first third of the movie, he was brilliantly funny; the second third of the film, only mildly funny; and by the last third of the film, just irritating.  I don't fault Eddie Murphy at all for this, but I do fault directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson for not toning the character down.The main fault with `Shrek', though, lies in the fact that it tries to appeal to two distinct audiences.  It's not that such a feat can't be done (Disney's ""Aladdin"", actually, does this flawlessly), but that ""Shrek"" juggles between the two audiences so poorly.  For example, one of the ""big messages"" being delivered to children by this film is that appearances don't matter, that people shouldn't be judged by how they look . . . and then a significant amount of time is spent ridiculing Lord Farquaad's small stature.  What gives?  When the two aspects of a film like this -- the child aspect and the adult aspect -- can exist simultaneously and separately, the results can be wonderful.  ""Aladdin"" is a prime example of this, as are nearly all of the Chuck Jones-directed ""Bugs Bunny"" cartoons of the early 1950s.  When the aspects start contradicting each other, though, it's confusing, and not very funny.  As it affects ""Shrek"", the contradictions aren't enough to significantly drag the film down, but they are quite noticeable, and they do cause the film to stumble.  (And another thing . . . okay, a minor rant . . . please, enough with ""The Matrix"" parodies.  They're officially now like all those stupid ""I'm so scared"" Blair Witch parodies .. . not even remotely funny.  Stop beating the dead horse.)Regardless of the mixed messages, there's no denying that ""Shrek"" is a very clever, funny movie that will no doubt be entertaining for both children and adults.  There will be a few moments, though, when kids will be utterly puzzled by what's occurring in the film . . . and other moments that will have adults gagging from the nauseating sweetness.  Still, ""Shrek"" is very, very good, and in the end, maybe that's all that really matters.  It's certainly better than most standard Disney fare, and is still the best animated film of 2001 . . . not too shabby, huh?  Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
You'll Shriek with Delight,"Simply put, `Shrek' is a masterpiece.  The story is engaging and very funny.

This wonderful script is brought to life by the fantastic vocal talents of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow.But what sets ""Shrek"" apart from all other films before it, is the ground breaking computer technology that brought it to life. ""Shrek"" is a quantum leap forward, with photo realistic 3-d backgrounds, and characters that seem like living cartoons.

"Disney's fantasy used against Disney by DreamWorks. Multiple bits of nostalgia bundled together in a ""beautiful"" animated feature.","Shrek (2001) :
Brief Review -Disney's fantasy used against Disney by DreamWorks. Multiple bits of nostalgia bundled together in a ""beautiful"" animated feature. Watching this film back in childhood was a different experience. Wait, what am I saying? No, it wasn't. It was just the same experience as it was today. Some films are like that, you know. Shrek is one of those films. Films like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, and all those old Disney classics from the 1930-1950s would feel different in adulthood, but Shrek's simplicity and beautiful nature keep it the same for kids and adults. The princess, the dragon, the first kiss of true love, the curse of the witch, the leave-me-alone protagonist, and a cruel wannabe king-we knew all these fantastical segments before Shrek was made or written. Yet, Shrek believes in selling the same goods with new packaging and successfully manages to get a high price for them. You don't really believe that an ogre can fall in love with a beautiful princess, and the princess would have the same film for him, but in a fantasy animation flick, you are ready to believe it. Shrek takes advantage of that mindset and scripts a beautiful love story of unconventional proportions. In the end, you expect the princess to turn into her second form, but she is already that. Maybe this part could have been better. But she is blessed with a compliment from Shrek, ""But you are beautiful,"" which covers some quotient of that element. There is comedy, drama, romance, and emotions, so I don't think anywhere can hit this film as far as entertainment value is concerned. Basically, it's an audience's film. As a tough critic, I can point out a few mistakes, but I don't want to. Because I was just enjoying the show despite the restrictions. That's the pure magic of cinema. Shrek won in that, so I don't really care where it failed.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

It's entertaining enough and it treats the audience with respect (no silly sentimentality) but it's no Antz.

What a treat!,"I don't know what movie these last half-dozen or so people saw, but it sure wasn't the same delightful ""Shrek"" we saw today! Only an ironbound Disney loyalist could consider its humor mean-spirited in the least. (And besides, really, it's high time the high and mighty Disney empire took a few shots of this nature.) The alleged flatulence obsession amounts to *one* fart joke and *one* belch joke - come on now, guys. Even the moments of gross bug and food humor (and I think kids will love those) are limited to the opening scene in Shrek's house. But why dwell on this stuff when the movie is so charming? It takes two of the most classic fairy tale stories - the heroic quest/rescue and the ""beauty and beast"" romance (which, need I remind anyone, was NOT invented by the Mouse House?) - and updates them with a terrific combination of mildly edgy modern humor and the most dazzling computer animation yet. I could go on for paragraphs about the deliciousness of the fabric textures, the grasses and leaves stirring in the wind, the shine of hair...wow! Better yet, this technical quantum leap forward is never allowed to become the reason for the movie (as it so tiresomely is with live-action effects) but is kept firmly in the service of the story, providing emotional responses and facial expressions of such subtlety that even green ogres become humanly believable.  This is used especially well in the delicate development of the unspoken romance between Princess Fiona (who has already shown herself to be something other that what she appears!) and her rescuer, Shrek. Fiona - who begins by believing that only a guy with the correct princely trappings can be her true love and comes to see things quite differently - is a completely convincing creation, but so is proud, lonely Shrek and even his yakky sidekick Donkey. It is mind-boggling to contemplate what this technology will be used to do in the future. Here it has given us an adventure and a romance (yes it is!) crammed with visual humor, (And can I just take one moment to revel in all these Disney jokes?

"Funny, goofy and delightful",Shrek is an amazing movie that takes the typical fairy tales that we have all heard and then flips them on there head. It is a very funny movie and it has very interesting characters that both adults and children can connect with.Shrek is an amazing piece of work that deserves to be placed i an art museum.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A classic of the 2000's animation,"There are few things to say about this animated classic from the early 2000s. Visually, they did an excellent job, deserving of the awards of the time, so much so that today they have aged decently.The plot is quite entertaining and also bold in combining characters from different children's stories to make them cohesive in a very synergistic way.The negative details are attributed to the kinesics of the characters linked to the development of new visual technologies at that time. The characters look stiff and with automated movements, to the critical eye.A well-rounded and fun fairy tale like this has many possibilities of staying in the collective memory, just as Shrek did at the beginning of its franchise. Absolutely recommended for a pleasant afternoon with the family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
So funny one of my favorite movies of all times,"I love this movie! I have watched about 25 times! It is so hysterical you can't help laughing the whole way through it. And the computer animation is great! Also this movie has a great moral. I also love the music video with all the characters at the end which included different characters versions of YMCA, I Like Big Butts and others but not to much to be annoying. It's so funny.

Somebody Once Told Me...,"In several ways ""Shrek"" is a landmark film. It is the first film to win the Oscar for Best Animated Picture. The animated film landscape after Shrek is noticeably different than it was before. Suddenly having an ensemble cast of celebrities to advertise the movie became the norm. After its box-office success traditional 2D animated films were on the way out and CG animated films were all the rage. Animated movies were no longer the place for big musical numbers, but instead a soundtrack of classics covered by modern bands. And the humor in the films became more risqué, appealing not just to kids but for the parents. Not all these effects were for the best, but that can't be held against the film. But beyond the impact that this film, how is the film itself? It's really good, but not perfect.The animation, music and voice acting are all well done. The jokes are hit and miss, but when its funny, it produces some big laughs. The story may take a little too much inspiration from classic tales because it leads to some very tiresome story telling tropes. But the film does implement a clever twist of the formula at the very end.This film truly is a shooting star that breaks the mold.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Very Unoriginal,"My wife and I recently rented this movie on DVD and it was our first viewing.  Let me say that I went into this with low expectations, which set me up to be pleasantly surprised.But that didn't happen.  This movie is very unoriginal.  The jokes are almost entirely tired, worn out ones that we've all heard many times before. How many times do they (hollywood) expect us to laugh at passing gas? That joke got tired when I was like 16.The characters are equally unoriginal.  When the donkey opened his mouth, I thought, ""Eddie Murphy as the 'colorful' little sidekick?""  Mulan pretty much used up the quota on that one.  At least in Mulan he got to say some funny lines.At times, I felt like I wasn't watching a movie.  It's almost like a set of animated, disconnected music videos.  Anyway, there's very little wit on display and the characters are not at all endearing to the audience.  You can tell that the writers are trying too hard.  They just don't have it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Fact That It's Been Copied Ad Nauseum Doesn't Diminish Its Freshness,"The fact that pretty much every animated film released now has a slangy and tongue-in-cheek sense of humor threatens to diminish somewhat the luster of ""Shrek,"" but people should remember how fresh and inventive this film seemed at the time of its release. It offered a new kind of animated film for adults that even Pixar hadn't yet mastered (though Pixar's level of sophistication would soon skyrocket and leave the ""Shrek"" films in the dust).Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and especially John Lithgow do terrific voice work, and the animation itself is stellar. ""Shrek"" won the first ever Academy Award given specifically for an animated feature, besting Pixar's ""Monsters Inc.""Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Great central character makes Shrek enjoyable,"As a book is opened, and Shrek tells the story of a prince and a princess and utters the words ""Like that's ever going to happen"" does the film engage the audience and set the tome for a thoroughly enjoyable family adventure with good comedy, interesting protagonists and an entertaining narrative.When we first see Shrek's appearance we instantly gasp, but are instantly laughing and amazed as the credits role and observe an Ogre in his natural habitat, bathing in mud and eating gross things. This opening is very inviting and invites us into an unknown world and the life of a different character that is far from your average looking everyday hero. Shrek, a big and nasty looking man, is a symbol, an icon if you will, of defying odds and true hope. A sweet and tear jerking moment comes when he says ""They judge me before they even know me"" a real landmark for animation and appearances, and how they can be deceiving. Shrek, obviously different from other heroes, has this unique quality that makes him so likable. Despite his gross habits, we can identify with him on a personal level, being alone and at a distance from others, and this ideology of defying odds and appearances is one main reason to watch this film.Plenty of animations lie on physical comedy to entertain, but Shrek uses intertextuality to gain most laughs. Watch out for parodies of Disney classics, the matrix and others that will make you chuckle. Eddie Murphy's Donkey is by far the funniest character, being so hyper and enthusiastic that it's almost unbelievable.When we first see Princess Fiona, we are laughing by the sheer ideology of her and her long awaited rescue.Though after a while the plot becomes slightly predictable and over dramatic. However there are twists and turns in stock to keep away from the conventional narrative which is always a good thing.There are a few dry spells and the humour isn't always funny but nevertheless Shrek is one heart warming animation with a different hero whom we can all identify with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This film has everything!!!,"I love this film, because it does have everything!

WOW! Surprisingly good!,"Woo, not many bad things that I can say. At first, I was reluctant to see this movie because I was trying to grow up, and I thought that it was for kids- even though adults thought that it was great.

Shrek,"Poor old ogre ""Shrek"" just want to be left alone, that's all - he's got a bit of the Greta Garbo's about him. Rather inconveniently, though, nasty Lord ""Farquaad"" who has a little of the Napoleon syndrome about him, banishes all the fairytale creatures from his lands and so they turn up on the doorstep of our green friend. How can he be rid of them all? Well together with his new (and frankly quite annoying friend) ""Donkey"" they head to the castle where they are given challenge: go and rescue the Princess ""Fiona"" from her dragon-guarded castle tower and bring her to marry the diminutive dictator. Off they go on a series of fun escapades that introduce us to all the creatures in the forest - including a decidedly French ""Robin Hood , ""Pinocchio"", ""Peter Pan"" - indeed, just about everyone from the fables pantheon. Do they achieve their mission - we you will just have to watch and see; but along the way the jokes have plenty to amuse older audiences with a screenplay that pokes some gentle fun at some prevailing stereotypes on beauty, loyalty, bullying, sexuality - you name it. Murphy is still fearsomely annoying - sorry, but Messrs. Myers, Lithgow and Cassel along with Cameron Diaz add richness to the punchy script and to the excellent and enjoyably colourful animation to create a film that has stood the test of time well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Shrek 2001 Review,"""People take one look at me and go ""Ah! Help! Run! A big stupid ugly Ogre."" They judge me before they even know me ... that's why i'm better off alone.""
20 years ago today Shrek was released in theatres so I had to rewatch this childhood classic.Unironically an animated masterpiece.I haven't seen this for over a decade but damn this is an amazing film.It's humor is amazing, it's score is iconic and memorable, the characters are all wonderful, the references to fairy tales (and even The Matrix) are great, it's birthed hundreds of memes, it's stood the test of time, and it's just a classic film that never gets old.I enjoyed every second discovering new jokes that went over my head whenever I was little, while also filling up my nostalgia tank watching scenes like when Shrek and Fionna blew up animal animal-balloons which I vividly remember seeing as a kid.From its extensive fairy tale references to its iconic score Shrek really is Dreamworks best work, and honestly one of the best animated movies out there.Happy 20th Anniversary!""...

One of the best ever,"This movie offered nearly everything anyone could hope for.  It had the much disliked villain, the damsel who was a tomboy and needed to give direction to get the work done.  The work of Eddie Murphy and Michael Meyers is superb.  Everyone would have loved to have a pet like the donkey, but for the less than sociable Ogre.  He lived truly up to the character who dreaded the meetings with anyone but himself, but yet fell in love!  There was so much cuteness in this movie: the gingerbread man, the dating game, the talking mirror, the donkey, the dragon even had its tender side.  The writing is superb, even giving the characters a chance at directing the show.  This movie sets the barometer for any animated movie that will reach ""all"" ages.  I've never seen anything animated that is as appealing to all ages.  Can't wait for the second movie.  Rock on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Formulaic, but with nice touches","For all the plaudits routinely thrown as the new generation of computer-animated movies, there's a remarkably standard template that underpins them all. In the standard plot, a collection of non-human creatures of different dispositions learn tolerance and friendship through partaking in some ultimately uplifting quest, while the humour has a level of self-awareness designed to appeal to adults; and these things certainly true in the case of 'Shrek', a story about an ogre that appears to owe a substantial debt to Raymond Briggs. But the film benefits from some delightful details, and the fact that Eddie Murphy, who voices the ""annoying talking animal"" (as he describes himself in the sequel) is actually funny and not just annoying. Overall, it's less dark and subversive than 'Toy Story' or 'Madagascar' , but much more watchable than the dreadful 'Ice Age', and the standard of animation is unquestionably high. It's not my favourite film, even of its genre; but I definitely enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar has nothing to worry about.,"There are three things that make a great, animated movie: art, story, and characters.  Shrek rates 1 out of 3.There seems to be a lot of buzz circulating about the great animation in this film.  I have absolutely no idea what they're talking about.  Notice in the film, how the animators can't get the proportions right for Shrek and the Princess.  In some shots, he's towering over her.  In others, they appear the same size.  It's not just camera angles; it's genuinely sloppy work on the part of the animators.  If I want to see lazy cartooning, I'll stay home Saturday morning.  I don't need to pay $9 for it.The artists of the film should have chosen realism or cartooning.  Instead they seem to have waffled back and forth between the two.  There was no sense of consistency.We've seen this plot, before.  Boy meets girl.  Boy doesn't like girl. Slowly boy falls in-love with girl.  Boy and girl have a falling out.  Boy and girl have a dramatic and happy reunion.  Throw in some fart, butt, earwax, and toilet gags, and you have Shrek.Eddie Murphy and Mike Meyers were great to watch.  I enjoyed the relationship between the two characters.  Their chemistry is Shrek's only redeeming quality.34/100",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Tremendous!,"Shrek was a marvelous delight for anybody to have the privilege to see it. The movie was ideal in length and was a perfect spoof on several fairytales. From the creators of Antz, this movie brought smooth, computer-rendered animation onto the big screen, and definitely deserved the Academy Award it won.With an all-star cast of voicists (Mike Myers, John Lithgow, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz), this movie easily shows the years of work they put into it. I loved this movie as a film and as a DVD, and I recommend it strongly, if anybody had not seen it already. It is clear and original, although taking much of a plot from other fairytales. I would look for an upcoming Shrek 2 to be nothing less than dazzling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of a kind - Excellent,"I'm not big fan of Disney type movies. So I avoided going to see this thinking that it was just an over rated kids movie with good animation. Well the cast and script couldn't have been any better.  This movie is simply a gem.  If you have any doubt look at the cast of voices ... Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz.  I never realized the overall significance of the script or voices in a movie.  Obviously the animation is state of the art, but the voice acting credits here can't be overlooked.  So when you combine it all you create a true classic for the ages.  I know they will be doing a sequel, but this is going to be hard to top or even equal. This one is worth watching several times.

Fine Movie-going Experience,"This piece of fine storytelling which is the anti-Beauty and the Beast was a enjoyable experience for me, but not for everyone. Several disgruntled, disappointed kids, they and their parents expecting gosh knows what, left the theater crying and one in particular with the remains of her dinner all over the floor. From that response you'd think they'd just seen the kiddie version of the Exorcist! Oddly enough they had no problem with the Mummy Returns a few weeks ago. Obviously, sadly, Shrek can not even begin to do that well in the box office and it's a shame since this is the best writing to come out of a Hollywood movie since Gladiator (take that as you will). Advice to parents, teens will appreciate this more, not because of its gross factor (which has been exaggerated by the press), but because of its ""layers"" as Shrek himself said and message to all those out there who will never look like movie stars. Young children won't get at all and they'll leave with tears in their eyes. Consider this your warning, parents.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's a great movie!,"I really love this movie..I think Shrek is the best animated movie in 2001. Yes, maybe Final Fantasy is better in animation, but Shrek offers more than just beautiful and realistic animation. The characters are just fictious anyway, so they don't have to gesture like real human being..Shrek offers us mostly fun, 'cos the story is really enjoyable. Okay,it's some kind of predictable, but it doesn't reduce the fun-thing. There are so many funny times like when the king had to choose one of 3 princess (we're not expecting that the mirror will be like a quiz host,are we?),then when Princess Fiona sang so the bluebird exploded, and I like the actions in the ""Colosseum"". Hey,it's so much like WWF Smackdown actions! Shrek acts like he's The Rock...it's fun and amuses us,right?Lastly, Shrek also contains some morality messages which are not given by other animated movies,such as Final Fantasy.Yeah,it's the best fairy tales ever told !Go on Pixar..create another excellent movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Mike Myers makes the magic happen!,"I really fail to understand many of the rather negative comments I've read here about this movie. For gosh sakes, its just an animated kid's movie, what were some of you expecting? ""Gone with the Wind?"" I personally would probably never have bothered to see it if my son wasn't an 8 year old. I really wasn't expecting much more than Toy Story or Monsters Inc. I was truly surprised.That said, I must also confess that I found Camron Diez to be disappointingly weak as the princess. Eddie Murphy was way overdone and overboard as the donkey. I mean there wasn't one second that I was able to forget that the ever-chattering voice behind the character was just Eddie Murphy going on and on and on in his usual Eddie Murphy style. And one of my all time favorite actors, John Lithgow, was unfortunately, simply an anaemic parody of himself as the King.However, this movie was saved as a great movie, animated or otherwise by a surprisingly stellar performance by none other than Mike Myers. It is still difficult for me to grasp that this very same idiotic SNL Pilsbury Dope-Boy who nauseated us all in such sick crap as ""Wayne's World"" and ""Austin Powers"" was the inspired genius behind that sardonic but yet wonderful character ""Shrek.""No matter how many times you watch the movie, (and I have both the video and an 8 year old, so I've seen it plenty!) you will never hear or find Mike Myers in this film, only the persona of ""Shrek."" Like Jim Carrey in ""The Truman Show,"" this is where Mike Myers proves to us all that he really belongs where he is in the industry.

"Somewhat entertaining, with some great moments, but overall a wasted opportunity","Maybe I just went into the film thinking the wrong ideas.  The trailers looked very appealing.  I saw parts of the movie working at the Edgewater Multiplex over the summer and really enjoyed the parts I saw.  But when I finally watched it straight-through, I have to say I was kind of disappointed.First of all, I thought they could've stressed the idea of spoofing fairy tales.  I think that's what tantalized me most about the film.  I laughed my head off when Lord Farquaa (voice of John Lithgow) looked into the mirror and gave that ""Mirror, mirror on the wall"" speech and the mirror commented on him negatively.  So he calls his henchman and he punches a crack into a small mirror.  Lord Farquaa then continues with ""You were saying?.....""  Now that's funny!  I also loved that little tribute to ""The Dating Game"" where Farquaa had to choose between Princess Fiona, Cinderella and Snow White (who is described as living with seven men).  Then the people in the audience, his knights, start holding their fingers up screaming out who he should pick.  Again, hilarious!  And I have to commend the always-talented John Lithgow for lending his voice to that character, because he absolutely cracked me up and I don't think any actor could've done a better job.  In fact, though he was the villain, I was hoping he would have a bigger part in the story.The story mainly focuses on Shrek and his pal, Donkey.  Eddie Murphy provides the voice of Donkey the donkey, and he's funny at times, but after a while he gets obnoxious.  I was amazed by the abundance of crude humor.  I know it's nothing compared to the average Farrelly Brothers movie, but how many parents are taking their children to see their flicks?  The opening scene alone is filled with gags involving farting in the water, taking a mud bath and spraying spit all over people's faces.  I don't see how a film like ""Road Trip"" gets panned for using gags like that--and often in a funny way--yet this movie gets rave reviews by critics everywhere.  There's always a certain way to deliver a crude joke, and it's hard to deliver it adequately when trying to appeal to children and keep the PG rating.  Kids will most definitely laugh at every crude joke in sight, but adults will probably roll their eyes.Even at an hour and twenty minutes, I felt the film dragged quite a bit. They could've cut a few of those Shrek-Donkey interactions and concentrated more on plot.  I liked the movie, but not as much as I thought.  But if parents are looking for something tolerable that they can watch with their kids--without putting on a fake smile and pretending to enjoy it--then ""Shrek"" is not a bad choice at all.My score:  6 (out of 10)",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Along for the ride is Donkey (Eddie Murphy). The voice acting is very well done (John Lithgow is my favorite) and the music and sound effects created a nice story book atmosphere.

Funny,"This movie, about a mean lord who exiles fairytale creatures to the swamp of a grumpy ogre, is a good buddy comedy movie!It is simple, predictable, and straightforward, but it has other qualities that make it stand out among animated movies. Its biggest strength is the humor - it has such a wide range that it can make viewers of all ages laugh. A lot of its charm comes from that humor, even if some of the jokes might not sit well with everyone today (though, honestly, that feels unnecessary).The concept itself is hilarious and absurd, thanks to its mix of fairytales and pop culture references. And while the animation is definitely outdated, it does not take away from the experience at all.

"A great classic revolutionary computer animation, full of powerful messages and references","A great classic revolutionary computer animation that overcame and many other great films like Antz, the same producer! Shrek is a milestone in 3D animations. Can join several aspects in the composition of a great work unforgettable. The directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson show here the story of an ogre who lives alone in a swamp until one day several characters from fairy tales invade your property because they were evicted by Lord Farquaad. Shrek and his newly known friend Donkey then go to the Lord in order to regain his swamp. It proposes that when Farquaad Shrek to rescue Princess Fiona is in a tower guarded by a dragon, so you can marry her and become king. In exchange for Shrek have his swamp back and fairytales come back where they came from. Then begins the rescue Princess unconventional by the duo Donkey and Shrek and many adventures and unexpected feelings arise along the way.The film presents here an anti-hero Shrek, an ogre ugly, clumsy, coarse, solitary and unromantic. He is totally the opposite of what a hero should be and just by his way of being and his good and pure heart is that we increasingly liking him. At his side have the priceless ass, which is actually the great character of the film, and using Shrek as a ladder to the great jokes. The meshing of the duo, with jokes in rapid inspired dialogues are very funny and are the highlights of the work. Undoubtedly the best double animation to date in a perfect partnership. The opposite of the behavior and characteristics of the characters is the ideal antithesis to cause laughter in the most unusual.Other high points are the striking scenes today (the interrogation of Cookie, the scene of Pinocchio Geppetto being sold for at the beginning of the film, the scene of Donkey begging not to be sold and flying soon after, the scene of the invasion of White Snow and Little Red Riding Hood Shrek's house, the whole sequence of the rescue at the castle from crossing the bridge to the race out of the castle, and of course the final scenes. Among the writers of the film is the same duo who scripted Pirates Caribbean also brilliantly: Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. We can say that a movie is inspired, with a fabulous script that knew how to be sarcastic, acid, provocative and innovative at the same time creating a new and magical world that we can dream and learn valuable lessons in it. The world of fairytales has indeed turned upside down with this perfect parody of the characters and tales of the brothers Grimm. Highlight was the songs that used even a bit of double meaning in certain phrases rhyme but without appeal, causing much laughter. Parody This was all exquisitely built with a magnificent soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell also used numerous appropriate songs and pop culture, ranging from Joan Jett to John Cale.Still talking a bit of film references: Among the songs can still quote: Smash Mouth, Baha Men among others. And as we can see references to a parody of an excerpt from the book by Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol, when Cookie says: ""God bless you all"" near the end of the film, besides mentioning the classic Snow White when Fiona kills the bird accidentally. Also cites Matrix and Charlie's Angels when Fiona fight with Robin Hood in the woods. The castle of Duloc is a parody of Disneyland, and also mentions several children's stories such as The Three Little Pigs, Robin Hood, Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, among others.Besides all the film still in great passes messages as not to judge people so quickly, by all deem a monster without even knowing it, Shrek lived lonely and isolated from everyone in his swamp and used his anger to ward off everyone around him. In this respect Burro not judged and showed that he really liked the ogre as he was, not judging from the first meeting. We also pass values that appearance is not everything and that we should judge a person by what she is and not for what appears to be, and that each person has a special person to her and that even if it looks ugly to others, is always someone to find the most beautiful person in the world. And finally, of course, to believe in true love and pure with all your strength. Not only the visual revolution caused by the animation, the story simple and catchy watered lot of comedy and romance, Shrek can be compared with the Ice Age franchise, major milestones and achievements of the first decade of the 21st century. Movie worshiped until the present day, which is a benchmark in the genre and binding. Pure entertainment and totally recommended.

So far the best animated film I have ever viewed,"Shrek is a great tale that follows an ogre named Shrek and a donkey, that won't shut up, named Donkey and their adventure to save a Princess in a castle guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. When they find the castle the fire-breathing dragon turns out to be a female and falls in love with Donkey. They rescue the Princess and then they head to a village called Duloc to deliver the Princess to Lord Farquaad. He is the one that sends Shrek on this journey to rescue the Princess, so he can marry her to become a King. Shrek interrupts the wedding of Lord Farquaad and Princess Fiona because he loves the Princess. Princess Fiona awaits a kiss from Shrek so a curse that was put on her by a witch would be lifted from her. The curse turns her in to an ogre every time the sunsets and the only way to lift the curse is to have true loves first kiss. But she stays an ogre to show children that true beauty comes from within. Shrek and Princess Fiona get married. Lord Farquaad is eating by the fire-breathing dragon, and she falls in love with Donkey, and vise versa. Everything is great in the end. The animation for Shrek is fantastic. No other animated film that I have viewed is as good or better. Ice Age, Toy Story 1&2, and Monster's Inc. are very fine animated films, but not Shrek quality. The film is also funny for kids and adults. A lot of little comments in Shrek that is meant for adults, that little kids won't get. The animation along with the story is why I give Shrek * * * ½ {out of 4 stars} & a 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

hilarious,i love mike myers. sure he's somewhat crude but he's still funny. now i usually don't watch animated movies unless they are disney. but i wasn't close minded on this one. disney makes good movies of course. why not other companies take a stab at it? a delightful comedy intended for both children and adults. i do think a lot of the humor is more for adults though. i was surprised to hear a few cuss words. children still love it though. aside from that..its a very good movie. 8 stars out of 10...........,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Funny!!!!!!:),This is a funny movie for all ages. Although it wasn't Mike Myers that was the funniest (don't get me wrong he did have some funny lines) but it was Eddie Murphy that was the funniest. And it seems when Dreamworks makes a family film it always seems that there is always adult humor. In Mousetrap they did it. And in this film they did. But the kids won't get it. But they will love the funny cheasy humor that is in it. Another thing they did was take things from other movies that the kids wouldn't get and wouldn't even be able to see the films they brought it from. It has been a few months that I have seen it but the one I remember most clearly is from The Matrix. It's about thirty seconds but is huge and is on the commercials. But it is a great family film.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Aside from clever satirical moments script falls flat.,"The satirical value of this film has largely been used by many tohide the slow moments of the film.  This movie has a few veryhumorous moments where it mocks many of the familiar fairy talecharacters.  But the main story of the film, which is a more indirectsatire of typical fairy tale elements, is slow and has uncomfortableinteraction between the characters that make the movie more of atask than a pleasure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Some people don't know what the true purpose of the Satire is.,"Woa woa woa.We have some real malice in the comments below.  Ya think they'd work for disney or something.  I mean don't get me wrong, Disney's done some great work over the years, but it ain't the fifties anymore, and we don't have to keep making animation in that mold.  I think Dreamworks has created a very original and fresh picture here.  A fantasy animation, very much for adults, moreso than for children.  Everyone I've seen the film with, thought it was riotous.  Hilarious bits interspersed with very real emotion, thanks to the incredible graphics.  Something you simply can't achieve with animation. You can't achieve realistic, round characters with pen and ink, which I felt they succeeded with in Shrek.  And if the cutting adult humor and great effects aren't enough, watch closely so you don't miss two great ongoing jokes.  First, the constant and hilarious satrical parodying of fairy tales(Gingerbread man:Do you know the Muffin man, Farquaad:The muffin Man? GBM:the muffin man, Farquaad: Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on mulburry lane?) and second, the wonderful rips at Disney, be it the massive ""compensating"" Dulochland, the terribly long lines, the info center which reminds us, ""don't make waves and stay in line, and we'll get along just fine; Duloch is the perfect town"", or even magical ending which is taken directly from Beauty and the Beast.Many reveiewers were upset, and thought the tearing at Disney was hate driven, and it very possibly may be, but when I was watching it, I didn't feel hatred for Disney, I felt a healthy sense of outside perspective on the unbelievably silly things that people don't realize they endorse when they buy Disney.  I hope Shrek does very well, despite it's ""negative"" messages, according to other comments, for if we had no type of editorials or parodies of the insane pop culture we buy into, there would never be any type of reform or self assessment, nor any type of consumer consciousness, and we'd simply buy whatever the big companies told us to.  In that right, I think Shrek was extremely successful, and on the flaky, silly, just a Saturday night movie with friends side, I also think it was successful, as it provided more than it's fair share of laughs.  Plus I found it very ""layered"", but not like pies or parfe, only like onions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another example of the masses settling for less. . .,"For anyone who A) believes that Shrek actually deserves an Academy Award nomination, and wasn't celebrated as such as a result of studio politics in a year where three huge entertainment conglomerates happened to release big-budget computer animation films (Disney, Paramount, Dreamworks) or B)that the movie was actually any good, please examine the following:Shrek pales in comparison to Pixar's Monster's Inc., and for very obvious reasons. Shrek desperately relies wholesale on it's (beware of the following buzzwords) ""cheeky/sarcastic/irreverent/ironic/tongue-in-cheek/post-modern"" send ups of classic fairy tales and folklore and . . . . not much else. I mean, it surely isn't relying on the completely NON-EXISTENT chemistry between Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. Shrek is Eddie Murphy's most UN-funny performance since Vampire In Brooklyn; and Mr. Myers starting getting truly & incorrigibly irritating by the time the first Austin Powers hit video. His disappearance from America's pop culture radar is long overdue.The story: Monsters, Inc. - like each and every one of the very excellent Pixar films - has heart and a warmth that cleverly (and NOT insultingly) touches every generation of viewers. Monsters, Inc. is able to speak to the audience in very touching and enjoyable ways, much like Toy Story 2; adults can remember/enjoy/get teary-eyed over their childhoods in a very sweet way, while enjoying seeing the joy and glee in their own kids' eyes while being entertained by the very excellent John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi (see some other long-winded Monsters, Inc. reviewer for story/plot details). What do we get from Shrek? A dragon that falls in love with the donkey - not for sincere emotional effect, but for dumb sexual comedy. Shrek is empty, hollow and cad-ish in comparison, without a single level of emotional resonance; Monsters, Inc. achieves several, handily.The comedy: The performance of a comedy team like Goodman & Crystal speaks for itself compared to the forced, joyless interaction between Myers' unlikeable Shrek and Murphy's neutered donkey. Goodman and Crystal - probably by virtue of Crystal's deep comedy roots & Borscht Belt classicism - touch on hammy old humor, updated and ""modern"" laughs and the good old goofy stuff for the wee ones. In fact, Monsters, Inc. struck me immediately as one of the least gag-oriented Pixar flicks - a lesser writing/producing team (ahem, Dreamworks) would rely on nothing but predictable monster gags in the same context. Don't believe me? Save for the Gingerbread Man scene, Shrek's ""clever"" gags are tired, overdone versions of the kinds of things we *really* laughed with in greats like Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the shorts of Chuck Jones & Tex Avery. The animation & cartoon industry has been lampooning themselves (and related genres like fairy tales, comic books, etc.) with good humor since the 1930s - do we need Shrek to do this for us again, now?The animation: It's impossible to not touch on this: Shrek's design is about as likeable & attractive as that of Antz, Dreamworks' other totally missed-the-mark and, well, ugly animated film. No one took any creative liberties with the environment and setting - we get an anonymous forest, a castle, a countryside. Wow. The setting of Monsters, Inc. is a visual carnival of original ideas and imaginative film making. Taking it's cues from existing influences and bettering them, or at the very least making them dazzle on their own, is half the reason animation exists - did YOU get that from the generic look and feel of Shrek?I will be thrilled - and honestly shocked - if the ""voters"" choose Monsters, Inc. over the huge-selling and grossly overrated Shrek. I've been conditioned to expect so little from fellow movie goers (see: Snatch and A Beautiful Mind's inexplicable presence in the IMDB.com Top 250) that I totally expect the more inferior film to get the award (notice, if you will, that I'm not even entertaining the thought of throwing Jimmy Neutron into this discussion - although, a comparison between Neutron and Shrek is probably more appropriate; it's easier to sort the trash that way, isn't it?).",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Some adult humor went over my head as a child but now I got them.As english being my 2nd language I didn't get a lot of Donkeys jokes but this time Eddie Murphy was fantastic.

The underdog in all of us....,"What makes Shrek ""1"" work is the simplicity, believable characters and the ability of the audience to connect emotionally (heey, there is underdog in everyone of us).Of course, saying ""reality check"" on the animated characters wouldn't be politically correct, perhaps ""parody"" sounds a good alternative. The obvious references work very well (all in good humour).The lead characters get adequate screen time and hence well etched out - Shrek, Fiona, Donkey. The me me. me. character Lord Farquaad is alright.The vintage characters are placed well (Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Gingerbread Man, Bear, Blind mice, Magic mirror, Three pigs)  the thing is that they don't go overboard.

This Could Change the World,"I'm not kidding. This is one of the very few fairy tale movies to actually practice the themes that it preaches. At the end of the movie, the story establishes that people don't need to be ""beautiful"" in the traditional sense of the word, but whereas other fairy tales fall short, and give some excuse to turn them both into rich supermodels, instead, Fiona continues to be an ogre, and the story ends on a ""happily ever after"" note with them still living in a swamp.Now, let's take a Disney movie as a contrasting example. Like, Aladdin. So at the end, the moral of the story is that Aladdin was a diamond in the rough despite being at the bottom of the social class barrel. But to live happily ever after, he needs to become a Prince.Shrek is of course renowned for its amazing visuals, which it certainly has in large supply. While the animation is superb with every character, I was especially impressed with Fiona, who was the most life-like among them, and certainly would give Aki Ross a run for her money. But along with all the visuals is an interesting story, dynamic and original character who manage to fit into the loose, generic roles associated with the genre (hero, damsel, sidekick) while defying the archetypes that usually tie such characters down. I was especially delighted to see the guardian dragon actually become a character and not just a story vehicle.As the result, we end up with an interesting, visually stunning, and wholly entertaining twist on the stereotypical fairy tale. One of the best movies of the year, and I fully believe that it should've been nominated for best picture. Unfortunately, the Academy, being so terrified of computer animation as they are, created the ""Best Animated Feature"" sub award so that they could take all animated films out of the running for best picture.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

What could only be made in months by classical techniques can be done in seconds by new techniques. In other words, computer animation is the end of animation, I thought. It would only improve the quantity but not the quality, I thought. Sadly Disney has shown us some examples of this. (Every Disney classic suddenly got a number II sequel of lower quality on video and DVD, to give an example). But in Shrek Dreamworks have taken animation up to a higher level and it really is amazing. They did not simply let the computer take over most of the work. They developed new techniques, not to save time, but to open new possibilities. Shrek took three years to make, the same period of time a classical animated movie took to make. The result is amazing. We see a new world, not just filled with cartoon characters, but with also with (almost real life) humans! As far as the movie itself goes, it is fantastic!

DreamWorks gives Disney the big green middle finger...,"A single word describes Shrek- brilliant.  Not in a long time have I enjoyed a movie as much as I enjoyed Shrek.  This is a movie that plays on a few different levels, and manages to be entertaining on all of them.  Plus, they stick it to Disney something good!Mike Myers is Shrek, a big green, smelly ogre trying to live a peaceful life in his swamp.  He spends his day brushing his teeth with bug goo and bathing in swamp mud.  All is well until the vertically challenged Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow in a brilliant performance) banishes all the kingdoms fairytale inhabitants to Shrek's swamp.  In an effort to regain his peace and sanity, Shrek, aided by his unwanted sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy), make a deal with Farquaad to rescue the Princess Fiona from The Dragon and bring her back so Farquaad can marry her.It's well known that DreamWorks and Disney have had an ongoing feud for years, and Shrek is the latest and most destructive shot yet.  The makers (led by ex-Disney, DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg) hits Disney where it hurts most - animated features.  No Disney chestnut is sacred. Various characters pop in and out of the film, and the sight gags playing on Disney's theme parks alone are enough to keep anybody entertained.  Without giving anything away, one of the most hysterical gags in the film involve the Princess and a little bird in a very Disney, very Snow White singing sort of way.The non-stop punches at Disney are one of the levels Shrek succeeds.  The other is that it's a pure, heart warming story that anybody of any age can enjoy.  Unlike most recent movies (animated or live action), Shrek is story driven.  Watching the film you come to care about the characters and get involved in their feelings.  I even found myself caring about characters that in any other movie would be pushed into the background soon after their ""big scene"".  I would also like to say that I commend the DreamWorkers for the ending.  It was unexpected and appreciated because it shows that beauty has many levels.In general, Shrek can do no wrong.

And I definitely think Shrek is up for that. There are too many movies ridiculing the perception of kids and serve them `jokes' on a plate. Jokes so bluntly obvious, and most often lacking anything that stimulates any brain activity that you can't really force yourself to even smile at them. So I'm not at all saying this movie is too `hard' for smaller kids to understand. It's a perfect mixture!Let's just see if the people behind this wonderful piece can make it even better, as I hear there's a Shrek 2 in the making. Hope it wont be just another `re-run' of this great movie or a bad sequel to make some extra cash.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Fun Movie!,"SHREKVoices: Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John LithgowRated: PGGenre: Animation/Adventure/Comedy/Romance/Fantasy/FamilyStar Rating: ***** out of 5Shrek is one of the best animation movies ever next to the ones from Disney/Pixar! The movie Shrek, is about a ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) who everyone thinks he is ugly and mean. Until one day when he met Donkey (Eddie Murphy) who liked him a lot and didn't care whether Shrek was ugly or not! So then these fairy tale characters come on Shrek's property by Lord Farquad. So then when Shrek and Donkey go to talk him, Farquad then sent him to go rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). So then when Shrek finds out that Fiona is in love with Shrek, Shrek goes to stop her from marrying Farquad, who just wanted to marry her just to become king. So then Shrek and Fiona are now married! I thought the entire movie was just fantastic, hilarious and enjoyable for people of all ages.BOTTOM LINE: VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Great, great movie!","Hilarious! I just couldn´t stop laughing during the whole film. The donkey was great!! He was the real star of the movie. The moral lesson of this film was very good. The plot was certainly predictable, but good. The parodies were fantastic. The character development was great. I didn´t expect this movie to be so good! I just hope its sequel is as good as this one, or even better (although making a movie better than this one is difficult).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Remind me what's so good about this movie, please.","I do not see what makes this movie so special. It's stupid and, truthfully, disgusting... but then again I wouldn't think anything more when the main character's voice is Mike Myers. I really want to know what people see in this movie. It's pointless! Am I the only one how thinks this movie should, well, jump a cliff without a parachute. It's not funny, it just tries to be! If anything, I say this movie doesn't deserve half of the ratings it gets. This movies OKAY for a, what? Seven-year-old? Yes, that sounds about right. Maybe and eight-year-old too.

Missing Something?,"My one line summary above can be taken in two different ways.  First, it could be seen as asking, ""Is this movie missing something?""  Or, it could also be taken to mean, ""Am I missing something?""  I'll try to answer it both ways.First of all, let me tell you that I grew up on cartoons.  I loved them back when I was a kid and I probably love them even more now.  This ""Shrek"" dreck, on the other hand, shouldn't really be classified as a cartoon. Sure, it's animated.  Sure, it isn't live action.  But it is to cartoons what digital video (i.e. ""Attack of the Clones"") is to film.  And I don't like that.So it's a light-hearted comedy with a great message.  Right?  Everybody I talked to that had seen this movie told me it was great, both for the parents and the kids.  I'm neither, but I can appreciate good humor in any form.  This movie just plain didn't make me laugh.  It didn't make me laugh; it didn't make me think; it didn't make me happy; and it certainly didn't make me glad I spent the time watching it.Therefore, on all counts, this movie is a complete failure.  It's my belief it's missing something (a soul perhaps?); however, it could be that it's just me who, plain and simple, does not ""get it.""",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Biggest Hit of 2001!,"To me, this film was very unusual and at the same time, very entertaining. From the opening titles to the end credits of the movie, I honestly could not stop laughing.Deep, Deep, in the forest, an ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) lives in a cabin with no one to talk to. He is basically lonely. But, all of that changes when a loud-mouthed donkey (Eddie Murphy) shows up out of the blue, Shrek becomes annoyed that there is no peace and quiet around the forest like it use to be. It gets even louder when fairy tale characters show up and command Shrek and the donkey to go on a mission to save the beloved Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from an evil castle and return her to an evil king (John Lithgow). Along the way, Shrek and the donkey just get on eachothers nerves.I give 100% graditude towards Eddie Murphy who made me laugh harder than ever as he played the donkey.Mike Myers (Austin powers, Waynes World), Eddie Murphy (The Nutty Professor, Showtime,) Cameron Diaz (Vannila Sky, The Sweetest Thing), John Lithgow (Cliffhanger, Third Rock From the Sun) star in this unforgettable comedy that was one of the biggest box office hits of 2001!Coming Soon:                                  Shrek 2",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Rage does wonders for satire,"For adults familiar with Hollywood, this film is a delight. Katzenberg's venom is evident and really funny. This is biting satire and parody that is just about as good as it can get. Of course, those totally unfamiliar with this background will also love this delightfully twisted fairy tale. And while the obligatory happy fairly tale ending is achieved, well, let's just say it too is bigger and better than one would expect. This is one to enjoy over and over.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I never thought..,"..that the movie would be so fantastic!! I read a lot reviews about this movie, and they were all saying that it was fantastic, but I never thought it was soo good. The characters are made soo realistic, and the voices behind them. OHH my god they are good, especially Eddy Murphy, he made me laugh all the time!! My advice to all of you out there, rent the movie, or buy it, just see it!! And I recommend buying/renting it on DVD, it makes the movie even better.

So good it hurt...,"Rather than go into a full critique, let me just say this... a large soda started an hour before we were let into the screening meant that I should have darted out to the lobby about halfway through the film.

It was... okay.,"It was sorta good when I saw it the first time, but after that it was BORING !!Some of the jokes were a bit funny but some were a bit childish and obvious, like when Shrek goes ""It's quiet, Too quiet"". The plot was a bit too ""Fairytale"" like for me.The actors were a good choice and the music was good, but the story was a bit of a let down for me, after hearing so much about it. I guess after seeing it three times, it has to be a bit boring.I know that a lot of people seemed to like this movie, but I thought it was very stupid.I didn't laugh throughout the whole movie. Monsters Inc. was way better than this !You decide for yourself !",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Excellent Film, All Around Great!!!","I loved everything about this film!  The animation alone is worth watching! I read a few other reviews on this site and a few of them said that they weren't impressed with the animation?  Are you serious?  What is wrong with you?  This animation is absolutely mind-boggling!  I think people that say they aren't impressed with the animation are people that have NO idea how much time, effort and work it takes to create just a single frame of this film (although, I'm no expert either, but I can at least imagine how hard it is).  Anyhow, don't listen to these people, the animation is excellent!!!The voice-acting is great on all accounts.  Mike Myers does a great Shrek, Cameron Diaz plays the perfect Princess Fiona, John Lithgow is awesome as Prince Farquaad, and Eddie Murphy completely steals the show as Donkey.  It really pains me to read other reviews and read that they didn't think the film was funny?  I don't know what to say to these people, I thought the film was hilarious!!!  Just different tastes I guess.I think this in one of the few films these days that can be enjoyed both by younger kids and adults, there's a lot of good stuff to this film.  I thought this film was excellent and can't wait for a sequel (hope it's good though).  I hope you enjoy the film when you see it, and you will!

One of the funniest films ever.,"Shrek is a very, very entertaining film.  There have been many attempts to take the classic fairy-tale genre and stand it on its head, going back to ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" on the old ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoon (and probably further, but that's the first I saw), but none succeeds so magnificently as Shrek.  The film takes the classic theme of a princess trapped in a castle and guarded by a dragon, and a prince who sees her in a magic mirror and wants her for his wife--and adds an ugly, rude, yet oddly lovable ogre, sent /by/ said prince, as the hero.  Add huge groups of fairy tale characters and references to classic stories, Eddie Murphy as a wise-cracking donkey--I'm sure the directors just let him talk about whatever he wanted to and just found a way to work it in--gloriously brilliant comedic lines, outlandish situations (Shrek's little wrestling exhibition is great, and the Dewlock(sp?) song kills me every time) and the fact that the plot is actually quite good in and of itself, and you have an instant classic.  A few too many crude jokes bring the rating down a bit for me, but the movie is still absolutely brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A perfect mix of fairy tale and sarcasm,"DreamWorks Animation and their groundbreaking technology fused into this romantic comedy is worthy of all of the praise. All of our favorite Fairy Tales Creatures and even Disneyworld itself aren't safe from some good natured ribbing in this satire featuring a cartoon ogre named Shrek (voice of Mike Myers). His sidekick arrives as a talking donkey (voice of Edie Murphy) while Lord Farquar (voice of John Lithgow), overplayed to perfection, boorishly covets his perfect world of Duloc and needs to marry a Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) to be their King. Myers heroically shines as Shrek, but it is Murphy, the proverbial ""third wheel"" with his comic ramblings and constant need of reassurance, that steals the show",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Another great movie for both kids and adults,"Shrek is one of those kids´ movies that adults are sure to enjoy as well. Many of my friends (I´m 19) saw Shrek before me and they all said it´s very good. Now I finally decided to rent the film and watch it myself. I´m glad I did. The movie´s hilarious! Donkey, played by Eddie Murphy, is the best character and he´s sure to make you laugh. Another great character is Lord Farquaad, played by one of my favorite actors, John Lithgow. He is such a fantastic performer, just watch The 3rd Rock From The Sun and you´ll know what I mean.       It´s no wonder that Shrek became a massive box office hit all over the world. Disney´s not the only studio that can produce good-quality family entertainment. Ice Age is another proof of that (I´ve only seen the trailer, but what a trailer that is!). Shrek actually pokes fun at many familiar Disney figures, but it´s not like Jeffrey Katzenberg is mocking them. I guess he just wanted to show his old pals at Disney that there´s a new player in the game and that´s DreakWorks & Co.Shrek, one of the best family movies out there, gets 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The film's success can be attributed to its ability to entertain both children and adults with its witty dialogue, pop culture references, and endearing characters like Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Surprising,"Eddie Murphy is notorious for his horrible movies. His base acting, humor, and overall style has smeared the face of movies with shame (see ""Pluto Nash"" for an example. However, this movie is surprisingly and refreshingly different from all other movies with Murphy in it.

Even though it is ultimately a child's movie, it gives excitement and pleasure to whomever sees it and is solidly recommended to anyone who asks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"delightful, funny satire of Disney and fairy tales","Please, people. You don't like the fart jokes? The key word is context. The fart jokes help establish the main character and the mood of ""Shrek"" - Shrek is a crude ogre and the movie is not your average fairy tale. I don't know why anyone would criticize the animation - it's really fabulous. And the plot itself is very well-written; it does a good job of satirizing Disney and just fairy tales in general, and all the characters are very non-cliche. This movie is very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Good, but disappointing and overrated","*Shrek* had a high bar to reach. Stellar reviews, good word-of-mouth, and my own anticipation since seeing the first trailer all led to a high degree of wanting it to be really, really *Memento*-good. While I've got *Memento* on my tongue, I can segue by saying that that movie lived up to the hype, while *Shrek* didn't quite make it all the way.I was very, very worried at the beginning. During the opening credits, they employ more gross humor than I've seen in some entire movies. Burping, farting, bug-eating, implied excrement, whatever they could think of. I was afraid. Where was the wit? The clever fracturing of fairy tales?The clever fracturing of fairy tales, I discovered, was not as prominent as I had thought and wished. Save for a few scenes at the beginning and the end, and one or the two in the middle, there isn't really that much of it. And most of what there was, I'd already seen in the trailers. The Gingerbread Man, however, should get his own movie. And I really love the Merry Men scene. I expected more of that kind of fun, but there wasn't.Where does the other humor come from? References to the butt, farting, jokes about how ""short"" [cough, cough] Lord Farquaad is, some nice Disneyland bits...and the fact that Eddie Murphy is speaking. He talks. A lot. But I like Eddie Murphy. The way he speaks, it's as if he believes that everything that comes out of his mouth is comic gold. Some of it's pretty funny. Some of it's just odd, but it's said amusingly. Some of it's just...hm, okay, he said what was in the script. But there are other really good elements of humor that I won't mention here because one good element of humor is the element of surprise.Mike Myers is excellent as well. I could hardly tell it was him. He uses a Canadian/Scottish hybrid accent that works very well. I read an article about how he actually begged to re-record his lines in this new accent because he didn't think he'd captured his character right the first time. It set the movie back three months and increased the budget by $4 million. Katzenberg thought it was worth it, and I think so too. Chris Farley was actually slated to play Shrek, and had actually recorded some lines before he died, but hearing Mike Myers' portrayal of him, I can't imagine Chris Farley doing it. I don't think he could have given him the genuine emotion that Shrek has now.Cameron Diaz. Hm. For the first fifteen minutes Princess Fiona talked, all I could see was Cameron Diaz speaking her lines in the recording room. I couldn't see the *character* saying the lines for some reason. I guess her voice was right for the character, but it took a while to get used to it.John Lithgow's great, but that goes without saying.The animation, as expected, is spectacular. It's just so amazing to see these 3-d characters walk around in their 3-d environment.So, overall...I think the movie could have been a *lot* better. Oh, I forgot to mention the music. I didn't recognize more than half the songs, but I suppose many of you will. Geez, sheesh, I sound like I hated the movie. I really didn't. My problem is I came in with really high expectations that weren't met. There's a lot of great stuff, and it's a very enjoyable movie (Enjoyability is always a plus for me). It does get my blessing and recommendation, but I just warn that you don't get caught up in all the hype. One review I just read ended with, ""but it's no *Toy Story 2*."" It isn't, but I think it could have been.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
