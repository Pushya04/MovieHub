Unmistakable Tarantino,"Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter. To identify his next catch, he tries to purchase Django (Jamie Foxx). Thing go all wrong Tarantino style. The two become friends and Dr Schultz decide on a plan to free Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a notorious plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).This is Quentin Tarantino all the way. His style has become as unique & original as they come. There is no mistaking it for another. It's the music, the violence, the visuals, the black humor, and the subject matter. This is all Tarantino. If there is one complain, it's the double climax. While I understand the need for a happy Hollywood ending, it would have been better to have 1 big gun fight and just finish with it. Not that big of a deal. Certainly it's still a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"My favourite Tarantino, and that's a bold statement.","A German bounty hunter flees a Slave, Django, and the pair embark on a mission to find Django's wife.As soon as I heard Luis Bacalov's Django, I was hooked.This remains my favourite Tarantino film, and let's be fair there are many classics in that particular catalogue.Django is equal parts shocking, entertaining, dramatic, bold, funny and original, to this day no other film exists that is remotely similar. It's a western, action packed love story, it really is a one off.Three hours passed by effortlessly, it's one of those films where I wasn't aware of time passing by, I was engrossed and absorbed into it.Some of the humour is hilarious, and in the context of the film works to perfection, the humour is as good, as the violence and misery of slavery are guy wrenching.The music is absolutely wonderful, the perfect soundtrack accompanies this great film. Indeed the whole production is exemplary, it's a skilfully crafted film, the visuals are jaw dropping, it's very skillfully put together, with costumes, sets and lighting all on point, with the unbelievable staging as well.Now I am sometimes quick to highlight who stands out in a film or TV series, but how can you do that here, every single performance is on point, Waltz, Foxx, DiCaprio, Jackson, I honestly don't think it gets better than this assembly of greats.It's no wonder it gave us so many memes, who hasn't seen this masterpiece. If you haven't grab your remote, and improve your day.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Tarantino at his best,"(Jamie Fox, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Don Johnson, Bruce Dern & Samuel L. Jackson)Set in the Wild West in Texas in 1858, a former dentist turned bounty hunter named Schultz stumbles upon the Speck Brothers who are in transit moving slaves they own. Schultz gets to talking with a slave named Django inquiring if he's heard of the Brittle brothers, upon affirmation of such information Schultz proceeds to purchase Django if he helps him locate and take care of the brothers than he would grant Django his freedom along with a horse and $75. Schultz then takes Django under his wing training him the ways of the bounty hunter and he becomes his deputy. After successfully tracking and taking out the Brittle Brothers and many other targets over the winter Django tells Schultz his story of how he and his wife attempted to escape their former owner and then were sold separately, and how he would like to use that reward to purchase his wife back. They discover the location of a Mississippi plantation where Broomhilda, his wife , was sold. They learn the ruthless Calvin Candie Von Shaft is the new owner and they now know that a scheme needs to be plotted to successfully purchase Broomhilda without raising suspicion that she was the target all along.For a nearly three hour movie it certainly doesn't feel that way as the film is so action packed that it'll keep you on your toes the entire duration of the film. A beautifully produced piece of film that stacks up with every other great Tarantino film, it just fits the mold so perfectly. Well developed characters and a unique story like none other. So much originality has been missing in westerns i feel like this one fueled the next decade of great westerns that have been released. This long list of actors in this film is quite extraordinary as there was even more great actors i could have listed. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and I'll admit i listen to this frequently it just fit the film perfect. The dialog was written so nicely creating some iconic scenes. Anyone who truly loves film can not get enough of this Tarantino masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Great Mix Of Action And Comedy,"Quentin Tarantino, one of the most iconic directors of the 21st (and late 20th) century, why? Simple. Because of masterpieces like this. Tarantino defies the laws of film, he shoots them in his own way, however he wants. Tarantino has always focused upon the action thriller genre from Reservoir Dogs up until Inglourious Basterds. However, Django Unchained is Tarantino's first look at the Western genre, his first attempt at it and he executed it beautifully. The scenes were shot perfectly alongside an amazing soundtrack as well as his own small cameo.Django Unchained tells the story of Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is soon picked up by bounty hunter Dr King Shultz (Christoph Waltz). The story follows on as Shultz takes on Django as his ""deputy"" during their tasks of bounty hunting, in return Shultz says that after winter he will help find Django's lost wife, Broomhilda. This takes them to a huge plantation in Mississippi owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), from here they plan up a scheme on how to get away with Broombilda.The cast boast out amazing performances, particularly Christoph Waltz (also famous for his previous collaboration with Tarantino on Inglourious Bastards as Colonel Landa). Both Foxx and DiCaprio's performance are both equally amazing. All three are able to add some light-hearted humour in the mix to make sure it doesn't stay too serious, as well as having comic actor Jonah Hill play a member of the KKK.There's a reason the film has been nominated for 5 Oscars.",,Anonymous,Drama
Django Unchained Rating and Reiview,"Interesting plot, story and events. Above average soundtrack and good actors who are really amiable and suitable. Excellent photography and directing of the movie. Holds excellent messages though many things need to be clearer. Just enough comedy to be mixed with drama. Sequence of events is good to very good but could've been much better. The movie was very good and had just the perfect amount of western style inclusion but for most people I think they expected more in addition to the amount of drama. The movie showed how crucial the slavery of black people was but didn't show how crucial it was for the other blacks (other than him and his wife and couple of others) and this was very disappointing taking into consideration how long the movie was. I think the movie should've been also count as a drama and an action. Overall, the movie was very good and fun to watch and sophisticated in a way, plus it was just enough western and drama that will not make you depressed.

A Bountiful Tale...,"Django's luck, has taken quite a turn, the chains around his legs, have suddenly been spurned, Dr Schultz did him a favour, uncoupled him from viscous slavers, now they're off to see what bounties can be earned. The rewards are more enticing than plain cash, as they hunt down evil villains and watch them crash, their revolvers take them out, seldom having time to shout, it's akin to picking up, discarded trash. Now Django's keen to find his wife who's kept, by Calvin Candie who is cunningly adept, at keeping people tethered, disobey and they get leathered, but the duo plan to make an intercept.Great performances, great dialogue and a bountiful tale set during the less celebratory times of a countries history.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
I like the way you write Quentin!,"This is a fun movie! Great acting, great soundtrack, great editing and great story! The scenes in the big house...top class! Every scene with Leonardo diCaprio was amazing! Now my problems with the movie: the main meat of the movie, the mid section, dragged on a little too long and some of the dialogue was a bit dull but it was necessary to tell the story. The opening of the movie though, was great, I was hooked instantly and the end was so chaotic and fast paced! I wasn't expecting this movie to be as hilarious as it was either, so many scenes had the timing of humour spot on and actually made me laugh out loud. The story isn't complicated or hard to follow which is good, I enjoyed being able to relax and watch the movie unfold. I like this...9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Brutally hilarious and quite messy, but a total blast from start to finish","I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers.The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino – he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django's editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino's work up until now.But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object – but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie's adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django's shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do.For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
It's not perfect but it's very good... and I'm not even a fan of Tarantino!,"I just saw this film and I confess that I am completely satisfied. I am not an admirer of Tarantino but I have little to say about this film, inspired by a character from the sixties western-spaghetti films and mixing western with blacksploitation. Tarantino's style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, but unlike other films I didn't feel that this was a problem or transformed the film into a kind of parody.The plot is about the search that Django, a former slave who is unexpectedly released and becomes a bounty hunter, will do for his wife, a slave who was sold and disappeared. He has the help of a German, responsible for his release. Together they discover that she is at the home of a rude slave-owner called Cotton Candy who, among other businesses, profits from death fights between slaves. So they decide to disguise themselves as experts in the field to go to his plantation and try to buy her freedom without Candy realizing what they want.The film is very good and, despite being almost three hours long, it has no dead moments and entertains wonderfully. However, although Tarantino's exaggerations and histrionic vision were not a problem this time, there are some points that were really uncomfortable, mainly concerning historical rigor, which, we already know, is not something that he really takes seriously (another reason why I don't like him as a director). To begin with, such Mandingo Fights never existed. We are not in Ancient Rome and the slave owners, however bad they were, did not like to throw money out the window and kill for pleasure their best pieces! Tarantino went to get that silly idea from another film he liked and pasted it here. Another problem is the use of dynamite, which would only be invented a few years after the period in which the film takes place. The clothes also do not match the time or place of the action. The outfit of the Club's black maid, with that miniskirt, is particularly bad in that it sexualizes the character and imports a 21st century scent into the middle of the 19th century. I will not go on much longer, I think I proved my point. Another thing I have to say is that this is a very violent film, Tarantino style, that is, with a ton of blood for each bullet, spectacular shootings, some nudity and high doses of brutality. The dialogues are also full of racist insults and profanity, but I think that was something the film asked for, in support of its own credibility. In short, this is not a movie for anyone. With Tarantino, this is often taken for granted.The main role was given to Jamie Foxx, and he is superb and gives the character a strength and toughness that I liked, and which contrast nicely with the polite sensitivity of Dr. Schultz, brilliantly played by Christopher Waltz. This actor had already done an extraordinary job in ""Inglorious Bastards"" and now he was even better, with a character that seems tailor-made for him. I was particularly impressed with the work of Leonardo Di Caprio, who rarely manages to make villains. He is an actor with a rare talent and has managed to be worthy of our contempt in this film. Another actor who shines in this film is the veteran Samuel L. Jackson, in the role of a black butler so fond of the owner that he becomes more slavish than whites. I also liked the brief cameo of honor of Franco Nero, the actor who played Django in the original films. It was an elegant and honorable way for Tarantino to bow to the actor and the work that inspired him. Much less impressive was the performance of Kerry Washington, who has little time and material to show what is worth.Technically, it is a film full of notable aspects that require our attention and that, to a large extent, are part of the director's brand image. It is the case of cinematography and the use of strong colors and slow motion footage in action scenes, features of a strong visual style that Tarantino loves. The sets are good, and also the costumes despite the anachronisms that I have mentioned. The film has a pleasant pace, but the first half was generally better yet more restrained: it seems that Tarantino gets lost in his own style as he approaches the most violent scenes. The soundtrack is great and takes advantage of several songs by various composers. Personally, I enjoyed listening to the original song from ""Django"" by Luis Bacalov, and the songs composed for this film by Ennio Morricone, a name that will always be associated, in collective memory, with the great western-spaghetti of the past. It was a careful, effective and honorable selection in the way it honors the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Freedom and Choices and Tarantino,"In Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, there is a scene in which Django (Jamie Fox), soon after being freed by the incredibly likable dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), shops for new clothes to wear.Schultz tells Django to pick out whatever he likes. Django looks at the smiling white man in disbelief. You're gonna let me pick out my own clothes? Django can't believe it. The following shot delivered one of the biggest laughs from the audience I watched the film with. After the white man confirms that yes, he is indeed letting the black man pick out his own clothes, we cut to a wide shot of Django riding his horse, now decked out in his very own (outlandish) cowboy outfit—an all blue with white ruffle get-up.It's a great little scene that provides humor and allows the viewer to further warm up to the two main protagonists. But it also does more than that. It's a simple scene that speaks for the whole film. It's an affirmation that this man of color is now free and able to make his own decisions. The choice he made concerning his extravagantly loud outfit acts as a warning to those that plan to stand in his way—watch out, here I come, I ain't gonna be quiet no more.And the humor the scene provides echoes the entire film—it wants us to get comfortable with our hero. Tarantino knows that a man of color makes an unconventional hero in a revenge- flick—that's why he made the film. When was the black man going to get his revenge film? It's been long overdue. With Django Unchained, that film has finally arrived and it has arrived in style. Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and meticulously written, it's Tarantino at his most epic.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Brace yourself for True Tarantino,"Quentin Tarantino's 8th film ""Django Unchained"" is one hell of a movie. A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now, they would've approve of this movie. It's designed to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you're in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz) who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics), who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now, you can't deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in here as well). His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for ""Ray"", Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body) playing a man who is free from slavery, but can't be free by the rules and limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born to be a part of Tarantino's entourage after his Oscar-winning performance for ""Inglorious Basterds"". Here, once again he brings humor and vulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen an actor go that far and doesn't go over-the-top like Leonardo DiCaprio. As Calvin Candie, DiCaprio is certainly Oscar-worthy as a man who runs a tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the death and female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind of guy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino's dialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals three dimples from a skull that belongs to his father, he is literally terrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L. Jackson is the real scene-stealer. The supporting cast is great from Walton Goggins, Jonah Hill, Michael Bacall, Michael Parks, James Remar, Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. ""Django Unchained"" has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But at the same time, it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearranged history by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up at a movie theater, he can do it again by having a former slave whipping a man who used to beat him and his wife. Now, that's entertainment. This movie really is off the chain. It's not only one of the most captivating films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year. Go see it, it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though, there are characters, especially Django, Stephen, Candie and Schultz that uses the N-word numerous times in this movie.

Who's that stumblin' around in the dark? State your business or prepare to get winged!,"Tarantino's first western film sees him return with a lot of the usual Hallmarks that are associated with him as an auteur. This film is heavy on violence with lots of gunplay and fighting, and it is filled with plenty of dialogue which drives the story as much as the action. Like some of his other films there is also a theme of vengeance running through it, something that was explored a little in ""Inglourious Basterds"" by Shosanna and the American-Jewish commandos; in ""Death Proof"" by the surviving women; sort of in ""Jackie Brown"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" too. This time out though, the main vengeance is between a freed slave and slavers in the 1850's wild west.Christoph Waltz plays Dentist/Bounty Hunter Dr King Schultz, who frees a slave called Django (Jamie Foxx), who will help him find some outlaws he has been tracking for a bounty. Django has his own plans though and wants vengeance against the racial injustices that are rife, and primarily to find his wife Broomhilda von Shaft. They learn that she is being held as a slave at the Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) ""Candyland"" plantation in Mississippi. On route to Mississippi, Django learns all about bounty hunting from working with Schultz and they develop a mutual respect for one and other.Although Jamie Foxx was not the first name out of the hat when Tarantino went into casting, he delivers a great performance as Django. As his story arc develops, he gives the role some excellent character and strength which I liked, which contrasted nicely with Waltz's more polite and sensitive character. Django and Schultz have a good chemistry that works well in tandem, one being gritty and raw, and the other being quieter and more reserved. One being about action now, and the other being more of a planner. Both manage to learn from each other as the story progresses and, in a sense, this becomes a bit of a buddy road trip (on horseback) film. In Tarantino's last film ""Inglourious Basterds"" I felt that Waltz's performance was one of the standouts, and this film he continues that level of acting once more. I do not prefer one of the roles over the other, they are both equally on par here.The pantomime villain of the film is DiCaprio's Calvin Candie. On the surface a well-mannered southern gentleman, despite obviously being a slaver and dictator in his own kingdom. This performance caught me off guard slightly and the usual lovable DiCaprio was able to turn on the offensive as easy as turning on a light switch. One minute he was being presented as calm and jovial, the next minute displaying a mean as hell psychopath willing to risk everything. Tarantino had wanted to work with DiCaprio for a while, even try to get him for a role in ""Inglourious Basterds"", so in ""Django Unchained"" he finally got his man.I must mention Samuel L. Jackson's performance in this, he was incredible. He made my skin crawl and was a genuinely haunting character. He felt as much a bad guy as Calvin Candie was. In learning to survive and the way he adapted to do so for a better lifestyle he become corrupted. This corruption was not just the way he was and acted, but also the way he looked, his mannerism, everything about the performance gave me shudders.Dealing with a film that looks at a dark time in humanities history is always going to invoke ill feelings and this certainly does that. Tarantino's film here is of course highly stylized and not entirely historically accurate in certain parts, but the main topic of slavery is something that cannot be denied. While ""Mandingo"" fights might not be accurate, or the wardrobe being display is not always correct for its time, the atrocity of slavery did of course exist and was mainstream in certain parts of America. While Tarantino handles this topic, and the linguistics unabashedly, certain audiences and critics did not respond well to it. While some audiences and critics have said it is offensive to them and handles racial issues terribly, equally the film has received praise from some quarters for the way it authentically handled these things. In this sense, the film does and will divide perceptions and will not make everybody happy or comfortable. In his own justification, Tarantino wanted to do a film which featured the history that America is ashamed to deal with, and which other countries directors feel they do not have a right to deal with.This highly stylized western film is tribute to Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960's and 1970's, three of which Tarantino openly admitted he paid homage to in making ""Django Unchained"". Sergio Corbucci's 1966 ""Django"" and his 1968 ""The Great Silence"", and Richard Fleischer's 1975 ""Mandingo. The ""Unchained"" part of the title may pay tribute to the likes of Corbucci's 1966 ""Hercules Unchained"", or Lee Madden's 1970's ""Angel Unchained"" which is a revenge film against rednecks. Lots of doffs of the cap to Corbucci but then when Tarantino wrote this film he had just finished a book on Corbucci overlap isn't all that surprising. Furthermore, Corbucci makes a cameo in the film too, which further shows Tarantino's admiration for the Italian filmmaker.I enjoyed this film more than I though I was going to. After ""Inglourious Basterds"" I expected another visually strong film, but one which was a bit messy and unintelligent. In this I got an exciting film that despite its nearly 3-hour runtime it did not feel like it dragged and still offered plenty of twists and turns. It might not have handled certain racial elements well, and I cannot think it did anything for gender politics either the way that women appear only as damsels in distress. But none the less it offered good writing with lots of strong dialogue. The onscreen bromance between Foxx and Waltz was endearing and fun, and DiCaprio's character gave me a somebody to ""boo"" and ""hiss"" at. Add to the writing and the performances some lovely cinematography and well-choreographed scenes, and this film does feel like a modern spaghetti western that is full of grit and style. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
This Movie Proves Something: Literally Any Concept Can Be Made Into A Fun Film,"Quentin Tarantino's Django: Unchained is almost equal to the mastery of Inglourious Basterds in every possible way, due to how both films capitalize on a dark and dreary subject to transform it into an absolutely FUN experience. However, Inglourious Basterds is superior since this movie's continuity errors, unnecessary location headers, unnecessary scenes, and dumb decisions from some intelligent characters are more clearly present. Still, those are the only criticisms of Django: Unchained that I could find through my watch that cause it to be BARELY below Tarantino's previous film. Please give this a watch if you want to witness hilarious and amazing performances, beautiful social commentary, pure intensity, and explosive action. Also, yes, the better the film and the less intricate its mistakes, the shorter the review.96% or 9.6/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Tarantino's Best, A Must See","I know claiming ""Tarantino's Best"" is quite a statement with such films as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Inglorious Bastards"", however I truly believe it is. Django Unchained is superb from start to finish, it's a 2 hour and 45 minute movie yet you're on the edge of your seat, eyes glued to the screen for the whole ride. It's the closest thing to a flawless movie I have ever seen. Before I continue my praise of this movie, let me say this ""the movie is not for everyone."" Clearly its rated R and it has several gruesome violent scenes, it also contains vulgar language and numerous uses of the ""n"" word. Some may claim it's excessive, but I personally appreciate how realistic it portrays the horror and tragedy of slavery. That being said, I am torn if I am more impressed with Tarantino as a writer of this movie or its director. He simply is a cinematic genius. The casting of this movie alone deserves an Oscar. Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo DiCaprio all put on Oscar worthy performances, and frankly, I would be astonished if they all did not win. I truly can't picture any actor on this planet being able to play any of those three roles as magnificently as these three actors did. I sum this movie into three general thirds, First: where Waltz steals the show, Second: where DiCaprio steals the show, and Third: where Foxx steals the show. I have only seen Waltz in ""Inglorious Bastards"" other than ""Django Unchained"" and he is rapidly climbing my favorite actors list. Leo is my personal favorite actor ever since his performance in ""The Departed"" and it was incredible to see him take on the challenging role as his first villain, Calvin Candie, possibly the most evil character I've ever seen in a film. Finally Jamie Foxx from start to finish played his best performance in any movie to date. Simply phenomenal. I loved how the audience sees his character evolve from a powerless slave to a confident powerful man. In addition to these three remarkable performances, Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson also deliver. Washington goes through living hell yet remains a strong woman throughout. Jackson plays a very interesting role as Stephen, Leo's loyal house slave. Trust me, you will hate him yet at the same time he is hilarious. Now's a good time to mention, this movie is funny! Tarantino perfectly tosses in frequent bursts of pure laughter throughout the movie to lighten up from the serious aspects of the movie. There is one scene in particular, involving Jonah Hill and Don Johnson, which had the crowd roaring in laughter for a solid full minute. Which brings me to my next point, the cast is absurd! The rather small roles for such big actors such as Jonah Hill and Don Johnson, just shows how honored actors are taking any role no matter how small for a Quentin Tarantino film. I recognized famous actors and actresses throughout the entire movie. There is one brief scene, where I believe I even saw famous rapper ""Childish Gambino"" for literally just a few seconds as a slave in Mississippi. This movie was done perfectly to a tee; even the remarkable soundtrack caught my attention, nicely combining songs of the past with modern day songs. This movie is a western, a drama, a tragedy, a comedy, an action, a thriller, and at it's deepest roots a romance. If you haven't already, stop what you're doing and see this movie today. Whatever you're doing can wait but this movie can't. Just make sure your 17, have your license, and have a stomach for more of the most gruesome violence I have yet to see on a screen. In conclusion, I've heard rumors of Tarantino pondering the idea of retiring as a director and Oo what a sad day that would be for movie lovers like myself, but if they are true at least he's going out with one hell of a BANG!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Django. Fun and pointless,"The biggest thing here is Tarantino's ego. Wow! A very clever, even gifted, filmmaker with nothing to say, nothing original that is. I'm not going to subscribe to Spike Lee's objections because that would imply taking this seriously. Mr. Tarantino's ignorance is just monumental, mo-nu-men-tal! but, I'm afraid, very much the sign of the times. Let's make it about nothing with super violence to keep the crowds cheering. What about taking a little responsibility sir? Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz and the rest of the cast do a credible job, inhabiting Tarantino's makeshift universe. Sergio Corbucci is your hero, but not John Ford, okay, that makes sense in your world, Mr Tarantino but please, stop preaching. Make movies but don't pretend that there is depth in your shallowness. I must say I wasn't bored, in spite of its length, I was just annoyed.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A messy movie,"You would be surprised if Quentin Tarantino ever made a truly bad movie. But he has made a few which, though not bad, are somewhat disappointing. Django Unchained is one of those. Honestly, this movie is a bit of a mess. An intriguing mess, at times a very entertaining mess. But still a mess. The movie gets away from Tarantino somewhat. His grand vision for what he wanted the movie to be ultimately lets him down. He couldn't let go of any of that vision, couldn't restrain himself. He put it all up there on the screen. And it proved to be just a little bit too much.The movie takes place in the pre-Civil War South. It is a story about slavery and Tarantino spares nothing in portraying the awfulness and brutality associated with that particular Southern institution. The hero of the piece is freed slave Django, unchained as the film's title would suggest and free to seek vengeance. But for Django more important than seeking vengeance is finding, and freeing, his wife who remains a slave. He is aided by the rather odd German dentist Schultz who does not actually make his money in dentistry. Schultz has a rather different occupation, a rather bloody one. And he is very good at his job so the bodies pile up in a hurry. Schultz, the man responsible for freeing Django, takes the former slave under his wing. Django helps Schultz do his bloody work and eventually Schultz will help Django find his wife.From its very intriguing beginning in which we meet the very mysterious Schultz the movie grabs your attention and certainly piques your interest. You desperately want to know who this mysterious man is, what he's up to. However once those questions are answered the movie begins to lose some momentum. It often feels as if the movie is just biding its time until it gets to the real story, the plot to free Django's wife. In the meantime things drag. There are a number of scenes which seem completely unnecessary. A little more focus would have done wonders for this movie. As it is things don't really perk up again until we finally, after much meandering, meet the despicable plantation owner Calvin Candie. This loathsome individual is the man who owns Django's wife. How do Django and Schultz plan to free her? It's quite the elaborate plan which, for the movie, is a bit unfortunate as it takes so much time to set the plan up. We now have the new character of Candie to interest us, and hating him is quite good fun, but again the movie struggles with pace. The big moments in this movie are big indeed. But there is too much dead space in between those big moments. At 165 minutes long this is a movie that is much too long for its own good. The crackling energy you expect to be running throughout a Tarantino film is missing. The director lost his way a bit.So there is a twinge of disappointment with this movie. But that does not mean it is a bad movie. It clearly could have been better but as is it is certainly worth seeing. After seeing it once you may not want to see it again though, it is a somewhat distasteful movie. Tarantino is never one to shy away from violence and the gore in this one is off the charts, it's a real bloodbath. It's just too much, way over the top. In and around the spasms of violence there is a lot here to recommend the movie though. It's a good revenge story, you've got heroes worth rooting for and bad guys who are as bad as bad can be. The movie is generally very well acted. Jamie Foxx as Django and Christoph Waltz as Schultz make for a very good team. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't entirely convince as the villainous Candie. It is as if DiCaprio is trying a little too hard to be evil, it comes off as being a bit forced. But in the moments when Candie is charming, and yes even this monster has his charms, DiCaprio seems much more comfortable. Notably fine work is turned in by Samuel L. Jackson playing Candie's loyal house slave Stephen. In his own way Stephen is perhaps more reprehensible than Candie and Jackson does a fine job of making that character his own. Tarantino fills out his cast well, supporting parts and little cameo roles all handled capably by a multitude of performers. All in all this is a movie with a lot of good pieces but there is the sense the pieces don't all fit together properly. Tarantino didn't make a bad movie. But he didn't make a great movie either.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Over indulgent, gross....but also terrific.","My biggest complaints about ""Django Unchained"" are ones that really won't matter to most people who see this film. After all, just about everyone knows that Quentin Tarantino's films are incredibly bloody, gross and self-indulgent. So, when you see a billion gallons of blood and bodies flying everywhere, you are not really surprised! This one does go a step further--there is some full-frontal male nudity and a few of the scenes were so gross and gratuitous that Tarantino has outdone himself. But still, you KNOW ahead of time that this is not a film to show your mother, Father Jenkins or your 6 year-old!! However, HOW far it goes will limit the film's appeal--you can be sure of that. Evan a large number of adults would be unable to stick with this one...it's THAT violent.The film is, in some ways, like an Italian western. I loved that much of the music was done by Ennio Merricone--the same guy who did music for such classic spaghetti westerns as ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". It was a major plus. I also liked seeing that one of the many wonderful cameos was by Franco Nero--the original Django. But, if you think that this is a modern Hollywood version of an Italian western, you are mistaken. PARTS of it are--most is not. In fact, despite the western clothing on so many of the characters (anachronistic, actually), the film is mostly set in the American South just before the Civil War. People just didn't dress that way at that time and in that place. The film is, at times, sort of like a blaxspoitation western in style as well.What did I like about the film? Well, it was never, ever dull. The film never really gives you a chance--even though it clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes. Second, as I mentioned above, there were a lot of cool cameos--and some were real surprises, such as Tom Wopat and Bruce Dern! Third, although it was vile, the language was dead on--no politically corrected phraseology in this one! Nasty and blunt, that's for sure. Fourth, although it was really violent and gross, I will admit that there is something very satisfying in seeing all these racist jerks killed so violently. It appeals to the lowest instinct in us...but on a primal level is IS appealing. Finally, the acting was quite good.What didn't I like? Well, even for a Tarantino film it was violent---very violent. Also, I definitely agree that the first hour or so of the film was MUCH better. It was better paced, less indulgent and more enjoyable. The film did become a bit of a free-for-all blood-fest near the end and the 'mandingo fighting scene' was unnecessarily nasty. Still, if you have the stomach for it, ""Django Unchained"" is a heck of an enjoyable film.By the way, I did a little research and there appears to be no such thing as 'mandingo fighting'. This was made up for this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Beautiful and violent,"Sometimes the German equivalent of the MPAA can surprise us all. Not only did this movie get a rating (uncut), it also passed with a ""16"". I'm always happy, when they pass a movie uncut, so I won't complain. That doesn't mean, I'm not wondering what is going on in the heads of some of those people who decide what rating a movie gets. The movie even got some heat in America for its violence (then again it also got some heat, because of its male lead. One party decided it wasn't a good example for white people to be killed by a black guy, the other side thought it was unfair in its depiction of black people and so forth)! Saying it lead to people becoming violent(?).Apart from those discussions, what can be said, is that Tarantino did it again. A great movie, with superb performances by everyone involved. Who'd have thought Kerry Washington would have to learn German for a role? Not me, but the inclusion of Waltz, Tarantino favorite and rightfully so, made this happen. And while Waltz almost steals the movie, it's still very much a Jamie Foxx picture.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Tarantino Epic,"By incorporating a multitude of thematic Tarantino elements Django is the best Tarantino movie SINCE Pulp Fiction. Not as good as that great movie since this one is a little more bloated and less novel, it nonetheless is Tarantino's second best movie. This was great because it used many of the best aspects of the other Tarantino films. Such as the friendship between a black and white antihero (a hit-man like in Pulp Fiction but now the male bonding is as bounty hunters), also the violence art similar to Kill Bill and the Gut Warming, heart pounding, pulpy thrill of revenge against an evil like in Inglorious Bastards. There were many other aspects of Tarantino's movie in this one.To start off the complete unpredictability is what really draws you in. You really do not know what is going to happen next which is refreshing to those that frequently see movies. The episodic scenes have such a high degree of unpredictability that it mesmerizingly keeps us on the edge of our seats.There were some really amazing characters created which was not wholly due to the writer/director but the great actors who infused their talent into the roles. These characters' eccentricities were so unique that you might have never seen characters like this before. A trademark oddity in how they spoke, what they said and their ultimate actions reflected without any creative barriers the moviemaker's soul. If you thought Christopher Waltzes and Jamie Foxx's character were great wait till you get to DiCaprios and Samuel L Jacksons. You really wanted to see more of these characters despite the nearly 3 hour length of this Tarantino epic. Dicaprio's character was probably the best; he was so amusing with his warped, semi-depraved, megalomaniac eccentricity. DiCaprios acting was really good here too. Samuel L Jackson can blurt out the necessary profanities with the appropriate rawness making him the perfect actor for some of Tarantino's parts.The greatest thing is the psychological aspects to these characters and how that plays out in the scenes. There is actually a lot of psychology going on which builds multi-dimensional characters and creates scenes of intense unpredictability. There were other scenes of brilliant hilarity mocking the dark side of the old south, or genre film itself.As the movie progressed and where it could have ended well and uniquely alas a contrived scene was thrown in to showcase Tarantino's signature brand of violence art, reminiscent of Kill Bill. This weakened the movie as a whole and made it drag however it was pure fun to witness the slow motion blood splattering and detailed depiction of body parts being shot with blood shooting out like geysers drenching the place in red.I think I heard Tarantino is criticized for rehashing old movies or copying from other films. I guarantee whether or not that is the case you've never seen something like this before.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Better than ""Death Proof""","I pretty much gave up on Tarantino after ""Death Proof"". He had been my favourite filmmaker in the '90s, but as far as I'm concerned, with that movie, he totally lost the plot. The signs were there: with ""Kill Bill, vol. 2"" I kept wondering what happened to his ability to write witty and original dialogue.The dialogue was what was so great about his first movies. Back in the early '90s, movies used dialogue to advance the story. That was pretty much it. Watch an early '90s blockbuster like ""Basic Instinct"" for an example. Every time the characters talk it is only to communicate information that the screenwriters want the audience to know to help the movie get to its final destination. Tarantino's characters don't just talk because the movie needs them to. They talk because they have personalities of their own; there were no ""Mr Expositions"" in ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"".In ""Death Proof"", however, Tarantino totally fell on his own sword. That was the one where characters talked. And talked. And talked. And talked. And died in a car crash. And were introduced. And talked. And talked.The first time I watched ""Django Unchained"", I didn't get very far. There was too much Christopher Waltz, and of course, too much uninteresting dialogue. But I decided to give it another go just now.What I can say about the movie is that it is nowhere near as bad as ""Death Proof"". The dialogue isn't endless and tedious to that extreme. It's also not that interesting, though. The movie often lost my attention; it was hard to care too much for the plot. It was enlivened by its set pieces and hand picked character stars.It did not need to be almost three hours. I think most of the dialogue between Waltz and Foxx could have been cut out, and the details discussed shown, rather than told.What the hell did Waltz win the Oscar for? If any performance in the movie was Oscar-worthy, it was DiCaprio's. Waltz was a plot device, and pretty one-note.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Don Johnson was cool and James Remar is always good. Not Tarantino's best but an enjoyable slice of historical fiction even though it was rife with plot holes and quite unlikely scenarios. Fan's of Samuel Jackson should consider it a must see. Even though I really like James Remar, Tarantino should noy have used him for two separate roles. It was a bit confusing. Especially when all of the other cameos (Lee Horsely, Tom Wopat, etc)were cool and he could have dredged up so many more forgotten actors to appear.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""You go to Hell, dentist!""","It now seems inevitable that Quentin Tarantino would make a spaghetti western and only he would know his Morricone or the western genre in general well enough to use the maestro's score from an obscure war movie called 'Hornet's Nest' or to call Christoph Waltz's horses Tony and Fritz; Waltz himself probably being the first dentist hero since Painless Potter.Making the Klan figures of fun and constant use of a certain naughty word are also characteristic of the Tarantino; although the film's at least an hour too long - also characteristic of the lad - and would have been twice the film it was at half the length.

*A Bold and Unforgettable Cinematic Journey*,"""Django Unchained,"" directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a powerful blend of genres that captivates audiences with its unique narrative and striking visuals. Set in the pre-Civil War South, the film follows Django, a freed slave played by Jamie Foxx, as he embarks on a daring quest to rescue his enslaved wife from a brutal plantation owner.One of the standout elements of the film is Tarantino's signature storytelling style, which masterfully combines elements of spaghetti westerns with sharp social commentary. The film doesn't shy away from addressing the harsh realities of its historical context, and it does so with a blend of dark humor and intense drama. The dialogue is brilliantly crafted, showcasing Tarantino's talent for creating memorable and impactful lines.The performances are exceptional, with Jamie Foxx delivering a compelling portrayal of Django, a man transformed by the thirst for justice. Christoph Waltz shines as Dr. King Schultz, a former bounty hunter who becomes Django's ally, providing both mentor-like guidance and comic relief. Leonardo DiCaprio's chilling performance as Calvin Candie, the ruthless plantation owner, adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, making him a formidable antagonist.The film is stunning with Tarantino's attention to detail evident in each frame. The cinematography captures the vast landscapes of the South, while the soundtrack perfectly complements the film's tone, featuring an eclectic mix of songs that enhance the viewing experience.""Django Unchained"" is an audacious and thought-provoking film that tackles heavy themes while remaining entertaining.

Tarantino at his best,"Wow! What a mind blowing film! This is by far one of Tarantino's best pictures and a masterpiece without a doubt. He put his whole heart in this movie(as he does in every movie of his) and he easily made me speechless at the end of it. This is an intense movie that not only keeps you engaged, but it also keeps you guessing. This film is genius in every aspect. Firstly, the acting is simply out of this world. Jamie Foxx was brilliant and natural at the same time in every single scene. Then, there is absolutely no one who could have portrayed, Calvin Candie better than Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a master. Christoph Waltz is such a magnificent actor who really does put his heart on the table for each film he does. The whole cast and crew did a great job in putting this movie together piece by piece.

Behind The Violence,"Django Unchained is a Western film that is thematically about revenge against slavery and racism. The film clearly understands how terrible this condition is, thus it gets interesting to that point. Since this is a Quentin Tarantino film, he never abandons his own style. Just like any of his films, it is brilliant in craft, gives a set of memorable characters charmed by the performances, and a high entertainment quality. The journey is quite enjoyable, though towards the end it disappointingly creates a misstep but it's all good anyway. Django Unchained hasn't beat Tarantino's best but it still can be memorable and undeniably enthralling.Any movie fan, especially of course Quentin Tarantino's fans, would definitely love the experience. The most obvious reason is his pure cinematic style. There's violence, great characters, and classic filmmaking. It's easy enough to get satisfied by those. The storytelling is pretty much of a Western story can be. The film takes a serious theme that keeps the plot intriguing. It sets an uneasy context and displays the violence of those times. At the point when Schultz first reacts at Django's whip marks and the depiction of that cruel history, there's a sense that the film might go extraordinary than just another cinematic pleasure. Disappointingly, the final act suddenly transforms the whole movie into an insane sweet revenge story. It seems like it's suppose to be a fan service or it's trying to be faithful to the Western genre, but it's random from all that was set up on the first two acts. It's not bad. It's just random. Again, it's still enjoyable but it could have been better and much compelling.The performances are as fun as a Tarantino film could ask. Jamie Foxx convincingly shows the personality, swagger, and the pathos inside of Django which is great enough to the character. Christoph Waltz once again steals the show. Mostly because his character gets to do more things than Django. Waltz is just being Waltz but his performance still shines as he brings charm to the character. Leonardo DiCaprio stands out, not only because it's an unusual performance from him but he also manages to hide the unknown sinister behind the villain's awkward charisma.The filmmaking is, without a doubt, stunning. The direction shows off many styles and impressive shots. The script is witty and makes the entire film entertaining. Even from the very first sequence, you already get the sense of fascination on what's happening. The production design is classy enough to make things look good. The cinematography is indeed perfect for a Western film, and the music score fits to every scene. Everyone will definitely find the action exciting even if the bloody violence may look too splashy.Django Unchained is a spectacular cinema despite of its mistakes. At least it never avoids portraying the ugliness of the setting. The dazzling styles can't even gloss that over. There is still something missing in the end which is sort of difficult to forget, but all the strange fun, humor, and intrigue will always grip you throughout the experience. The filmmaking and the performances are already remarkable to be fascinated. It's a near masterpiece. If only it was less ridiculous and less forced at the third act. Though, this flaw isn't really that bad. In fact, it's probably one of the best looking flaws you'll see. No one could make a flaw this good like Tarantino. Overall, it has plenty of memorably great moments and achievements that indicates that the film is still amazing.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Tarantino At the Top of His Game,"Django Unchained (2012)**** (out of 4)Quentin Tarantino returns to full glory in this violent homage to the various Spaghetti Westerns that he grew up watching. Former slave Django (Jamie Foxx) is bought by bounty hunter Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and in exchange for his help in tracking down three wanted brothers, Schultz promises to give him his freedom. Things then change when Django decides to go find his wife (Kerry Washington) who is being held by the notorious Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).I was one of the few who didn't care too much about Tarantino's previous film but DJANGO UNCHAINED has him returning to full glory. This film is funny, intense, violent, at times shocking but most important is that it's flat-out great entertainment from start to finish. If one is easily offended then there's a lot here to get upset about but it seems people often forget that Tarantino makes exploitation movies, which means he takes a serious subject and exploits it for entertainment. All sorts of violent sub-genres came up during the 70s glory days of exploitation and I think mixing the Spaghetti Western with a slave story works on many levels. The biggest being that the film manages to shock you but you also hate what's going on so much that you can't help but get behind Django and his cause. Foxx really did a remarkable job here and perfectly captured those gunslingers who said very little but did their talking with a gun. Waltz and his comic timing are downright terrific and he really adds a perfect balance to what Foxx does. DiCaprio is also excellent in the role of the sadistic Southern gentleman and I'm sure Oscar-time will be friendly. Don Johnson also does a great job with his small but flashy role and the debate on the masks is a brilliant example of comedy.The film really does a remarkable job at being a Tarantino film. Meaning that everything a fan has come to expect from one of his movies is on full display and perfectly executed. The music score is fabulous, the cinematography highly impressive and the costumes and settings really make you feel as if you're in the actual period that the film is set. DJANGO UNCHAINED isn't going to be for everyone but then again, what exploitation film is? The film is very dark, very bloody but oh so funny. It works on all levels including a terrific adventure picture with a bloody good revenge tale.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Works really well despite so much of it seeming to be at odds with itself,"Beyond the name and a cameo by Franco Nero, the story here has nothing in common with the original film series being referenced, although the genre and the design do of course have a lot of common ground. The story here sees a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter freeing a slave who can identify three men who have a considerable bounty on their heads. Despite being an one-time deal, the partnership works so well that the two stay together for more work, although the slave (Django) only has one overall goal – to find his wife and buy her freedom.The film opens with all the tropes that tell you that this will be an exploitation-style western; the music is of its time, the credits are blood red in that wonderfully gaudy manner and the camera movement is knowing but effective, and indeed this is what we get from the film as a whole – a bloody exploitation western that refers the grindhouse films that Tarantino idolizes so much. However to suggest that this is all the film does is to somehow miss the fact that it does so much more. Despite being trashy in some regards, it is brutally unsettling in others – some scenes of cruelty to slaves are very hard to stomach. On top of this we have the usual dialogue scenes that Tarantino is very good at – just like Inglorious Bastards had some incredibly tense scenes of just talking, Django has many great dialogue scenes – some are conversations with a bubbling tension, others are monologues delivered to camera in such a way that you are gripped by what the character is saying. Then we have the other thing Tarantino – sudden bloody violence, and it is very bloody here – excessive, OTT and very well executed. And just in case this mix isn't convoluted enough, the film also takes the time to have plenty to laugh at whether it is the flamboyantly written characters or the comedy set-pieces which include a clan raid having wardrobe issues. It really shouldn't work – I have seen other films trying to do several things in the same film and not make it work but yet here it does, and remarkably so.Credit to Tarantino because he really doesn't put a foot wrong here (aside from casting himself when he can't act). He delivers a great exploitation film that, much like Inglorious, allows the audience this bloody fantasy retribution with the underdog hero, but also has scenes of genuine tension, scenes of great dialogue and others of genuine hilarity – and most importantly none of them seem out of place. The length of the film put me off a bit because the cinema releases ahead of awards ceremonies all seem to run long as if that counts in their favor – but in the case of Django the time really flew. It helps that it is really well filmed too; the camera movement is powerful, the shot selection good and With such material to work the cast all give great performances – again despite so many of them having different aspects to deliver on. Waltz is a great presence, as he was in Inglorious – he fits the dialogue really well and captivates with his colorful character. Surprising to me was how much I liked Foxx – he downplayed when he needed to but yet was also able to step up into the exploitation hero when required. Di Caprio captures real smiling menace and again I was surprised by how well he did it. Samuel L Jackson isn't in the film till the final hour or so, but when he arrives he joins a very crowded screen of people all commanding attention – but his house slave is brilliantly loathsome and convinces as a man so long surviving that he has forgotten this is what he is doing. Washington has less time but she sells the emotional part of the film by being so convincingly brutalized. The supporting cast is almost too heavy in famous faces, but mostly they do not distract but rather add with their various turns.I was taken by surprised by how much I enjoyed this film and how the time flew. It mixes so much together that should clash and damage itself, but yet it all works really well (even the mixing of genre music and modern hip-hop!). I'm not always a fan of Tarantino's grind house and exploitation referencing, but here it works really well across the board.",,Anonymous,Drama
A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's scurrilous lampoon on human trafficking,"Django Unchained presents the larger-than-life tale of a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who collaborates with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz)—a German dentist-turn-bounty hunter—in order to rescue his wife from the servitude of a ruthless Mississippi plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). The story begins in the US state of Texas in the year 1858—two years prior to the start of the American Civil War. The tone of the movie is set by Luis Enriquez Bacalov's original ""Django Theme Song"" sung by Rocky Roberts—taken as it is from Sergio Cobucci's Django (1966)—which plays with the opening credits. Django Unchained is Tarantino's tribute to the visionaries of Western filmmaking—those who conceptualized the decorated genre and more so those who prevented it from dying by reinventing it. The Western genre has always fascinated Tarantino. Right from the beginning of his career it has been his dream to make a Western of his own. Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci are the two filmmakers who seem to have inspired him the most. With Django Unchained, Tarantino finally seems to be living his lifelong dream of emulating his childhood idol. And what makes Django Unchained even more special is the fact that it comes at a time when the Western genre once again finds itself on the brink of obsolescence.While the classic works of John Ford and Howard Hawkes epitomize the golden age of Western filmmaking, the grotesque, tongue-in-cheeky works of Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci—often referred to as Italo-Western or more prominently as Spaghetti Western—clearly represent its new age. At a time when Western genre was looked upon by most filmmakers as dead and buried, Leone and Corbucci not only rejuvenated it but also changed its very face for the better. The Old West which was once governed by the tenets of pride, honor, chivalry, machismo and idealism got metamorphosed into a brutal realm inhabited by realistic, grey-shaded characters that despite their endless flaws couldn't be deemed completely devoid of human virtues. While Leone is often regarded as the master creator of Spaghetti Western cinema, people often overlook the indelible contribution made by Corbucci. With movies like Django (1966) and The Great Silence (1968), Corbucci succeeded in adding a whole new dimension to the Spaghetti Western canvas by painting a nightmarish world haunted by fascist ideologies. In fact, Corbucci's depiction of the Old West was so lurid, stark, brutal and vicious that it made Leone's portrayal appear remarkably dull and placid in comparison.There's absolutely no doubt whatsoever that with Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino consummates his trademark style—built around the uncanny combination of gore, glamour, grotesquerie, and dark humor—which is often described using the adjective ""Tarantinoesque"". The movie's filming style also bears a striking similarity to Sergio Corbucci's sanguinary, majestic Spaghetti Western masterpiece: The Great Silence (1968). In Django Unchained, Tarantino fiddles with history (but falls short of rewriting it unlike his previous film Inglourious Basterds) to present his own perspective on several delicate issues mainly concerning slavery. Tarantino's naked display of uncorroborated brutalities associated with the inhumane practice of slavery, especially Mandingo as its extension has given rise to discontent among certain sections of the white community. Likewise, the movie has received condemnation from the likes of Spike Lee and Tavis Smiley for glorifying the n-word in the tradition of blaxploitation films. Django Unchained features special appearances from Jonah Hill, Don Johnson, Quentin Tarantino and Franco Nero who had played the titular role in the 1966 Spaghetti Western classic Django.Tarantino's imaginative direction is well backed up by some commendable acting performances from movie's lead as well as supporting cast. Jamie Foxx delivers his best performance in years, one that is perhaps bettered only by his Oscar-winning portrayal in Ray (2004). Despite bearing several similarities to his multi-lingual part in Inglorious Basterds, Christoph Waltz portrayal easily forms the backbone of the movie. Tarantino once again takes full advantage of Waltz's polyglot abilities and uses it to great effect at different points in the film. Waltz's Schultz is basically a representation of all those white men who raised their voice against slavery and contributed to its abolition. Behind his facade of a cold-blooded bounty hunter we discover a righteous human being whose superior intellect is well matched by his great sense of compassion. He inexorable resolve to rescue Broomhilda and his sacrifice in the end inexplicably brings to mind of the great sacrifice made by Abraham Lincoln. Schultz is a symbol of white men's conscience, courage and virtue in the same way as Samuel L. Jackson's Stephen is a symbol of Black men's pusillanimity, servility and hypocrisy. Thus, Stephen in many ways is Waltz's antithesis and the movie's true antagonist. And to Jackson's credit, he plays the part with great subtlety, guile and conviction. According to this critic, it's his best performance since Pulp Fiction (1994). Leonardo DiCaprio, in a rare negative portrayal, delivers a thumping performance as the sadistic Calvin Candie. A megalomaniac who dresses with the perfection of a fop, Candie is quite easily one of the most menacing Western villains of all time. Kerry Washington plays the part of the slave-girl Broomhilda—the only major female part in the movie—with exquisite charm.Overall, Django Unchained has its flaws and suffers from anachronisms and incongruities, some deliberate and some not so. But, Tarantino still manages to pack a strong punch. From the cinematic point of view, Django Unchained is undoubtedly a lesser work in comparison to Inglourious Basterds (2009). But the audacious yet effective manner in which Django Unchained retraces the history, fiddles with it, and presents its dark side makes it an important work of cinema. Django Unchained is unusually high on style, but luckily there's enough substance to keep an intelligent viewer interested. Highly recommended!A more detailed review of the movie can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
More of the Same,"Quentin Tarantino is quite possibly the master of popcorn cinema - entertaining films that give an illusion of depth while actually being incredibly shallow. This is another fine example of this genre and if you take it for that, you'll be sure to enjoy the film immensely. Especially the first half is incredibly funny and Christoph Waltz shines as the incredibly subtly named ""Dr. King"" that frees Django and turns him into a bounty hunter. There's good dialogue, decent action scenes and just enough of a story to keep you entertained for almost two hours. Sadly, the film lasts for almost three and would have greatly benefited from some serious editing. At some point, I just wanted it to end, especially when Tarantino's usual gore-fest took over in the last third of the film. If you are trying to find out whether you'll enjoy the film: that's quite easy. If you like any other Tarantino film, you'll like this one. If you don't care for his ""style"", this one won't change your mind. So really, it's just more of the same, solid albeit uninspired entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Mostly Standard Recent Tarantino Revenge Fantasy,"Why you shouldn't see it:If you've seen Inglourious Basterds and thought once was enough, you're not likely to find much worth reviewing here. This is another of Quentin Tarantino's fantasy revenge flicks, of the sub- genre that rails on systemic injustices.Beyond that, there are a number of pretty obvious reasons that will probably jump out at you right off the bat, even if you haven't seen the movie. Most of these reasons boil down to whether or not you are comfortable with confronting humanity's occasionally (or frequently, if it's the deep south in the 1850's) ugly nature. This is a movie that makes white Americans uncomfortable with being white Americans in much the same way that Basterds probably made German non-Jews uncomfortable with being German non-Jews.This film unabashedly displays outrageous racism and almost cartoonish violence (frequently using the high visual contrast of bright red blood spattering on bright white set pieces). Two things that, like it or not, are prevalent recurrences in the way mankind has conducted itself through the years. If you like to close your eyes, cover your ears, and sing ""The Song That Never Ends"" when you're confronted with either of these things, because you like to think happy thoughts about the good ways in which people treat each other, this movie is not for you, and you will likely find it a tremendous waste of your time. Unless you really like singing that particular song, I guess.Why you should see it:It should be noted, however, that the way that Django and Basterds make an individual want to check his cultural baggage at the door is wholly unrelated to the way in which movies like Amistad and Schindler's List do the same thing. While the two Spielberg movies make you take a magnifying glass to our past somewhat against your will, the two Tarantino movies are more like your charismatic buddy who comes along and says, ""Hey, check this out.""Django takes American slavery, shines a bright light on it, and hands it a microphone so that it has the opportunity to show what it's about. In a way that possibly only Tarantino can do it, the movie takes a dark subject matter and turns it so ridiculous that the audience can't help but have fun with it. Everyone in the theater found a measure of satisfaction each and every time a slaver died, regardless of the colors involved. The movie also adds a sort of vindication for those of you who saw Basterds and would have rooted for Colonel Hans Landa if not for your disparate stances on the right of Jewish people to remain living. Pretty much the same character seems to travel back in time to strangely play a more (his name is Dr. King) or less (he's a white German) proto civil rights advocate whom you can really get behind and cheer along.There are a couple enjoyable moments that sort of jarringly take you out of the main thread of the story with their surprising cameos and/or humorous observations on otherwise revolting situations. I'm not necessarily a fan of Jamie Foxx or Christoph Waltz, as I find the former unmemorable and the latter both lacking in range and somewhat creepy in the one role that he has settled into. But in this movie, Foxx does a good job of taking his dynamic role and morphing the character throughout the course of his story arc, and Waltz is more fun when he's ""on your side"" (which, ironically, is the side that kills people like you if you're white). I will say, however, that the acting highlight of the movie for me is Leonardo DiCaprio going largely against his type of controlled and almost closed characters in other movies to boisterous and cartoonishly evil in this one.In Short:I had originally started writing this post by going on a long rant about Quentin Tarantino when I realized I hadn't really said anything about the movie itself. And maybe that's the point. Most of you already have a pretty good idea whether or not you enjoy Tarantino movies. I ended up giving this one an 8 out of 10, and I recommend it as a good watch.Exceptions to the recommendation: if you're someone who knows for sure that you just don't appreciate QT's work (which probably means that you just don't appreciate film and the history thereof (and may God have mercy on your soul)); if you're one of those aforementioned people who sometimes struggles with harsh realities; if you're someone who sometimes struggles with revenge fantasies; if you hate seeing Quentin Tarantino try (active word) to act; if you're a white person who sometimes forgets to apply your filter and uncontrollably repeats things that you think are funny; or, by extension, if you're an impressionable young child... hold off for a bit, and I'll explain when you're older.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The truth is that it drags and the violence gets generic.,"My favorite quality of a Tarantino movie is that somehow he gets me to care about the characters while the narrative is filled with irony treading upon satire, but never crossing the line.Another reason why I think he's so great is that he has a way with violence. A lot of people were shocked and appalled by ""Pulp Fiction"" because we really felt those kills. It meant something when they happened.Same with Bridget Fonda's kill in ""Jackie Brown"". Absolutely stunning moment.My problem with ""Django Unchained"" is that the violence becomes generic. I can't believe I just wrote that. I couldn't believe I thought that about three-quarters of the way in.The joy of this movie is in that first hour with Christoph Waltz using his quick wits to get out of two huge jams. His charms are so effective that we let it go that it would be totally implausible for him and Django to have gotten out of those two pickles alive.And then the movie appears to be building us up to some kind of payoff that just isn't satisfying. It just sort of goes the way of most spaghetti westerns, with tons of people getting shot up real good, instead of being turned on its head in usual QT fashion.Perhaps one of the reasons for the generic, cartoonish violence towards the end is that we're not fully invested in Django as a character. Schultz is the character we gravitate towards and the only face we're watching up there no matter what shot he's in. Django never breaks free from being just a mythical creature of sorts.I thought Kerry Washington was wasted.I'm sorry, but this movie just doesn't have the gathering power from scene to scene the way ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Jackie Brown"" or the two Kill Bills did.This is OK QT, not great QT.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Django Unchained 2012 Review,"""I like the way you die, boy""Definitely in my top 3 Tarantino films, dare I say a solid second place? It's hard when you have this, Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction all next to each other.
Django Unchained gives you some crazy, gore filled, off the wall, explosive action. The way blood is used in this film seems so off the top yet realistic it's just beautiful. Performances are also a strong suit, I mean damn, I can't think of a single bad performance. Everybody gives it their all and Leo definitely deserved an Oscar for this. Sam Jackson's performance is also one of my favorites, he seems like he's having so much fun in his role and his character is extremely memorable.
And as with almost all Tarantino films, cinematography is on point and there are a handful of shots in this that are just, breathtaking.
You definitely can't go wrong with this film, it's action-packed, filled with some amazing acting, has beautiful cinematography, a captivating story, and a great score all wrapped into one beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Amazing formally, and with a moral complexity that will work on you from within","Django Unchained (2012)(A second take at the bottom after seeing it again six months later.)What a wild, imaginative, provocative, beautiful, disturbing, excessive, nuanced movie.Is it a masterpiece? Maybe. Or yes, absolutely, as long as you can stomach some of the bloody mayhem. In terms of the core qualities of any ""great"" movie there is no argument here. The story is well told, filled with turns, believable in a fictional way, and entertaining. The acting is superb (or at times incredible). The photography and lighting and editing--the visual basics--are all excellent. The sound and soundtrack (including odd and wonderfully varied anachronistic popular songs) take you by surprise with their validity.The movie is overtly original in that Quentin Tarantino way that is firmly rooted in classic movie-making. It refers to older styles openly, including the ridiculously bold red lettering of the opening credits which are a little like the orange-red lettering of the first widescreen color movies in the mid 1950s. The music at times invokes spaghetti westerns, and the broad landscapes echo that (and in fact the cowboy theme takes us very close to these 1960s movies which Tarantino so loves).So, yes, this is a great movie in all these ways.Can you address the content more directly here? Is this movie about morality, about slavery and justice, about love and walking through fires to achieve it? Yes, of course it is all these things. But, many ask, does it tell the right story about these things? The first answer is, who cares? The director can say what he likes, right? Well, maybe maybe not. He can, of course, but he has to face the music of his critics because in fact movies are not just about cameras and storytelling conventions. They take on meaning, they move people to think, they cause palpable reactions.And so I'll come to the defense of the movie in the simplest ways. First of all, the ambiguity of the main character, the white bounty hunter played by Christoph Walz, is balanced and provocative and without real judgement. He's a cold blooded killer on the path of righteous judgement, a kind of John Brown revolutionary with a hankering for wealth, which he never gets to spend. Likewise the other lead, the black slave played by Jamie Foxx, is both victim and filled with bloody vengeance. It isn't automatically easy to justify everything, but it makes sense on some level, too.I realized when it was all done that the movie pulls off something I hadn't quite seen before--the real horrors of slavery. I think Tarantino ""gets away"" with it because his style is so exaggerated and unreal. The hyper-fable approach makes it possible to be comic and horrifying. If a movie just went ahead with a straight on with torture and brutality to show how bad slavery was, almost like a documentary, it would be unbearable, almost unforgivable. But here we see the worst kind of injustices as part of an approach that at other times forces you out of total verisimilitude, and you cringe and hate it but you go with the flow.Don't mistake things. This is one bloody cruel movie. To make people blow up with more guts and blood than usual so that it's like a comic book death does not make it less bloody. Blood will soak some scenes like graffiti art. And sound effects are used with amazing clarity to emphasize aspects like people's guts flying through the air--or, in a totally opposite way, to hear the searing sound of the ash on a cigarette as someone takes a puff. It's that kind of up and down, deeply thoughtful movie.See it? Of course, if you can stand a little over-the-top violence. It's morally sound, it's exciting and funny and fun and moving. It's beautiful. It's comparable in many ways, formally and in terms of content, to ""Inglourious Basterds."" If you liked that, you'll like this. I thought it amazing through and through. Masterpiece? Why not?Second take: I had a slightly less overwhelming impression this time. It's still a masterpiece of filmmaking, for sure, but some of Tarantino's decisions--what kind of bloody excess, how much to say derogatory words, how to push and pull the plot--seemed slightly contrived. As if his style was forced on the movie, rather than used to further something within the movie. I also watched Inglourious Basterds again recently, and found I still am perfectly amazed by that movie. For now, it's the better of the two (and they have a lot in common structurally, and thematically). Anyway, the rest of what I felt goes. Especially the necessary revulsion. Necessary. A terrific movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""I like the way you do movies boy!""","Tarantino does not disappoint. His classic bloodbaths, intriguing dialog and black humor finally had a tribute that is ""Django Unchained."" Many people did not like the movie or for being too silly, or too long, or excessive violence. Will a Tarantino fan crazy as me, to realize the enormity of the great masterpiece that ""Django"" can be?Not only is one of the best of Tarantino movies, but it is the tribute that the writer-director make to his films, giving a demonstration of who he is and its material.Django is arguably the greatest production of Tarantino, but I know that size does not make the content, but greater in everything. Here we see the combination of the various elements of Tarantino's films, the title character and history elements, are there all together, just pay attention.At the beginning we see Django (Jamie Fox) as a poor, simple and sufferer slave, who meets the great Dr. King Schultz (Crhistoph Waltz), and with him the chance of vengeance of his old owners, and later regaining his love Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), these first 45 minutes of the film we see how Django grow both spiritually and mentally and becomes a killing machine that becomes later. Also in these first few minutes of the film we see elements of ""Kill Bill,"" for example, the Bride of Uma Thurman, a sufferer with visions of the past in search of redemption and revenge against those who took her all what he loved. Django is her male version, and as The Bride is an expert on samurai swords, Django is in revolvers.In the next two hours we see the plan that Django and Schultz plan, a foolproof plan to recover the wife of Django from the cruel Calvin Candlie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a plan that seems to be impossible to know when Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson). In these two hours we see elements of ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". From ""Inglourious"" is the plan that seems foolproof that will lead to an enhuge end with small twists and obstacles ahead, along with an intriguing dialog scenes, as the dinner scene where the 5 characters are connected in one intriguing line of dialog that lead's to the unexpected end, such as scene that resembles the scene of the German Pub. From ""Pulp"" is the friendly and contradictory partnership between Django and Schultz, that closely resembles the duo Vincent and Jules. Two people who are very friendly and respect one another but a small rivalry between the two in what has regarding their attitudes or as Schultz says ""getting dirty"". The end of the second act, delivering the third and final act where the unexpected happens, like any Tarantino movie, a tremendous scale of grandeur.Django might not show a Western as we think it would, mainly because the film is set in the American South, being then a Southern, but ""Inglourious Basterds"" did not show much of the war and not the situation of the Jews (only the beginning) and focuses attention on killing Nazis. Tarantino uses the environment to explore the southern's slavery that existed in America during the time, but at the same time maintaining the elements of a Western, not getting shot during a firefight; a small town with a old sheriff with a dirty past; a lone ranger looking for redemption.At the same subject, the characters, all well-established, and in them we can see several elements of other Tarantino films. Django seems a mixture of Jackie Brown, The Bride and Vincent See, all alike in gestures and attitudes but also their situation in the whole plot. A character a bit shy but very smart and they can even be BADASS, and their situations in the story that almost seems to be a secondary character; Schultz looks a bit like Winnfiel Jules (Pulp Fiction) and Max Cherry (Jackie Brown), a character cultured with a very particular vision of the world and with his own philosophy of what is good; Stephen is the mixture of Marcellus Wallace (Pulp Fiction) and Ordell Robbie (Jackie Brown), a ""n#"" who thinks superior to all others and can be really cruel. The only character who seems to be the same original was Calvin Candie, a cynical and cruel slave owner.Many complain that Django can hardly stands out in the film being the main one, but how many times in Tarantino's previous films the main character was half out when the secondary characters spoke. But here the very minor characters seem to stand out when they talk among themselves. When is a scene of Schultz, Calvin begins to talk stealing his scene; when is a scene of Calvin, Stephen starts talking and steals his scene; when is a scene is Stephen, Schultz starts talking and steals his scene. And so it goes on in this dialog triangle of secondary characters, and all of them in the Badass voice of Django appears as a roller-coaster doing everything shake. This just proves that Tarantino can still do screenplays with mastery and persuasion.The performances of the entire cast can also be fantastic, on the style of Tarantino, Jamie Fox can install itself in the world of Tarantino with a performance that is the beginning of a simpleton slave until its evolution into a BADASS lone-ranger; Chistoph Waltz superb as always and once again manages to be the favorite character of the movie for those who attend; Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances; Samuel L. Jackson proving to be one of the best supporting actors in the business. All amazing as the movie itself.""Django Unchained"" manages to be one of the funniest films of Tarantino, but also one of the most intriguing ones, with a really well written screenplay. A great product delivery that Tarantino has always given us and as always challenging and causing controversy in society, proving that it still has much to give.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Raw, violent, wicked and wild revenge wild west style, yet a shoot em' up black Tony style.","Most of Quentin Tarantino's works are well done and they push the limit often paying homage to B list cinema and underground works with the director often putting a stamp of violence and outrageous scenes in most of his works and ""Django Unchained"" is no different! The film is blended with raw humor and wicked scenes of blood and violence which were set in the slave days of the deep south. Here Tarantino takes the slave theme to the max ending in all out war and revenge. Yet the story is entertaining and clever you have a well to do dentist Dr. King Schultz(the terrific veteran Christoph Waltz)who goes rogue and becomes a bounty hunter and he acts underneath as a slave freedom crusader. As Dr. Schultz purchases a young but rough and rugged slave named Django(Jamie Foxx)who in return for freedom will work with the doctor to hunt down wanted rich and evil slave owners. Yet a prize awaits for Django in the end as the goal is to rescue his slaved wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington). And the journey is interesting with plenty of blood, guts, and violence thru the south and rural dirty roads that lead to the big house of the arrogant and rich big time Mississippi plantation owner mister Calvin Candie(in a to the max and well acted role by Leonardo DiCaprio).

"Strong, powerful movie.","This movie is a spoof on the so-called spaghetti western genre, but with the violence ratchet up to a level probably unimagined in years past when the the spaghetti westerns gained popularity. The entire story is permeated by violence, which is shown in all its graphic goriness. There is no act of violence too gory for this movie. People are shot, clubbed, knifed, blown up, whipped, cudgeled, mauled, beaten and stomped as well as humiliated, put down, made fun of, laughed at, bullied, and yelled at. The theme of this movie is that interpersonal conflict can be resolved only through violence, and not just nineteen-thirties type violence, i.e., a drive by shooting or a quick ambush, but by violence that is sadistic, that is, gives pleasure to the character perpetrating the mess. But along with the violence is the use of the ""N"" word which is uttered probably hundreds of times in the movie, and by all the principal characters, black and white. In a way, it seems that the ""N"" word has finally arrived. Now, is all this violence gratuitous? The answer to that question is NO! No way. Although the violence is Hollywoodish and played up to the extreme for dramatic effect, it still belongs in the movie because the story is set in a time and a place when physical violence as a way of regulating people was a norm and when people were openly exploited and physically abused. The idea of a white slaver raising a bunch of mandingoes may seem ludicrous, but such activities occurred. Black people were slaves; white people were masters, and the ""N"" word was part of the normal lexicon of the time. The acting in this movie is outstanding. Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz deserve special recognition, and the rest of cast is excellent too, especially Leonardo De Caprio who plays a villain to great dramatic effect.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"It's humorous, but the film never has a coherent thread","It's interesting that a film entitled Django Unchained, about a freed slave that becomes independent, has the major black character--played by Jamie Foxx--behaving fairly clueless throughout the film. Sure, you have to become socialized as a free man if you were a slave. While that may be accurate, it doesn't make for a compelling plot. In fact, I thought Jamie Foxx has this deadpan/confused demeanor through most of the film. The main character ends up being Dr. Schultz. In fact, Samuel Jackson's character is much better defined and more interesting than Foxx's. The film grows more and more gonzo as the story progresses, and approaches the level of slapstick. That's not necessarily bad, but it simply adds to the mixing of genres, which is also fine if it works, but it seemed to gimmickly to me. The salute to Italian westerns is fun, but Italians didn't have to contend with slavery as a serious issue--one that tore and still seems to tear apart the U. S. So, while the film is an interesting diversion, that's all it basically is.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Something is wrong with Django Unchained and Tarantino too,"Yes it was decent, humorous at times but it left a very bad taste in the mouth. This is by far the bloodiest movie Tarantino made, and exploding bodies, with guts, flesh and brains flying around almost makes one sick. For me, Tarantino is getting worse as he ages, his insanity starts to take over his talent. This movie did not need to be so brutal, cruel and frankly insulting.Almost 3 hrs was way too long for this type of movie. While the story was sort of about good guys and revenge and all that jazz, it all seemed to be just a mere backstage for sadistic fascination with blood, guts, violence and repeating ""nigger"" every friggin' second. Some say it was ""humane"", I did not see anything resembling humanity.

Some strong Tarantino writing on display.,"The more things change, the more things stay the same. While I do appreciate that Quentin Tarantino is exploring more historical pieces that actually give a bit of justification for his ""ultra-violence"", the ""over-the'top"" of his style still applies. However, the only counteraction that makes this a somewhat enjoyable film is the dialogue, which has been Tarantino's strong point for a long while and is most likely why Christoph Waltz is looking at obtaining his second Oscar this February.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

TARANTINO'S WILD WILD WEST,"Another great Tarantino film & another big hit, here Tarantino takes us back to the old south just before the Civil war & drops us off in the horrible racist Slavery times & takes us on a violent & bloody quest of vengeance!!!
Tarantino DEFINITELY watched Will Smith's WILD WILD WEST whilst preparing this move!!!!
Tarantino is an outstanding film maker as we know & here he delivers all the quality & great dialogue we've come to expect & his casting is again Amazing with an excellent Jamie Foxx as the ""Django"" the freed slave in search of his beautiful wife played by Kerry Washington, & ""Django"" is helped by a German bounty hunter named King Schultz, an outstanding performance by Christoph Waltz, the two become partners as bounty hunters & Django becomes an incredible marksman who can really handle his guns. The two Bounty hunters go from town to town & plantation to plantation in search of Criminals & Django's wife, this leads them to the evil plantation owner Calvin Candie, an excellent performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as such a nasty & evil villain of this piece. There's also Tarantino regular Samuel L Jackson as an evil black butler type who is just as racist as the Southern whites!!! There's lots of other great actors in small roles & there's lots of very funny moments & black humour throughout but there's also still the dark & raw look into the evil times of slavery & it gets extremely violent & bloody. I loved this mix of fact & fiction turned into a revenge fantasy just like Tarantino did with his ""Inglourious Basterds"" & his ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"" that's why he's such a great story teller & film maker. I did notice alot of similarities to the excellent but underrated Will Smith western ""Wild Wild West"" from 1999, now i know the part of ""Django"" was written with Will Smith in mind but he turned it down, so there's lots of bits & bobs & scenes & it's look that Tarantino obviously borrowed from Smith's Wild Wild West!!!
Smith would've been excellent as Django as he's a great actor but hey we got the excellent Jamie Foxx & he nailed the part as extremely tough & raw freed slave.
When the killing gets going it's so exciting & gripping as these evil Slave traders so deserve to die brutally & Django delivers, my favourite line in the movie is ""I like the way you Die boy"" from Django before he blasts an evil redneck in the chest, it's beautiful.The movie looks fantastic & never was it boring because it's so interesting watching these richly detailed characters & this dark & dangerous world they are in & i loved the idea of these two Bounty hunters on a quest of vengeance!!! Another great Tarantino movie & another instant Classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Mixed Emotions,"It's not a bad film. The choice of music is terrible though. I don't usually write reviews. However, I felt the need to complain about the soundtrack. It just doesn't fit. It's out of touch with the story and it's background. It also has little in relationship with the overall feel of the picture. With only a few lyrics that relate to the story- line. I feel sick as a movie and music lover. Alfred Hitchcock will be rolling in his grave. Whoever thought it feasible to put this type of music in a western should of got four lashes with the whip. You need dramatic, moody and captivating scores. Tarantino... you should of better known better. On the other hand the acting was superb. It moved and captivated me and I often felt I wanted to reach into the screen and kill the slave-masters myself. Only to be thrown back to reality by the bad choice of songs. Err... pop songs? These songs will be outdated in a small number of years. Rendering the film mediocre and maybe forgotten by many. Where as it could of been a timeless gem. Absolutely abysmal. Some people may read this and agree with me. Where as others would say ""I bet he couldn't do better"". But I'm damn sure I could with ease. If I reviewed this movie as just a picture alone It would be at least an eight. If reviewed only on the music, then maybe a two star only.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Worst Tarantino film,"I should start off by saying that I love Tarantino. I should also mention that I went into this movie wanting to love it. But even with my pro-Tarantino bias, I only found a handful of scenes and characters the least bit interesting.The main problem with it is the cheap humor and reliance on vengeance to have the viewer connect with the story. It's some new (unfortunate) genre of slapstick-ultra-violence. The laughs are awkwardly placed into a mostly serious and action-packed narrative (and I use the description ""laughs"" loosely). Combining laughable moments in a serious scene, even a bloody scene, is one of Tarantino's strengths ( think ""Oh man, I just shot Marvin in the face."" -Pulp Fiction), but the attempts at humor in Django are childish and silly (a clansman going home because no one values his wife's KKK masks, wt-f?). They border on Wayans Brothers' type humor (not a compliment).My second point: The reliance on vengeance to keep the audience interested is, unfortunately, the foundation of this film. It's almost as if a group of frat boys got together and brainstormed on how to stick it to racism. ""How about the racist dudes get shot in the balls?!"" ""Yeah! F*#k racism!"" And, again, this is territory that Tarantino has covered brilliantly before (anti-Nazi sentiment throughout Inglorious Basterds) so he should be able to pull it off. But unlike Eli Roth smashing in the skull of an SS officer with a bat, Django's bloody scenes are pointless Van Damme-style shootouts that appeal to only the most base emotions.Maybe the difference in the successful examples from previous movies and those of Django are the two-dimensional nature of the main characters in this movie. Django, doesn't change very much from the beginning of the film to the end. And I don't just mean emotionally...for some reason, he's already a pretty good shot when he first picks up a gun? Django's character is more about the surface-level bad@*# imagery than, say, Vincet Vega, who is a bad@*#, but who is capable of emotions and character development within his role as a bad@*#. Django is just a cardboard cutout of a character with black sunglasses and a six-shooter.I guess I should mention the good parts of the movie too: Samuel L. Jackson's performance is great. His character has some of those attempts at cheap laughs, but the quality of his acting and the believability of the character make you forget about the cheesy moments. I also thought the scene where Dr. Schultz lets Django choose his own outfit was honest and believable, not to mention one of the more clever moments.I know I'm in the minority, but I was greatly disappointed and would not recommend seeing it in theaters.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
IMDb numbers stand quite justified.,"Tone, Script & Story: A Bounty Hunter from Germany finds his new companion in a black guy named Django. They together set out over a journey to set free Django's wife. There is a lot of bloodshed lot of people killed but with the end pictured you walk out feeling positive.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It's a movie directed by Quentin Tarantino. What's the trade mark? It would be violent with lots of blood involved. What's the positive we can take; well it shows us how certain things would take place for example in real world, like a shootout.For me Oscars are overrated. Despite that it won't hurt to have one and Quentin here has two (one of them for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for this movie Django Unchained). This is one of the movies with a vote bank of more than a million on IMDb, so that really means something.Music: Dint quite understood it like in most of the foreign movies but seemed as if it went well. Acting: Went well with direction.Final Verdict: IMDb numbers generally don't lie for major part of Audience. For me with respect to Django Unchained they stand quite justified.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino always delivers,"This is a typical Tarantino flick: it's got great characters, intriguing dialogue and over-the-top violence like only Tarantino puts to the screen. And I'm here for it. The movie grabs you with the soundtrack (which was amazing, as expected), and keeps your attention by switching clever personal moments between characters with raw, bloody violence. The acting is outstanding, especially Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio give some of their best performances in their careers. Even Jamie Foxx, of who I am not usually a fan, gives a decent performance as the title character. Definitely one of, if not my favorite movie of all time, and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the opportunity to watch it yet!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Near Perfect Film,"This movie was as near perfect as a film can be. I particularly enjoyed how it seemed to be in parts. Part 1 when Django and Shultz meet and so on. Like little vignettes. Tarantino has a style about him that when you are watching one of his movies, you know its his. His unapologetic style of film making borders on guerrilla warfare. Using non PC language, showing graphic violence and so forth. Truly makes this film more of an experience than a viewing.

Don't Pay Attention to the Negative Reviews...,"No, this isn't Tarantino's ""best"", but even his worst film is still better than the majority of crap that gets released into theaters. Tarantino is a director for people who love ""movies"", not ""film"", and he makes movies for people who love movies, too. I happen to be a fan of both movies and film, so I am able to appreciate movies that have been made just to entertain an audience rather than just those that contain a message that the viewer should learn. ""Django Unchained"", by the above description, is an incredibly well-made movie.The acting is top notch and the writing contains all of Tarantino's trademarks that we have loved since ""Reservoir Dogs"" introduced audiences to this unique talent back in 1992. Yes, the violence has been magnified to ludicrous and even comedic heights, but that only serves to remove the viewer from the more horrific atrocities depicted on screen. I happen to feel that this movie ranks in the lower half of QT's filmography, but that in no way means that I think it is a bad film. No, I still love it. It's also a little long, having been the first film he made since the passing of his longtime editor, and it could be shortened to quicken the pacing a little bit. But I'll be damned if I can think of any scenes in it that could or should have been cut from its heavy 165-minute runtime.Having read a great deal of the other reviews of this movie on IMDb, I felt compelled to add my own, because there is a common thread that unites all of the one-star reviews. Once you see it and identify it, you definitely don't want to be associated with people like that.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

The dialogues, the musics, the scenes it all just comes together perfectly. And of course with great actors and a great director who loves cinema passionately comes this beautiful movie.

"Good, Not Great","I guess I am the outkast here, but I just couldn't give this one an 8. I will start with the great things which was the directing and overall visuals. The blood spraying all over the white cotton was such an amazing shot, as well as the horses coming the down hill, and Django's first shot killing the guy off horse. In addition the slavery content was incredibly intense. However I thought the quirky jokes and humor was incredibly cheesy, and misplaced. The movie seemed to have an identity crisis. Others will say it had a bit of everything but to me it was all over the place. In addition I thought the score was horrible, a Rick Ross song? Like come on. Lastly, while the acting was good, I did not find any of them to be believable southerners especially Leo. While Leo's scene with the skull at the dinner table was great, I wasn't blown away overall. Overall, it was really the cheesiness of the jokes, score and some of the shots that turned me away from this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

It's Like a Day at the Slaughterhouse,"I'm pretty broad in my tastes in movies. I've seen most of Tarantino. When I start watching, I know that peoples arteries will be pumped up to 250 pounds per inch. I haven't seen so many geysers since I was last at Yellowstone. I was taken in by the story. The establishment that there is evil out there and yes, there was racism in the old West. And I did enjoy the avenging angel. But when the gore started and it sounded like the lake washing up on the shore at midnight, I slipped away. I really didn't care what happened to these guys. This is just another one of those blood baths that have no end. Two hours and thirty minutes of it. They mistreated your wife. Let's kill everybody. Of course, they are all simplistically portrayed as consummate evil. Only Django and his guy are acceptable. And anyone else who is black, unless, of course, he's in it with the white guys.There are some things to recommend this. The cinematography rivals the National Geographic as they make their way through some of the most beautiful places on earth. The white house at the end of a path that looks strangely sexual is a good touch. The argument among the Klan members about the holes in their masks it hilarious. I know he is trying to pull our chain at every step and it is fun to see the bad guys get theirs. It's so excessive.I think what frightens me is what kind of culture have we become where this kind of movie brings people in in droves.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good start, ridiculous ending","How unrealistic can a move be?? Some reviewers actually gave this movie a 10! Based on what? It started out OK and had some situations that happen, maybe. But for the last ten minutes I didn't know if I was watching a western movie gone bad or the writer was just making a big joke of the whole thing. When Django jumps on a horse bareback, with no bridle and rides off with the horse under total control over the horse, that about did it for me. How phony can you get! It went downhill fast from there turning a sort of interesting movie into a cartoon. I shoot in competition and I wish I could shoot 1/10th as good as Django. My goodness. The first time he shoots a gun(a rifle), it's a 200 yard shot at a guy on a running horse, .....and he hit him! And he shoots from the hip (not really taking aim) and never misses! How anybody could give this movie high marks is a real wonder. And at the end, when he ride his horse like he was trained for the circus, I just cracked up.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Tarantino's talky, violent, and brilliant exploitation style western!","As with most Tarantino films, ""Django Unchained"" is not for all tastes. Tarantino is a filmmaker who makes films he'd like to see and his films are attuned to his own idiosyncratic tastes, which range from arthouse, to world cinema, to exploitation (both foreign and domestic), to even mainstream Hollywood. With ""Django Unchained"" Tarantino takes a wide set of influences and mashes them into one of the best revenge films of all-time (Kill Bill 1 and 2 were pretty great revenge flicks as well). The story is fairly straightforward. Jamie Foxx plays a freed slave who with the help of bounty hunter Christoph Waltz looks to free his wife, Broomhilda Von Shaft (a possible ancestor to John Shaft?), from Leonardo DiCaprio's villainous slave trading Calvin Candie (possibly Tarantino's most despicable villain since Gary Oldman's Drexell Spivey). The story is deceptively simple, but Tarantino's script is anything but. Drawing from samurai flicks, spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation flicks of the 70s, Hong Kong action films of the 80s (and that doesn't even scratch the surface), ""Danjgo Unchained"" can rightfully be called the ultimate revenge film, which builds to a bonkers climax that is as bloody as it is cathartic. Think John Woo's ""A Better Tomorrow II"" but even crazier, and that's saying something if you've ever seen's Woo's film. From the title and soundtrack, you'd think this would be Tarantino's take on spaghetti westerns, but it's better described as an ultraviolent souther gothic along the lines of ""The Beguiled"" more than it is like ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" Think ""Truck Turner"" as a weird west version of the southern gothic. Samuel L. Jackson in an interview described it as ""Shaft on a horse."" And the film is just absolutely brutal at times. That ""Mandingo Fighting"" has to be one of the bloodiest fist fight scenes ever committed to film (reportedly there was an even more violent of version, but Tarantino rightly cut it, out of fears it would negatively impact the tone of the film). With his usual flair for eclectic casting, the film features a terrific cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson (""Pulp Fiction""), Walton Goggins (""The Hateful Eight""), Dennis Christopher (""Face to Black""), James Remar (""The Warriors""), Kerry Washington (""Little Fires Everywhere""), Don Johnson (""Miami Vice""), Franco Nero (the original Django), Tom Wopat (""Dukes of Hazzard), Don Stroud (""Coogan's Bluff""), Russ Tamblyn (""High School Confidential""), Bruce Dern (""The Driver""), M.C. Gainey (80s character actor), Jonah Hill (""Superbad""), Lee Horsley (""Matt Huston""), Robert Carradine (""The Big Red One""), Tom Savini (""Dawn of the Dead""), John Jarratt (""Wolf Creek""), and Zoe Bell (""Grindhouse""), there's really no excuse for Tarantino fans to miss this excellent western revenge flick! FUN FACT! During the filming of one of the dinner scenes, Leonardo DiCaprio had to stop the scene because he was having ""a difficult time"" using so many racial slurs. Samuel L. Jackson then pulled him aside telling him, ""Motherf----r, this is just another Tuesday for us.""PS: Stay tuned for a Django/Zorro sequel!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino's Love Letter to Westerns with a Message,"This is a movie that I missed in the theater but saw while I was working at Family Video. This would have been a pre-street that I took home early. I hadn't seen it since then. This movie was on the Internet Movie Database poster that Jaime and I were working through, so we were both giving it a rewatch.I'm so glad that I came back to this. Knowing more about Westerns made me enjoy this movie more. I'm not versed in them as much as some of the people that I listen to through podcasts, but they're relayed some information that is quite interesting. One of them being that Django was a character that had a bunch of movies. There wasn't always a lot of continuity between each one, but it was a recognizable character. I like that this movie even had the first man to take on the role in a cameo, Franco Nero.For the movie itself, I love what Quentin Tarantino did here. We are getting a bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), who seeks out the aid of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx). Dr. Schultz doesn't agree with slavery, but there isn't a lot he can do. He does free Django and the two become partners. We see their relationship grow. This is coupled with people in the south who see them as property. I do think we've come a long way, but there are people who still don't respect them. It is heartbreaking. It also satisfying as they decide to take out bad people.The acting here is great. Seeing Waltz go against Leonardo DiCaprio is tense. They both are amazing. Foxx is also good along with Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson. There are a bunch of cameos here that are also good. Going along with that, we have cinematography. It feels like the era that it is set. The blood and violence are a bit over the top, but this is also part exploitation film which makes sense. This movie is even better than I remember it.My Rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing.,"So, this is actually my second time watching this one. First time was around 7 years ago or so and I feel like I have matured and gained a better knowledge and understanding of film (I did gain a film degree in this time). So I am rewatching high rated films. And I can safely say this one is amazing!!!The acting is just perfect, Christoph Waltz in particular is just outstanding in every way. In terms of acting performances this film is one of the best I've seen, because everyone is so good.The story is also great. It's interesting and really keeps you sitting there wanting more. I think what is so good about the story is that there isn't any dull moments, every scene has a purpose. A lot of long films feel like they are long for the sake of it and include scenes that are pointless. I didn't get that for Django at all.Obviously this film is also very dialogue heavy (you'd expect that with a Tarantino movie), but it flowed really well and had great action scenes throughout, as mentioned above also it wasn't as dull. A problem I had with Hateful Eight for example was that it focused too much on the dialogue and it did (in my opinion) become bland in places.I'll end it there because I don't want to bang on. But please watch this if you haven't already. I will say, just to end on, that the shock value is ramped right up with this one. Not only do you have a lot of gore (as per), but the use of the n word is almost excessive. Don't say I didn't warn you.But yeah, please watch it's great and you won't be disappointed. There's a reason it's so highly rated on here!!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Violence? check. Witty Dialogue? check. Kick-Ass soundtrack? check - everything a Tarantino fan would want from the movie.,"In 1992 Quentin Tarantino entered the movie spotlight with his Art House film Reservoir Dogs, which was a spectacle. Eighteen years on he brings us yet another spectacle, this time on a bigger budget, bigger scale and bigger story.With it's assembled cast of brilliance the film has already grabbed a few Golden Globes and is a treat for all of the Tarantino fans out there. With Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino once again showcases his directorial and writing skills covering an unusual genre for even himself; Slavery and Western. The films's beginning title sequence sets the film up straight up with style and the sequence is supreme and as good as that of Inglorious Basterds (which is amazing.) The cinematography, the camera angles and music score to the opening of the film is all near perfection.The soundtrack to the film is glorious and fits right in the usual Tarantino standards, with the larger than life music and moments giving it the Tarantino-esque feel. A noteworthy mention is also the cinematography of the film adding strength with the excessive use of long establishing shots of the landscapes giving off the feel that this is indeed Spaghetti Western.The script and dialogue to the film is expert and is set in stone to be very memorable. 'I like the way you die boy' - for example. The film is very informative of the Slavery side too, in language, reactions and story. The cast of the film is spectacular with Jamie Foxx giving a strong performance throughout. Christopher Waltz is captivating in his role that is almost written directly for him and is as good as his other multilingual Tarantino role of Col. Hans Landa (in Inglorious Basterds.)Not appearing until late in the film, villainous Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Calvin Candi, the bad guy plantation owner and he is a stun, and engaged in the role and good to see him a another memorable role which we haven't seen from him for a since probably Inception. The absolute highlight of the performances is easily that of Samuel L. Jackson's, in which plays a delusional bad-ass old house keeper and with the accent, dialogue and bad motherfucking attitude he steals all of the motherfucking scenes he is present in.At one point of the film unfortunately, around the time of the that Tarantino makes his cameo appearance (with an awful Australian accent) you suddenly realize that the film is dragging and look at your watch to release that this is a three-hour film! only four minutes behind The Hobbit. (Which dragged like hell!).Violence? check. Witty Dialogue? check. Kick-Ass soundtrack? check - everything a Tarantino fan would want from the movie.

Even though the majority are modern songs, none of them felt out of place.The lighting is perfect.The violence is as satisfying as it is gruesome.The ending was a satisfying payoff.Everything looks accurate to the time period.The scenes that are meant to be disturbing are very effective.The practical effects are great.The scenes that are meant to be tense put you at the edge of your seat.The dark humor is hilarious.With this movie you can tell that Tarantino has a great love for spaghetti westerns and that certainly adds to the experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Good movie but nothing special.,"I usually like Tarantino movies beside the last two. Why I didn't like Django? If this movie was from another director than Tarrantino people would have said that it sucks, if people are so impressed when you have a Rap song in a slow motion cowboy scene, if people are so impressed to see scenes with a lot of blood per minute and flesh flying around all the time than you are a Tarantino Fan probably.The story is interesting, the movie is way too gore at first I liked the movie then after all those disgusting scenes I thought, OK i'm definitely not re watching this movie again, and after 1.30h of the movie I was ""damned this movie is getting boring, oh no wait another disgusting gore scene, and another rap song, well done Tarantino you now have the attention of the 17years old that are going to talk about how gore it was at school""But lets not be too negative I didn't rate this movie with a 0 because the photography was really amazing, the shots were really beautiful, the story is catchy, some of the actors are really good good overall costumes. This movie has many reference to other movies so if you are a movie fan you might recognise some moments from other movies. But the overall feeling of the movie isn't very good in my opinion, it could have been an amazing movie he had all the good cards in his hand to make this movie epic but it will definitely not be one for me.So and overall of 6, this movie is definitely not worth a 7 or a 8 I'm not going to add more points just because it's from Tarantino like most people are doing.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Pure Badassery,"I won't lie, knowing that this was a Quentin Tarantino film, I went in with very high expectations. Which, as anyone knows, is never a good idea. However, I am absolutely positive that I, or anyone else that has seen this film, can say that those expectations were very well met.Every actor and actress does a splendid job in their role, from Jamie Foxx to Leonardo DiCaprio. The action is very satisfying to watch play out, and I don't feel that way about many films that I watch.Literally, the only issue I have with the movie is the occasional modern rap or pop song that crops up once or twice. This film appropriately uses a lot of western, cowboy music and does so well. So, you can understand my disappointment when during a climatic action scene of the film I hear, ""GET IT ON TILL I DIE,"" screamed in the background. Again, though, this is my only issue and as you can see from my rating, I do not think it really detracts from the film too much.To anyone who reads this very late review and hasn't seen the film, watch Django Unchained.

Hats off for Monsieur Tarantino!,"Django, Django, Django, I think we've got a new badass in town. Yet another Tarantino classic, yet more classic and ground breaking characters. This piece by Tarantino is one of his finest works ever, ""Django: Unchained"" is set to become an all time classic.There are so many things about this movie that are great. For starters, as in any Tarantino movie, the attention to detail of the characters is spot on. Every character you meet has a name, a certain or several traits (the way they talk or dress or act) and is from the bottom to the top extremely well thought out. He has said so himself that it is by his characters that he will be remembered, and for sure there are some memorable ones here. Django, the main character played by the all cool Jamie Foxx, a former slave turned bounty hunter travels with the mysterious dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz, played outstandingly my Christoph Waltz, winning him his second Oscar, in his second tarantino movie! Together they embark on an unforgertable journey trying to rescue Django's lost wife, Broomhilda.The movie stands at 159 minutes long, and that's a long time for a story not that long. The reason is that every single scene is so adequately put together. Though the sceens might seem long and dull, they are infact the opposite of that. Firtst and foremost, they slowly build up a tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat during the entire scene, to finally explode into something extraordinary. And that is what makes Tarantino's scenes so special. You sit there waiting for something to happen, and sometimes nothing will, other times all hell breaks loose. That is the brilliance of Tarantino movies, their unpredictability to rupture at any moment. Lets not forget to mention the, as usual, unprecedented and marvelous dialogues, it is the biggest reason why his movies work, and does not become a dull and boring fairy tale.What this movie particularly shines in is all of those things, but especially in story telling. The story is un-heard of and definitely a one of a kind. The lovely friendship between Dr. Schultz and Django, but more than that, the astounding character developement of Django from insecure and scared to bad ass and serene, is a delight to watch.In the end, this movie goes out Tarantino-style; Double-up! It's an ending sure to bombard and rumble as well as satisfy and surprise the viewer. This is one for the history books. Hats off to you, Monsieur Tarantino!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Incredible.,"This movie is absolutely incredible. The acting, the dialogue, the tense scenes, everything about it is perfect. Seeing Christoph Waltz play the good guy is refreshing after watching Inglourious Basterds, as you can now sympathize with his character. Jamie Foxx as Django is amazing. Calvin Candie is so despicable, and is a truly terrifying villain. The dinner scene is so tense, I know I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Christoph Waltz as Dr King Schultz is amazing, and my personal favorite character, definitely in my top ten favorite Tarantino characters. Some scenes are brutal and hard to watch, but the scenes with Schultz and Django are great. In summary, I think this movie is beautifully made and is one of Tarantino's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino Magic!!!,"I have waited to long to see this but OMG what a great movie.... One of tarantino's finest works.
I love westerns anyway but with the tarantino spin on it and an ode to the spaghetti western this is pure magic.
The acting in this movie is superb especially from christoph waltz, he is brilliant and steals the show for me.
Its a great mixture of comedy and the brutal violence we have come to expect from a tarantino movie and it works brilliantly.
The cinematography is outstanding and the soundtrack is brilliant.
All in all this is a 2 hour and 45 min masterpiece.

From slave to bounty hunter,"With a film that's part a throwback to the black exploitation films of the Seventies and part a homage to the ballet violence of Sam Peckinpah, Quentin Tarantino has given us Django Unchained about a newly freed slave turned bounty hunter under the tutelage of Christoph Walz.When this film opens poor Jamie Fox as the title character is part of a group of slaves chained up and heading for the auction block. But it turns out to be his lucky day as traveling dentist Christoph Walz wants to make a private deal because Fox can identify three brothers who are wanted. Walz is a bounty hunter with abolitionist tendencies and he makes short work of the slavers and has a paper making Fox his legal whom he immediately frees.Fox agrees to become Walz's partner, but he's got some conditions of his own like finding and freeing his wife who was deliberately sold separately from him. They do a good season's work and then go on the mission for Kerry Washington, Fox's wife. She's on a Mississippi plantation owned by Leonardo DiCaprio.If DiCaprio's character were around today he'd be a charter member of the White Citizen's Council. He takes white supremacy as a simple matter of fact.DiCaprio got deserved raves for his performance. But the most intriguing role in the film for me was that of Samuel L. Jackson who plays the head of the household servants. Seeing Jackson in his part took me back to early Nineties when I saw a production of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard with the character of Piers who was a servant and who totally identified with his employers. And the aristocrats who employed him just think of him as part of the furniture. There's a lot of Piers in Jackson's character with a nasty racial component that smacks of Uncle Tom.Quentin Tarantino saw a lot of those films that starred people like Richard Roundtree, James Brown, and Fred Williamson back when I was a lot younger in creating Django. He also took careful note of how Sam Peckinpah staged his violent scenes in such things as The Getaway and The Wild Bunch.Still it's the players that make this one work, DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson most of all.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

It's irritating how they keep saying...,"A few of the characters in this film can clearly be seen calling the slave portrayed by Kerry Washington (Brunhilde) ""Broom Hilda"".That's just freaking annoying. Broom Hilda is from a American comic strip in modern days. NO ONE from back then would ever accidentally call Kerry Washington's character ""Broom Hilda"".Other than that HUGE irritation... I thought this film was well worth watching. I've never seen Jamie Foxx do such a great job (nor Don Johnson, for that matter).I was emotionally affected (meaning, I sobbed) by scenes depicting the cruelty dealt toward slaves in this era (and make no mistake, there are STILL people being treated like this throughout the world).Emotionally moving film.

Twisted violence from an overrated director with nothing new to say,"This is nominated for best picture? You got to be kidding me. Where are the sweeping themes, the original ideas, the unique contribution to cinema? This is just a remake of a spaghetti western/blaxploitation movie, with the same old funky soundtrack, the same old movie homages, plot tricks, blood splatter, etc. It was fresh and original in Pulp Fiction, but half a dozen movies later, it is becoming formula. But, wait, I forgot, this is a savage indictment of slavery. Hahahaha. This is movie nerd Tarantino stealing other directors' ideas and painting the world in ludicrously simplistic black-and-white, in Technicolor, so that the bad guys are so detestable you'll cheer graphic violence and mass murder. This time it was slavers, last time it was Nazis, what cliché bad guys will be next? Terrorists? Vampires? In a musical homage? How long can this juvenile director keep spinning the same old blood-spattered revenge theme in a genre remake? This is not cutting edge cinema, folks. Using the N-word does not make you a daring film genius. Now if Quentin spent his multi-million budgets on a movie about, say, a father whose daughter was gunned down in a mass shooting, and goes on a killing spree at the NRA headquarters or a Hollywood studio, I'd be just as disgusted but at least I'd call him original. Well, no, it would be just more twisted cliché, like all Tarantino movies these days.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

Good,"Quentin Tarantino returns his activities to fashion the epic Django Livre, he is able to resurrect a story in the midst of a very violent western and with a different look. after the scene, with the utmost violence in the jeitão Tarantino Foxx, he does one of his great works here, showing that one can still be quite sensational Tarantino and Christopher Waltz but one proves to be intelligent and incredible, being the best in the film. And finally, running around outside, Leonardo DiCaprio, joining a cast of great names.Film seen on the 20th to the 21st of November 2020.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
40% of a good movie,"Once again Tarantino shows us that he knows how to make about half of a good movie. He sets up an intriguing if wildly implausible premise, a nattily dressed ex-dentist has become an expert bounty hunter who makes his money killing the uneducated white trash of the pre-Civil War south. And the dentist doesn't embrace slavery and has a soft spot for slaves.Christoph Waltz plays this part with aplomb and fits perfectly into Tarantino's uniquely paced scenes and dialogue, handling what would otherwise be impossibly wordy expositions as if he always spoke that way.And so the movie begins and we're taken through a few scenes showing the dentist's perfect poise and implausible shooting accuracy. He frees a slave (Django) and forms a relationship with him and initially we aren't sure what direction the film will go.Unfortunately, with the stage set, this is about where it starts to come off of the rails. Tarantino's fetish for completely over the top violence was originally his signature but now is a stain on his films. He approaches the border of addressing ""adult"" topics and conflicts such as racism, slavery, cultural issues, or a great showdown between two prominent characters, and seems able to immerse himself in these issues to understand them well enough to portray them on the screen.But like a 14 year old who would rather play video games than do his homework, he quickly pulls the plug on any serious story telling and descends into mindless splatter- filled violence which, once started, can only increase through the rest of the film until it reaches a disgusting big red goopy climax. Slaves eaten by dogs, slaves killing each other with hammers, men wailing in pain after being shot or crushed, 20+ person shoot- outs with red paint coating every visible surface... it's hard to watch and doesn't tell a story or really do anything for the viewer, it's just self-indulgent nonsense.Tarantino clearly has talent in coming up with good story ideas, providing viewers with an immersive experience into other times and places, and attracting great actors and getting great performances out of them. It's too bad it's all wasted on his mental masturbations.I can't help but to wonder about the people calling this movie a ""masterpiece"" and wonder if they have ever actually seen a good movie or read a good book. If watching a movie just to see 100 people graphically killed and dismembered before your eyes is your idea of supreme entertainment then maybe you should think again.",,Anonymous,Drama

Nearly every aspect of the story is grossly unrealistic or inaccurate including geography, weaponry, dates, and special effects. However, the movie is entertaining if reality is totally suspended.

"Self-indulgent, but still a worthwhile Tarantino movie","DJANGO UNCHAINED, Tarantino's spin on the spaghetti western genre, should rightly be called a southern rather than a western. It's an epic-length story about slavery and redemption in the southern states, featuring an ensemble cast and the kind of ultra-stylistic, ultra-violent gunplay that Tarantino has made a trademark all of his own. It's also one of Tarantino's most self-indulgent movies, coming third to the worst excesses of DEATH PROOF and KILL BILL: VOLUME 2.Like INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS before it, the ace up Django's sleeve is Christoph Waltz, once again delivering a subtle, softly-spoken and multi-layered turn that's reminiscent of his best work as Colonel Hans Landa. Waltz walks away with the movie; every scene in which he doesn't appear is noticeably the poorer for it, and Tarantino gets the very best from his German star. That's good, because the rest of the movie thinks it's better than it really is; the opening and ending are both strong, but the middle is very saggy, lacking in action, incident or any form of suspense or intrigue.It does pick up here and there with a couple of blistering action sequences in which Tarantino seems to have ploughed the grisly excesses of PLANET TERROR for inspiration, but even one of these is spoilt by Tarantino's insistence on including some jarring rap music on the soundtrack (a silly effort to pander to the young black male audience, and shameful considering the rest of the excellent, eclectic score). Then there's the lengthy dinner table scene that tries to outdo the one in BASTERDS but doesn't come close.Even with these detractions, this is still an entertaining movie, which is mainly thanks to Tarantino's skill in direction; he brings all of the drama, bloodshed and humour you'd expect to the tale. I'm no fan of Jamie Foxx but this is probably his best performance given that he plays it taciturn for the most part; Samuel L. Jackson walks away with a great minor role, and DiCaprio makes for a wonderfully slimy bad guy; you'll wonder why casting him as a villain wasn't considered previously. Tarantino's skill at casting familiar faces in minor roles (the likes of Dennis Christopher, James Remar and Franco Nero, for instance) is as good as ever, but I'll have to watch this film a couple more times to decide whether it's truly great or merely quite good.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Pure Tarantino,"Quentin Tarantino is perhaps the only mainstream movie director that can give us a movie like this and still get away with it. If you can call him mainstream, that is. Perhaps commercially successful would be a better term. Or perhaps well-known. Regardless of the exact term, we don't usually see films this full of violence and gore outside of indie films. Which is a shame, because in my opinion this is an excellent film. Excellent.Though don't get me wrong. It's not a good film just because it has a lot of brutality, blood and extreme portrayals of violence. It's a good film because it has excellent characters, an interesting story and it is shot so well that you're transported right into the infamous antebellum era from the very first scene. It's a brutal film yes, but the era was equally brutal, and I give this film props for not shying away from that fact. Sure Mandingo fights might never have existed, but slavery was still a horrifying phenomenon, and this film deals with the subject admirably.The things I enjoyed the most are by far the characters. Tarantino has always had a talent for writing unusual and intriguing personalities and this film is no different. The dialogues are not quite as quotable as in his other films and there is not a clear winner for the best scene in this film, unlike in his previous ones, but the whole still holds together. The actors are equally as capable, though Christoph Waltz once again steals the show as Dr. King Schultz, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson are also very good in their roles. The only real nitpick I have is that perhaps the character of Django (Jamie Foxx) is a bit too bland compared to the rest of the outlandish characters, but then again he is the audience surrogate, so it kind of works. Perhaps he would have needed a bit more spice, but that's just my opinion.As for the story, I quite honestly feel that the ending dragged a bit too long. Or should I say that there was one ending too many. The film almost reaches a resolution, but then it suddenly throws in a twist that keeps it going for another twenty minutes. The twist has a purpose and it has been foreshadowed, but it still feels unneeded. But before that the film is pure gold. Especially the first hour or so, which is full of crazy scenes, intriguing character development and great atmosphere.Who would like this film? Well, if you're a fan of Tarantino, you're probably going to love this one. It's full of his unique style and visuals and the man is still going strong. If you're unfamiliar with Tarantino, you're going to like this if you're a fan of blazing action, interesting characters, westerns and/or great storytelling. However, if you're squeamish about blood, violence and gore, even by a little bit, stay as far away from this film as humanly possible. It's a film for adults, pure and simple. And for what it is, it's perhaps one of the best films I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Quentin at his best! A classic!,"Movies don't get much better than this. If you haven't seen this film, don't bother reading this.... Go watch it now! What are you waiting for? I saw this on the big screen and was in awe the whole time. From the start this movie will have you captivated, with Jamie Fox leading the way and Leonardo DiCaprio stealing the show this movie is exhilarating.Django (Fox) is a recently freed slave who doesn't have a lot to do except look for his wife who is still a slave. When he meets a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist he learns how to shoot, ride a horse, and think first. He soon becomes the man's partner and makes money hunting down bounties, waiting for warmer weather to go find his wife with the man's help. Disguising himself as a kind of slave fight promoter and Django being an expert on the subject they go on a dangerous journey to find and free his wife. They find themselves at the largest plantation in the south 'Candyland' where DiCaprio appreciates money, Mandingo fighting, and honesty.This movie doesn't fail at any level, and I can't say anything negative about it. While the 'n' word is used more than any film I've ever watched it's both necessary and speaks to the realism the script evokes. Tarantino's second-best film behind Pulp Fiction (maybe a tie?) you won't be disappointed by anything. Samuel L. Jackson even seems to steal the show with his role but with a movie filled with great acting the whole thing just works and it's marvelous.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino Light,"Django Unchained After rewriting history and the demise of Hitler in his last film, everyone's favorite ex video store worker turned cult film director Quentin Tarantino is back, this time he puts his own spin on the spaghetti westerns of the 60's and 70's. Those of you who have followed Tarantino since he first burst onto the scene 20 years ago with brilliant Reservoir Dogs will know that he doesn't so much as remake films but take a bunch of ideas from obscure films from all types of countries, eras and genres and mash's them together in an explosive blender and what normally emerges is a stylistic, visceral, in your face and down right entertaining film.Django is no different, the first Django film itself was made in 1966, and the original man to play Django makes a cameo in this film, throughout the film there is more than just passing nods to house of the flying daggers, Battle Royal and young guns, but like I said before none of this is a surprise and it certainly didn't affect my enjoyment of the film, my only real surprise was I didn't enjoy the film as much as I had hoped.I am not sure why I left the cinema slightly disappointed by Django, it had all the standard elements that I normally love about a Tarantino film, snappy dialogue filled with quotable sound bites, charismatic actors who really look like there are enjoying themselves, a good bit of mindless violence and a simple to follow plot which doesn't leave you scratching your head as to what is going on. I think maybe I just expected a little more, it kinda felt a bit like someone else was trying to make a Tarantino film, like a pop band doing a cover of a song that was originally done by a rock band. Maybe I am being a little harsh, I did think it was a really good film but maybe Quentin Tarantino is now a victim of his own success, he has raised the bar so high that it is impossible for him to keep up those standards.One thing that cannot be denied though is the performances his is capable of bringing out of his actors, Chistopher Waltz was once again amazing as the quirky yet deadly Dr Schltz, Leonardo DiCaprio was clearly having the time of his life playing the pantomime baddie but the guy who stole the show for me was Samuel L Jackson. He really is excellent as Stephen the Head Housekeeper of DiCaprio's plantation. Whenever he is on screen just keep an eye to him, especially when someone else is talking, his facial expressions and demeanor are both hilarious and terrifying all at the same time.So in closing I would say go and see Django, it's and entertaining way to spend 2 and a half hours, but just be aware it's probably only Tarantino's 5th best film behind Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, Kill Bill and Reservoir Dogs. Oh and if you do go see it, keep an eye out for Tarantino making his usual cameo. Is it just me or is he starting to look like Jaws from the James Bond films?",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

How Tarantino Would Tell a Love Story,"I have learned to take Quentin Tarantino films with a sense of fun. They may have so many offensive things about them, especially the gratuitous bloody violence and the excessively foul language. But they, this is what people want out of a Quentin Tarantino film! It would not be a Quentin Tarantino film without these mercenary things! And indeed, ""Django Unchained"" is a trove of them, 2 hours and 45 minutes of it!Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave sometime before the Civil War broke out. He was rescued from his new owners by dentist/bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). As Schultz gives Django his freedom and makes him his partner, Django expressed his desire to find, rescue and reunite with his beautiful, German-speaking wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who was now owned by the sadistic Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). All hell breaks loose in Candieland when Django unleashes all his suppressed anger to get his wife back!People who are not used to Quentin Tarantino style (or maybe even those who are) would shirk their eyes away from the screen many times for every cracking whiplash across a slave's back, every explosive shotgun shot going through a body and every bloody punch in that graphic Mandingo fight. Eventually, in the final Grand Guignol scenes, maybe everyone in the audience will already be desensitized despite the interminable fountains of blood that will shoot out of countless bodies in what seemed to be thirty minutes of continuous gunfire. That is classic Tarantino for you!The actors all attack their roles with outrageous glee. Well all, except probably the lead star Jamie Foxx, who plays it ""cool"" in stark contrast with the rest of the hyper cast. Christoph Waltz already won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his role of Schultz, but honestly for me, this is practically the same type of acting I saw from him in both ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""Water for Elephants."" Now, Leonardo DiCaprio, I think he was robbed of a nomination here. He was evil incarnate here, such a different Leo from what we are used to seeing him in. Special mention would have to go to Samuel L. Jackson, whom I did not immediately recognize as the conniving Stephen, the sinister head manservant of Candieland. Those piercing eyes of his baleful glare were something else!It was a great idea to bring the spaghetti Western genre to the deep South. The music was so 70s with those jangly guitars, except for the occasional anachronistic incursion of rap music. The sense of dark humor was all over it, under all that bloodshed and gore. There was a scene with cameos of Jonah Hill, Don Johnson and their KKK masks which was outright hilarious. Funny but I realized that THIS is how Tarantino would tell a love story!But if you ask me if this will win the Oscar for Best Picture, my answer would probably be NO. I do not see this type of film appeal to generally conservative Academy voters. But the fact that it even made it to the final 9 nominees is already recognition enough for QT.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
This Pulp Is The Worst Fiction Ever Made,"One out of the worst money-movies these times. Quentin is keeping exterminating his own film-making; burnt out, there's little chance of recovery. He lost his innocence and the genuine investment of the real geniuses that have lived. That's it. I have already written about that not long ago; there's nothing more to do for Tarantino than to laugh his way to the bank. What a loss for all involved. I can understand that Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio, Morgan Freeman and Jamie Foxx and many others allow themselves to become involved in the making of a new film and, perhaps, in a performance, in a project with a filmmaker who proved he was somebody... but this garbage is denigrating the art of cinematic storytelling, this is compromising the ability for the young moviegoers to never enjoy in the future any resource and representation of life. What's your name? – Django – Can you spell it? An exchange between Jamie Foxx and Franco Nero, the man who first played Django in 1966, a Damned Great Movie, that time has left behind, which happened, for a sterile profit-only engagement, to fit the name.

"Jamie, Quentin, Christoph, and Leo on fire","This film is structured like many of other Tarantino's films. It is rapid-fire, action-packed, and very sharp, with biting dialogue and flashy scenes.The characters are bold and colorful, and their interactions, with Tarantino's signature dynamite dialogue, make the scenes that much more engaging and interesting.Jamie and Christoph give terrific performances and the film is really about them and their relationship with each other, within the backdrop of Antebellum South to create such a dramatic story.Tarantino is all style, and so much style. His films have so much personality and style, you don't even know what to do but sit back and enjoy the ride. There is a lot of cinematic power in his films, and Django Unchained is a force to be reckoned with for sure.Revenge is obviously the main theme here, a common one in Tarantino's films, and Django gets his in spades, taking out a number of slave-masters and otherwise villainous characters in the film. I think Tarantino is tapping into, and exploiting some deep-seated elements of the collective African-American unconscious in Django's quest for revenge, and he does it with this spectacular spectacle.Worth seeing for Tarantino fans and those wanting to explore cinematic representation of the Antebellum South.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino's Most Entertaining Movie,"I know everyone loves Pulp Fiction and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but from my point of view, Django is Tarantino at his finest. To some extent it's his most ""normal"" movie, with in-order storytelling and no narration, but the camerawork, dialogue, and over-the-top violence scream Tarantino. Everything in this movie is perfect. There's plenty of action, comedy, and drama. I think it uses its length better than his other movies. Hollywood and Pulp Fiction felt rather long, but despite the fact that Django features an extended dinner conversation, the intensity of the movie never drops. It's incredibly engaging. The dialogue is incredible, with plenty of callbacks and clever humor. This movie has dozens of quotable moments, including the hilarious raid scene. The Brittle Brothers flashback is utilized perfectly. The performances are amazing. Waltz's Oscar is well-deserved, but honestly Leo might be the best here. His portrayal of Calvin is scary and cunning, and I love that the blooper with his hand getting injured was kept in the movie. I wish there was an Oscar for best villain. Samuel L. Jackson is great as always, and Jamie Foxx nails the title role. Watching him get progressively more confident is so fun to watch. The use of Ennio Morricone's music is brilliant as well. Most importantly, this movie is probably the best example of one of my favorite parts of Tarantino's movie. I don't really like watching movies based on a true story because usually the truth is depressing and disappointing. Tarantino is more of an optimist and features movies that ask ""what if history went right?"" Inglorious and Hollywood are great examples as well. Django is an inspiring story that's so satisfying.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Oh my Django!,"If you are a Tarantino fan, prepared to be blown out of your seat. This movie is beyond epic, so much so that it needs to invent a new word for epic. This has to be beyond a shadow of a doubt the greatest movie Tarantino has ever done (and if you've seen one QT movie you'll know what a huge statement that is) and in my opinion the greatest movie of this century. If you are sensitive to the use of the N word, this might not be something you should watch, because it reportedly gets dropped over 110 times. The actors were completely mesmerizing, with Leonardo DiCaprio outshining all of them with one simple scene. I was very happy to see Christoph Waltz play a character that didn't scare the crap out of me but by no means did that make him a soft guy in the movie. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with a perfect balance of old-timey music and newer music. The song ""Freedom"" is the best, because it sounds like a slave song but written in modern times and I love jamming out to it. Absolute, hands down, 10/10!!!Tip: DO NOT MAKE THIS INTO A DRINKING GAME IF YOU DON'T WANT ALCOHOL POISONING.

Django Unchained is a film that will stand in the hall of fame with history's  greatest westerns,"Django Unchainted is probably one of the greatest modern westerns and one of the best films of 2012.The film has a lot of things to enjoy.It has an interesting,original plot that will make you feel like it is a spaghetti western made in the 60s but also has the right amount of modern touches like having some humour(besides that the film is mostly a drama) and that it shows the racism that existed at the time and how white people treated black people at the time.The film has great action sequences(especially some shootouts that were amazing) and has some gore and violence.It has incredible dialogue and amazing performances by Samuel L Jackson,Jamie Foxx,Leonardo Di Caprio and Christoph Waltz.The characters in the film were interesting and developed.Django's character was the most developed in the film.His actions and emotions were justified by his tragic past and he was lovable and the film made you care for him.The antagonist Calvin Candie played by Leonardo Di Caprio was interesting,intelligent and menacing and Christoph Waltz's character Dr Shultz was also very intelligent,likable and entertaining. It goes without saying that Quentin Tarantino's directing in the film was masterful.If you haven't see this you really should but I am sure that you already have seen it a thousand times.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great action & drama in which DiCaprio stands out,"This film is about Django- a newly freed slave who teams up with a German bounty hunter killing wanted people and claiming the rewards. The two of them then set out together on the mission of finding and rescuing Django's wife.This film includes a great cast with some well known actors playing very different roles. Jamie Foxx was endearing as the determined and likable main character. His German partner was also very likable and provided comic relief throughout which was nice when it was quite a dramatic film about serious issues. Leonardo DiCaprio portrayed his character fantastically and he really made some of the scenes with his brilliant acting.The story line is quite powerful and there were some very shocking and gory scenes in this film but because of the topic of the film those scenes just had to be in there.I think this is one of those films which everyone has to watch and at least give it a go. It is definitely memorable and despite it being a very long film, it is worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Disappointing,"Looks like Tarantino is getting old and jaded. He generally has a small acting role in his movies, in this one he looked like Elvis in the latter part of his career and so does the movie. Going through the motions with little emotional involvement or imagination. I am actually quite a fan of Tarantino and had hoped to see his equivalent of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven but left the theater disappointed. The movie was far too long for what was on offer (not that much) and the ending seemed to be a 20 minute add on to meet blood and gore quotas and nothing more. As regards acting, this movie should leave a few of the famous thinking like Silvester Stallone after he made Rhinestone. I understand he basically paid to have that movie taken out of circulation. Samuel Jackson, in particular, may soon be doing the same. His role was far from sympathetic, but made worse by overacting. Don't give up the day job Quentin.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"DJANGO UNCHAINED (Quentin Tarantino, 2012) ***","In hindsight, given how extensively he had been ""inspired"" (read copiously pilfered) from it in his previous 7 films, it seems somewhat surprising to me how it took Quentin Tarantino 20 years to make his own pastiche-cum-tribute to the Spaghetti Western. Rather than the taciturn Leone/Eastwood hero ""The Man With No Name"", he picks the sub-genre's second best-known icon to do so – which is just as well since he subverts him into a caustic smart-ass of a colored slave, thus enabling Tarantino to hit two birds with one stone and equally pay would-be homage to such infamous exploitation fare as GOODBYE UNCLE TOM (1971) and MANDINGO (1975).Where it does ape Leone's celebrated Western quintet is in the sheer time it takes to tell its simple tale of revenge (165 minutes as of this sitting) but there have already been rumors circulating that a lot of footage was left on the cutting room floor after The Weinsteins vetoed Tarantino's desire to release the film in two parts! As if wishing to stress the fact that his version of the critically much-maligned (if clearly beloved of film buffs) sub-genre is superior to and artistically more valid than its antecedents, he takes great pains to point out that his is a ""Southern"" (set in America's Deep South, y'see) and not just a mere Western. Such earnestness to be taken seriously would have carried far more weight if we were not subjected to so much cartoonish violence (with the fakest use of blood squibs imaginable) throughout the entire film!Carrying on from his previous movies, however, we find a typically excellent ensemble cast at work here with Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio and especially Samuel L. Jackson and Don Johnson (seriously) shining the brightest. Just like any number of the film's blood-soaked corpses, it is also riddled with knowing cameos, from Franco Nero to Bruce Dern – most of whom, buried as they are under whiskers and the ravages of time, went by unnoticed (Robert Carradine, Lee Horsley, Ted Neeley, Michael Parks, Don Stroud, Russ Tamblyn and Tom Wopat); unfortunately, the egocentric film-maker does not even spare us from a bloated, middle-aged appearance of himself as a mining company employee sporting arguably the worst Aussie accent on record!The central couple of Django and Broomhilde Von Shaft (yeah, the ancestor of Detective John Shaft, dig it?) are competently enough played by Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington but it is very evident (particularly in the film's tastelessly upbeat final scenes) that Tarantino had Will Smith in mind when he wrote the screenplay; besides, the clearly Homeric (or rather Sigfriedian, given her Germanic name) overtones intended for Django's long-winded quest would have been far more relevant had Washington been made to be Mississippi landowner Di Caprio's mistress rather than just a kitchen maid!! Their past lives, then, are intermittently displayed via a series of rather pointless and gratuitously flashy flashbacks.Frankly, however, (whatever our personal feelings towards the man himself might be) we do not keep on going to watch Tarantino's films for their pointed character studies but to see how they fare in the ""coolly quotable dialogue"" and ""clevery obscure in-jokes"" departments: even though there are predictably reams of dialogue here, on a first viewing only a handful register as memorable at all (chiefly among them the brief exchange between Foxx and Nero on the spelling of the ""Django"" name; another one between Di Caprio and Jackson regarding Washington's German heritage; and the animated rendition of Jackson's colorful insults usually hurled towards Foxx; Waltz's ludicrous conclusion that ""Alexandre Dumas was black"" is best forgotten, however). Telllingly, the film's highlight is not an action set-piece but a subdued confrontation between Di Caprio and Foxx on their way to the latter's lavish abode Candyland. What is worse is that the film is oddly repetitive in both dialogue (some words keep cropping upand not just the dreaded ""N"" word) and action (Di Caprio gets his comeuppance exactly in the same way as a sheriff did earlier in the movie!); Jackson's explosive end, then, seems like an impersonal one given how despicable he had been toward Django, his wife and their own race!!Finally, the film is marked by some significant changes in Tarantino's personnel, namely producer Lawrence Bender and his late editor Sally Menke; it is a shame, however, that he did not also dispense with the services of The RZA (courtesy of some ill-judged rap rants) on the soundtrack – which, includes the title track of the obscure 1971 Spaghetti Western HIS NAME WAS KING (used here as the theme tune of Waltz's character) and a rather blah new song composed by Ennio Morricone himself! For the record, DJANGO UNCHAINED has been named Best Film Of The Year by The American Film Institute, is up for 5 Golden Globes (but the winners will only be announced in tomorrow's ceremony) and has just been nominated for another 5 Academy awards (but, surprisingly enough, both Tarantino and Di Caprio have been snubbed)!",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best profanity movies of the year,"After the huge success of this movie over the past few weeks I started wondering what is Tarantino's winning recipe for this movie. Was it the depiction of brutality African people were subjected to during the slavery? Certainly not, since there are movies that do a much better job in that area. Was it the spaghetti western style? Not the best one in that area either. The satirical portrayal of some characters or situations? The movie has its funny moments, but with all of my generosity I could not call it a comedy nor a satire. And then it struck me. Profanity. Profanity spiced with a few jokes and the right dose of blood spatter. Thinking back to his previous work I started to see the pattern. This recipe seems to be very successful with the audience. Why not give the masses what they want, right? That one worked for Rome too. At least for a while. It seems to me the prophecy of the movie Idiocracy regarding our society is becoming a reality much sooner than expected.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Two Thirds of a really good film,"""Django"" is part of a story that starts out as a journey, that is both storyline heavy and cinematically appealing and but at the 2/3 mark of the film, ""Unchained"" plays out and the crash and burn effect takes over. That is also the point in the film where Christopher Waltz goes out of character. Coincidence? I think not, but despite my lack of adoration here, there are scenes that can't missed. The pre-KKK attack is a rewrite short of Blazing Saddles and every Waltz soliloquy or explanation of action bears witnessing at least twice. A Tarentino adventure always merits attention, but expectations here are planned resentments of either unfulfilled promise or, more likely, excessive non-sense. Over exposed violence served its purpose in ""Kill Bill"" and ""Inglorious Basterds"" but anti-slavery points were well made and preserved well before the blood sport took over.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

The usual Tarantino style is always welcome and the over-the-top violence just makes the movie more entertaining to watch.

A major achievement by many crafts persons,"As I detest Tarantino and his violent cruelty fantasies, let me come out and say it now...this is an astonishing piece of entertainment and particularly well produced. The two Oscars it won are not the ones I would agree with, as This film deserved awards for the superb craftsmanship on display, more than for his wanky script and same note performance by Mr Waltz. The pleasure in this film belongs in the work of the cinema- photography, art direction, set design and melancholy acting by Jamie Foxx. I saw DJANGO twice and thought it terrific both times. The sharp editing allows the violence to be hard but appropriate and the storyline is strong. Leonardo plays it like Vincent Price channeling Snidley Whiplash, and quite camp. Terrific credit titles upfront, lots of 'spot the B grade actor' fun and a nice joke with Franco Nero. Outstanding atmosphere, realistic tension and quality work on the screen make this a major work by someone who might finally have grown up a bit. A plot hole a mile wide still does not spoil the result.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great fun to watch but on reflection leaves a bit of a bad taste,"A really entertaining film when you are in the cinema watching. I have no problem with the length of the film as you become engrossed in the story and characters and the time then passes by quickly. Christoph Waltz is again brilliant but if you have seen him in Inglorious Bastards and Water for Elephants you can certainly see similarities in his style and characters.My overall impression is that its like watching a comic and is very funny in places, maybe in other places a bit silly, but thats what you expect from a comic. Then it gives you the other end of the extreme and some of the violence belongs more in a horror flick?We again get the tense and trade mark dialogue around a table, think of the bar scene in IB and you have it here at the plantation, again very good and entertaining. I came away from the cinema feeling I had been very entertained and had a really good laugh, then on reflection having watched the film one thinks thats maybe not what you should be feeling.So it does entertain you, it does make you think, you go in to watch it caught up in all the hype, after all its been a while since inglorious bastards (which is better in my opinion) and its only after a couple of days if you look back and think that maybe you feel its not as brilliant as its made out to be.QT puts in a cameo appearance and after seeing him promoting the film and on various chat shows I found it a bit of a distraction and would rather he had not put himself in the film, his acting is not as good as his writing and directing! Definitely worth going to see on the big screen, it may just leave you a little confused as to how you feel about it afterwards.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A lot of fun. Violent, violent fun","This movie is definitely a bit of a revenge fantasy, a sort of reimagining what it would be if there was someone who stood up against the brutality of slavery of old-timey American, and used a BLOODY GUN to do so instead of diplomacy.Jamie Foxx delivers a very good performance as Django (though I've heard rather unpleasant things about what he said about his experience shooting the movie), and Christoph Waltz is....... Christoph Waltz. Easily one of my favourite charming European actors. DiCaprio is amazingly believable as the narcissistic and blatantly racist Candy. In the end, the cast is very very good and the story, which follows the usual revenge narrative arc culminating in a bloody (a bit TOO bloody, actually imo) shootdown, is predictable and fun.It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's good popcorn fun, and a howling gun-toting bloody good time if that's what you're looking for.

Fun pulpy western that will not last.,"QT makes another pulpy homage to genre movies from the past. It sometimes works, often doesn't but at least it is never dull! For the most part, this movie is a solid, re-imagined western that includes black people often absent from the traditional western narrative. Great characters, great story, great action but then it all goes super pulpy with silly action. It is a pity because if QT had just pulled it back it could have been great but instead it is just great fun. The real shame is for the first half it is excellent but there comes a point when you begin to doubt that even racist evil plantation owners could have said N1gg3r as much as they do in a few scenes, then like the language the action becomes overblown.We still watch ""Man with no name"" films and ""Once upon a time in the west"" decades later, I doubt this will stand the test of time. It may seem like I am down on this movie but honestly go and see it you will enjoy it.I also think not being able to type N1gg3r on a review about a movie that says it about 700 times is ridiculous and I pity the sensitive souls who are so fragile that they allow this word to have so much power and suggest they avoid using youtube and reading the comments otherwise they will find themselves trolled by 12 year olds.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Outstanding,"That movie is really cool.It seems Tarantino has the intention to tell the sad/bad story in his way of the slavery in southeast USA : I think he succeed because i could not miss a scene and a speech in the story. It's gripping He does it in his way but i loved it. Also i wonder if the movie mirror the real social schemes and relationship between black and whites before the American civil war I have been also impressed by the figure who Samuel Jackson plays. The black that become strictly connected to the master. How much in that times the social schemes drove the people's mind. Also tells the story of the internal conflicts and contrasts between blacks themselves The title also plays his important part. I thinks that he wants to say that when the blacks have been have given the freedom it could have taken big changes in the society with all the troubles and dangers the freedom involved but it was a necessary and important human step in the history. This movie helps not only to learn the past America but also the present? Maybe? Everywhere in the western world the blacks have been misused mistreated displaced beaten and abused oftheirs lives. That explain a lot their social disease now. A really nice movie, a strong look at the errors of the pasts, in order to figure out some feature the actual world. Bad or good they are, is the world we are living . There is some italy inside. A famous Italian actor Franco Nero plays the part of a man who bets on mandingo fights . He spoke in Italian. Also, Tarantino gives space to the German language, to make understands that the culture can be a prerogative of a slaved person, also. And some reference to French culture as well..etc..culture, languages, all of this breaks barriers. And is very powerful.I would add that the level of the actors is totally amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The latest masterpiece by director Quentin Tarantino.,"Django Unchained is the story of Django(Jamie Foxx) who is released from slavery by bounty hunter/dentist Dr. King Schultz(Christoph Waltz) to identify three slave owners. Django & Schultz make a deal that after they take care of the slave owner business, they will search for Django's long lost wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington). After a little research they find out that Broomhilda is a slave owned by infamous slave owner Calvin Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio). After they reach Candieland, Candie's chief slave Stephen(Samuel L. Jackson) is suspicious about their intentions.This movie was freaking EPIC! Every second of watching this film was a delight. I liked it much better than Tarantino's previous work, Inglorious Basterds. A note on the performances. Jamie Foxx is effective as Django. However, Foxx's performance is nothing compared to the others performances. Christoph Waltz is hysterical in his portrayal of Dr.King Schultz. Leonardo DiCaprio is terrifyingly brilliant in his portrayal of the brutal Calvin Candie. Kerry Washington is great as disturbed & tortured slave Broomhilda. However, Samuel L. Jackson stands out as the evil & menacing Stephen. The slave is more wicked than Candie himself. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you are disgusted or easily disturbed by a lot of violence & gore then, you should stay away from this film. But, for everyone else this movie is a must watch.

"Tarantino is not developing himself, same empty revenge stories.","It is sad to see Tarantino is not able to improve his talents, he is spinning around same type of movies with no real message at the end of the movie/day...This is very similar to Kill Bill or Inglourious Basterds. Lots of revenge, lots of bold killing scenes, blood and flying heads.Some people may like this kind of movies, some people claim he is pointing out important matters like Genocide or Racism, but I do not believe movies are deep enough to convey any kind of message. Stories starts nice but ends like nothing... Good guys take the revenges and kill them all. Very superficial.It is sad people like it at all.This time there is one German good guy carefully picked unlike Inglourious Basterds (I believe he is trying to fix previous movie's anti-German reputation somehow.)Leonardo DiCaprio performance is the best in movie for me. Also Christoph Waltz performed very well. But Leonardo proofs he is a real star and can handle any role in its best manners even in such empty hole he was doing some real role.So movie never deserve such high points as general quality. Yes it is 9 to 10 point for a Tarantino classic movie but not for a good movie. It is 6.5-7 in my eyes mainly because the quality of effects and some star performers...I hope one day I can really watch Tarantino movies not like watching a short commercial brake or short you-tube movie, but with a real story supported with detailed background details and side actors...So if you don't watch, you don't loose anything.

Pure manure...,"If anyone else had done this movie, it would be savaged for its low quality. I don't know what this movie was supposed to be.

But the acting, except for the good Dr. Schultz, is miserable. Everyone is a caricature. If I was black, I'd be offended. Fox doesn't act, he glowers. The settings are all wrong....I mean snow-capped peaks in the South? The firearms are not period correct. You can even see the Italian proof marks on them.

But in the end it is just another rotten pizza.Yes, I understand, the director or producer of this knows that everything is wrong. I guess that is part of its so-called charm. But don't call this great cinema. Oscars? What, are you on crack? The best way to watch this film is as part of a Mystery Science Theater 3000.

revenge is a dish best served cold,"If you thought that Quentin Tarantino had gotten as hilariously ludicrous as possible with ""Inglourious Basterds"", wait 'til you see ""Django Unchained"". Based on a series of spaghetti westerns, it depicts a former slave looking for his wife...and getting revenge in the process. Jamie Foxx plays the title character whose unexpected acquaintance with a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) sets on a path to reunite with his beloved (Kerry Washington).Since this is a Tarantino movie, there's naturally a lot of graphic violence done in very good taste. But probably the most surprising thing is Leonardo DiCaprio's role. So far he's pretty much always played likable characters. Here his role is that of a deliciously evil plantation owner who has what appears to be an incestuous relationship with his sister. Equally impressive is Samuel L. Jackson's role as the house (N word). Not only does Jackson naturally use his common word - the one that graced his wallet in ""Pulp Fiction"" and dominated the famous line in ""Snakes on a Plane"" - but he turns the Uncle Tom character into someone who looks down on blacks as much as any slave-owner. Django, meanwhile, often gives everyone a soft stare while the bounty hunter leads the conversation.As is Tarantino's protocol, he gives a bunch of forgotten and/or retired stars supporting roles: Don Johnson and Bruce Dern play slave-owners; Dennis Christopher (""Breaking Away"") plays an assistant; Ted Neeley (""Jesus Christ Superstar""), Robert Carradine (""Revenge of the Nerds"") and Tom Savini (the famous makeup artist) play trackers; and Franco Nero (the original Django) plays a man who understands the pronunciation. Jonah Hill appears in the movie's funniest scene.It all adds up to one really good movie. So far Quentin Tarantino (who appears as a mining company employee) has not disappointed, and I'm very eager to see his next movie. You know that he'll do something neat. In the meantime, ""Django Unchained"" is one for the ages! If you haven't seen the original ""Django"", it's also worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I defiantly recommend anyone to watch this! It gives you a good look at slavery in it's truest form. Nothing that you would learn in a textbook at school. Tarantino made this raw, not for enjoyment, but to simply teach a lesson in life. how everyone deserves to get a taste of revenge! 10 out of 10!

Unpleasant to the max and NOT entertaining in the least,"The word that best describes this movie is ""unpleasant."" I know Tarantino crafted the film to impart the horrible nature of the subject matter. It works in that regard. Still, it's unpleasant from start to finish and in a drawn out and poor fashion.Part of Tarantino's charm is that his often juvenile sensibilities shine through in all his work no matter the subject matter. His work is usually entertaining and crisp first and foremost. Here, what's delivered is neither. There's his trademark bloody, cartoonish violence but none of it feels rewarding or is even captivating to be honest. The unpleasant message is hammered home time and again but with no charm. I certainly wasn't expecting a feel good film or a Charles Bronson revenge flick but I was expecting to connect with a character or two and was expecting more of a thrill ride. I found nothing of the sort in this film. What I did find is an almost three hour film that feels like five. I guess that's part of the creative decision but he seemed to sacrifice all entertainment value for a chance to drive home his white guy guilt angle. What results is a simplistic and poorly written plot with one dimensional stereotype characters drudging through as unpleasant of a story as possible.That's a tough way to spend three hours at the cinema.",,Anonymous,Drama
A vision of history that only Tarantino could bring us...,"As an avid fan of Quentin Tarantino, there's a level of quality that I expect from each film that he makes. I expect to connect with his characters, but not necessarily like any of them. I expect to see a film that satisfies the film geek in me. More than anything, I expect to see a film that entertains throughout the prerequisite bloated running time.""Django Unchained"" is nearly three hours long. But it never feels that long, it entertains and surprises every step along the way. When I first checked my watch, we were already two hours into the film. All of Tarantino's films are usually about this long. Tarantino has been having fun with fictionalizing historical periods lately. This started with 2009's ""Inglourious Basterds"", which was easily one of the best films of that year. My eighty-something year old grandmother, who lived through the time that the film depicted - World War II - said that if events actually happened as they did in that film, that we would be living in a better world today. I think that's a pretty high compliment, especially since my grandmother is not Tarantino's target audience. He was able to design a great story - not an idealistic view of that time period, but still a pretty fascinating one.""Django"" is about slavery...a taboo subject in any film, a strangely popular one, recently, as the same time period is explored in ""Lincoln"". It's about Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is bought and then freed by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz, one-upping himself from the fantastic performance he gave in ""Basterds""), a dentist turned bounty hunter. White supremacist slave owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) bought and enslaved his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), and Django and Schultz are out to correct the grave injustice done to both of them, and this doesn't mean just capturing and killing Candie, but many others who are responsible for the trauma experienced by Broomhilda.Christoph Waltz has got to be one of the finest living actors in Hollywood. He's incredibly charismatic, but he cares about his character, first and foremost. As the prime antagonist in ""Basterds"", he was positively horrifying. In this film, he's the hero, but at the same time, he's anything but that. He brings humor and depth to a character that wouldn't have worked this well otherwise. Jamie Foxx does a good job as well, but I don't necessarily see him winning anything this Oscar season.I'm half-tempted to call ""Django"" Quentin Tarantino's superhero movie. Django is by no means that, he's an oppressed figure with no real ""super powers"", however he's a kick-ass guy who the audience roots for from the very beginning. He even has his own theme song! We don't know how he appears to be more literate than other slaves, and he is somehow always able to outsmart those around him.""Django"" shows Tarantino having slightly more respect for genre than he ever has. It's a western revenge epic, first and foremost. It's also kind of a comedy, with some of the most clever dialogue I've heard in a film in 2012. It's also a romance, displaying the forbidden love between Django and his wife. But it's first and foremost a western, and Tarantino sticks to that.This film isn't perfect, however. One thing I expect from Tarantino is well-developed strong female characters. We don't have that in ""Django"". I was hoping that Kerry Washington, who is also badass protagonist Olivia Pope in ABC's ""Scandal"", would be smart and strong-willed enough to get herself out of the problems which are out of her hands. I was hoping for Tarantino to give her some snappy dialogue, to show that her character is, like Django, superior to all of the other slaves around her. She isn't. She just kind of stands there and whimpers. She's helpless, and I wasn't expecting that from Tarantino, who has written some of the best female protagonists in film.Other than this, ""Django Unchained"" is a masterful film. It takes a lot for a nearly three hour long film to be engaging the entire way through, and it is. It's wickedly funny, and at the same time, extremely dramatic. With its graphic violence and filthy mouth, it isn't for the faint of heart. All of the actors here, especially DiCaprio, seem to be having tons of fun here, and it shows. Tarantino loves to fictionalize history, and if such films are as good as ""Django Unchained"", I think he should keep doing it. It's a vision of history that only Tarantino can bring us.Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of Tarantino's Finest Works,"With the help of a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), a freed slave (Jamie Foxx) sets out to rescue his wife (Kerry Washington) from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio).Take the blaxploitation classics ""Boss"" and ""Mandingo"", throw in some spaghetti westerns, stir them around inside the brain of Quentin Tarantino, and you get this: another masterpiece from the perennial film student. Whether or not one likes his directing or his acting, Tarantino's writing has always been his strong point, and he exhibits that again here.I want to address the issue of race, as this film sort of forces us to do. Spike Lee said about the film, ""All I'm going to say is that it's disrespectful to my ancestors. That's just me... I'm not speaking on behalf of anybody else."" Although I am a white man and cannot speak as the descendant of American slaves, I did find it to be a powerful condemnation of slavery unlike we have seen nearly anywhere else. The film was the flip side to ""Gone With the Wind"". And its moral ambiguity was done flawlessly -- Django is the hero, yet he kills mercilessly and even allows slaves to die if it helps him meet his goals. He is an egoistic utilitarian -- no harm is too much if it helps his personal greater good.""Django"" and its approach to race is interesting from the perspective of someone who has watched Tarantino's career unfold. While I would hardly consider Tarantino a racist, he has written some questionable lines over the years, and batted the n-word around more freely than most white folks would feel proper doing (e.g. the ""dead n***** storage"" line in ""Pulp Fiction"" or the exchange in ""True Romance"" where Sicilians were said to have ""black blood"" and were ""spawned by n*****s""). Yet, he has frequently had strong black characters (Marcellus Wallace, and especially Jackie Brown). What do we make of this? Has Tarantino found a way to transcend race in ways few others have?I also want to put the film in perspective. Owen Gleiberman wrote that ""Django isn't nearly the film that Inglourious was. It's less clever, and it doesn't have enough major characters – or enough of Tarantino's trademark structural ingenuity – to earn its two-hour-and-45-minute running time."" I am mixed on this remark. While I do think that ""Inglourious"" was a stronger film and more tightly scripted (some of the references and allusions are so subtle, it takes repeated views to really get them), and I definitely think ""Django"" could have been told in 90 rather than 165 minutes, I do not mind its length. Again, referring to the moral ambiguity, we see this evolve and move forward as new situations arise.On the acting front, Jamie Foxx is excellent and this is his best performance since ""Ray"", maybe ever. Leonardo DiCaprio falls short of his best work, but is still good. Christoph Waltz is the real gem here, much like he was in ""Inglourious"" -- why he does so few American films is a mystery. The most debatable performance seems to be on Samuel L. Jackson. I did not find him to be doing his best (I prefer him in ""Black Snake Moan""), but others say this should have been his time to be recognized and awarded. I think opportunities passed before, and hopefully will not be overlooked again, but this was not it.Best Picture? No. Best Director? No. But I can definitely see Best Screenplay and it is great to see that Tarantino's best work has been in the last five years -- it makes me think whatever he touches next will (again) be gold.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Very good, but a little short of being a masterpiece","I went to see this after weighing up a number of reviews from different sources. I can only say I wasn't disappointed, but despite the film's strengths it has one major weakness. I'll try to outline these without spoilers.Strengths: (1) Outstanding performances from Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel L. Jackson (both a big surprise as baddies and proving the versatility of these actors), plus Christoph Waltz was the most engaging character in the film, and Jamie Foxx was very good too. (2) Some excellent set- piece scenes, especially in the first half - the scene where Schultz meets Django is hilarious. (3) Also surprisingly, a really, really earnest attempt by Tarantino to grapple with the slavery issue on a visceral level. To criticize him for his use of the 'n' word and excessive violence is to miss the point. This is what slavery was like: nasty, brutal and racist. The film depicts the horror of slavery in all its repellent detail, and should be commended for this, not criticized.Weakness: Only one, but it's a biggie. The last part of the film, from the conclusive interaction between Dicaprio and Waltz onwards, lost me emotionally, where I had been very involved up to that point. After this it became cartoonish (perhaps deliberately?) and instead of the ending being moving it just felt empty. The scene with the Australians, for example, was just silly, not believable, and not even funny at all. That Django was even in that position after what he had done not long before was ridiculous. Although Tarantino has cleverly avoided falling into cliché, I don't think the resolutions he came up with were convincing in terms of some of the characters' motivations. There were other options, which one can identify simply through memory of several Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns. The outcome could be the same, but the method of arriving at it needed to be more believable.I think, like so many directors and writers, Tarantino has struggled to get the ending right. Despite many claiming that the film is too long, I think in the end Tarantino actually needed to develop the denouement at greater length and more satisfactorily for it to have any emotional or intellectual bite. Kill Bill 2 suffered severely from similar problems.Overall, then, a very worthy attempt at a revival of the spaghetti western (one of my favourite genres), but the script would have needed a redraft in the last third.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not very funny; violence more than sufficient,"It's not that there is no humor; I laughed out loud maybe twice. Very early on, though, it becomes clear that we are supposed to be enthralled (amused? impressed?) by unrealistic gun play and explosive red blots, and that theme continues throughout.Christoph Waltz clearly enjoyed his role and performs it with relish and a twinkle in his eye. Every time he opened his mouth, I thought ""Richard Dreyfuss""--I don't say that is either good nor bad, but to me, it was Waltz playing Dreyfuss playing this role.Jamie Foxx seemed to take his role too seriously, as the movie does not deserve it, or maybe he just doesn't do comedy well anymore (I seem to remember some funny bits on ""In Living Color"", but that was long ago.) Samuel Jackson played his role as ""house Negro"" well, but he didn't do himself much honor by taking it. There were some good cameos, particularly Don Johnson as a slaveowner in Tennessee, and Franco Nero as an Italian owner of a Mandingo fighter in Mississippi. Quentin Tarantino's cameo was ridiculously bad acting; he should refrain from putting himself in future movies.Leonardo DiCaprio's role as a degenerate slaveowner was generally well portrayed, from a stylistic point of view. I would say his character's dialogue was not particularly well written, but he has no particular cause for complaint, as bad dialogue prevails throughout, except for some ill-fitting attempts at intellectual discourse, which I saw as showy and superficial in such a mindlessly violent exercise. (I suppose the bad dialogue could be said to be intentional, but it earns Tarantino no credit.)What else? I don't object to the excessive use of the 'n' word, as it probably is realistic for the period. Unlike, say, ""Huckleberry Finn"", its use doesn't have anything profound to say about slavery except that some slaves would really have liked to kill every white person in sight (not too surprising, probably). The closest to something meaningful was when DiCaprio's character asks the interesting question: ""Why do the slaves not kill their masters?"" and doesn't answer it. Clearly many of the bad guys deserved what they got, but not all of them, and the script shows little discrimination (so to speak). The plot was tediously predictable, though I do admit I knew the outlines of it before I went in to see it.Tarantino's use of old-fashioned spaghetti Western titles, Nero, and the song performed in Italian (could get a nomination, if the field is weak enough) was probably his most interesting directorial motif, but it was neither surprising, funny, nor profound.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Django Unchained (2012),"Having built himself up as one of cinema's great auteur directors, Quentin Tarantino has struggled to surpass his finest achievement Pulp Fiction which became iconic for its constructive dialogue and fascinating characters when it was first released back in 1994. Though the likes of Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill I & II (2003/04) and Inglorious Basterds were generally well-received, they lacked the audacious elements of his second 'masterpiece' (his first being Reservoir Dogs!). However his latest film, the violent western Django Unchained, manages to reclaim those specific elements as he chooses to revive the 'spaghetti' sub-genre and blend it altogether with gratuitous violence as well as paying homage to several lesser-known westerns. There is also the small matter of its versatile cast which includes Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Di-Caprio and Christoph Waltz while awards recognition has already been sprung on the film including a couple of Golden Globe wins and several Oscar nominations. Mr Tarantino, you had my curiosity, now you have my attention.In the Deep South of 19th Century America, a slave named Django (Foxx) is rescued from capture by a charming but deadly dentist-turned-bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz who decides to use him as a partner. During their pursuit of a couple of rival bounty hunters, Django reveals that once he is free, he intends to find his beloved wife Broomhilda (Washington) who has been forced to work under sadistic plantation owner Calvin Caddie (Di-Caprio). The pair travel to Caddie's home as they look to try and negotiate with him about taking on a bounty even though their main objective is to rescue Django's beloved from her suffering. However when things turn nasty, our slave-turned-gunslinger instigates one final confrontation to try and save his wife once and for all.As he did with his depiction of World War II in Inglorious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino presents an equally gritty look of the Old West as he relies on old Spaghetti Westerns to influence his film-making through its plot and misc-en-scene. The latter in particular sees him use a Ennio Morricone-style score that is played throughout the film which lends a nostalgic feel to the days of classic Sergio Leone-type westerns. A running theme that is beginning to occur in the maverick director's filmography is revenge which shows up here again as Django vows to find his wife but decides to take down those who have troubled the pair in the past. This is all graphically conveyed by the violence, a key part of Tarantino's films, as his illustration of brutality reaches an all-time best courtesy of the constant blood and gore which occurs throughout. He also refuses to ignore the shocking treatment that the salves endured as he places the Southern mansions and 'mandingo' fights into the film to remind us that this was a traumatic period for the African-American race and that while things are better now, there is no moving away from what went on all those years ago. But amidst the scenes of violence and long-drawn dialogue from the slick script, we do get some light-hearted relief particularly in one scene where a gang of KKK members (including Jonah Hill in a very brief role) have a frank discussion about the uncomfortable masks they wear. It is these type of moments in the film that makes us realise that the director is having a lot of fun as he did with other comical moments in his past productions. Another key trademark is having a black and white duo as the leading characters which worked out well in Tarantino's renowned Pulp Fiction as the heart-warming friendship between our two heroes allows us to root for the pair as their story progresses. Jamie Foxx has a lot of fun in his role as Django as he mixes empathy and coolness to his portrayal of a man who eventually develops himself as a bad-ass hero. However he is overshadowed by his more versatile co-stars including the recently Oscar-nominated Christoph Waltz who is terrific as the charming but deadly killer who initially starts out as an anti-hero but becomes more compassionate about the mistreatment of slaves in the film's final quarter. A complete surprise is the villainous turn from an-against-type Leonardo Di-Caprio as he tackles the role of the unhinged Calvin Caddie whose vicious and disturbing personality is truly terrifying to watch compared to Di-Caprio's previous on-screen portrayals. Just as tyrannous is Samuel L. Jackson as the vindictive and loyal butler of Caddie who is more prepared to betray his own race rather than to help a fellow 'brother'. The stunningly-beautiful Kerry Washington is sadly reduced to being the helpless victim who uses her facial expressions to show her fragile side and is never given much of a chance to shine but is still an alluring sight nonetheless.One major criticism that does detract Tarantino's directing style is his excessive use of racial language which is driven to complete overload as the 'n' word gets spoken hundreds of times. While this was a tough period in US history that was blighted by the harsh treatment of African-American people, it is bound to unsettle some audiences who won't be prepared to handle a film which overwhelmingly uses countless racist dialogue. Think of it as a dramatic (and present day version) of Blazing Saddles! The director also makes the bizarre decision to use a strange Australian accent in his short role (something he has done in his previous films) which isn't necessarily needed considering the time the story is set but at least he gets an explosive send-off! Despite its overly use of the 'n' word, the D stands for delightful as Tarantino's latest violent spectacle tackles the Old West with true grit and influential-style while the likes of Foxx, Waltz and Di-Caprio saddle up and give roaring performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gunslinger goodieness turning stale and pale,"This movie is once again a feast for the eyes and ears, though it tends to sag halfway through. And it never recovers. This hasn't exactly much to do with DiCaprio or Jackson, whose characters are introduced around that time, OR those characters. It's just that the movie entered a section where my thoughts apparently tended to wander off. That's never a good sign. It's then that I stopped being fully engaged and it's where I became aware that I was watching just another fun, silly movie that was starting to get really top-heavy. Also, and this is kinda serious, Django the character was kinda.. BORING. This might have been the intention. For example, it could be that Django was mirroring one-dimensional gunslinger heroes of classic westerns, but when you hear these accompanying musical odes you can't help but to expect more. A bit more fleshed out character and even some added spice. I liked the fact that the original Django had a cameo, plus that there where these original songs written especially for the movie this time. Especially the song 'Ancora Cui' by Morricone. Not that it really matters, but if you're gonna hand out a damn Oscar, give it to Morricone and Elisa Toffoli instead of Adele.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Encourages hatred and violence,"Science fiction writer Frank Herbert wrote in his novel Chapterhouse Dune: ""...the inevitable failure of slavery and peonage. You created a reservoir of hate. Implacable enemies, you dared not try. Temper your efforts by the sure awareness that oppression will make your enemies strong. The oppressed will have their day and heaven help the oppressor when that day comes. It was a two-edged blade. The oppressed always learn from and copied the oppressor. When the tables were turned, the stage was set for another round of revenge and violence--roles reversed. And reversed and reversed ad nauseam."" This film is clearly an attempt to instill the desire for modern day blacks to hate and oppress any who disagree with their liberal doctrine who are willing to submit to everything the left insists upon. This is precisely the kind of oppression we have so often seen in dictators such as Adolph Hitler.With that in mind, Django is one of the most blatant attacks the left has made on conservatives that I've seen as it works to establish a tie between the ghastly world of slavery with modern day conservatives. That was certainly the message being presented at different points in the film. It should make it very clear that what the left wants is not equality but complete and complete and utter dominion.Though acts of violence were portrayed on both sides, including the brutal killing's of slaves and other brutality, there were other scenes in which even an unarmed white woman was gunned down simply because her brother (Leonard DiCaprio) was a villainous slave owner. Several black movie goers sitting near me giggled and laughed when she was gunned down. I found this extremely disturbing that a film would encourage this type of behavior and result in such joy from blacks in attendance.I'll stick to film work such as Alex Haley's Roots, A Time to Kill, To Kill a Mockingbird, In the Heat of the Night and other great works such as these which encourage an end to oppression and not the reversal of it. Nor do any of these encourage hatred and violence by one group on another.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Almost a Masterpiece!,"This is a typical Tarantino movie. The dialogue is very well written and very entertaining. The characters are brilliant. We have some strong performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Christoph Waltz which deserved his second Oscar. If you are familiar with Tarantino's work, you probably know that there will also be a lot of shootouts. Shootouts very well done by the way, very bloody and gory, but in my opinion this is the weakest part of the movie. The movie was good enough with the characters, dialogue and the landscapes, it didn't need so many guns and explosions, but we have to accept them since this was a tribute brought by Tarantino to the classics ""Spaghetti Westerns"". Overall, this was a good movie. If you like Tarantino's work, then this is a must-see for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Spaghetti Served Piping Hot,"Absolutely crowd pleasing Western (okay, probably a bit too violent for some) but the artistry in mounting this epic that owes a great deal to the Italian Westerns of the 1960's does deliver on that foundational promise of the revenge Western. What elevates Tarantino's homage is the undeniably great performances he has captured from DiCaprio, Foxx, Jackson and most especially Christoph Waltz.Add the spectacular cinematography, costuming, set design and the clever but not overused anachronistic song score all underscore what is inarguably a supremely compelling story punctuated with a dozen or more memorable quotes that should be popular in the pop culture universe. Actually, I may have enjoyed this more than Inglourious Basterds and I have a feeling many others may very well also.May I also add, make the effort to see this in a theater, it is truly a stunning looking film that I feel would be singularly diminished irrespective of how large your flat screen may be.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Off the Chain,"Quentin Tarantino has out-done himself on some of the most violent scenes that I have ever seen on the big screen. This film shouldn't be called Django Unchained; it should have been called Tarantino Unchained. There were times during the film that I just could not watch what was happening. On the other hand there are also some very funny moments; mostly delivered by Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz). As seen in the trailer, the doctor needs help in finding some criminals with a very high price on their heads; however he has never seen them. He enlists Django (Jamie Foxx) to help him hunt these men down and soon fully employs him as a bounty hunter. In exchange, the good doctor will help Django to retrieve his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the mega-plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Running the ""big"" house on Mister Candie's plantation is Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) who is as loyal as they come and disturbingly dedicated to his master. Django is totally transformed from a down-trodden slave to a self-reliant pistol carrying sharp shooter. I also just want to say that there has been so many films where Germans have been portrayed as the ""bad guy"" so it was refreshing to see one that was a good guy. I would be remiss if I did not mention Big Daddy (Don Johnson) who somehow made me think about fried chicken because they dressed him up to look a little bit like Colonel Sanders. The violence in this film is not the only shocking moments; there are some things that are better left not shown (you'll know exactly what I mean once you see the film). It seems like really long movies are starting to become the norm and this film is no exception, although you are so engaged in what is going on in the film that this one did not feel that long. This is a true Tarantino film and you will get exactly what you expect (and then some). In classic Tarantino fashion, he takes you from one extreme (disgust) to the other extreme (laugh out loud funny). This spaghetti western will definitely take you on a roller coaster ride for sure, so buckle up. Even though there were times that I was shaking my head and turning away from the screen, I am going to give this film a green light.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A white liberal's imagining of a black revenge fantasy,"A little bit bloody, but I guess that's just Quentin Tarantino. The film held my interest throughout. Some fine actors did some fine work in this movie, like Jamie Foxx, Bruce Dern, and Samuel L. Jackson. And Leonardo DiCaprio finally looks grown up. I have seen from her television work that Kerry Washington is a fine actress with a lot of range. Very pretty, too. I wasn't familiar with Cristoph Waltz, but his part was very good. Overall the film seems like a white liberal's imagining of a black revenge fantasy. I suppose that there's nothing wrong with that. I enjoyed the film, but I cannot find it to be the masterpiece that some of the commentators seem to think it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"An obnoxious, racist screed of pre-civil war history","Quentin Tarantino needs to undergo some serious rehab before directing another movie. This movie was as racist as it gets with the gratuitous use of the N word and the over-hyped violence of white men torturing and killing black men and black men taking vengeance on white men. Historically, the film is schizophrenic jumping from what appears to be the 1880s in the mountainous West, right down to the costumes and the weapons to the ol' southern plantation life of the pre-civil war twenty five-years earlier. (With shots of hilly California thrown in for good measure.) The only saving grace of this movie is Christoph Waltz as the German bounty hunter and Jamie Foxx looking uncomfortable on horseback. For the life of me, I don't understand what prompted Leon DiCaprio to take part in this fraud.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Probably the best film I've seen in long while,"Every time I see a bad review of this film, they always focus on one thing: The rather liberal use of the n-word throughout the movie. The movie is offensive because of the n-word, they say, as if that alone negates everything that was done well with this movie (and there is a lot done well).Oh look, they use a derogatory term for black people for a movie set in an era where black people were barely considered ""people"" in the first place. Oh look, they use a racist term for a movie set in a time when being a racist was pretty much the norm. The movie is bad for that reason alone...Really?OK, I understand that, as a civilization, we are trying to grow up and move away from prejudice, but to condemn an art piece meant to depict a less-developed time because it clashes with your modern morals is, well, immature. Another thing, you act as if the movie directly insults you. At what point was the movie directing its insults at you? Not only are you offended out of context, it's also misdirected! How self-righteous and immature do you have to be to--- You know what, forget it. It's got nothing to do with the movie so it's not worth getting into.What is worth getting into is why this movie is awesome. Considering this movie pushes the 3 hour mark, I'm amazed that it kept my attention through out the whole thing. That says something for the film because I'm one of those kind of guys who can barely keep focused on anything for more than twenty minutes. But here, I found myself intrigued by every single scene and how the story moved forward. So this movie gets an A from me from storytelling merits alone. Dialogue is balanced with exposition and the script, while shoddy in a few places, works well overall. The narrative is very much character-driven which I think is the film's biggest merit. It doesn't rely on big sets or numerous filler montages. The action scenes are short and brutal. And they should be because there's nothing fancy about the shootouts and these scenes are mostly direct to the point and leave a big impact. This ain't no kung-fu movie. The movie is all about the interaction and conflict if it's rather diverse and talented cast. Speaking of whom...Though I think he's the weakest of the main characters, Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz is still a very notable performance, probably one of the best in Waltz's career. I love the way he serves as the wise mentor figure in the story as well as providing most the comic relief. Schultz's cleverness displayed in the film is fun to watch and lends a certain respect to his character. And though he is played to be lighthearted most of the time, there are instances where we definitely see a hidden depth to Schultz. That said, it's also the character's weakness because, you know this guy has a long and likely very interesting history, and yet very little of that history is explored within the narrative. And that sucks. This guy should have his own movie really.But of course the movie is focused on the title character Django (with a silent D) played by Jamie Foxx. This movie is all about Django coming to his own. Foxx handled that splendidly in my opinion. When we're first introduced to the character as a nervous and broken man who seemed lost in just about any environment, portrayed in a way that, strangely enough, reminded me of Forrest Gump somewhat. But as the story progress, Django matures, learns the ropes, gains confidence in himself, takes more risks, and generally grows from being Schultz's student to equal. Foxx's portrayal of this development is commendable. If you watch just the first and last 15 minutes of the movie, you'd think he was playing two completely different characters. Watching the movie is a whole, the gradual transformation of Django from rookie to pro is amazingly subtle though. Foxx's excellent performance makes sure that Django's development doesn't come off as forced or contrived and is believable throughout.But my favorite character would be, hands down, Calvin Candie played by Leonardo DiCaprio whose performance is, in a word, sublime. Candie simply eats up any scene he's in. Even if you wanted to, you simply cannot deny his presence. And while he starts off as a non-too-serious antagonist when first introduced, we quickly realize that this is a man that one does not want to hang out with on a social basis. But that realization happens without the guy being overly diabolical about it, which lends to the believability of the character. And when Candie eventually does go off the chain he easily becomes the most memorable villain in film history. Much respect to Waltz but how DiCaprio did not get more Best Supporting Role award nominations (especially at the Oscars) is beyond me.I don't have much to say about Samuel L. Jackson's character, Stephen, as he really only serves as a plot point that leads into the climax of the movie. Many people don't like it when you get a big name to play what is essentially a throw-away character. But I'm fine with it. For what little screen time he had, Jackson gave an excellent enough performance to be memorable.So basically, yeah, awesome direction, awesome script, awesome characters played by awesome actors makes for a definite hall-of-famer in my opinion. This film will stay with me for a long time. It's a brutal, bloody, brilliant take on the darker parts of America's history not without its fair share of humor and wit. A must see film for anyone with any measurable appreciation for good cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I Guess I Don't Understand The Star Rating...,"Why isn't this movie in the Top 100? It got an 8.8! I hope this isn't some political correctness bull---t... There has been a lot of press about the 'racist' aspect of this movie. I think most sane people will argue that racism is a bad thing, but there is a subtle difference in a film that is actually racist and a film that is about racism. No one (at least no one with a brain) denies that the slave trade was a dark chapter in this country's past, and this movie acknowledges this fact. Most of the white people in the movie are repulsive characters, and Django is one of the smartest characters in the movie. He seems dumb at first, but that's because he hasn't been taught anything during his life of servitude. The ability to learn is what makes a person smart.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Many lovely details and an outstanding acting disarm the mediocre story,"Here it comes, Quentin Tarantino's new blockbuster and Italo Western homage ""Django Unchained"". Personally, I happen to find Tarantino's movies quite a mixed bag as he has done anything from stupid disaster pieces such as ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" up to very thought out stuff like ""Inglorious Basterds"". His new movie is among the better ones he has released but still not the best.What I immediately liked about the movie is the camera work with many wide angles, natural Stillleben and shots on the eyes of the actors to capture their emotions. If you like directors like Sergio Leone, you will know what I'm talking about and if you happen to like him, you will also adore this movie. The opening scene presenting the cast already gets you into an old school western atmosphere. The amazing soundtrack is another strong point all along this movie. After some very explicit scenes, Tarantinos puts a vivid and catchy track that grabs your attention and makes it easier to digest what you've just seen. Tarantino certainly has a good feeling for impressive settings and gripping atmospheres.He puts a lot of details in his movie once again but only good connoisseurs may detect all of them. In one scene, the new Django Jamie Foxx sits next to a bar and an old guy who spoke Italian asks him his name and how it's spelled. Well, this old guy is Franco Nero who portrayed Django for the very first time and that's what makes this scene so funny as he knows off course how this name is spelled. If you recognize Franco Nero, you will laugh out loud during that scene, anybody who doesn't know him may just find that scene overlong and strange. A similar event happens towards the end when Tarantino appears himself as an actor which is another funny moment.In general, this movie has a lot of humour once again that contrasts the long dialogues as well as the detailed killing scenes. This aspect works very well thanks to the acting of Christoph Waltz who is just amazing and incredibly diversified. He's not as great as in ""Inglorious Basterds"" but comes very close and would deserve one more Academy Award for his acting in my opinion. That being said, the actors simply do an incredible job in this film. Jamie Foxx is a quite diversified character and one really cares about his fate until the end of the movie which is very important. Samuel L. Jackson plays a great villain and does it in a very credible way. Leonardo DiCaprio happens to play in more and more dark and mature films and convinces once again as unpredictable maniac.This being said, everything about this movie seems to be perfect but one very important thing is missing: the story. The movie has no twists or surprises and also includes many lengths after a strong beginning and just before an explosive ending. These lengths include the scenes on the way to Candie Land or several dialogues inside the mansion. These scenes are only saved by the strong acting by Waltz, Jackson and Co. but would ruin a movie if they were done by average actors. This movie would have been much more fluid if it was cut down to two hours of running time. The original Italo Westerns like ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" had better story lines and a few mysterious characters that would only reveal their true intentions in the very end that are missing in this modern adaption.Nevertheless, apart of the story line and the lengths, this movie is a definite must see and lovely done homage to the era of Italo Westerns. Any fan of Tarantino should be satisfied with this flick even if it's not his best and even if there were a couple of better movies than this one in 2012.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Better uses for my time,"I could have...... washed my dirty laundry...... played with my neighbors dog.......brought out my cleats and kicked a ball around.......... but unfortunately I did none of these things and chose to watch ""Django Unchained"" instead.Why people tout this movie as a work of genius is beyond me. A 3 hour long runtime was hardly justified for the material at hand. The story is predictable and the characters (barring Stevens and Calvin) pretentiously self-righteous and boring.While the film did possess panache in delivery, as all Tarantinos do, it lacked a central character and premise strong enough to make it engaging. The intelligent script and characterization that is a hallmark of films such as ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Death Proof"" etc is dampened due to Django's portrayal as a virtual mute with an attitude.Bottom line is, there are a lot of things that you can do in 3 hours, make sure you do them.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

...like the dust I'll rise,"The Tarantino film promised to the world since Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction first caused such a commotion all those years back has arrived.What defines the cinema of Quentin Tarantino, strangely enough, is not - for me, anyway - not so much what goes on on screen, as the feeling you get walking out at the end; you walk tall, you have diamonds on the soles of your shoes, you feel euphoric.This is fun, this is populist, this is a cartoon, this is where a shootout is a Jackson Pollock painted red, this is history, this is fantasy.Django's wife 'princess' Brumhilda (played by Kerry Washington) has her hair up on the sides of her head like Princess Leia in Star Wars; do you remember the thrill of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo disguising themselves as Storm Troopers (""Aren't you a little short for a Storm Trooper?"") and braving the danger of a whole Death Star full of mortal enemies to save the conceited royal damsel in distress? The fantastic moment where Luke gets to say ""I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you!""Django is all about the suspense inherent in a dangerous rescue mission, Leonardo DiCaprio plays our Darth Vader here, a truly frightening slave plantation owner and sadist in a brilliant turn.Han Solo was a bounty hunter and Luke a young knight looking for a quest, this is also a film about a bounty hunter and a knight with a quest: Django's quest is to rescue his wife.In fact, you could say that by focusing the film on chivalry the bag of loot or treasure becomes the damsel (his true love) in distress and our hero can be purified by his violent actions motivated by love rather than damned by violent actions motivated purely by greed.Beneath the swagger Tarantino's narratives are grounded in a fervently moral universe where the evil that men do is, if not punished, condemned.Tarantino's own cameo is one of the funniest I've ever seen - this is mostly because of the explosive punchline - although it is also an amusing Australian accent!Righteous anger, the basic urge to destroy and revolt against injustice.This is a beautifully made film, well-structured, suspenseful, funny, inventive, the world created is seamless, the acting rich, the photography glorious, and the violence is sickening and brutal but justified.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
'DJANGO UNCHAINED' is a kick-ass entertainer!,"DJANGO UNCHAINED (4/5)Please visit - http://iamalekhya.blogspot.com'DJANGO UNCHAINED' is a kick-ass entertainer!Like any other Tarantino film, it has a tinseled appeal and bold sentimentality, embroidered with mind-blowing acts from all its actors.Set in the eighteenth-century era of the Deep South and Old West, the film trails an unbound slave (Jamie Foxx) who treks across the United States with a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) on a task to rescue his wife (Kerry Washington) from a harsh and alluring plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio).Unlike other Tarantino flicks, which are portrayed in chapters, Django Unchained has a linear narrative. It reliably rotates around the two characters, played by Foxx and Waltz, who share practical aims. With a runtime of quarter to three hours, the film could've been a dull watch, but the screenplay is so captivating that never do you comprehend the length. Tarantino gives you one attractive scene after the other, keeping you deeply absorbed in the whole drama. In addition to this, the humor and brazen-faced style is consistently upheld to make the proceedings even more delectable. The writing is immaculate, although, it isn't as shrewd as his preceding film, 'IngloriousBastards'. Each character is sketched so beautifully that it leaves a permanent mark on the audience.There are scenes that make you laugh, like the one where in the middle of chasing Django and Dr. Schultz, the masked goons fight over the silly issue of who made such clumsy masks. In fact, Jamie Foxx's crude style and attitude, while shooting, or horse-riding, or even while just silently looking, are respectfully mirthful every single time. Then there are raw action scenes filled with blood and gore, and some disturbing depictions of slavery prevailing in the region during the era presented. It touches some really sensitive issues of slavery of the dark-skinned, albeit, upholding the playful flavor of the film. Everything, right from the sets, to the costumes and dialogues seems absolutely authentic.Now coming to the performances, since it's a Tarantino film, it goes without saying that the performances are impeccable. Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel Jackson, Kerry Washington and others are totally apt. But it's Christoph Waltz who shines the brightest. His demeanor is truly magnetic and dialogues, delightfully written as well as delivered. He truly deserves the Oscar he was awarded with.Tout ensemble, Django Unchained is wildly extravagant, ferociously violent and outrageously entertaining. Those who hate blood gore and action might not relish it, but a ""Must Watch"" for all Tarantino fans! Rating: 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
What can I say? I love Quentin Tarantino and I love this movie!,"What can I say? I love Quentin Tarantino and I love this movie. It is very funny, very exciting, very shocking and very thought provoking. It is has a great script, is incredibly well acted, and it goes without saying the direction and cinematography are outstanding. Set in 1850, this 'Black Western', is the story of a German bounty hunter, who helps a freed slave to rescue his wife from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner. In his typical, Tarantino-esque way, the master film-maker amuses us with his dark, blood-curdling humour. In graphic detail, he reveals to us the horrendous barbaric cruelty of the darkest times in American history – the slave era.Particularly noteworthy were the performances of Jamie Foxx in the lead role, Christoph Waltz as the German bounty hunter, Leonardo DiCaprio in a spellbinding performance as the brutal plantation owner, (his best cinematic performance up to that point by a million miles), and Samuel L Jackson in an outrageous over the top 'Uncle Tom' performance as Stephen - Di Caprio's faithful slave-servant. A host of brilliantly played cameo roles also added to the overall quality of this 'must see' movie.I'm not claiming this is Tarantino's best movie- Pulp fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill 1 take a lot of beating. But none of those excellent, ground-breaking movies received any Oscars, so why indeed should Django Unchained? Frankly, I can't answer that, except to state the obvious – Tarantino has never been accepted by the Hollywood community as one of their own – in spite of his movies' universal popularity and wide critical acclaim. Was it ever thus? To this reviewer, he is right up there with the best. Go and see it and be entertained, be shocked and see something that might shake you out of your lethargy. Even if you hate it, you cannot fail to be moved and provoked by it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Original and fun,"I enjoyed this movie, although I don't really know why.It is ridiculously violent, downright cheesy, corny and melodramatic, rather artificial and unrealistic, occasionally aimless, overly complicated.However, it is quite original and certainly fun to watch. Tarantino delights in showing moviegoers bold, shocking characters and images . Many of them are cliché but at the same time they are strangely original and seductive, and not cliché at all. Vampire aliens and Nazis have served as the villains in his past movies; now it is the turn of slave owners and traders, and their redneck yahoo workers.In the ""horrors of slavery"", Tarantino has found a juicy historical scab to pick, and he works at it for over two and a half hours. He shows us things about the South that probably never happened, but that we think must have happened. This movie made me wonder why we don't see more movies about what slavery was really like (not just in the South, but everywhere).Some of the characters are memorable and the performances truly excellent: Christoph Waltz and Samuel Jackson in particular have created astonishing, powerfully evocative characters that will be hard to forget. Glorious bastards.However, the scene with Tarantino and the men with Australian accents didn't work for me at all. It was like the movie had stopped and we were now watching a skit or rehearsal.And go see this movie if you're ready to go through the psychological experiment of seeing what happens to your understanding of the N-word after you hear it repeated 5,000 times (in 160 minutes).It's a strange thing that the Dutch film distributors chose to allow the N-word to be translated as ""neger"" in the Dutch subtitles, which is roughly the equivalent of ""negro"". For English speakers, imagine if ""negro"" had been used 5,000 times in this movie instead of ""n*gger"". No, I think the right Dutch translation would have been ""nikker"". They chose to bowdlerize the translation.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino being Tarantino,"Django Unchained is a bit of a conundrum, largely in part due to it's creator Quentin Tarantino. I have had long love/hate relationship with his movies. When he debuted in 90's with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction I rode shotgun on the Tarantino bandwagon, but as time wore on and more and more of his personality came to light I started to sour. Tarantino strikes me as that kid in middle school that got crammed in a trashcan and rolled down the hill and who was rejected by cheerleaders in high school. He has spent the rest of his life trying to prove to all of us that he really is cool. That desperation for hipness bleeds through in everything he makes. This is not to say he is without talent because he does have a sharp eye and a feel for jaunty banter. He also has a encyclopedic knowledge of film history and flair for homage. That can be double edge sword though, what differentiates insightful reference and a lack of his own voice?That brings us back to Django Unchained which is Tarantino's spin on spaghetti westerns. It's Tarantino through and through. From soundtrack to visuals it all screams ""LOOK HOW COOL I AM!"" and occasionally it's right. There are scenes that feature genuine humor and visual flash as well as some solid performances in particular from Sam Jackson, who steals all of his scenes. All of this is smothered in Tarantino juice and there's the rub. If you love him you'll the love movie but if you think he's a pretentious douche bag this movie won't change your opinion. So many of his conceits took me right out of the movie from his typical ""hip"" soundtrack to Jamie Foxx's sunglasses.Django Unchained like most of Tarantino's movies is unapologetic in it's violence and often wanders the gray wastes of where just tasteless ends and where offensive begins. One has to question if he makes these forays for anything other then shock value. Despite all of Tarantino's efforts, he doesn't quite drive me away. Beneath it all Django Unchained is a serviceable revenge tale with several water cooler moments but beyond that? ... More shock then awe.... and this has been The Mack Minute.

"Drag On, Django!","This film is not recommended.The D is silent in Quentino Tarantino's blood-soaked film, Django Unchained, and so will you be, sitting there in the movie theater watching endless scenes of carnage and slaughter that co-mingles with the blaxploitation genre in this revisionist Western tale of revenge.  At the core of all this bloodshed and violence are the historic issues of slavery and racism, but Tarantino uses a spaghetti western format to hone in on his underlying message. Racial stereotypes, offensive white characters, and ethnic slurs abound. But so does action and dark humor, minus the wit, in this brutal parody of the Old West.Django Unchained is essentially a tale of vengeance and black empowerment, told by the talented Tarantino. But with all his Black Like Me posturing,  the director takes over the role of the angry white man speaking for the entire African-American race. It all seems a bit ludicrous and egotistical to lessen the horror of racism as a vehicle for pop entertainment. That said, Django Unchained is an extremely well-made film worthy of the attention from the more seriously-minded faction of adult film-goers, but its outlandish plot and excessive treatment of violence kept the movie too absurd for me to truly appreciate. ( I may come off as self-righteous but I do tend to over-react and worry when the abhorrent subject of slavery parades itself as pop entertainment for a younger generation, muddying the historical content to become a pale substitute for their only possible history lesson on that issue.  Fiction can so willingly become fact these days. I also question the R-rating slapped onto this blood-fest when a NC-17 rating is more befitting, with all the endless shootings, stabbings, and bludgeoning going on under the guise of vigilante justice in this film. )After an hour's worth of slow-moving episodic detours and sub-plots involving repetitive shoot-em-ups, the film finally settles down to its main storyline, which is at least compelling:  A slave, Django ( Jamie Foxx ), searches for his wife, Broomhilda ( Kerry Washington ) who is now the property of an wealthy plantation owner, Calvin Candies ( Leonardo DiCaprio ). On his journey for salvation, Django befriends a bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz ( Christoph Waltz ), and both continue on their rescue mission to Candyland ( the plantation's ironic name ).Now Tarantino has used this same set-up before in his previous films, a series of misadventures until the final climactic shoot-out takes place. It's his calling card. His solid filmmaking techniques and edgy style stays evident throughout his lengthy film. So does his gift for well-written conversations and flamboyant characters.  But his screenplay needs more reworking to streamlining his film's potent message and there is in dire need of eliminating unnecessary complications within its plot structure.Beside his ever-present trademark non-stop gratuitous violence, Tarantino's anachronistic blending of pop, hip-hop and rap songs, along with modern sounding jargon, sharply contrasts the visual images on display with mixed results. He overdoes the pop culture references this time around. The excessive use of the N-word ( estimated usage: nearly 100 times, without exaggeration ) seems to be here more for its shock value purposes that authenticity and richness in dialog.Where the director / writer achieves success is in his wisely assembled ensemble of actors for their overly ripe roles.  Waltz brings to his role a commanding presence and larger-than-life bravado. Washington creates a gripping portrait of a woman caught in a desperate struggle for freedom.  Also on hand in a small supporting role is a Tarantino favorite, Samuel L. Jackson, giving another ballsy performance as a morally corrupt man servant.  However, it is the film's evil villain that makes Django Unchained break free of its caricatural qualities. As Calvin Candies ( a.k.a. Simon LaGree channeling Snidely Whiplash ), DiCaprio is a guilty pleasure. The actor puts his underused comic talents to good service and astutely navigates a difficult role to great acclaim, creating such an indelible reprehensible scoundrel.  Yet, what throws the film slightly off-balance is Foxx in the title role.  The actor looks the part, but, strangely, seems too reserved and solemn for this empowered hero. Foxx does little to circumvent the subtle demands of this complex character.  He becomes a stock character, The Man with No Game.The film rambles on, with too many side stories that do little to advance the action. More judicious editing is needed which would also help pick up the film's lackadaisical pacing. As the case with most Tarantino films, scenes go on far too long to build tension that has already been established.  Humor seems sparse or sophomoric as set pieces drone on with no real purpose.Django Unchained is a live-action cartoon with an adult perceptiveness. Tarantino's films always have a divisive effect and this latest venture is no different. His re-boot of the Western for today's movie-going audiences will thrill only his die-hard fans and alienate others. Yes, dear moviegoers, there is plenty of red for your hard-earned green this holiday season, and its name is Django Unchained.  And, yes, while the D may remain silent, it can also stands for disappointing as well. GRADE: C+Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: Be forewarned, moviegoers: This film is one of the most violent film in recent memory. Lately, with all of the senseless murders and on-going anarchy happening in America, this film could easily become the poster child for the N.R.A. and its recent stance against gun control and Hollywood filmmakers in general.  Tarantino may not want his film to be seen in this light, but this film ( and many of his other movies ) could become a painted target for the Conservative Right mentality and close-minded gun enthusiasts with which to take aim.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino's best movie. Foxx and Dicaprio are great in this. A few cringe worthy scenes but I highly recommend. I say A-.,"""You want to save your wife by doing what I do? This is what I do, I kill people and sell their corpses for cash."" Django (Foxx) is a slave being moved to a new plantation when dentist/bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz finds him and frees him needing his help on a bounty. After getting to know each other they strike up a deal, work together for the winter making enough money so they can buy and free Django's wife from her owner. I will start by saying that I have thought Tarantino's movies are good but I am not a huge fan. Unlike most I think Reservoir Dogs is his best, not Pulp Fiction but overall I think he is a little overrated. I was looking forward to seeing this one mainly because of Jamie Foxx. About halfway in I started to change my opinion. This is far and away Tarantino's best movie. The writing is fantastic and the style is defiantly him with a few cringe worthy moments but this is a movie that I really enjoyed and I highly recommend. Foxx is great in this and DiCaprio plays such a good bad guy that he should get more roles like this. The only bad thing I have to say about this is that it is a little long, but it does hold your attention for the most part and this is one of the best movies of the year.

With all the famous actors, action, drama, costumes and laughter, Django is just the movie you'd want to sit down and watch with your mates, on a Friday night. 'Django unchained' not only highlights the way olden day fashion used to work, but also looks deep into discrimination and racism, teaching an audience slyly about the past. Most of all, point must be awarded for the fight scenes in 'Django', right from the start we witness violence, and we ride side by side with Jamie Fox whilst his character Django becomes more confident and skilled at, killing.

Review,"The whole plot of the movie is based in vengeance, something that every lover of the Tarantino's movies should be aware of. First spaghetti-western of the director, Django (Jamie Foxx) brings us back to the very beginning of the American Civil War, the place Django, lead character, seeks for his wife. Django is helped by a bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), in exchange Django must help Dr. Schultz to track down three man.The quest for his wife leads them to Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man buried in prejudice. Calvin owns Django's wife and will not just let her go.The movie is full of pop music like Quentin Tarantino usually put in all of his movie. What reproduces a lot of critics is the use of racist language like ""Nigger"" and the violence, but the movie just tries to bring some reality of that time and this fact is exaggerated in the movie and make a zoom effect. In fact, the movie is not about violence and racism, but a love story about a man seeking for his wife.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Django Unchained,"*Review Contains Spoilers*PLOT: A bounty hunter and former dentist Dr. King Shultz frees a slave named Django Freeman to get his help in finding the Brittle Brothers. Soon after killing them though, Shultz and Freeman plan on freeing Django's wife, Broomhilda from the Candyland plantation owner Calvin Candie.MY THOUGHTS: Quentin Tarantino has done it again. I find the more and more movies he makes, the better and better they become. This movie was truly amazing. Very unique idea which was brought out and shot wonderfully. The action was amazing and the characters were very interesting. It had a perfect mix of action, comedy, romance, and seriousness. Christoph Waltz has yet another amazing performance as Shultz and Leonardo Dicaprio as Candie was also very threatening and well done.PROS/CONS: The action was amazing and being that it is a Tarantino movie, very blood-soaked. But it did of course fit the picture. Its been a while since there was a very good western and this film hit it right on the head. Christoph Waltz and Leonardo Dicaprio are by far the two best actors in this movie and you can't take your eyes off them when they are in there scenes. The film pulls no punches either by killing both Candie and Shultz at the end. Like an eye for an eye and I found it very exciting. Some people complain about the gore and language, but honestly it doesn't bother me. If you are paying to see a movie like that, that sort of thing shouldn't surprise you.OVERALL: 10/10 *MUST SEE*",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Subpar Tarantino but Waltz and Washington shine!,"There's been no film more divisive or more igniting in terms of strong Oscar speculation then Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. After months of shooting, word of a last minute edit (some believe editing is still going on currently), the film has finally hit cinematic eyes and the ""final"" product is both bold and misguided. Django Unchained is big and full of Tarantino life and color that we've come to love about him. On sheer production value, it's his finest film endeavor to date. Set designs are simply gorgeous, Robert Richardson captures some beautiful shots, and Sharen Davis proves once again, she's one of the most awe- inspiring designers working today. Tarantino does go a bit ""out there"" in his choices of dialogue along with the developing and rising structure of the story. Where Tarantino succeeds is in digging some terrific performances out of his principal cast, even if his film is at times lunky, problematic, and a bit messy.In the opening title sequence, Tarantino uses one of the best film theme songs this century and setting up ""Django"" for an audacious roller coaster ride. The film tells the story of Django (Jamie Foxx) who with the help of his mentor Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) becomes a bounty hunter in the 1800s and sets out to save his slave wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of an evil plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).Anyone who knows my cinematic mind, knows my feelings about Jamie Foxx and his abilities as an actor. For the most part of his career, I've found him immensely overrated, though excels quite well in comedic driven vehicles. As the uneducated yet craftly-minded Django, Foxx does one of his finest works. As satisfactory as Foxx is and given the nature in which the character is written, he gives Django a needed sensitivity that lacks in this grotesquely violent portrait. This isn't to say Foxx doesn't fault. His interpretation of Django at the beginning of our tale, fresh off the slavery line and later becoming an A-list free bounty hunter is not entirely on point. Not always being believable, at least in drama, is Foxx's major flaw. Where he'll start by burying himself into a character, by the end of the three-hour finale, Foxx's natural and Foxx-mannerisms reveal themselves in an awkward fashion.When Christoph Waltz came into our lives as Hans Landa in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (2009), many cinematic-lovers thought their lives would never be the same. Waltz's ticks, evil grin, and astounding portrayal went on to win, very deserving, the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. As Dr. King Schultz, Waltz recaptures much of that magic and demonstrates once again, he is one of the most talented actors to grace our land in quite sometime. What Waltz demonstrates so brilliantly is how he can both inhabit the soul of a man with no remorse or fear to take life yet have this potent and clear sensitivity for humanity. A divine interpretation. Waltz is fearless, becoming a man with no obvious background, and building one of the finest portrayals by an actor this year. Simply superb.In a near-mute performance, Kerry Washington, and make no mistake, is absolutely magnetic and steals focus from every single actor in every single frame. As Broomhilda Von Shaft, Washington delivers a performance reminiscent of Holly Hunter's Ada McGrath in Jane Campion's The Piano (1993), a turn Oscar recognized and is equal in talent and execution. Besides the obvious beauty Washington naturally exhibits, her heartbreaking and bravura work stands at the top of anything she's delivered in her respectable career. Though the work is brief, and in many ways a background ornament that some might miss, without it, the film and the fable would feel simply meaningless. Washington is purely fantastic.As the flamboyant and wicked Calvin Candie, Leonardo DiCaprio steps out of his usual comfort zone and is as charismatic as I've ever seen him. When Calvin is on an even keel, telling a story, and simply on his lower register, DiCaprio excels. It's when the work hits the high notes, over-the-top anger or forced fuming yells, it can often feel stale in its execution. One thing I've noticed is that Tarantino attempts to give DiCaprio, and the character Candie, instances of an ""evil monologue,"" where the audience can find the brutality of his motivation spelled out on the screen for all to see. Tarantino attempted this in past films like Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004) with David Carradine in the scene with the Bride and B.B. and the infamous story about the fishbowl. In most Tarantino films, this tactic works. In the newest effort, it doesn't come off as a natural disposition and simply out of character. The only conclusion I can come up with his either Tarantino doesn't fully understand his characters and/or their motivations, although he did create them, or simply the editing and the timeline didn't give him enough time to fully develop Django Unchained into the story he envisioned. With all this said, DiCaprio is still memorable and should be worth the conversation of any awards body.As the grumpy and vulgar Stephen, Samuel L. Jackson delivers his best work in years, reminding audiences that when teamed up with Quentin Tarantino, Jackson can stand next to any other actor working in the business. One of Tarantino's successes in the screenplay is the creation of Stephen, a head of house slave for Candie. Jackson is the comedic backbone of the film and steals focus from many of its performers including DiCaprio and Waltz. Also making a brief but memorable turn is the talented Don Johnson as Big Daddy Bennett, a slave owner that moonlights as something even more offensive. Making a cameo, Jonah Hill makes his mark and makes it well...Read the rest at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Fine Art of Plagiarism,"www.eattheblinds.comThe last time I spent Xmas Day with Quentin Tarantino was in 1997. On that day, Jackie Brown and QT's shout outs to 70s Blaxploitation made my holidays worthy of celebration. From the good (White Dog), to the bad (Mean Johnny Barrows), to the flat out nasty (Maniac), B-movies have remained my greasy burger cure for Hollywood hangovers and nobody understands this craving better than Tarantino.Because of Death Proof, I marked 2007 as the end of Tarantino's short, but impressive career. Inglourious Basterds made me realize my prediction was a tad premature and last night's Xmas screening of Django Unchained had me swallowing my half-eaten words. In short, props are due: Quentin Tarantino -- the fast-food auteur -- is back on the map. What's also back is his talent for turning plagiarism into art and elevating the B-movie into art house splendor. Derivative yes, but this is a special talent no other rip-off artist has done as exceptionally well as QT. Tarantino doesn't merely copy, he cuts and pastes, and if plagiarism is art, Django Unchained is 2 hours and 46 minutes of glorious B-movie cinema spooning.While Django Unchained is a Runaway Slave flick bacon-wrapped with Spaghetti Western sauce and splattered with 'Argento Red' buckets of blood, it's also a monument of empowerment for a no-bullshit Hero who happens to be Black and proud. Despite refusing to watch DU, Spike Lee argues Tarantino is trivializing Slavery, an argument ignorantly reminiscent of the Catholic Church's attempt to smear Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ. The fact is, Tarantino's portrayal of slavery (and white supremacy) is contemptuous. Over and over, Tarantino exposes viewers to the viciousness, brutality, and ugliness of slavery and the racists responsible for it. He then ridicules these racists before he sends them all to hell at the hands of a true (Black) Hero.There really is only one thing to hate about this film and it comes in the form of a self- indulgent Director's cameo. Distracting beyond words, the scene is fortunately short lived and tactfully punctuated by Tarantino having himself blown to smithereens. Nitpicks aside, Django Unchained is steeped in so much of the 70s it looks, sounds and feels like golden age deja vu. With deserving cameos from Franco Nero (the original Django) and Bruce Dern, to the countless flashbacks recalling Peckinpah, George Roy Hill, Jeremiah Johnson, and volumes of others, Django Unchained is a cinematic standout in a digital age gone wrong. Do yourself a favor this holiday season and go see a brand-new Classic...on film (if you can).",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Again: what is happening to the great American directors?,"Normally I wouldn't bother commenting such an awful movie or even watching it to the end. But this after all was the great Tarantino, who directed some of the most brilliant movies in the last 20 years or so and invented a style of his own, so I soldiered on and hoped to be surprised. In the end, I felt more than disappointed, I felt embarrassed for him. This is not the meta-trash he specializes in, this is just pure unadultered trash: no intelligence, no originality, no irony, no second layer of meaning, no redeeming grace. It is badly written, badly directed, badly shot, badly cut. The actors - with the notable exception of Cristoph Walz - are laughable. This is the gory mush a dumb semi-illiterate teenager would produce if you gave him a few million dollars and told him: go write and direct a movie.So I must repeat the question that has been daunting me since Poseidon by Riddley Scott and Black Horse by Spielberg: what is happening to the great Hollywood directors?

One hell of a movie,"Django Unchained is a typical Quentin Tarantino movie. Bloddshed, conversation, acting whatever you expect from Tarantino everything at his best. The movie has all the ingredients to make it a big hit. The star cast especially is simply at his best. Leonardo Dicarpio, Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz where at their best. I loved it. Some of the scenes especially the Lunch room scene was awesome. A must watch for Tarantino fans.Leonardo Dicarpio and Samuel L Jackson has taken up different characters in this movie. I liked the characters especially that of Chrisrtolph Waltz, he was just too good. Another Oscar on cards for him. We cannot leave out Kerry Washington as well. She was beautiful in this movie and as acted very well. Jamie Foxx has made justification to his character. I liked the parts when helping Christolph Waltz as a Bounty Hunter.Quentin Tarantino was quite clear in what he wanted to deliver. The script was simple but the screenplay was awesome. The background song by Franco Migliacci in this movie is also very good. Tarantino is getting good with each and every movie. This probably is his master piece till now.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An entirely satisfying and quintessentially Tarantino film,"In this his seventh feature film, Quentin Tarantino has made it very clear what he's all about. The auteur's hallmarks litter the frames of ""Django Unchained,"" the closest he's come to making a film in the style of his favorite genre (arguably, but it's not really a contest) — the Spaghetti Western.Watching ""Django,"" it's clear how comfortable Tarantino is behind the camera in this Southern-set Western environment and with the characters he has created/molded based on his many influences. It would be a surprise to learn that this film was anything but one of the easiest filmmaking experiences of his career from a creative standpoint. He's a master of genre filmmaking, of giving his audience exactly what it wants (and at this point his fans exactly what they expect), and ""Django"" is consequently a breeze to watch.Jamie Foxx plays the titular hero, a slave who in the film's opening is purchased somewhat violently by the German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). The two strike a deal that if Django helps him track down and secure the bounty of three men whom only he can identify, Schultz will not only give him a cut, but help him find and rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). In the process, Schultz trains Django to be a good shot and a quick draw.It's Schultz who dictates pace and tone of the first half of the film, however, not Django. Just as he did for Tarantino in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Waltz dominates every scene he's in during this first act, dancing loquacious circles around all the other actors and using his charm and wit to turn the tension and conflict into putty. He's not as impressive as he was in that Oscar- winning role, but that could easily be attributed to the fact that his character is a good guy, not malevolence in its purest form.Django as a character comes into his own in the final act of the film when all the cards are on the table, or as would be more appropriate to say in a Tarantino film, the you-know-what hits the fan. That's not even a semi-spoiler, by the way, because it's Tarantino's M.O. — you know not to panic if you're over two hours in and there hasn't been all that much bloodshed.Anyway, Foxx thrives when Django is finally ""unchained,"" but he's written rather curiously until then. His motives are simple enough (love and vengeance) and being a former slave the sympathy card is in play from the first shot of the film, but he's not written to be the most likable of heroes. He's a quiet partner for much of the movie who begins to slowly speak up more, and the things he has to say are brash and frankly a bit cocky. It's clear he'd rather start shooting sooner than talk, which will make you antsy up until the trigger gets pulled, in both a good and bad way.Tarantino doesn't wield as much suspense in ""Django"" as in other films. The stakes were so much higher in ""Basterds,"" for example, perhaps due to the wartime, undercover nature of the plot and the involvement of Nazis. This made his lengthy scenes and fluffy dialogue keep you even more on edge, which happens in Django but not with the same sense of urgency. Instead there's a lot of racial tension, and while that adds an interesting side commentary, it doesn't have any bearing on how the events will ultimately unfold.""Django"" is also much more predictable than Tarantino's pervious films, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. None of the turns of events will be shocking, especially if you've ever seen a Tarantino film before. A lack of surprises always lessens the impact of a film, but there's a certain comfort and pleasure in knowing what's around the corner, because the result is absolutely satisfying.The biggest wildcard of the bunch is Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie, the Mississippi plantation owner who Django and Schultz discover owns Broomhilda. Not appearing until late in the film, we don't get to spend much time getting to know his character, so when he flips a switch it comes with a significant impact on the tone and the flow of the film.Still, there's not enough depth there for Candie to be a true villain, just a colorful one. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific as his housekeeper, Stephen, as well, but his and Candie's character arcs are disappointingly short. While Django is always motivated by Broomhilda from the start, there's no antagonistic thread that runs from beginning to end to make the payoff more than just carnally satisfying.As a piece of entertainment, if you're a fan of genre films, straightforward revenge-based premises or Tarantino, ""Django Unchained"" is nothing to complain about. It's expertly filmed, cleverly written, gloriously violent, funny and wholly satisfying. As obvious as it is in its methods from time to time, it never loses its stylistic edge and never falters in the mechanics of good storytelling. Tarantino is capable of being more clever as a writer and more dynamic as a director, but he puts all his best skills to use in ""Django"" and it doesn't disappoint.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Like nothing i have ever seen,"Been using IMDb for years without the slightest inclination to spend the time registering until tonight.Never got Tarantino to be honest, always found his films hammy and definitely in the ""not my cup of tea"" bracket. As a rule i usually give his movies a wide berth. Django Unchained was no different till tonight and only ended up watching as my friend has been constantly badgering me to to do so.Where do i start, well i was hooked within the first 5 minutes and at regular intervals through the film i checked how long was left as i never wanted it to end, a sure sign that a film has me gripped.Yeh it was hammy and way over the top but it worked beautifully and i found myself in stitches at times, loved all the characters especially Django and Dr Shultz who were perfect as the unlikely buddies.Thankyou Mr Tarantino for giving me the best movie experience of my life.Massive 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
There's Nothing Like It...Except,"The only thing that you can compare this Movie to is another Tarantino. That is what makes his releases so anticipated. Love them or hate them they are singular. He is his own contemporary. It might be noticed that many of the criticisms for this one are...""it is just more of that Tarantino stuff...haven't you done this before"".Well, of course he has. He likes it. So do Audiences and Critics. So why not? He is still young and will most likely do more, extend himself, and try new ways. But why now when he is having so much success at entertaining himself as well as many others.Once again, there isn't anything remotely like Django Unchained, except maybe his own Inglorious Basterds (2009). It has its ""roots"" in the Spaghetti Western, somewhat in Blaxploitation, but mostly its a satire on the modern mindset, still in existence, of the inferiority of lesser Races with genetic deficiencies. Because that's the way God intended. The most telling of all the anti-White scenes is at the Candyland table and the ""Scientific"" explanation of why the Slaves don't unchain themselves and fight back against their oppressors (it's in their physiology).This is a feverish foray into that fight back Fantasyland for shackled people everywhere. A wish fulfillment of revenge without remorse and hatred for those who hated and abused. It is a sometimes funny and a slightly poetic display of modern Pulp Fiction with excessive violence. But for those commenting about the ultra-violent and bloody display, they might think about how ultra-violent and bloody it must have been to really be under the yoke of what is being riffed here.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Funny, Yet Uber Violent and Crude","""The D is silent!"" a quote that made so many people laugh and applaud. It's Robbie K again, this time reviewing Quentin Tarantino's latest film Django Unchained. The plot for this film is about a slave named Django(Jamie Foxx) who is rescued by a German bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz(Christoph Waltz). Apparently Django is one of the few men in Texas who knows the identity of a band of outlaws named the Brittle brothers. As payment for helping him, Schultz promises to track down Django's wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington) who is currently owned by a chauvinistic plantation owner named Calvin Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio).If you've seen Tarantino's work, you know that the man is very extreme in his movies and makes no attempts to censor his work. Django Unchained follows the same path, which for some will be enjoyable for some and rather grotesque for other. From the very beginning, Django starts off with blood as gun shots paint a messy shower of red. Yet the madness has only begun, as Shultz takes Django under his wing and helps him develop the killers edge needed to be a bounty hunter. As Django evolves, so too do the kills as the dynamic duo updates not only their arsenal, but techniques as well. The end result of this training are numerous scenes of gun blazing goodness, usually resulting in some sweet kills and bloody bodies. Are you sickened by the description? If so, then skip this movie as the cinematography captures enough detail to make some stomachs turn. Head shots, knees exploding, and a shots in the neck are common scenes in this movie. Some of these kills are not quick though, and the poor victims who suffer usually have some ugly wounds associated with them, some of which involve a person being torn apart or tortured. For me extreme gore isn't my cup of tea, as violence doesn't always have to mean a river of blood to follow.Despite the messiness though, Tarantino does still provide some other entertaining qualities that somewhat made up for the weaknesses. His choice of actors was well selected as both Foxx and Waltz work well together as the bounty hunter duo, each balancing out the other's character weaknesses. Waltz in particular uses his charm to not only swoon the various extras, but also as a tool to make his lines even funnier as he adds a pompous atmosphere to the conversation. Foxx on the other hand sticks more to the rough necked outlaw motif, saying little to his victims before firing the shot, though the little he says is more than enough to get a few chuckles out of the cast. Washington is just as lovely as ever, but doesn't get to do much other than scream and cry. While she can play a damsel in distress very well, this character was a little lacking compared to some of her other work. As for Jackson, his character is both fun and malicious. Jackson's overacted rants and cascade of stereotypical insults were hilarious to me for the most part, yet his character too sometimes overstepped the appropriate boundaries. As for DiCaprio, well the man is still on top of his game. Stepping out of the somber detective role, Leo's portrayal of the pompous plantation owner is incredibly captured in every detail from the rich debonair look to the heavy southern accent. The strongest aspect to his character is the viciousness he has to develop throughout the course of the movie, which starts with simple enjoyment at a blood sport, but turns into an anger that can't be controlled.Yet like many movies, Django does have its faults. For one thing the editing and filming require a little more polish to meet the qualities of his other films. Various settings don't match up with the areas they are supposed to be in, for example a rocky outcropping in the state of Tennessee, or a dried up wasteland for Mississippi. The grainy nature of the film is also a little harder to enjoy, though it may have been used to help develop and depth to the Western world. Pushing past the editing, the time limit of the movie was a little hard to deal with at times. While the pace of the movie was rather quick for the most part, there were a few times where I felt the scenes were pointless or overdone. The end of the movie in particular could have been modified to deliver the same entertainment in a fraction of the time. What may have contributed to some of these ""slower"" parts was the episodic element this tale seemed to have. Instead of having a nice linear plot with twists and turns, Tarantino sort of divided the story into 3-4 tales some of which lasted for minutes before the plot was just dropped. Perhaps it was just a means for introducing more satire and laughs, or just another excuse to add more gore, but some of these short stories could have been replaced with something to make the story deeper. Yet my biggest weakness was the uber amount of crudeness, Tarantino put in this film. I know that he designs this movie without a care to criticism, but his rebellious nature was a little out of hand this time. In particular the bloody savageness and filthy language were excessively overused to the point where it was no longer enjoyable, but annoying, despite the cultural relevance to the time period being portrayed.Django was a fun movie to watch, but it still has some flaws that need to be tweaked. Perhaps when the movie comes out on DVD the editing can hammer some things out. While it is not his best work, it's still enjoyable and will please any fan of his work. Just make sure to exercise caution when planning to take younger audience members to see it, as the crudeness factor has stepped up a bit.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
What was this movie about?,"If you have nothing better to do with two and a half hours of your time, and ten dollars to blow, then watching this movie might suit your purposes.Witty dialog doth not a movie make.

But I can hardly remember having watched it.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
I Look Forward To A Proper Edit of this Film,The truly breathtaking aspect of Quentin Tarantino's film-making is his use of music even if comes from a different time than the diagesis on screen.I got chills watching 'Django' in the scene where Jim Croce's 'I Got A Name' played whilst the title character and his German bounty hunter compatriot Dr. Schultz (Christoph Walz) ride off against backdrop of a rugged western landscape.A truly frustrating aspect of Quentin Tarantino's film-making is his apparent resistance to cutting the footage he shoots. 'Django' is at least 30 minutes too long - a time elongated with pointless cameos of terrific actors recognizable to 1980s TV aficionados and fans of Grindhouse productions. There are enough character actors to fill three movies but too many for one.Tarantino gave himself a speaking role (Always a mistake) and inexplicably did the worst attempt at an Australian accent ever. There was no need for that and no need in fact for sizable chunks of the movie that he nevertheless chose to include.Some will take issue with the numerous glaring anachronisms. I don't mind those so much particularly given the tone in which the diagesis is presented which evokes European-made westerns of the 1960s. Scenes that go nowhere fast and utterly baffling pacing are things I take issue with however.A complete re-edit would serve to present the essence of the story more efficiently whilst emphasizing more appealing aspects. It would also serve more efficiently hide flaws. Some of Tarantino's best work is buried within some of his worst.Stylistically the reaction shots evoke Bogdanovich but in a good way. The violence evokes Peckinpah as do the blood spatters and moments of emotional havoc.,,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best!,"One of if not THE best movie I have ever seen. Not only is the scene throughout the movie very well presented but so is the fabulous acting. All the roles were played GREATLY. Leonardo Di'Caprio is not bad at being the bad guy, but I am just too used to him being the good guy :\. Christopher Waltz was my favorite. Jamie Foxx did well too. I think that this was a well thought out movie. The reason I gave it a 8/10 instead of a 10/10 is because it was lengthy. Which isn't bad but I personally can get impatient and there were parts of the movie I thought it would end but then the twist just went on. Also some of the no-aim shooting was a ""bit"" unrealistic.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Greatest Historical Movie of ALL TIME,"Django Unchained, directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a story of a free slave transforming to a bounty hunter. Django, played by Jamie Foxx, and bounty hunter friend, Dr. Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz, go on a mission to free his wife, Broomhilda. A mix of comedy, action, and a history lesson make this a great movie which is supported by an all star cast. I believe that with the help of incredible acting, from the likes of Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, and Leonardo DiCaprio, Django Unchained is the most profane, yet informative movies of the century.
The movie Django Unchained is full of profanity, incest, and nudity. The n word alone is said at least once every minute, as everyone uses the n word being that the setting of the movie was a different time. When reaching Candie Land, we figure out that Calvin Candie's wife is actually his sister. This is because of the movies southern incest roots as Candie Land is based in New Orleans. Incest was never right I believe, but the inclusion of this topic was genius by Tarantino as it gives the watchers a basis of the setting. Candie, one of the biggest plantation owners in the Django Unchained universe, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. There are also multiple instances in this movie where there is nudity. The viewer cannot see any profane body parts, Tarantino directed the actors to cover up in the movie to a certain degree, but the inclusion of nudity portrays how harshly slaves were treated in the south. One scene illustrates what slave owners did to their slaves when they tried to run away; Candie put Broomhilda in a hot metal casket shaped box outside as she laid there naked. The viewer can see the fear in Hildi's eyes as the white men pull her out of her metal box. The movie was not only full profanity, but there were also multiple instances where the violence in this movie may be too much for the faint hearted.
Django Unchained is so violent that from the violence alone, it could be rated R. A scene I want to highlight as violent comes from the beginning of the movie when Dr. King Schultz frees Django. Dr. Schultz was on a mission to find Django and get his help for a hunt on three brothers with a big bounty on their heads. But first, Dr. Schultz encountered a couple of white men who were transporting the slaves including Django. He first encountered them nicely, but when the white men did not want to comply with his terms, he shot and killed one and let the other bleed out. Christoph Waltz portrays the character of Dr. Schultz perfectly at this moment as he is nonchalant about killing these men as if he kills for a living. This sets up the story of Schultz being a bounty hunter and is a perfect transition into the story of Django and Dr. King. Another scene I would like to shine light upon is when Django is at Candie Land. We are introduced to the idea of Mandingo fighting. We see that a Mandingo fighter is trying to run away from Candie Land saying that he can not fight no more. Candie then sends the dogs at him and the dogs tear him into shreds and eat him. Although Mandingo fighters were a fictional idea conjured up for the movie specifically, this scene shows how hard it was for slaves creating a kill or be killed atmosphere for African Americans in the south. The violence in this movie is necessary to show all people of color how far we have come in America.
Although the profanity and violence may be too harsh for viewers, Django Unchained portrays a message about how poorly African American slaves were treated at this time period. I believe that the main message of the movie is to show the adversity that slaves went through and that there were very few white men at this point who believed what they were doing as inhuman. In this movie, Tarantino portrays his message very well. Also, Schultz is like a father figure to Django as he frees him and trains him to be a killer. As the saying goes, ""money is power,"" and being a bounty hunter, killing fugitives was a very good occupation at the time. Schultz is like the police as he justifies the wrong doing of the evil. A second message Tarantino is trying to tell us is that love is a powerful thing. The whole plot of the movie is centered around Django's motivation to do whatever it takes to get his wife Hildi back and freed from slavery.
Overall, Django Unchained was a movie that exposed the viewer to the problems of slaves. To this day, it is sad to think that not much has changed as many African Americans are still being racially profiled and being killed by racists. Django Unchained shows viewers the faults that we had in our America and reminds us to never do this once again to minorities today.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A violent and entertaining Quentin Tarantino movie , paying tribute to Spaghetti Western","In 1858, a bounty-hunter named King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) seeks out a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) and buys him because he needs him to find some men he is looking for. After finding them, Django wants to find his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who was formerly sold. With the help of the German bounty-hunter, the freed slave sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal plantation-owner (Leonado DiCaprio) in Mississippi. There they will take on a tough rival and his underlings (Samuel L. Jackson, Walton Goggins, Dennis Christopher , James Remar) . Life, liberty and the pursuit of vengeance. This Christmas, Django is off the chain. The ""D"" is Silent. Payback Won't Be.It is an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the starring and enemies . The film blends violence , blood , shootouts and it is fast moving, though overlong. There's high body-count with the bloody attacks where Django and King Schultz cause cruel slaughters, and , of course , the final showdown at the house. There are frantic scenes that are often intercut with a character taking their time and behaving methodically . The highlights of the film are the successive confrontations of our two protagonists against a series of outlaws to win the rewards on their heads and the overwhelming final in which starring does a real massacre . Django is named as homage to ¨Django Reinhardt¨ , the famous American musician who introduced his particular guitar . There are special remembrances to Leone's Westerns , thus: ¨Fistful of dollars¨, ¨Fistful of dolars more¨and ¨The good, ugly and evil¨ regarding various scenes and of course , Sergio Corbucci Westerns as ¨Navajo Joe¨, ¨The great silence¨, ¨Compañeros¨ and ¨the Mercenary¨. And of course ¨Django¨ (1966) with Eduardo Fajardo, Loredana Nusciak and Franco Nero himself , that followed a number of unofficial sequels , rip-offs , and copies .¨Django¨(1966) is a classic and violent Spaghetti Western with numerous imitations , in fact it was prohibited in various countries for its violence , for example , in England , but in France , Germany was a real hit and in Japan there is one ¨Fondazione Django¨ too .Django Unchained (2012) displays an enjoyable cinematography by cameraman Robert Richardson who does an excellent photography with barren outdoors , dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and gorgeous exteriors from New Orleans, Louisiana, Whitney Plantation, Louisiana, Independence, Santa Clarita, Lone Pine, Abana Hills, California, among others . As always Tarantino uses pre-recorded music for his films, here taking ¨Django¨1966 music from Luis Enrique Bacalov (author of ¨The Postman and Pablo Neruda¨ which won an Oscar and composed lots of Spaghetti) , creating a good soundtrack with Ennio Morricone influence .This cult movie was competently directed by Quentin Tarantino who often uses an unconventional storytelling device in his films and often shows a relationship between an older experienced character and a younger character in a manner similar to a parent or teacher .His films usually subvert cliches of certain genres and often pay a homage to genres that were highly popular in the 1960s and 1970s such as Heist (Reservoir Dogs), Blaxploitation (Jackie Brown), Kung Fu (Kill Bill), and Spaghetti Western (Django Unchained) Quentin has helmed several critically and financially successful films, including Reservoir Dogs (1992) , Pulp Fiction (1994) , Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill: Vol 1 (2003), Kill Bill: Vol 2 (2004), Inglorious (2009) and The Hateful Eight (2015). Rating : 7.5/10 . The movie will appeal to Tarantino enthusiasts and Western fans . Essential and indispensable watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino Masterpiece,"Time and time again as Quentin Tarantino made some of my favorite movies, but I think quite literally this one makes it as my favorite.You have to watch it. This is the embodiment of a true western and with this movie brings out the popularity for westerns again, especially when it released. Every second, every scene of this movie was perfect. I was left utterly speechless after watching and was blown away about how reality focused and historically accurate Tarantino has shaped this movie.The characters are incredible, Jamie Foxx stars as Django, and plays his role perfectly, his character development goes beyond my expectations and seeing him and the world transform around him throughout the movie is frankly phenomenal. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Candy and frankly, he's probably one of the coolest antagonists I have ever seen.Each character in this I found likeable and enjoyable to see them develop as well as they did. Tarantino found the perfect actors and actresses for each role and I couldn't be more pleased with the casting as a whole. This movie is a must watch, it brings the reality of American slavery in the 1800s into purity and reflects the atmosphere of the Texan Wild West perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Disappointing,"I love Tarantino, but this one was so far over the top, you couldn't even see the top from where I was. Although there were a couple of good Tarantino-esque scenes of dialog, there wasn't enough to sink my teeth into. Jamie Foxx was solid. Christoph Waltz was excellent as usual. Leo D. had his moments. Samuel L. Jackson was terrific as the house slave, playing somewhat against type (although subservient, he was still irascible and no pushover, so that was in keeping with his usual persona.) The characters' actions were generally uninteresting and the action was predictable. The violence was over the top, even for QT. How many times can he show a bullet causing someone's head/chest/leg/arm to explode? It wasn't boring by any means, it just didn't live up to my hopes for it. QT is so in love with playing with the filmic conventions of his youth, he sometimes forgets to make a good film.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
The D is for Dangerous!(sorry),"Tarantino's love letter to blacksploitation and especially spaghetti westerns.

Very memorable performances all around, but especially from Waltz, DiCaprio and Jackson! Also a sweet soundtrack, but that goes without saying.. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Great, but no longer genius...","Even though I am, and will forever remain, a diehard and devoted Quentin Tarantino fan-boy, I can't deny there's a disturbingly unnerving trend noticeable in his 5 latest movies. QT used to be inimitable and downright iconic for two specific trademarks, namely dialogues that are pure genius and sudden outbursts of extreme & uncompromising violence. Since ""Death Proof"" the dialogues only seemed to get longer and longer, while the violent bits became less numerous. Or at least that was the impression I got. When I first saw ""Django Unchained"", in the cinema when it was released, I thought the talkative parts were so overlong that I didn't even bother to write a review for it. But after the even more talkative ""The Hateful Eight"" and the exaggeratedly - almost exclusively - talkative ""Once Upon in Hollywood"", ""Django Unchained"" suddenly didn't seem so bad anymore.In fact, it's great! Already thought it was great the first time around, but I was too preoccupied with the length of the dialogues. But, in essence, it's another genuine and bona fide Tarantino, meaning it's an intelligent hodgepodge of genres and chock-full of delightful cinematic homages (to known classics as well as obscure gems) and an unbelievably stellar cast (featuring cult & western icons from the past four decades). Quentin must have been thrilled about his collaboration with Christoph Waltz in ""Inglourious Bastards"", and the very first casting of both Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio were also both tremendous successes. There still isn't a single other director who provides a soundtrack so suitable for a film. There also aren't any other directors that find the exact right balance between visual style, humor and excessive violence. But there were, say, ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill"" were basically 100% perfect, ""Django Unchained"" shows quite few little cracks, and those cracks grew out to become enormous craters by the time of ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"", and that's most unfortunate.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Uncle Tom's Day of Anger,"Tarantino at his most epic (as said by some) defeats for me the whole point.Overlong and sloppily put together, the film mainly suffers from Tarantino's specific philosophy, or lack of one. He is a writer first, writes frothy scenes of some tension but never pays mind to the submerged undercurrents of soul, the actual life that give rise to the tension, and then separately pulls visual skin from several places to dress his short sketches, films, music, cool tidbits of pop culture. At its best, this can create a narrative energy that carries you along, it's infectious in short spurts.This time, he has delivered the sketches in the form of the western he has long threatened to make, in this case Italian. I have seen most of the spaghetti westerns he takes from, probably all. These differed from their American counterparts in a key way—the stories were not about a clean sweep of destiny from one coast to the other, because Italians wouldn't know Kansas City from Santa Fe, which liberated them to do a sort of abstract comic opera of the West.Films like Django were all about the visual sketch and archetype, entirely about the image of the man dragging the coffin. The sensibility goes back to centuries of comedia dell'arte, an appreciation for mannered masked life, episodic gaffe and irony, countered in the films with the rustic simplicity of the western. Being a writer first, few of Tarantino's episodes are visually thought out, the effect is nothing like Good Bad Ugly or Grand Silencio, where wry humor or absurd violence is chiseled to rise out of silence with the cicadas.In tandem with this is my main complaint.By all means, have the frothy patter, it's Tarantino's staple and one he is good at. But he is simply unable to visually integrate his wordplay with images, just can't do it, probably he doesn't even think it is an issue, or it's how movies work. In the film, you have individual scenes anchored on the spot in some kind of bartering going on, and wholly separate visual interludes, usually a montage of cool music video shots played over to music of his choosing.These are entirely independent of anything, sloppily slathered from the outside; blood spraying on cotton, slow-motion riding and shooting. It's such a sloppy way to make a film, sloppy like the man we see in interviews. There is not a single image here I will carry with me. Which wastes Waltz and Jackson putting on an excellent show, and to a lesser extent Foxx.And of course, all filmmakers reach out and borrow, Tarantino's problem is that he borrows fashions and what is incidentally attached to it, never the inner logic, the notion of life a certain way that on the outer level is the image we see.Let me illustrate this in the film. Django being a slave, in order to freely go about in the slaveholding South he has to be in disguise, Dr. Schultz tells him to pick out his costume and character. The rough-hewn ex-slave picks a frilly Little Lord Fauntleroy costume, and we get the silly image of him on horseback.How about instead of Fauntleroy for a quick snicker, Don Quixote? And borrow with the costume the logic of self-deception, and patiently mold and weave this through the film. Foxx in his pointy beard, and sculpted intense face does look the part, a black Quixote on heroic adventure. Schultz as his Pancha, an educated Pancha who 'writes' him into the story.I'm just throwing ideas. Instead of simple scattershot amusement, something that more deeply involves. And take this in a million directions. And visually distort truth, and fool with Southern chivalry and have us question the heroism. How about a Broomhilda as Dulcinea who doesn't know anything about him, but goes along because it means freedom? How about this as love, meeting someone that sets you free?I'm not saying this will be deep because in itself the theme is something, or it references a respectable work. It can be deep, in the sense that you more deeply involve more of us in the viewing. Tarantino has grown, but only the size of his canvas—a small view stretched to epic length.",,Anonymous,Drama
One of the greatest movies ever,"Tarantino's brilliance is perfectly depicted in this western masterpiece.From the well-formed lines to the great character development , this movie has them all. The charisma of Dr.Schulz and the anger of DiCaprio's slave-owner , led to the creation of two entertaining and unforgettable characters. Django had one crazy development that impressed me to the point I couldn't believe there would be a happy ending for him , but Tarantino managed to pull out a decent happy ending without making it boring or cliché. I totally recommend this movie to every movie lover who wants to have a roller coaster of emotions and great storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant,"It is with great pleasure to tell everyone that this is one brilliant film. I've seen an uncounted amount of films, but nothing quite like this. It's intelligent, funny, terrifying, and directed with such creativity that it could wrap even hardest to please viewers in awe. Leonardo DiCaprio shows us once again why he is the greatest actor of our time. Jamie Fox played it well, and Christoph Waltz performance was beyond spectacular. DJango's soundtrack may be a little unfitting for some particular scenes, but stunning visuals, a shrewd script, and monumental performances from a well rounded cast, does more than make up for it. Admirably giving Quentin Tarantino's already impressive directorial history - helming such timeless classics as: Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Reservoir Dogs - I genuinely believe DJango Unchained is his best work yet.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Entertaining and witty movie...85%,"Like director Quentin Tarantino's earlier movie, ""Inglourious basterds"", this one is about the return of the repressed. In the earlier movie, that was the Jew, with the added twist that this time he was taking the fight up to Hitler! This time, it's the negro slave just before the American civil war which outlawed slavery. Not sure if Tarantino has mined all the wronged ethnic groups...Jews and black Africans...that's it, surely? Stay tuned. In any case, like ""Inglourious basterds"" this is a highly entertaining day dream of the ""What if...?"" variety. A revenge fantasy in other words.The story involves a secret bounty hunter (Dr. King Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz) who poses as a travelling dentist, in order to find his latest targets, three brothers wanted for murder and robbery. He needs somebody who can identify the brothers for him, so needs a slave to buy who knows them by site. That turns out to be Django (played by Jamie Foxx). Schultz is a German and has an 'innocent abroad' way to him, as far as America's slave system goes. He marvels at people's reactions to what Django does when he is with him. It is curious to me why Tarantino chose a German to be in this role. Having recently watched the interesting documentary series ""Civilisation: Is the West history?"", I know that Adolf Hitler's views on race were shaped by a German 'scientist' in colonial Africa...in the late 19th century. This link came to me in a scene involving a skull in this movie...there is a very horrific story in the documentary series concerning this German 'scientist' and an African woman, also concerning the creation of a skull.Anyway, despite Schultz being no advocate of slavery, he realises he needs this cover for his bounty hunting activities (his main cover is that of being a dentist)...Django will play the role of his servant. For this reason, Schultz helps turn Django into an effective bounty hunter...a skill that will become useful to him as Django seeks to reunite with his wife, Broomhilda von Schaft (! played by Kerry Washington), who is a slave on a notorious plantation.In Hollywood movies or TV series of decades ago, you would often see African Americans in roles...as slaves or as house servants in modern set stories. For the latter, particularly, it's not clear to me exactly what the meaning of this is...that African Americans have 'improved' their lot in America? That they are now treated better by white Americans? There is no such mystery in ""Django unchained"". Django is the unconventional hero with a quest...where he gets to kill white people. Unthinkable decades ago in US pop culture...that would ordinarily make the character a villain.Things I liked in this movie:* A collage of visual styles, taking their cues from genre movies or movies from other countries.* The visual aesthetic of place...e.g. the boggy Main St. in some tiny town...it really made the place look like a dung hill...which is unusual for Westerns.* Leonardo DiCaprio's gaze of searching intensity on Django (DiCaprio plays Calvin Candie, a notorious slave owner who Django must deal with in order to get his wife returned to him safely).* An interesting question asked by Candie to his dinner guests, where he uses a human skull as a prop. Be interesting to know if the answer he proffers was the 'intellectual' explanation of the day. It's this scene which brought to mind the scene in the documentary series ""Civilisation"" and the question of why Tarantino had a German play the role of the bounty hunter. Irony?* I especially liked the scene where Big Daddy (who I didn't realise was played by Don Johnson...hey, I never watched ""Miami vice""!) discusses with one of his female slaves how she should treat Django...it's witty and shows real human character and psychology at play. Good screen writing that.* There is also humour in Django's early fashion sense, once he becomes part of Schultz' quest to claim the bounty on three brothers.* Speaking of actors I did not recognise...I had heard that Samuel L. (for ""Ladies love...""?) Jackson was good in a disturbing role in this movie. I was enjoying the humour of a certain character in this movie and then...it dawned on me that that was Mr. Jackson hisself! Most amusing was his character's paraphrasing of William Shakespeare's Richard III (who, by the by, has recently been discovered under car park in England!).Other points of interest:* I was browsing a newsagent magazine rack and noticed a feature on this movie...there was a particularly horrific picture from the movie...it might have been on the cover of this magazine, which was a horror magazine. Glad to say that this scene is not in the movie...even though the movie is bloody and violent, this particular shot (which I assume to be in the slave fight scene in Candie's mansion) was just too gruesome, in an over the top manner. Which begs the question: has the Australian release of this movie been censored? If not, is that scene to be included in some 'director's cut' of the film for DVD?* Quentin Tarantino plays an Australian in this movie...for some reason. Australian John Jarratt also is in scenes with him, playing an Australian. This just seems really random. Jarratt piles his 'Australianness' on thick and Tarantino's accent is good in parts. Well, good in part, singular. Still, Robin Williams could no doubt learn something about Australian accents from Tarantino. Which isn't really saying much! All this stuff is anachronistic, but fits in with some of the caricatures of Americana found in this movie.* Story wise, I did find it odd how Schultz' and Candie's final interaction with each other played out, considering what was at stake...beforehand, it was Schultz always advocating Django to be judicious.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best Duo Since Butch and Sundance,"""Django: Unchained"" is a brilliant deconstruction of the western genre through a blaxploitation lens. Similar to ""Blazing Saddles"" in its approach to using a sort of dark comedy to shed some light on a very disturbing chapter of human history. I loved Christoph Waltz as the German dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. Schulz. Great performance. Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson do an equally impressive job as the sinister pair Calvin and Steven. Brilliant dialogue, beautiful cinematography. I love when Tarantino pulls out a lot of old school film techniques to give it a retro sort of feel.One of my favorite westerns of all time. Or should I say southern? Anyways this is among Tarantino's better films, perhaps even his second best, and along with the more down to earth depiction in ""12 Years a Slave"" is some of the best on screen commentary on the history of slavery. Excellent film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Django unchained,"Django Unchained: Critically acclaimed Director Quentin Tarantino does not leave the eager movie goer disappointed with his lasted work. Tarantino's mark on cinema began two decades ago with an indelible style that cannot be matched. Whether you are a fan or not, this man roots for the underdog. With Inglorious Basterds we got revenge for Nazi crime and cruelty. Well done and undoubtedly Tarantino with an in-depth, unapologetic and unorthodox view of bravery, heroism and violence. At times, Tarantino's gory goes too far but we tolerate it because we admire the stretch for the sake of his story. Django is no different in its fantasy for the underdog approach. When the Django gets loose there is no stopping him and we are all there shouting ""Yee haw, go get 'em"". Jamie Fox becomes our new version of a cowboy as he prepares to save his damsel in distress. We are sucked into Django's journey and are introduced to amusing and quirky folks along the way. This includes the wickedly perfect Stephen played by Sam Jackson, the colorful Master sleazy played by an unrecognizable DiCaprio among others. Best of all however is the impeccable Christoph Waltz. Hats off to you sir who played the brazen mentor defying conventions of the era with quick wit and an even quicker gun.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino's best yet,"First off let me make it clear that this is a superb masterpiece that should have wiped the floor at the Oscars. There is more power, tension and drama in a couple of minutes of DiCaprio and a skull than in the whole of Argo. So whats so good about this film. Firstly its just a great story - a retelling of the Siegfried legend set against a backdrop of slavery and bounty hunting in the deep south of the US, just before the civil war. It is also a love story, a pupil / surrogate father figure story and perhaps most importantly a brutal account of the horrors of slavery. The second thing that is outstanding is the screenplay. It is littered with quotable lines, from the funny: ""That house we just left from, is The Big House. Big Daddy call it that cause it's big."" to the plain scary: ""If you examine this piece of skull here, you will notice three distinct dimples"". In fact the screenplay is so good almost the whole thing is quotable. The final ingredient of this unforgettable film is the casting/acting which produces some wonderful characters: Dr King Schultz, a civilised, cultured bounty hunter, who although he has told Django that he must stay in character just cant do it himself when confronted with Candy's cruelty. Stephen, a brilliant personification of evil by Samuel l Jackson, the moment when Stephen sees Django approaching on a horse is an astonishing bit of acting, essentially with only the eyes. The eponymous Django who through a kind of right of passage changes from a scared slave to a vengeful hero. And perhaps I leave the best to last, the francophile Calvin Candy: DiCaprio captures deep evil and menace.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another Tarantino Classic,"Django Unchained is the story of a freed slave who becomes the partner of a German bounty hunter. Together they set off on a mission to release a certain slave owned by ruthless plantation owner, Calvin Candie, that slave being Djangos wife.In all honesty I had some reservations about this movie as it didn't look to be anything too great, but I thought I'd give it a go and I was not disappointed. Out of the Tarantino movies I've seen not many have disappointed...Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs just to name some, are all superb and while Django Unchained is not on the same level as those for me, its not too far off.Now, if you're expecting the usual Tarantino style of action, blood and violence then you'll be sorely disappointed. I mean there is good amount of action in it (especially the last 30 minutes) but its just not the main story character. There's a few good comedy moments as well, with one favourite of mine being when a lynch mob are talking about whether to wear their hoods or not. I know - that doesn't sound funny but when you watch the movie you'll understand what I mean.There's a number of very obvious spaghetti western style moments too, such as the ultra-fast camera zoom, but all this adds to the style of Django Unchained.As for the characters, the relationship between Django (Foxx) and Dr. King Schultz (Waltz) is 1st class. They play off each other so well and they make what is already a good movie that bit better. DiCaprio was fantastic bringing a cold, calculating side to the already vicious streak of Calvin Candie. Jackson was excellent (as usual) as Stephen, Candies slave house master, and in one way is more ruthless than Candie because of the way even he treats the slaves.On the whole, whether you're a die-hard Tarantino fan, a period action/drama fan, or a fan of both, Django Unchained is definitely worth a watch and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Lemmings Vote 8,"Just because good movies became a rarity, a mediocre product still shouldn't be rated as high as this one. All Tarantino does, is copying one of those blaxploitation movies. And in such a generic way, you could pick just any one of this genre.I am not saying it is all bad: the first half is intriguing, interesting, and entertaining. The eye candy and music are good through most of the film. But at candy land, which is halfway through the movie, things turn grave plot wise. A deal so elaborate, nobody ever would come up with, guns blazing, one more useless turn of events, only to justify some more guns blazing and gore, for no purpose or meaning at all. With it's main topics, slavery and segregation, this movie had a chance to transport some message or meaning, but all it does, is utilizing those main themes for pure entertainment reasons. In a way, Tarantino abuses those themes to make money, and you should find out for yourself what you think of it. For me Tarantino finally made his way into the bread and circuses league. If that is what you are expecting, it is your movie.In short:copy a generic blaxploitation movie, borrow on a known character, use serious topics like slavery and segregation, blend in some eye candy and good music, and you have Django to make you some money.

Sorry I gave Tarantino my money- that I wasted my $ is incidental, that I encouraged him to make more trash is deplorable. I think there is a place for violence, where it adds to the story, in this case the movie was solely about violence. Is there a plot? Yes, but it is incedential; this is about blood & guts-and I don't mean bravery. There is no redeeming aspect to the movie, don' waste your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

HK Auteur Review - Django Unchained,"I'm just going to right into it...The best performance by a mile is Christoph Waltz - he is the heart of the movie. Waltz's Doctor King Schultz single-handedly balances the entire film, evening out the tone between moments of intense horror and humor and mediating the film's internal battle between historical fact and its post-modern aesthetic. He is the Yang to the film's Yin, filling out the missing part of the scenes and even providing a human perspective into what's happening when the audience does not what to feel in certain situations. Whenever Christoph Waltz is not in the movie, it is heavily felt.Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin J. Candie is a great villain and brings a scary presence. Scary is something we haven't ever seen Dicaprio accomplish so it was quite fresh to see. He sings Tarantino's dialogue, projecting a charming demeanor on the surface while carrying a constant petty evil underneath. It's not Oscar worthy (if anything, he should have won for The Aviator) but a powerful performance nonetheless.Jamie Foxx's lead performance as Django seemed off to me. Particularly his voice threw me off because his inflections sound too modern. Everybody else seems to have an accent from the era, but he does not use a southern accent, or any accent. He just sounds like a black man from 2012. Django's progression of intelligence was unconvincing to me as well. There were times where he seemed dim-witted and other times where he seemed sharp, and it felt unnatural. It is not a screen writing issue, but in how the performance was delivered. It was as if Foxx focused on playing the ""Man with No Name"" western genre hero and did not know how to balance it with the historical context of black slaves in America. He just did not carry enough pain in his eyes.I don't have words for Samuel L. Jackson's performance, it's quite the spectacle to behold. Watching it transported me into a weird nether place. Maybe I need to go leaf through a history book on slavery or something. I don't know what to make of it. And on that awkward note...However one may feel about Tarantino's frequent use of the N word, he definitely has a strange obsession with it. As horrible as this sounds, I was surprised how other racial slurs from that era were not spoken in the film. (I am not going to name them here. I will defer you to watch that scene in Clerks 2.) There is a quality in Tarantino's crass, in-your-face direction that suggests that he gets off rebelling against social taboos. That telling him that something is politically incorrect will push him to do it in order to disprove you. That's my speculation anyways.The film is way too long. Simply put, it's ill-disciplined in the sense that Tarantino wants his cake and eat it too. He wants to tell his story and communicate a statement but also wants to amuse himself by inserting things that he enjoys and cannot reign himself in. There is a gag where a major comedy star shows up in a cameo which I found problematic. In fact, it was problematic in the exact same way I found Mike Meyer's cameo was in Inglourious Basterds. In a film where it's trying to balance historical fact and a post-modern aesthetic by mediating film genres, seeing a modern comedic actor show up for a cheap laugh is just one extra layer too many and it took me out. Did the gag make me laugh? No. Did it progress the story? No. Then why is the gag there? Tarantino wants it to be, that's why.A reason that I prefer Django Unchained over Inglourious Basterds is that Tarantino doesn't try to make every scene into a dialogue set piece. The opening set piece in Inglourious Basterds is the best thing Tarantino has written (he says so too), but every proceeding scene seemed like he was trying to recreate that for the rest of the movie and it got tiring. There is a point in the Django Unchained's final act where the story could have concluded but it proceeds for another half hour. I could have cut 20 minutes out of the film and it is that exact 20 minutes that holds the film from being something masterful. Yes, that includes Tarantino's cameo. Tarantino shouldn't act in his own films. Maybe he shouldn't act at all in anything but he was the worst part of his own film.All that said, I enjoyed it much more than Inglourious Basterds ( I am so relieved it didn't end with a character uttering ""Hm, maybe THIS is my masterpiece."") Tarantino fans may love the extra fat, but I would have preferred a leaner steak with more discipline. It's just that little difference, if only Tarantino reigned himself in.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"*sigh* AKA ""The Worst Movie For Race Relations In America In The Last 30 Years""","Opening Statement: ""This film is the greatest, longest, most boring, unimaginative, tasteless, self-indulgent piece of racist trash that I have ever seen in a movie theater. Do not see it for history will prove you to be a damned fool.""This is what sensible critics should have said about this movie.In my defense: First, let me say that I have been a tremendous Tarantino fan my whole life and have seen all of his movies. Second, let me say that I will not be attending anymore of his films in a theater. Third, ""Django Unchained"" is not a bad movie, in the same way that ""Birth of a Nation"" is not a bad movie. All these things considered, this is one of my least favorite movie experiences of all time. It completely lacks substance, with the exception of ketchup and corn syrup. There are few things about this film that I actually enjoyed (Christoph Waltz being one exception.) The rest? I can say little in its defense. Instead of making a statement about America's brutal history of slavery and its atrocities, ""Django Unchained"" rolls around the filth under the excuse that ""its a satire,"" ""its comical,"" ""its making a statement,"" ""its a parody,"" ""its campy.""NO.(these are not acceptable excuses)Tarantino should not get to do this. A great movie could have been achieved, but he made damn sure to cross that line. In the absence of any real moral message, social statement, or will to style, Tarantino has continued to rely upon ultra-violence to win him points with audiences and critics. If Tarantino wanted to keep me interested, I would recommend he cut the laughable redundant gimmicks that he has fallen back upon time and time again.Please.I am tired of seeing someone getting their junk blown off in every Tarantino movie. Its not shocking anymore, its just repetitious.

A Fairy Tale by Tarantino,"Originally written 12-30-2012: After seeing it played in three different theaters, I can safely say that I would probably not recommend anyone see ""Django Unchained."" As much as it is a lesson on how damned the English language has become, the film, for me, makes me think again and again about influences and motivations. It's only a fairy tale, per se, but my main motivation in seeing Quentin Tarantino movies is the lesson in influences they give me. They're a cinematic history lesson directed towards pure entertainment and leave out any potential for dull moments. It also challenges any idea of ""fun"" you may have. As strong as any of his other flicks (and, more importantly, cinema in general), it is a perfect blend of dialogue and scenes propelled by a sweet soundtrack. There are some terrifying moments, one which should give Leonardo DiCaprio an Oscar nomination at least, but they aren't meant to last long, and an intense grand bloody finale is cut short to lead into another finale, as if it's a re-do, for a more satisfying conclusion. As perfectly edited as each scene is, I wonder if the last 15 minutes would have benefited better from the late Sally Menke (Tarantino's editor for the past 20 years). Not to give any spoilers, the movie gives you what you want if not what you expect. Tarantino is a master of escapist entertainment and if you're ready to take a ride away from the real world, his cinema is capable of making you feel like a kid again (meaning you are definitely NOT a child watching this film).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Yet another amazing film about revenge,"The story of Django Unchained is interesting and very thrilling. Okay, that's hard to sincerely while that screenplay picture is there, but I really do mean it. Django's character makes everything even better. He is definitely a hero, but he's slightly complicated hero. Usually roles like that are made for white actors, but there's no way to make this story about a white man. There are too few heroes that aren't just white men, especially when we're talking about roles where the hero is forced to act against his beliefs. Meaning Django had to pretend to be a black slaver, and he did his part and seemed almost merciless, and even when you know that's just for his plans, it is awful to watch.The love angle is a good add for this story. Of course the revenge theme is very strong here, but the love story of Django and his wife Broomhilda is definitely a nice touch. Maybe the audience doesn't get to see romance that much, but it gives a sort of softer feeling to this.Violence in Django Unchained has two reasons: there's the violence that the slaves face. And that's something that definitely shouldn't be left out. Slaves were treated horribly and that's a fact, and seeing that violence on screen makes it harder for people to not talk about it. And then there's the violence where Django gets his revenge, and those are amazing. Firstly there's the catharsis - the bad guys get what they deserve. Secondly, film is a fantasy. One guy fighting ten or more guys and surviving is impossible, and we all know that, but it is thrilling to watch.It's impossible to talk about Tarantino's films without mentioning the music. Once again, I loved the soundtrack of Django Unchained. It felt different compared to the other movies I've seen, but it was still good.Django Unchained is definitely amazing movie. It deals with a very serious issue, yet it manages to give a satisfying result to everything.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Í have enjoyed the symbolic language of Tarantino in the movie,"I've got the opportunity to see the movie only recently and now, having read some of the reviews I'm astonished that nobody had thought about why Leonardo Di Caprio mentioned in the scene with the skull (in the year of 1859!)Albert Einstein! Einstein was born in 1879!!!This clue of Taratino to us should have explained for some of previous reviewers that the movie was not gritty and messy, but a fantastic description the WAY TO GET TO FREEDOM AT ANY TIME.The rolls he has given to the slaves was to understand symbolic for any people or group living without freedom.Steve was the symbolic figure for those who were enjoying the benefits of - in this case slavery - and he was the very one who wanted to save the system even after the death of ""the big daddy"". I liked the scene after the funeral with the people, black and white, but in the shadows they were the same. One could not separate who was black and who white.The same way showed the flattering white under the clothes of the two black women their real face at the and of the movie, just before the explosion of the house.By the way explosion and dynamite: was it there in America about 1859 at all? Alfred Nobel has invented it perhaps a few years before, but in America? I'm not sure that it was there already. So the dynamite was for me a symbol again, besides many other things such as the ""white cake"" together with the papers for freedom in the hands of Di Caprio. Eating the ""white cake"" and shaking hands with DiCaprio Schultz would have joined in a way to Stephen, getting what he wanted - in this case to free Djangos wife -. But Schultz did not want to compromise, therefore had he chosen the death together with Candie, who was a symbol - in this case of the slavery and the South at the time around the Civil War.I'm sure the sunglasses for Django had some other purpose than to protect against the sun. I think it was because Django should not be blended on his way and he should not miss the final aim, in this case to free his wife.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

You just can't beat watching a good Western, Action, Comedy, Thriller all wrapped up in to one great film for the history books. Then to top it all off why not have it directed by Quentin Tarantino and have your lead actor played by Jamie Foxx dressed to the nines in his nice blue velvet suit and frilly white scarf that reminds us of the renowned painting ""The Blue Boy"" by the English painter/artist Thomas Gainsborough. Django Unchained will certainly go down in the history books of cinema as a true classic work of cinema art.The film was only nominated for five Academy Awards and ended up winning only two for Best Writing,Original Screenplay (Quentin Tarantino) and for Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Waltz). Personally I felt this film should have received several more nominations and won at least a few more Oscars. It is ""that good a movie"" that I have added it to my library of Classic Films of all time.To those viewers who felt Tarantino went over the top, I say to you that Quentin is still relatively a young man and you have not seen anything yet. Tarantino plays a small role in this film and how he writes his own character out of the film is just pure genius and sure to be talked about for centuries by those avid film goers and masters of the creative arts.There is a very strong supporting cast with names such as Kerry Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L Jackson (he was better in Django Unchained than he was in Pulp Fiction if that is possible), James Remar, Walton Goggins, Don Johnson, M. C. Gainey, Michael Parks, and Ato Essandoh to name just a few of this brilliant cast of characters. I felt that all the actors put their heart and soul in to this film and it certainly was reflected on the big screen.One of my favorite scenes (and I had many favorite scenes) occurs relatively early in the film when the slave Django (played by none other than Jamie Foxx) accompanies a bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (played by Christopher Waltz) in to a towns local saloon to sit down and have a pint of cold beer. The slave Django is well aware and truly frightened to be sitting in a white mans saloon but at the coaxing of his rescuer Dr. King Schultz who promises Django an explanation shortly Django accepts the cold and refreshing beer while his curiosity about Dr. Schultz is getting the better of Django. What happens next is so bizarre that I would be spoiling the film for new viewers, but I will say it was simply a brilliant piece of screen writing.If you are a fan of Director Sergio Leone's and actor Clint Eastwood's 1960 spaghetti westerns trilogy than we the fans must demand that Quentin Tarantino and Jamie Foxx agree to sign on for two more sequels to Django Unchained and complete their own classic western trilogy as epic as A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad and the Ugly were to the 1960's. With Django Unchained they have a great start for a box office trilogy bonanza!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Movie perfection!,"It is hard to think of a film that combines as many genres as this, and can make you feel so many different ways. The plot is reasonably simple yet exciting, and Tarantino cleverly manages to shock and disturb the audience with a very real and powerful depiction of slavery, whilst at the same time making you laugh and enjoy immensely a classic revenge/ western/ folktale type storyline. The violence is classic Tarantino, being extremely over the top that it is almost comedic (in the best way). The acting is incredible too, Jamie Foxx manages to pull of one of the coolest characters ever created, alongside the deserved Oscar winning performance by Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo Dicaprio acting at the top of his game, who is perfection while playing the bad guy. This film has so many great aspects, but above all is extremely entertaining and outrageously hilarious.

I lovehate Tarantino,"He has done it again. Tarantino has managed to make me lovehate another one of his movies. Django Unchained has his director signature on each one of its frames: overpowering loud music, wardrobe malfunctions, body parts flying, ridiculously clever dialogues, constant surprises. That's him. I do hate Tarantino for getting so much involved in a movie like an attention seeking teenager with lack of self esteem. But I love him for creating such original, provoking, entertaining and brilliantly acted form of modern art. What this time struck me, is Tarantino's tribute to Italian artists with the padre of Spaghetti Western, Sergio Leone, as well as Sergio Corbucci, who directed the original Django, starred by Franco Nero who had a small cameo appearance. The unique melodies of Ennio Morricone dominated again as the perfect soundtrack of Django Unchained while Elisa (Ancora Qui) song deserves credit if not an award. If you, like myself, hate Tarantino for being cocky and showing off, Django Unchained will give you a noisy slap on your face and make you love one of the best directors of the past decades.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Superb!,"USA Today Andrew SindtDjango Unchained 84Quentin Tarantino directed yet another superb film. The storytelling was great and the plot kept moving along great. I was attracted to the screen throughout the entire duration of the film. The action sequences were executed sometimes in a poor way but they are hard to notice and aren't distracting. You don't think about the goofs that were made during the sequence though because they are so quick, violent, and intense. I was in love with the slow motion shots and they fit great. The 165 min. runtime wasn't a bad thing either. It was also hysterical at some points which it fit with the music and mood of the point in the film. Tarantino's style of this movie made it seem like it was a true western style film with a modern adaptation, the music and special effects. Christoph Waltz had another Oscar winning role which he well deserved, he was a great actor. Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel Jackson also helped make the film what it is, a superb film.

He doesn't disappoint!,"While this movie is not entirely very original, it does contain some new ideas, even for Tarantino's usual style. There is even a scene that strongly resembles the ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" style (the night horse raid scene to be more specific); yeah, Tarantino and pythonesque humor... this shouldn't be that surprising actually. I would even dare saying that this is the least Tarantino-style movie, right after ""Jackie Brown"". I like this aspect very much actually.

Tarantino was over in the 90's,"Tarantino's best movies were Pulp Fiction, True Romance and Reservoir Dogs.Tarantino's last few films have been the same old recycled crap. Basically the story is about someone being wronged and then that person takes violent revenge on everyone to blame for the rest of the film. Over and over Tarantino is spewing the same old story with gratuitously violent scenes. Kill Bill, Inglorious Bastards, and now Django are all the same story. I think Django is getting a lot of buzz because it deals with slavery. I found Django to be sleepy and boring. The cameo Tarantino treats audiences to is useless and unnecessary. The gratuitous violence is acceptable because the people killed are big, bad, white slave owners (yawn).Django is not a great film. Really, it isn't. Don't be such a follower and pretend you enjoy it like the rest of the herd. Go see Pulp Fiction or True Romance if you want to see a great Tarantino flick.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama

A modern classic,"Quentin Tarantino contuines to prove just how much of a genius he is with Django Unchained, his first proper western, and an awesome movie from beginning to end.

Foxx and Waltz both deliver fantastic performances, as do basically everyone else in the movie, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. The pacing is great, dialogue is fantastic, the direction is amazing, it has everything you could want in a Tarantino film. There is also some great comedy, including one of the funniest scenes in Tarantino's entire Filmography. The serious moments are well handled, the simple moments are well handled, almost every scene in this movie is great. I also really like the music choices, Tarantino pulled form a lot of genres when selecting the songs for this movie. I only have one problem with the film, and that is the fact that the endgame feels a little messy, even though the ending is fun. Still, this is definietly a fantastic movie from an amazing director, and I will definietly recommend it to everyone that enjoys his work.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"This is historically based reviewing, not entirely opinion based","""Django Unchained"" is a film that really is unchained. Its constant use of blood and violence is used as a form of entertainment, but not many people acknowledge this film as a real part of history. However strange this film is, with all of its oddities and extreme scenes and dialogue, it is a very good testament to how things were back then.However, and that is a very large however, Mandingo fighting, or the practice of pitting 2 slaves against each other for their owner's entertainment, was largely false. David Blight, a professor at Yale's center for the study of slavery, has said that ""One reason slave owners wouldn't have pitted their slaves against each other in such a way is strictly economic. Slavery was built upon money, and the fortune to be made for owners was in buying, selling, and working them, not in sending them out to fight at the risk of death."" His logic makes a lot of sense to me, and unfortunately the entire film is based upon Mandingo fights existing in that time period.However, other films such as ""Mandingo"" (1975) portray its existence, and its sequel has a sequence where an actual fight is had. However, Quentin Tarantino has said that his representation of Mandingo fighting was based upon the film ""Mandingo"" and its sequel, ""Drum"". This really discounts the legitimacy of Django Unchained's representations of the sport, as it is a secondary source of an already shaky film.Another point to be considered is that a German man was living in the United States as a bounty hunter. During the 19th century, there was a large amount of migration from Germany to the US, for farming and commerce purposes. The film Django Unchained began in 1858, and from 1851-1890 alone, there were almost 1 Million German immigrants to the United States. This makes the main characters existence in the story highly plausible. One of the main concentrations of Germans was in Baltimore, where a large part of the story is held.Overall, the film stretches the idea of plausibility, as most Tarantino films do, and does it while creating a significantly accurate image of the time period. While the main base of the story is not the most accurate, factually, it creates enough factual ideas around it for it to be forgiven.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Django Unchained,"I've often felt that when Quentin Tarantino directs his own scripts the results are for the most part huge successes for critics and his admirers as well. When he has written something like Natural Born Killers, or True Romance, both of which were directed by other directors, they had some mildly interesting moments, but for the most part did not work. Here we have Django Unchained, which he has both written and directed and while I am a Tarantino fan, I have to be honest and say that it is the weakest, or at least one of the weakest of his films as a writer and a director. I was a little torn and undecided exactly what to say in this review because there were certainly parts of this new epic that I really admired and considered to be quite well done. On the other hand, there were parts that were terrible and an ordeal to sit through which made the film feel uneven and the 2 hours and 45 minutes of the film dragged, I mean really dragged. I could understand that he wanted to revisit familiar territory and make a spaghetti western with a combination of a blaxploitation film thrown in as well. Whether you like Tarantino, or not, you will have to admit that a lot of his ideas and concepts are borrowed from older, or basically other people's films. He seems to repeat and show the same type of story lines, dialogue and style in almost all of his movies, which I guess is paying off due to the high box office grosses of the films and also the numerous award nominations as well. Django, did not work because it tried to do too many things at once and on almost all accounts it failed. There were times when it tried to be humorous and it tried to set up a gag, or a punch line for amusement, but those scenes just felt so out of place and it didn't seem like Tarantino knew what he was writing and the actors often seemed clumsy and having difficulty delivering these lines and scenes. Instead of being interesting, or funny, or humorous as it's intentions were it just felt painfully awkward and like scenes that belonged in another way different type of film. I know I have criticized others droning on about the length of one's film before, but this time I can not excuse Django Unchained, because it's pacing and timing was all over the place and felt like an editing mishap and overall a mess. We have so many scenes that just do not work because they are written and performed awkwardly and they don't seem to have any clear purpose, or reason for being in the film other than to use up time. Take director Michael Cimino for example. Heaven's Gate has a scene that lasts a very long time when they are at the character's university early on in the film. The scenes goes on for a very long time, but has little to say and has no real relevance, or has any point, or purpose being in the film. It just drags. Same with his The Deer Hunter, which I like considerably more than Heaven's Gate, but what about the wedding scene in that film? The same thing. It goes on without any real purpose, or anything relevant to say. That is one of Tarantino's big problems with Django Unchained, it is almost like he wrote a bunch of ideas down on cue cards and when it came time to pulling together a script, he had to use every single last idea, note, or brainstorming idea he had and put them all in this film whether they worked, or not, or even made the film seem messy and jumbled. He didn't really seem to care. I have nothing against long films, or even films that have slower scenes in them, but they have to offer some kind of benefit to the film, the story, or the overall experience of the film. If not, having them in there just makes the film long, ambiguous and tiresome. There were things I liked about Django Unchained, particularly the supporting performances by Christoph Waltz (who continues to shine after Inglourious Basterds), Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. They are all at the top of their game here. One thing I really missed in this film that is more evident in other Tarantino films, is his flare for dialogue. My favourite scene of the whole film is where the main characters are sitting at a dinner table and Tarantino, creates tension and a mood because of his great knack of dialogue, what the characters say and getting these great actors to play it. I wish there had been more scenes like that in the film, but unfortunately there were not. The action scenes this time seemed a little too over the top and corny and a lot of the film did too, which further made me wonder what type of a mood Tarantino was going for. A lot of it just really seemed like they were trying to ham it up and be ridiculous, but those scenes were followed by others of extreme brutality and gruesomeness that didn't work either. I continue to admire Tarantino as a writer and filmmaker and while Django Unchained had a few honourable merits, there were not enough for me to call this a great film, or make me want to see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Quentin Tarantino's Riveting and Uncompromising Western Revenge Tale,"Set in the pre-Civil War era, the film follows Django, portrayed by Jamie Foxx, a freed slave who partners with a German bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz, to rescue his wife, Broomhilda, played by Kerry Washington, from the clutches of a sadistic plantation owner, Calvin Candie, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. Their journey takes them through a dangerous and morally corrupt world as they confront the horrors of slavery.Tarantino's signature dialogue shines through in ""Django Unchained,"" with sharp wit and memorable exchanges that add depth and complexity to the characters. The film seamlessly blends moments of tension, humor, and explosive violence, creating a rollercoaster of emotions that keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.The performances in the film are outstanding. Jamie Foxx brings a quiet intensity and determination to the role of Django, portraying the character's transformation from a downtrodden slave to a vengeful hero with conviction. Christoph Waltz delivers a captivating performance as Dr. King Schultz, infusing the character with charm, intelligence, and empathy. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Calvin Candie is chilling and charismatic, while Samuel L. Jackson delivers a memorable performance as Stephen, Candie's loyal and manipulative house slave.The film's cinematography is visually striking, capturing the beauty of the landscapes and the harsh realities of the time period. Tarantino's meticulous attention to detail and his love for homage to classic Westerns are evident throughout, with nods to the genre's visual and narrative tropes.Thematically, ""Django Unchained"" confronts the horrors of slavery head-on and exposes the systemic racism and dehumanization of African Americans during that era. It explores themes of revenge, justice, and the power dynamics inherent in a society built on oppression. Tarantino's unflinching portrayal of violence and his exploration of the moral complexities of vengeance invite viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about America's past.""Django Unchained"" is a riveting and uncompromising film that combines Quentin Tarantino's distinct style with a searing examination of slavery and its aftermath. With its sharp writing, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes, the film stands as a testament to Tarantino's storytelling prowess and his ability to tackle challenging subject matter.

The freedom of the whole film runs through the whole process. The black people have been working hard for their freedom. This reminds me of Martin Luther King. I am very moved by their constant struggle and efforts for their freedom. Of course, whether it is the leading role or the supporting role, the performance level of each actor is commendable, which can be said to be very committed, and it is easy to bring us into the story. The director chose to shoot in the United States, which vividly restored the social environment at that time, and it can be said that it is easy to bring the audience into the past. Under this premise, the story telling can be said to have a very obvious effect. Of course, this film also seems to criticize some ugly faces in the old American society, and also oppose the landlord class at that time and some things against the black people. I think that for the black people, it should be a work with very strong influence and leadership. Of course, I also like the soundtrack of the film very much.

review,"Quentin Tarantino has been plundering cult cinema for over twenty years now, with varying degrees of success. Django Unchained sees the director turning to the Spaghetti Western for inspiration, borrowing film-making techniques from the greats of the genre (most notably Sergios Leone and Corbucci) while adding his own trademark touches-snappy banter and over-the-top violence. The result is something of a mixed bag-some of it works brilliantly, much of it is unremarkable yet still entertaining, and some of it is embarrassingly bad. Fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives, the overall result being far from Tarantino's best work, but a long way from his worst as well.The good points include a decent soundtrack (something that QT has always managed to get right), excellent performances from the film's primary cast members (Christoph Waltz putting in a particularly good turn as bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz), a decent supporting cast that includes both big name actors and cult favourites, lots of very brutal violence, and a few well executed action scenes, the film's highlight being a brilliantly choreographed and extremely gory shootout between Django and numerous soon-to-be-dead gun-toting bad guys, the equivalent of Kill Bill's blood drenched Crazy 88s fight (it's such an exhilarating scene it makes one wonder why QT didn't cut some of the jibber-jabber and devote more of the running time to action).Of the more woeful content, we get a supposedly humorous exchange between various members of a hooded raid party that is painfully unfunny, the expected cameo performance by QT (as a slave-driver) which is up to his usual low standard, far too much 'filler' (the film could have been shorter: it doesn't feel epic enough to warrant such a long running time), and a finale that, although explosive, still comes as something of a disappointment after the aforementioned shootout scene.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Dark past of human history is rarely so enjoyable.,"'Django Unchained' might be the most controversial movie Quentin Tarantino has ever written and directed. I remember some uproar it caused when it was first released - some composers and actors refused to work with Quentin Tarantino ever again. Many people were upset about the violence and how slavery was depicted. Tarantino has stated himself that he later re-edited some scenes to tone down the violence. My personal opinion is that he made the right choice. Not that I can't stomach the violence (on the screen), but on some occasions the horrors we can't see can have a bigger impact. The scene with the runaway slave and dogs - when we hear the screams of the victim from the background while we see into the cruel eyes of Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie - it is haunting. As it is a Tarantino movie, one can expect over two hours long well-paced epic with magnificent dialogue and scene-setting. The acting is perfect with many actors doing some of their best jobs here. The balance between some of the quiet performances and that perfect little notch of over-the-top is just fantastic.'Django Unchained' is filmmaking done right - pure stylish genre movie with social commentary. And with that 'Django Unchained' might be the most important film about slavery in recent decades (yeah, take that '12 Years of Slave').",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterclass in pulp cinema.,"Django Unchained isn't Tarantino's most consistent work nor is it his best, it is however, still a truly great spectacle.The film initially focuses on Dr Schultz (Waltz) who is a skilled and charismatic bounty hunter. The good doctor soon enlists the help of a hopeless slave called Django (Foxx) who crucially can identify conclusively the men currently on Schultz's kill list. Shultz who is sympathetic to the black slaves of the deep south despite his own morally corrupt profession, soon sees the potential and merit in having Django around. Then the focus shifts as we learn that Django has been separated from his wife and the odd pair endeavour to rescue her from a plantation run by the eccentric and possibly psychotic Candie (DiCaprio).I'll start by stating the obvious, Tarantino is a Cinephile. This often works to his advantage but every so often its a hindrance, Django represents a good case to highlight this. Django's opening two acts are very strong, focusing on character and setting, providing us with a rich and inviting world that is equal parts grim and hilarious. However, much like Tarantino's more recent efforts Inglorious Basterds and Kill Bill, Django suffers from an odd and inconsistent tone. When the film is funny, it is very funny. When it is sad, it is truly heartbreaking (see all of the numerous torture scenes). However, when the shoot-outs and action began, by and large i switched off. The violence here is campy (as are most of the performances) but there is an odd cinematic grandiosity that simply isn't present in much of the rest of the film. It is strange to focus so much on character and development to dispel it so whimsically with a series spurts and loud bangs. Its mainly the last act that is afflicted with this problem, bullets fly and blood is spilt but the films bite and feeling gets lost in the mêlée. Django himself soon becomes a caricature, he becomes the movie equivalent of what his character sets out to be at the start of the movie and this is a shame. Thus, the last 45 minutes is shade too light and throwaway, seemingly at odds with the world Tarantino painted with his first hour and 45 minutes.The above being said the film is still masterfully crafted. Everything from the tawdry vernacular (i wont comment on the rights and wrongs use of the N word), to the costume design right through to the performances are simply sublime. Waltz, Foxx and DiCaprio are all great as the various shades of humanity on parade but its Waltz who again steals the show. His charming, effervescent musings mixed with his unwavering empathy make Schultz a force of nature from his brash entrance to his heroic exit in the film. All of the Tarantino-isms are present, the fluid use of time, witty villainous monologuing, extreme violence and an expert use of cinema language. Tarantino shuffles his deck like few can and once again shows why he is a true original. Most films struggle to nail down one mode or tone and Tarantino valiantly tries (with varying success) to juggle a plethora of moods with an intelligence and arrogance few can match. Case in point is the films tongue in cheek seriousness, even in the face of Django's vengeful retribution the film isn't afraid to jolt straight back into farce with the wink of an eye.It might be a little long for some and it could have been wrapped up more cleanly but hey, thats just not the Tarantino way. I think a more straight forward, more succinct ending would have been more effective than the one offered here but Tarantino is much more comfortable being subversive and revelling is his ever colouful, lovingly created pastiches.So in short, this is an often great but ultimately solid piece of cinema and yet another interesting chapter in the already bulging book of Quentin Tarantino.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterpiece from a true cinephile,"I watched Django last night for the third time. The first time I saw it, I was not so impressed, it felt too different than the classic Tarantino. The second time I thought it was a good movie. But now, after several years, I think it is a marvelous movie. It was like watching it for the first time and the experience was outstanding. This is what a movie should be like. It is so powerful in every aspect. I have been a fan of QT for more than 15 years and I think that he is just becoming better and better. He is such a complete artist. In my modest opinion, few directors are able to make such an extravagant movie, with the combination of disturbing and hilarious scenes, with ridiculous clothes and mannerisms, and yet so profound and overwhelming. The emotional weight was enormous. Only a true visionary can pack all these elements into an unforgettable experience. Every word, every sigh, every look, every piece of dialogue is masterfully positioned to evoke the viewer's feelings and to enable them to be completely immersed in this epic piece of art. The music and the acting are on another level. I can't even think of how to describe it. With such vision, talent, knowledge, sensibility, and intuition, QT is capable to breathe life into characters and to make them immortal. I have never completely understood Tarantino's words that his dialogue carries emotion, but now I do. Performances are so strong, so genuine, and given with 100% devotion. Because of the ability to bring the best out of his actors, this movie has just established the greatness of Jamie, Washington, DiCaprio, Waltz, and of course, Jackson. One of the most memorable things to me is Jamie's acting when he hears about or sees Hildi's suffering. It so well written, so perfectly executed, it shows how strong is his pain on one hand, and how high is his control on the other. The one thing that ties the whole movie together is the song Freedom. This is one of the best uses of a song in a movie, a stroke of genius. Not only it carries the weight of terrible lives, but it also haunts you and reminds you what hell they had to go through. From an existential and a therapeutic point of view, the song and the movie convey the message of human life itself. How we live our whole lives in some kind of captivity, how we can easily give in and abandon our search for meaning and autonomy. Even though it's a theme of revenge, the movie, and especially Jamie Foxx, shows us the strength and drive that are innate to us, but many times are forgotten. It is not just a story about killing a bunch of people, it is a tale of great suffering that is inescapable, and a tale about how life shapes us, transforms us, and leads us in many unexpected ways. True art doesn't answer questions, it asks questions, it stimulates you to think, and it helps you to experience feelings that stay with you for a long time. For me, this is an example of true art.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The movie is great - I don't like it.,"The movie is great - I don't like it. But that can be explained. Well - I like Tarantino movies, I adore them even. Bad thing he does not make more of them. Undoubtedly the most successful one so far was Pulp Fiction, it's a cult classic. It just has great actors and a huge number of really classic scenes in it. A famous movie scene has something magical about it. It not only has an impact while it lasts, it also has an impact on the whole movie: Before the scene you kind of look forward to it, then you like it while it happens and then the impression even lasts after the scene. That is the kind of magic that makes you watch movies over and over again thus making it a true cult movie. However human nature has it, that good emotions have a smaller impact on us than bad emotions. You can have the most sensual experience with the most stunning girl - you would not want to have it in exchange for HIV, just the thought of it would turn you off, right? You would not want to have the nicest imaginable sensation on your skin if you had to except the worst imaginable or painful sensation on your skin afterwards. The need to avoid the bad emotion is much more developed than the need to seek the good sensation. And this is not only true for a 1:1 comparison but also for a 1:10 ratio. You could enjoy your favorite most delicious spaghetti a hundred times - but if you bit on huge disgusting cockroach while enjoying our meal just once, you would not only stop enjoying the rest of your spaghetti but would probably condemn the whole place and never come back, no matter if all the previous meals were OK. Now what does that have to do with movies? Well, Tarantino movies are mostly filled with intriguing conversations or impressive violent scenes. Most of them are good and cause a sensation of excitement. You can see that actually by the reaction of the crowd in the movie theater. If a rapist gets struck with a ninja sword or Lucy Liu loses half of her brains in a sword fight or some poor gangster gets shot in the face on the back of a car and his brains splatter all over the place - funny enough everybody, including me, likes these scenes - you can clearly see that in the peoples faces and the sounds they are making: 'ouch!' or 'whohoooo' or 'damn! haha' . And as I said, a good scene not only last while it last, but influences the viewer before, while and after it happens. However, there are scenes, like the baseball bat scene in Inglorious Bastards and the mandingo Scene and the dog scene in Django that do not seem to entertain the audience in the same way. You don't hear an 'ouch!' or 'whohoooo' or 'damn! haha' - what you hear is complete silence! It's like suddenly people are not watching Tarantino anymore but more like everybody is forced to watch a scene from Schindlers List. You are not entertained, not the slightest bit - you are deeply disgusted. That is not what you have come for. You will not look forward to that scene in the future, you will want to avoid it! This scene is not neutral or dull, it is the cockroach in your spaghetti and no mater how good the rest might be, it will have spoiled the whole thing forever. Now how can a cinematic genius as I always like to think of Tarantino, make such a huge mistake? It seems as if he blindly stumbles through a minefield of dreadful ideas for showing violence and was magically able to avoid all mines in Pulp Fiction while treading on one or two mines in the last two movies. Don't get me wrong - those movies might still have very high viewer counts initially, but they will not be seen repeatedly for the above mentioned reason. Which is sad. I liked to think, those mistake are just bad luck, but then I saw an interview with Tarantino the other day. He was talking about violence in Django and he even mentioned that he did show the movie to a test audience and he saw the reaction during the mandingo fight and the dog scene and realized that he had to 'cut the scenes' since they seemed to be too much for the audience. Jesus! You can't help the problem by cutting the scene. Just like cutting a cockroach in half and putting it in the spaghetti wouldn't help the smallest bit. The scenes just have a totally different quality, no matter how much of it you actually show in pictures. Even if you did not show a single picture of the mandingo fight at all and would only have the happenings narrated or hinted at: 'Here we have a man squashing a helpless mans eyes out and then bashing his whimpering, struggling even more helpless skull in with a hammer while the audience is cheering and applauding'. Just knowing that these events take place would cause a bitter silence in every movie theater no matter how much of it was actually shown. I for one don't want to see that again. Why do we perceive certain types of exaggerated violence with excitement while other forms seem to stun and disgust us deeply? In short you could say that the a bad scene is not too violent, but rather violent plus way too mean. Please Mr. Tarantino, go back to the sickness of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill that most people like so much and only some stupid people criticize you for. No more cockroaches in your delicious meals. They destroy the whole thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Top tear Tarantino movie,"I have watched a bunch of Tarantino movies and this one of my favorites. I overall love westerns, and this movie shares some similarity with The hateful eight, another Tarantino western, the thing is it is not typical, you won't see infinite desert and the plot won't be about typical natives vs cowboys or sherifs routine, movie starts with bounty hunters adventure story, but shortly after you realize that movie will be much more serious. It shows up racial problems of 19s century, hard life of slaves and an overall society idea's. In this film you feel really bad for afro-american characters, like a main character - Django. Movie last around 3 hours but good plotting makes it feel not that long. Very good characters, mostly impressed by Django, doc, master (Leonardo Dicaprio) and the mansion keeper. I have watched this movie like 2 months ago, so can't remember all the names. In the end of the movie you will find a classic Tarantino bloody action.

Brutal. Serious but with comical moments too,"In order to win his freedom from slavery Django (Jamie Foxx) teams up with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a Bounty Hunter to hunt down bad guys: The Brittle Brothers. But, what really drives Django is finding Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) his wife, who is rumored to be at the Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) plantation.The year is 1858. Slavery is rampant and so is the ""N"" word. Yes, it's very uncomfortable hearing that word constantly. Do we get used to it? No. Do not expect any political correctness in here. Somehow we get used to crude language, which is also rampant, but never the ""N"" word.The acting all around is impressive, but it is Leonardo DiCaprio who steals the show even though it takes a while to get to him in here. You remember the title and wait for Django to unleash/unchain himself on evil-doers. Well, you just have to wait a little longer. He'll have his moments, but he needs to cool it while negotiations are going on to free Hilde (Broomhilda). As he has in the past Jamie Foxx proves, once again, that he is a class act.As brutal and serious as this story is there is also a lot of comedy. Witness the KKK riders who complain they cannot see through the eye-holes in the bags covering their heads. There are many other things that create some chuckles as well.There are many, many stars in here, but there is some difficulty recognizing them because many have gained weight, and beards hide their faces. However see if you can pick some out: Don Johnson, Walton Goggins, Tom Wopat, Don Stroud, Russ Tamblyn, Amber Tamblyn (but no beard here), Bruce Dern, Jonah Hill (he was one of the KKK riders), Lee Horsley, Michael Parks, and, keep an eye out for Quentin Tarantino (he should be easy to pick out).As we go along, you would think this is Christoph Waltz's story as his is a very big part. Sameul L. Jackson has a good role as the Head Household slave to DiCaprio's Candie and yes, he found a way to pontificate in here as he has in all his other movies; but he is good at it.Every now and then we get teased with a big western and then nothing after that. Boo Hoo. Let's hope that Quentin Tarantino can bring westerns back, but without the ""N"" word. I think we have had enough of it in here.Django was nominated for Best Picture. Christoph Waltz was awarded the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Quentin Tarantino won the Oscar for Writing - Original Screenplay.

Chix Chat on Film Review: A new kind of western.,"I thought that the most intriguing thing about Django Unchained, was going to be figuring out how could a Black man in America during slavery possibly become a bounty hunter and most importantly would the constructed tale be plausible. Not only did Quentin Tarantino (writer/director) make it believable he made it worth sitting through the 2 hour and forty-five minute running time. Initially as seen in the trailer Django (Jamie Foxx) is requisitioned by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a German dentist to assist him in his current trade, from there the adventure begins and includes the task of reuniting Django with his wife. The dialogue was filled with far too many nickels for my taste, but there were consequences for its usage which shows that there is a cost for speaking ugly words. Uncle Ruckus, I mean Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) was the character that you immediately love to hate, the portrayal was so convincing that I watched him in every scene with a measure of contempt. I have become accustomed to the signature excessive blood spatters when flesh is injured typical of a Tarantino film, but the gore and carnage in this film was a bit much even for Mr. Tarantino. I guess that pushing the envelope with the savagery is his way of being explosive. This film had shocking moments that took me to the limits of disgust like the Mandingo fights and there were moments that took me to the opposite end of the spectrum by Django's love for Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Ms. Washington is a natural beauty but her acting chops were only challenged here by anguish, I guess a man's man has a hard time thinking up what a slave woman would say so she had very little dialogue, but she did emote well. I don't know what the emotional response was that was expected from the viewing of this film, but I was left somewhere in the middle. The middle of the scale for those two extremes is indifference. The final scenes were a payoff and I especially liked the horse tricks, but I'm trying to decide if it was a big enough pay off to lean more towards favoring the story or reviling the violence. This one was difficult to gauge, it was entertaining but I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that I laughed at some of the uncanniest things like the klan. I will linger on the middle ground with an amber light.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Not absolutely perfect, but pretty close","It may not be the best Western film of all time, but it is certainly the best one from the last thirty years. Maybe the best one since Unforgiven.It is a film that is not without its (minor) flaws yet it is a movie that is truly unique and original. You could argue that while it is Tarantino's first Western, all his previous films were already Westerns of sorts. Which does not take anything away from the fact that this film feels fresh and novel. Not only because there is an obvious comprehension of the grammar of the Western genre, but also because by setting the movie in the South just before the Civil War.It is refreshing to see a movie being so bold with the issue of slavery. Not only is it mentioned and discussed, but it also deconstructed. We see the economics of it, how culture revolves around it and how it permeates almost every facet of Southern life. The film shows that when you had slaves you talked about slaves, you had to manage your slaves. The characters Candie and Big Daddy spend all their time exclusively talking thinking and worrying about slaves.Yet, the writer's genius, of course, is that slavery is woven into the story. It is not something just mentioned: it drives the plot forward. Slavery is an element characters have to take into account into their actions. It is something that is seldom seen in these types of movies. In Westerns, usually the hero is more or less a white knight. Here the protagonist is more of a weapon. Django is a wedge against history. Yet, it is also a weapon against the classic clean Westerns. It is almost as if you took the boldness and subversion of the Spaghetti western and applied to the Spaghetti Western genre itself.The ultimate genius of the Italian Westerns, was not the gritty-ness, nor the realism, nor the music, nor the fable-like aspect of their stories with good guys and bad guys and a moral at the end. Although they're all integral elements and they are present also here. The true genius was the outsider look they had on the American myth-making. The true Spaghetti-Western is a subtle satire of a certain idealised version of American-ness. Here, Tarantino re-appropriates this, so to speak. It is the American version of it (even though a lot of it goes through Schultz who is specifically a foreigner). It is a true American story, told by Americans, and as such it is unique and significant. Unforgiven also showed the discrepancies of the romanticized West vs. Reality, but it didn't have the sarcastic humour nor the did it confront the issue of slavery.It may also be Tarantino's most clever script in terms of dialogue and plot. Dr. Schultz as a bounty hunter is fantastic. So is the scheme he and Django hatch up against Candie. There is a real care in showing how life in the Antebellum South looked like and how the Western institutions functioned.The minor flaws would be that the action is somewhat uneven. There are great sequences, and some memorable ones. But there is not anything instantly cult classic, like in his previous movies. It is kind of a nitpick and I must insist that the movie is brilliant, but it is the sort of thing that jumps out on a rewatch. Also the music was a bit lacklustre, except for the opening titles. It was not bad, but it could have been better.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Even from a critical standpoint, at least 75% of the film is terrific and most shortcomings are only skin deep.","Spaghetti Western—or is a Spaghetti Southern more appropriate?—about slave-turned-bounty hunter Foxx and companion/mentor dentist-turned-bounty hunter Waltz making their flesh-for-cash living, ultimately ending up at the Candyland Plantation to rescue Django's estranged wife Washington. Very much a Tarantino film, delivering homages to the genre in the same manner as ""KILL BILL: VOL. 2"" and ""INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS""; however, this addition to Tarantino's impressive filmography as director/writer is possibly the least dialogue-driven, even more so than ""KILL BILL: VOL. 1"". To some who did not care for or are not familiar with ""RESERVOIR DOGS"" and ""PULP FICTION"", this may not be a disappointment. On the other hand, viewers/fans who are very much familiar with Tarantino's style of making full use of his actors' words, expressions and interactions—a style which has gained him much praise—might be slightly let down that ""DJANGO UNCHAINED"" is more about visuals and less about emotion. Well-acted, with plantation owner DiCaprio and his head slave Jackson offering the most memorable performances. Foxx is great, but delivers an interchangeable performance; and Waltz is more than charming, but his talents are put to very similar use as in ""INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS"". Neither Foxx nor Waltz should be criticized as they obviously gave it their best; perhaps the problem is that the two lead roles are two-and-a-half-dimensional characters—not quite two-dimensionally dull and not quite three-dimensionally gripping they are both caught in that invisible world between script and screen. The film's flaws are not quite apparent until the climatic sequence, a point of the film that changes from slick and stylish to complete sloppiness. Did they use red dye and varnish for the blood or what? But even from a critical standpoint, at least 75% of the film is terrific and most shortcomings are only skin deep.*** (out of four)",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Quentin Tarantino Goes All Out,"I personally enjoy going to the movies when a new Tarantino movie comes out. And though I was a little skeptical about this one, I knew it would be a big one. What I ended up thinking by the end of this movie was ""my Christmas was made."" ""Django Unchained"" is one of those movies where you have to appreciate the director's other work to appreciate this one. And if you're a true Tarantino fan, this movie will come close to your favorites. This movie offers all of the elements of a Tarantino movie at an extended level: There is an awesomely, extreme amount of violence which makes every one of them fun to watch; he gathers two of the best acting members of his entourage; and it's the classical revenge flick styles that he loves. The majority of the violence of this movie was done in the coolest ways ever. Some of them were a bit much, and some of them were done in a darkly funny way. I think it would probably be the second most violent Tarantino movie and the most violent Western I've ever seen. The actors were picked perfectly. Quentin brings back Christoph Waltz after he won an Oscar for his performance in ""Inglourious Basterds"". His performance is equally as good, if not better as he plays the role of Dr. King Schultz, a retired dentist- turned-bounty hunter who's determined to help Django rescue his wife. Tarantino's other golden actor, Samuel L. Jackson, gives off a solid role as Stephen, the very wise house slave that is skeptical of Django and Schultz. But the one performance that made the movie for me was perhaps my favorite actor, Leonardo DiCaprio, in his performance as the film's antagonist. His portrayal of Calvin Candie was the most swiftly crafted role of his career and he nailed it. And as a revenge flick, I thought this movie was written perfectly. This movie brings back the same feeling that Inglourious Basterds did. Considering the themes of ""Jews getting back at the Nazis"" and ""Blacks getting back at the slavers"", we can definitely see a third part to this major revenge series coming that Quentin has been making. The screenplay was written out so great that he made every minute of the movie, especially the dialogue which is traditional of a Tarantino movie, interestingly enjoyable. Everything about this movie was solid in my book. I give this movie its deserved 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Having seen it, I am baffled by the misguided commentary about the film that greeted its release. No one seemed to realize that it is first and foremost a black (in both senses of the word) comedy. I found it extremely clever and funny throughout. Indeed, it seems to be as much an homage to Blazing Saddles and Skin Game as to the original Django. I had my usual language objections (mild by Tarantino standards), but not the one that seemed to bother everyone else.

The shackles have been dropped,"All the charm of ""Django"" is not in excellent stylistics, meticulous script and not in the first-class game and selection of actors. The director and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino is at the heart of this tangle of coolness, so you should start promoting this work with him.Tarantino, like his character, dropped the shackles of genres, difficulties in perceiving the fresh works and focused on what he loves and knows best - the 'spaghetti western'. At first glance, the genre is as simple as a gingerbread, water everything with ketchup and eat with actors, however, only Tarantino and one more person today can separately shoot spaghetti westerns and ""thrash"" without confuse these concepts. With all the comedy, blood and conventionality, Quentin draws within a single canvas of realistic slavery, realistic people, realistic love and in general digs traditionally deeper than you expect.With the hero of the day Tarantino all around his finger. Jamie Fox and Leonardo Dicaprio are as good as you can expect from them in this situation and even more. But the script is written, first of all, to Christoph Valz and with his participation in a painstaking process; he is the king here, he is the central character, this is his benefit. His talent creates once again such things that the film wants to be revised in any way. For this purpose, by the way, from 2013 distributors will start showing original movie tracks with subtitles in cinemas (in addition to dubbing), which will be very valuable for many.On this ""German"" element of the picture is not exhausted. Firstly, Django became a cult and found popularity in the 60's not only in America, but also around the world and especially on German soil. In their edges, as we have now, sometimes during localization they put the name ""Django"" in the name of films without any reason, simply because ""also spaghetti western"". Secondly, the story of a liberated slave and his beloved echoes the myth of Siegfried and Brunnhilde, the good thing is that the latter is called that. From all this symbolism, which Tarantino already has enough, comes legendary at all levels.Thanks to the dialogues, personal skills and plus all the make-up artists' work, the images of most of the secondary characters will be remembered, especially Samuel L. Jackson (the role of the bad grandfather was obviously successful) and the cowboy Don Johnson.And what happens to the music in ""Django""! The viewer is satisfied with a roller coaster of the epochs, Morricone starts, modern performers like John Ledgend continue, and Jerry Goldsmith, a classic, completes the ride. The selection is so diverse that it seems as if Tarantino wanted to please everyone. And he managed to do it.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Raunchy, Racist, and Radical!","Watched this movie on 6/16 not really knowing what to expect. All of my friends who saw it in theaters raved about how ""crazy"" and ""awesome"" Django Unchained had been. I for one viewed the movie as the title of my review describes; racist, raunchy, and radical! There are a slough of things I could get into about this movie but I will keep it short. I had heard through the vine that while being very comedic, this movie had a very Western atmosphere and was realistic in its interpretation of Slavery during the 1860's. That being said with Django's comedic and black righteous overtones, wrapped into a Western Movie, I was very satisfied with this movie. Characters: In terms of bounty hunting Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz couldn't have done a better job. Dr. Schultz sporadic personality combined with Django's hatred for Candie made for a kick-ass duo. Upon the introduction of Candie, I couldn't have hated him more, which made his death all the more satisfying. Leonardo DiCaprio takes on a likeness I've never seen in him as Calvin Candie, the ruthless black-hearted owner of the Candyland Plantation. From the tone of his voice, to the torture he put Django's wife through, everything in between made his death all the more righteous in the grand scheme of the movie. A few other points of interest to me were some of the special effects. During scenes in which people died (there are a lot) I found the amount of blood spilled to be a bit unrealistic. Especially when Django has a shootout in the big house. The amount of blood spilled wasn't a gross out factor, it was somewhat comical. My friends looked at me funny when I started laughing during that scene. A final thing that kind of turned me off to Django a little bit was the use of the n word. I mean it isn't a big deal, but I got kind of tired of hearing it five times every scene. SO, over all I gave Django a 7 out of 10. Seven points awarded for the fact that it was a near perfect blend of comedy,action, and historical fiction, and three points taken off for overuse of certain special effects, and the N word, but hey, other than that, pretty good flick for those who aren't afraid of a little blood and a few heavy words.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Quentin, please just calm down a little!!","Unlike many of QT's films - Django Unchained has quite a simple plot. The film is really all about revenge. The set up is that Django (Jamie Foxx) is freed from his life as slave by Dr Shultz (Christoph Walz) to help him track down 3 outlaws and in return he will help Django free his wife from her life of slavery. Simple.The film is a mammoth 165 minutes long - but the time flew by and the film kept me entertained from beginning to end.Django has everything you'd expect from a QT film, both good and bad. Excellent dialogue, rounded colourful characters, magnificent acting, a wonderful soundtrack and of course bucket loads of humour. Last but by no means least the most important element of any of QT's films - lots and lots of violence, blood and gore and liberal use of the 'N' word....... Unlike many critics, I don't have a problem with the use of the ""N' word. It certainly seems warranted in a film set in the deep south in 1858.Now, for the bad parts of the film. Some of the plot developments seem a little too silly, but that is forgivable. It is after all a work of fiction and not a documentary. But the one big unforgivable, is that QT needs to reign himself in, or to have someone strong that can stand up to him and reign him in. The final act of the film, was a little on the ridiculous side. I don't want to give anything away here, but it is pretty obvious where QT thinks, you know what, there just hasn't been enough blood and violence and crazy developments yet - so he just goes over board..... I've got to say, Quentin JUST STOP IT!!!!!I really don't understand how Django won the Oscar for ""Best Writing, Screenplay written directly for the screen"". Surely that honour should have gone to Wes Anderson for Moonrise Kingdom. I guess Django is a long film and most of the members of The Academy are very old, so probably feel asleep after 2 hours and missed most of the crazy last act.Having said all of that, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would have given it a better score if QT had have been a little less like a kid in a sweetshop in the last 40 minutes of the film!",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
just plain awful!,"I expected this movie to be awesome, since the director is awesome. I was sadly mistaken. I have to admit it had good points, but over all I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. Not only did it throw me off when they were playing rap music in a western movie, but in one second they were talking about going to find someone and the next second they knew exactly where they were and they were already there...really? And the sad thing is, is that I always use this website to compare the ""good"" movies that are out and this one had the highest rating... now it makes me wonder where the ratings really come from.

Amazing and very entertaining,"What an interesting film. The soundtrack is to never be forgotten, the acting was simply incredible (Christoph Waltz was especially my favorite in this film), and the story is unique and emotionally moving. Yes, it has the typical plot of one trying to fight back for his girl, but it is SO much more than just that. You witness the reality of the brutality toward the slaves, the compassion of slave- rights activists (such as Christoph Waltz's character), and the reality of needing to always fight for what you want.If Django Unchained taught me anything, it's that there are more forces out there stopping and discouraging me from achieving my goals in life than there is support; the only option I have is to literally live for and die for success in life. In fact, I don't have any other option than to live like that, unless I am OK going through life with people stepping all over me and my family. What a great film that will leave the viewer with quite a bit more adrenaline to get rid of the real bullies of their lives and finally be happy with who they are.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Bold and Uncompromising Masterpiece,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Django Unchained"" is a cinematic tour de force that boldly confronts the horrors of slavery in the antebellum South while delivering a thrilling and visually stunning tale of revenge and redemption. From its gripping opening sequence to its explosive finale, the film captivates audiences with its blend of sharp dialogue, dynamic characters, and unflinching portrayal of America's darkest chapter.At the heart of ""Django Unchained"" is the riveting performance of Jamie Foxx as the titular character, Django. Foxx embodies the role with a quiet intensity, portraying Django as a man fueled by a desire for justice and freedom. His journey from a slave shackled by chains to a gunslinging hero seeking vengeance is both empowering and deeply moving, serving as the emotional core of the film.Opposite Foxx is Christoph Waltz, whose portrayal of Dr. King Schultz, a charismatic bounty hunter with a moral compass, is nothing short of mesmerizing. Waltz's impeccable delivery of Tarantino's trademark dialogue infuses the character with wit and charm, creating a dynamic duo with Foxx's Django. Their on-screen chemistry drives the narrative forward, as they embark on a perilous journey to rescue Django's wife from the clutches of a sadistic plantation owner.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a chilling performance as Calvin Candie, the charming yet ruthless owner of the ""Candyland"" plantation. DiCaprio's portrayal of Candie is both captivating and terrifying, as he effortlessly embodies the essence of evil incarnate. His scenes are imbued with a palpable tension, as he exudes power and privilege with every word and gesture.Tarantino's direction is masterful, blending elements of spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation films, and historical drama to create a cinematic experience unlike any other. His keen eye for detail is evident in every frame, from the sprawling landscapes of the American South to the intricately designed sets of Candyland. The film's soundtrack, featuring an eclectic mix of classic and contemporary music, adds another layer of depth to the storytelling, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene."" Django Unchained"" is not without its controversies, as Tarantino doesn't shy away from depicting the brutal realities of slavery in all its ugliness. The film's unflinching portrayal of violence and racism may be difficult to watch at times, but it serves a greater purpose in shedding light on the horrors of America's past.In the end, ""Django Unchained"" is more than just a revenge tale-it's a powerful indictment of systemic injustice and a celebration of the human spirit's resilience in the face of oppression. With its stellar performances, gripping storyline, and bold social commentary, ""Django Unchained"" cements its place as a modern classic and a testament to the transformative power of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino does it again!,"In the mid-1800s, an American slave (Jamie Foxx) receives freedom in exchange for working for a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz). Much of the later part of the film takes place on a Tennessee plantation owned by a charming but very devious man (Leonardo Dicaprio). The film is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.Tarantino is truly an enigma. As he proved in 'Pulp Fiction' and more recently in 'Inglorious Basterds', he is truly one of the best film-makers of the past twenty years. Likewise, in those other films plus the 'Kill Bill' series, violence is used in excess to advance the plot. The same is true in 'Django Unchained'. Some of the violence is necessary (considering the evil of slavery) and always well executed. It is rarely, if ever, the in-your-face gore which is used by less talented directors. Still, Tarantino's skill in creating edge-of-your-seat tension and suspense is so strong, he doesn't always need violence.But with all the qualms aside, this is truly one of the best films of 2012. Despite its length of nearly three hours, every moment is intense and engaging. This is mainly due to the film-maker's brilliant use of camera angles, music and getting the best from a great cast particularly from Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson plays the complex role of a high-ranking slave who gains much privilege in exchange for his willingness to turn (often harshly) against his fellow slaves. His performance was sadly overlooked during this awards season. (Jackson also gave Tarantino a superb performance in 'Pulp Fiction'.)I often turn away from violent films. But in that genre, nobody does it better than Quentin Tarantino. He has another winner here with 'Django Unchained'. - dbamateurcritic",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Perfect,"This is what you want to see happen. Heroes and villians all hidden in great personalities. Jamie Fox on his best, Christoffer Wallace on his best, Leonardo DiCaprio on his best and Samuel L. Jackson on his best. Quentin Tarentino writes screenplays made for these specific actors. Every scene detailed and precise, second by second you want to see how the story unfolds. As a writer I have to reconize art.Eventhough historicly inaccurate, characistacly one hundred percent accurate. This is how black people were treated and this also shows how beautiful they can be or how ugly they can become under these circumstances.

If I were Steven Seagal I would have filed charges for copyright infringement!,1. take any Steven Seagal film 2. replace the random bad guys with white slavers 3. replace the martial arts guru with Dr Schultz 3. paint Steven Seagal black and you have Django Unchained!This film has no dept whatsoever. The humor is on about the same levelas the transformers brownie jokes were. Picking the obnoxiously smooth Jamie Foxx to play the poor slave also did not help me in getting any emotional engagement. I wish there was more content to rip on but this film barely contains any. In order to comply with IMDb's guidelines of at least having 10 lines of text I will continue typing some more. Im not a Steven Seagal fan yet I must admit I did not enjoy Django Unchained half as much as any Steven Seagal Flick. I always expect something good from Tarantino but this time I was let down. I would recommend you all watch this film and maybe someone can get any deeper meaning out of it.,,Anonymous,Drama
Surprisingly Enjoyable!,"Review: After reading the mixed reviews about this movie, I can actually say that I enjoyed it. The film wouldn't be anything without Christoph Waltz and DiCaprio, who completely smashed it. I'm glad that Taratino didn't do his long unnecessary speeches, which he is famous for, but I must admit, I did get a bit fed up with all of the racism. Who wants to relive those days! Anyway, the story wasn't mind blowing, but it did keep me entertained. It was better than I expected. Watchable!Round-Up: I couldn't really see anyone else playing Jamie Foxx's role, so I will blame it on the director why his character was so dull. He just lacked any emotion, which was definitely needed with the amount of crap he had gone through. I'm glad that Taratino kept the movie simple which made it easy watch, but I didn't understand the weird soundtrack which didn't suit the style of the movie.Budget: $100million Worldwide Gross: $425millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Westerns with a Quentin Taratino flavour. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Absolutely great movie!,"Western in the Tarantino's edition drew me from the first minute and kept in suspense until the very end, slowly revealing cards of the main character - Django. The movie is full of brilliant dialogues with an excellent play on words, humor and irony. It connects threads of friendship and hate, talking about slavery and racism at the same time. Of course, as befits Tarantino's scenarios, there was also bloodshed, but it wasn't as brutal as his previous productions. I consider this a definite asset of this movie.

I thought the characters were portrayed very well in the movie, however I thought Jamie Foxx's character was a bit too cocky at times and that didn't feel realistic considering the time that the movie is set in.

"Simply cool, marvellous and just wow","As I hate comments which endlessly rewrite the script, here is my take on the best movie I have seen in years.

Better than IB, razorsharp script - even in the German version this definitely shines through, cuedos to the translators, breathtaking photography, and what could you possibly say about the actors, apart from stellar. Foxx's transition from slave to a proud, cool as f**k free man is nothing short of mesmerizing. Waltz is marvellous, as opposed to his Landa, here we have a killer with charm and a heart of gold, sort of (it's Tarantino), but who really steals the show is de Caprio. He makes Mr. Blonde look like your dream son in law. You have to see it to believe it. Amazing, how Tarantino rips out performances from well established actors that you wouldn't believe they could deliver. The soundtrack is simply great, it suits the scenes in ways you wouldn't believe. Of course the splatter factor reaches heights formerly unseen, and admittedly I couldn't stomach two scenes and hid behind my hand, and you're in for some ""ear splatter"" too. So, everything you might expect from the master, but with this one he topped himself. Go and watch it. It is cool, eye candy and funny as hell.",,Anonymous,Drama

However, it's still a good movie and an enjoyable western (though some would argue the story's geographical location may prevent its categorisation as such). Its snappy dialogue and hyper-stylised bloody violence are clear signs that it is, in fact, a Tarantino movie first and a genre movie second. As usual, the director decides to ape as much from the genre as possible while projecting his voice from the mouth of every single character. Ultimately, though, this is an entertaining experience that only suffers slightly from its few flaws. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Entertaining, not as good a script as expected","One of the early reviews for this film lists it as 10/10, ""another Tarantino masterpiece"" but I totally disagree. I think this movie, while entertaining enough to get a moderate thumbs up, is neither as funny, as unpredictable, as original, or as exciting as his earlier films.It may be as violent, but the violence is, like the use of the 'N' word, a bit over-done. Tarantino, in a brief cameo, is the only one that avoids using the 'N' word (calls Django ""black"") which seemed a bit cowardly IMO, given that he gave the word multiple times to his other characters.The other annoying element- something he does in all of his music but almost too much here- is placing pop music in scenes for an added punch. I just felt that it seemed less effective here.Again, all that said, it's still entertaining enough. The acting is good, and the story moves along pretty well. I'm not sure if the Tarantino formula is getting old. I just think this script is not one of his best.

A Must Watch,"Oh boy I did not see that coming but knowing Quentin Tarantino once did deliver magic, I should have anticipated this. An absolute phenomenal feast of sheer acting brilliance compact into 165 minutes of western adventure is DJANGO UNCHAINED.Events occur in a time 2 years before the gi-normous civil unrest in the States. Django (Foxx) a black slave is bought off by Dr.Schultz (Waltz) from the prying hands of two slave traders. Dr. Schultz who is retired 5 years now from dentistry is a bounty hunter of the state and requires the assistance of Django to identify the Brittle Brothers who have a handsome bounty set on their heads. Django who agrees to assist Dr.Schultz does so in true Western-Foxx craze convincing me that Will Smith was wise to turn down the role because no one will play Django better than Jamie Foxx.Acting is indeed integral in any motion picture. The performance of the actors in this movie is more fundamental than any other movie of the recent past since the DJANGO UNCHAINED isn't about a variety of occurrences put together. Instead the movie follows Django every frame of the way making the audience involuntarily focus on the same set of actors which opens a window of opportunity to zero in on the vulnerabilities in the character portrayals. The best part is that there are no flaws, there are no hiccups. Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel Jackson and Christopher Waltz are jaw droopingly dazzling. I kid you not; there are moments in the art of the way some scenes are directed that I literally have my jaw drop only to embarrassingly notice it minutes later. One must try real hard to not like DJANGO UNCHAINED.Special note must be made for the Oscar winning performance by the Austrian Actor Christopher Waltz. Strangely enough that I could not stop myself from thinking that he sounded an awful lot like John Malkovich if he was to play to the same character. There is not a moment of boredom when Waltz delivers his lines. Evidently he is in full swing with his portrayal and coincidently he manages to bag in 2 consecutive Oscars with 2 consecutive Tarantino collaborations.Lastly this movie is a great comeback for Quentin Tarantino as his fans begin to wonder if he had burned his imagination with KILL BILL and PULP FICTION.

I don't understand the reasoning for this over the top ridiculous level of graphic violence. The movie doesn't need it. It's like they are trying make society think this is normal or invoke some other sickness on an already violent world. Also, lets do some research. People did not wear holstered pistols in 1855. They hadn't even invents those type of holsters yet. People didn't openly carry guns. If they even had a gun it was most likely just put in a pocket. And Django's sunglasses? Come on!

Django Unchained certainly isn't a masterpiece but it's bold and funny for sure.,"I'm a cinephile but I wasn't looking forward to seeing Django Unchained. Still, since I had some time, I went to the theater where the film was being screened. Django Unchained is a long film. Its running time is 165 minutes. Some people say that Quentin Tarantino is a great filmmaker, so he must have filled this project with meat. But no. There's just not enough meat here to justify the long running time. Instead there's fat and plenty of it. After Inglourious Basterds (2009), which is one of his best films, Tarantino wanted to make a spaghetti western. But he wanted the setting to be the Deep South before the Civil War. So he called his project a ""Southern."" He's not the first filmmaker to twist the word. Russian filmmakers made Western-like films as far back as the 1960s. They called them ""Easterns"" or ""Osterns."" One of the best films from that genre is White Sun Of The Desert (1970). Tarantino also said that he wanted to tackle the issue of slavery in the United States because America hasn't dealt with it well. The plot of Django Unchained is a simple one. Tarantino doesn't shy away from showing some of the worst abuses that happened as a result of slavery. But he still keeps things entertaining. The actors deliver good performances, especially Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. The film contains some of Tarantino's best written dialogue. The gunfights are some of the best ever committed to film. Despite all this the film is still, for the most part, a stylistic failure. For such a simple story it's too long and there are a number of scenes which serve no purpose. Tarantino gets good performances from the actors but his direction doesn't impress because he didn't do a good job at building scenes. He's known for including things that he likes in his films. Here he goes too far by including too many of his influences and too many songs that aren't really suitable for the material. Tarantino's previous editor Sally Menke knew how to cut his footage for a good result and when to reign him in. But now that Fred Raskin is the editor the film doesn't seem like the work of a great director. So, even though the cinematography by Robert Richardson is beautiful and even though the film is entertaining we still get something that seems average but bloody as well. With better direction and better editing it could have been a great film. Django Unchained is also Tarantino's funniest film yet. I recommend it but my recommendation isn't enthusiastic.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Make this short, sweet...You know the plot otherwise ya wouldn't be reading this. Movie works VERY...VERY WELL not only because of the dialogue but the clever use of the camera. The camera pans the idea of the point & even w/a sound effect to boot. Numbers of still shots of the characters during intense scenes, the eyes, slight physical responses that scream the reaction WITHOUT needing any dialogue. Yet...when dialogue is delivered, Tarantino continues to write better & better movie after movie & the actors who deliver are 4 STAR performers.

"8.6/10 - Ridiculing Slavery In a Great Way, Django is Deep Yet Accessible (and really good)","Once again, Tarantino manages to remind me some of the reasons I love cinema without losing accessibility even a little bit.Django Unchained follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave whose freedome is bought by the German dentist/bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (the legendary Christoph Waltz). After Django helps Schultz in his work (which was the original reason he bought Django's freedom), they both decide to work together for the winter, and then go and free Django's wife from her current owners.Like I said before, I love this film. The soundtrack is pretty great (it has some goofy songs here and there but I do think it fits the film well), as I've learned to expect from Tarantino. The cast is absolutely legendary. Samuel L Jackson, Waltz, Dicaprio - all of them totally slay their roles, in the best way possible. (Yeah, Foxx is also really good here, though I can't say his acting is as legendary as of the ones I've mentioned before).The plot is very well paced, and though there are some minor points that feel a bit weaker in that aspect (especially after the first act and towards the very end of the movie) I can't say that it's a big issue, really. I also love, love, love the cinematography. So many beautiful shots, symbolic moments that have deepness but are still quite accessible.Slavery is a concept that's so ridiculous, and the film emphasizes that point in a variety of awesome ways.It's also genuinely funny, thrilling and even moving at points. Can't not-love it.So, to wrap it all up, I'd say that Django does what it aims to do very well, both on a technical level and the ideological level. It's a fun, smart and well crafted film, and I honestly don't think that I have a single major criticism towards it. I'm feeling an 8.6/10 on this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Probably the best slavery movie ever made.,"Writer and Director Quentin Tarantino took the topic of slavery and mixed it with the western genre in which ""Django:Unchained"" was made. This film tells the story of a black slave in America named Django who is confronted by a German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz. The two characters make a deal that leads to the plot of the film, turning the story into a tale of drama, violence, and love. Keep in mind this is a Tarantino movie. If you know any of his films, then you know you're in for one hell of a ride. Django:Unchained is an action-packed historical/western film that reveals the harsh reality of slavery in America. The performances by the cast were outstanding; particularly Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson and the directing couldn't have been better.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Bloody, Gritty, Violent, Gross, Over the top! You get the idea!","Even though this movie is gritty, violent, bloody, and gross it is still one of the best films ever made! Quentin Tarantino did a phenomenal Job in everything that he did while making this masterpiece of a film! Now, i'm 14 years old and I've seen this film! that's OK. Because, I've learned to appreciate the work Tarantino has put into making this movie. So,I went into this movie not expecting much. i was expecting it to be a movie that's all about blowing people up but its not even close to that! this film takes itself very seriously! Even though there is a lot of blood, brains, and guts in this movie it is still out of this world! everything and every performance in this movie was so well don i just can't put into words how good i thought some of the actors did. There is a lot of N-words and F-words and S-words and D-words and blood and over the top violence. But surprisingly it is still a phenomenal masterpiece! First off there is an amazing soundtrack with explicit songs but the music really gets you into the mood of the film. The Candie land shootout is one of (actually the best) Shootouts I've ever seen in my life! i would so highly recommend watching this movie. But most kids should not see it due to the explicit elements i mentioned earlier on in the review. This film also has some of the best money shots I've ever seen and also some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in my entire life! 14+ is my recommendation although it is rated R/18A.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blazing Saddles of Django,"Mel Brooks comedy classic ""Blazing Saddles"" was the first thing that came to mind while watching ""Django Unchained"".And I'm obviously not alone in that.I read the screenplay beforehand, and aside from a couple of scenes, the comedic touch wasn't that evident. Thankfully Tarantino cut out a number of very vile rape-scenes, whose omission do nothing to soften the grueling and abhorrent behavior that shows man's cruelty towards man in all its gory-glory.The movie is too long for my taste. The last third could've been cut shorter, and some earlier scenes run on a bit too long. But aside from that, the script is tight, the art- and camera-work superb and the performances are spellbinding. There is not one loose chink in the ensemble chain. Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx have an unusual chemistry together, which is most evident in a very brief sequence where Django throws back the morals of his bounty hunting liberator Dr. King Schultz, and we make a first big step towards ambivalence.The other pairing is that of Samuel L. Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio. The former playing a black servant with the demeanor of a pure blooded white racist, and the latter presents himself as the most educated, tasteful and wealthy form of fascist ideologue with a scientific predilection. Tarantino does have a profound sympathy for the devil.Equally strong and mostly omitted in the reviews is the couple in distress. Foxx and the beautiful Kerry Washington fashion a whole romance out of very little cloth, and are seen only briefly together. Yet, their marriage and the reasons for Djangos journey are obvious and never simply implied. These two truly love each other.Nothing is as serious as comedy, and nothing as funny as dying. What ""Django Unchained"" does, next to inciting a long awaited discussion on the slavery past of the United States, freed from political correctness, is entertain and shock in equal measures. And it makes you actually wish for a straightforward comedy written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Now that would be a truly blazing saddle.",,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino at his best,"Django Unchained is the 8th movie of Quentin Tarantino, and, as always, he has made a great movie. It's a remake from a movie released in 1966, with an excellent cast on it. Great actors have made a great job. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Fox, Kerry Washington, Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson are part of the main cast of the movie, and those, in my opinion, deserved an Oscar. Set during slavery in 1858, it's the history of Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by Dr. King Schultz, who hires him as a killer to kill three brothers that are villains. After killing them, they go after Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is a slave of Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who is the owner of a farm named Candieland.. Calvin has a slave named (Samuel L. Jackson), who is important to the end of the movie.The movie is bloody, violent, with a lot of racist words and with a very intelligent script, which was successfully played by the cast. It's also funny and sad, where the acid dialogs on it are connected to the way that black people were treated at that time. Another important point is the soundtrack, which has a large variety of styles, going through rap until electronic music. The photography is also fantastic. Tarantino has created an excellent job again. Django Unchained was considered one of the best movies in 2012, with several Golden Globe and Oscar nominations, it worth the 2 hours and 45 minutes standing in front of the screen, watching Tarantino at his best.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A very enjoyable movie!!!,"This movie displays a good pattern of excellent and rapid scenes that will make you cry, smile and foremost make you think about older times. This movie has a thrilling story centering a powerful black man and a clever older gentleman.It has some aspects from classical western films. There will always be haters of incredible pieces of art such as this cinematic wonder.I believe that Quentin Tarantino did a splendid job of directing and featuring in this piece. Furthermore the film has an amazing soundtrack that elevates the storytelling ability of this film.The cast of this movie is the closest thing to perfection that I have seen. Jamie Foxx as Django was a phenomenal choice by the casting director. Di Caprio's performance is one of his best to date. Not to mention Christoph Waltz as a loving yet smart bounty hunter posing as a dentist. Although Samuel.L.Jackson's Character has a less than optimal in movie counterpart, He makes the audience further immerse themselves into the American south during the year 1858. This story builds on the American tragedy that is slavery.This film has something for everyone, Packed fight scenes with a lot of blood and gore, to the loving and calm conversations between long separated lovers.

One of Cinema's Great Revenge Stories!,"Django is an unflinching look at America's past of slavery and the Old West: and Tarantino brings his timelessly inventive style to tackle one of the United States' most sensitive topics in its storied history. This film is a blood-soaked revenge story that packs SO much oomph in its character arcs, its great music and punchy dialogue. It takes slavery and uses that idea as an out-and-out crucifixion of the idea throughout Django Unchained's 2-hour and 45-minute runtime.This film was an experience to remember at the movies when it came out, and rewatching it is still a powerful if somewhat harrowing experience because of the slavery aspect. Django doesn't pull its punches with the story's brave exploration of the pre-Civil War American South and its very well thought-out direction and closure of the character's arcs are done in ways that some of the best self-contained screenplays of the past managed to pull-off so seamlessly: i.e. Casablanca, Star Wars(1977), Back to the Future, Pulp Fiction (of course), Toy Story and Her (2013). Django's a fantastic film that's not only a pleasure to watch over and over because of its revenge but also a crucial piece of film history thanks to confronting slavery within the context of a good-old-fashioned Western.For such a heavy movie it's a masterpiece of its craft and what it's standing for: taking on American history and giving the audience unmitigated truth and vengeance in its confrontation of slavery.Django gets 5/5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

how I stopped watching the movies by Quentin Tarantino,"After seeing Django Unchained I decided to stop watching anything by Quentin Tarantino. This should have happened after Kill Bill, though (Part 1, for that matter, despite the fact that the author regards both parts to be one movie). I don't want to sound too negative, so let me add that I believe his best and only decent work is Jackie Brown (1997).Here it became clear to me how Quentin Tarantino wanted to make a movie in every genre he liked while working in the video rental in his early days. Just think of this sequence: Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained.Anyhow, the photography has been wonderful again, the colors warm and the actors dressed smart. Christopher Waltz has been great again, the rest of the cast less so. The script is Tarantino's ego tripping and leading nowhere while his small role proved to be abysmal.And there we reach the same old mystery surrounding Tarantino. An army of connoisseurs tried to explain the higher plane of his output. In the case of Django Unchained, the message is supposedly anti-racist and elevated to the level of some ultimate anti-slavery pamphlet. Strange, since from his interviews I understood that Quentin Tarantino has been a movie buff and has been making movies that he himself would like to watch. I haven't been able to detect any higher meaning there...What bothers me the most are the splatter scenes that came to be his so-called signature. It is somehow expected that there will be blood being abundantly spilt and this is considered a baroque exaggeration of violence, more of a ballet or an opera and less a documentary about violence. At the same time your average horror movie is dismissed displaying the same thing.",,Anonymous,Drama
He's back.,"If Quentin Tarantino wasn't making movies he'd probably be killing people, so we should all probably be a little grateful that he is actually still making movies. It's become commonplace to fall in love with his films, and then swiftly disregard them as the the exploitative rip-offs that they have become; films that riff off the success of Pulp Fiction. So, in some ways, Django is almost a return to form for the director, even if it still does contain a few of his tedious trademarks that he's developed. No one knows he is a talented director more than Tarantino itself, which is ultimately his main downfall.Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first: QT makes an appalling cameo, the film is too long for it's own good and there is still a pungent whiff of his gimmicky narrative technique of flicking here there and everywhere. However when putting that aside one could almost surmise that Tarantino has almost, almost, come of age in this film, as the theme of slavery is treated with a definite seriousness, however cursory. To casual onlookers though, this is still Tarantino being a child behind a camera with a rich dictionary of naughty words and bucket loads of blood.What sets this apart from his more recent output is that it has a story, a plot, and it's a welcome return to say the least. Jamie Foxx plays Django, a slave freed by Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who encourages him to become a bounty hunter, and subsequently claim back his wife from Monsieur Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). All three actors do a terrific job, especially DiCaprio, who suits the nutty-yet-dangerous character of Candie to a tee. Samuel L. Jackson is also worth a mention, as the head slave who is at once hilarious and threatening. What really steals the show is Tarantino's script (nominated for an Academy Award) which is very often hilarious; the audience I was with couldn't stop laughing!It's the most un-Tarantino Tarantino film in a while, while still being, er, a Tarantino film. The plot twists and turns, the set-pieces are terrific and the violence is deliciously graphic, making this into a highly enjoyable film for fans of the director or otherwise.

Not quite up to the mark,"I thought Inglorious Basterds was just fantastic. Each scene had so much tension built up, its almost difficult to watch the entire movie in one sitting. Django Unchained is far tamer in comparison. It's a pretty good movie but does not really reach the level of brilliance of Inglorious Basterds. It does have a couple of tension filled moments but quite as nail biting for me.Terrific performances all around. The stand out performance for me was Samuel L Jackson. Can't believe that was Nick Fury, incredible! My biggest disappointment was the character played by Christoph Waltz. I felt if his character in this movie was swapped with the one he played in Inglorious Basterds, there would be no difference what so ever. Not sure why Tarantino would do that, except for the fact the Waltz plays that character brilliantly.Overall, I think what works most, is that Tarantino has given this movie some breathing room from Inglorious Basterds (unlike the rapid fire from M. Night Shyamalan which grew tiring quickly). If this movie had come out a couple of years earlier, it would have been far more disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Their chemistry is what drives this movie and it does it rather well. The cinematography here is top notch and Tarantino proves he's probably the director that most wisely chooses songs for his movies... What takes this movie in my opinion to epic status is Leo's surprising role as a villain who most couldn't see Dicaprio do...but he excels in this role.

Tarantino is getting predictable,"I'm not the type to hand out a 1-rating to bring a movie's average down, but Django seems to receive more accolades than it should. From Reservoir Dogs on, I've seen every single Tarantino release in the theaters. This is the first time my friends had to carry me out - literally sleeping.Django starts off well enough, with a great opening salvo that locks down the Oscar for Cristopher Waltz in about 15 minutes. But after an hour, the script starts to drag, and the snappy one-liners disappear. By the time DiCaprio and Samuel Jackson enter, the movie is effectively on life support. Neither can save it, with the plot spelled out and the pace gone. The death knell comes from Waltz, who has to relinquish his lead role to the good - but not great - Jamie Foxx. Foxx is promptly sent into a revenge-by-the-numbers routine we've seen several times from Tarantino.Which is where I fell asleep. In the end, Django gets bonus points for its clever tackle of a tricky subject, and for a first hour that ranks among the most entertaining I've seen this year. But it's not in the league of Inglourious Basterds, which isn't in the league of Jackie Brown, which isn't in the league of Pulp Fiction.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Revenge, violence, torture and hatred glorification.","I didn't see inglorious bastards cause it sounded bad, and morally warped. I didn't mind kill bill because while it was a revenge movie, there was no really sadistic pleasure taken in causing extra pain, in that sense, it was emotionally realistic. Also the suffering and the anguish of the thirst for revenge was portrayed.These two latest films of QT's glorify burning seething hatred, torture, pleasure in suffering (Inglorious and Django)- the worst kind of traits you can humanly empathise with. Every one who is killed is ""a bad guy"", but the ""good guys"" are also bad guys, in that they revel in the suffering of others (not just the deaths by the way). The difference is only in the backstory, character focus, and degree of sadism. This blurs moral lines in horrible ways, and tempts you into taking satisfaction and joy, not just in victory, but in human suffering.This is some sick stuff, and I am going to wait until QT stops making revenge movies, before I revisit his movies. They have lost all real human emotional qualities and all sense of moral compass.

It is sharp and clever at the same time with excellent packaging. The performances are outstanding, and it is hilarious. It is a great film. Now that I've said that, I'm going to give a little warning about Tarantino's next films. This movie has no background or message to it. It can barely support itself. If It wasn't made by Tarantino, it would be terrible. Let me explain. Why can he throw all of these racial slurs and offensive materials at us? It isn't like he's trying to prove anything.

That being said... after watching the movie, it is truly a WELL directed and tasteful movie.

"Fabulously fun frolic, stunning imagery & a bucketful of belly laughs.","It's been said that Quentin Tarantino has lost his edge, and the evidence of Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds supports that. But that doesn't mean he's making poor films now. I may look a fool in a couple of days but I predict Django Unchained will pick up two Oscars tomorrow night: Best Original Screenplay for Quentin Tarantino and Best Supporting Actor for Christoph Waltz.It isn't classic Tarantino and it's far from a great movie, but it has elements of classic Tarantino and is a fabulously fun frolic with some stunning imagery and a bucketful of belly laughs. The dialogue is mostly sharp, frequently funny and largely eschews the trademark (and tedious) irrelevant soliloquies and it dances with as much action as the visual fights and explosions around it.The principal issue is that Django Unchained is just too long. The 165-minute running time isn't an issue per se, but it has far too many potential climaxes and doesn't know which one to take. More than that, Django Unchained isn't quite sure what type of film it is and has too many slapstick moments and odd scenes that change the direction of the genre without committing fully. Clearly Mr T set out to make a great film but perhaps the danger of having his level of success is that producers are afraid to step in when he veers away from great storytelling and into the danger zone of personal whims.Waltz, as the dentist-turned-bounty-hunter, Dr King Schultz, who buys Django (Jamie Foxx) his freedom from slavery is superb. He finds the right balance between sincerity and humour to be entirely compelling on the screen and some many of the funniest moments come courtesy of his brilliant delivery. Schultz is a more stable and reserved character than the Inglourious Basterds' Col Hans Landa but he is even more watchable because of it and Waltz seems to have cornered the market in gently off-kilter nut jobs.Foxx, playing against type in perhaps his most memorable role since Ray, is a joy to watch from the moment he arrives on screen looking like Darnell from My Name is Earl through to his transmogrification into the free man consumed with violent, bloody revenge as he searches for his wife. He duels with humour and steely anger with equal aplomb and is every part the leading man, though he would be little without Waltz by his side.Both Leonardo DiCaprio, as Calvin Candie, the plantation owner who owns Django's wife, and Samuel L. Jackson, as Stephen, his slave-cum-butler, have a good go at stealing the film and both bite great chunks out of the scenery in their contrasting roles. DiCaprio plays nasty in a cruel, vindictive kind of way and has surely shaken off the pretty boy days of Titanic now, but it is Jackson who has the most indelible effect on us, though that may not be always for the best reasons. Yes, he gives us enough to know that Stephen is as unpleasant as his is funny, but too often his antics as the old slave wander into the world of pantomime and needless slapstick.Tarantino isn't always generous to his actresses, though he has given us some great female characters. Broomhilda, wife of Django, is no Jackie Brown but Kerry Washington plays her with depth and compassion. She is the beauty, the sincerity and the reason for Django Unchained and as such she carries the weight without fault. While Tarantino serves us up plenty of horror, it is Washington that gives us reason to pause and contemplate the harsh inequalities of life in the deep south of America before the civil war.Musically, Tarantino is usually on the button, but here he again seems confused with the effect he wishes to create and, whereas Plunkett & Macleane placed modern music in a period film to clever effect, in Django Unchained there are times it jars. The music is inconsistent and occasionally pulls us in the opposite direction to the action. It isn't a reason not to watch this, but at times it just feels wrong.Tarantino's greatest skill is in the overall feel and effect of his films and, in his third collaboration with DoP Robert Richardson, he is bang on the money with most of his shots. Django Unchained isn't merely sprinkled with great shots, it's littered with them. Tarantino does spectacle well and here he is in overdrive. Heads explode, bodies erupt with geysers of blood, limbs audibly splinter and, in a moment of pure beauty, cotton plants turn into swabs as another demolished body sprays claret the full length of them. Stunning.Stunning, funny and beautiful. Just too damn long!For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tarantino's masterpiece,Everything about this movie is great. Tarantino is a genious,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not the great film it could have been,"You would be forgiven that, during a screening of Quentin Tarantino's latest Django Unchained, that one of the many directors the film plays homage to, is John Ford. After all, Ford all but made the American western genre his own, from early silents such as The Iron Horse (1924), to well-established classics like My Darling Clementine (1946) and The Searchers (1956), he brought critical adoration to a genre that was then seen as nothing more than popcorn cinema. But Tarantino hates John Ford, to quote - ""to say the least, I hate him [...] It really is people like that that kept alive this idea of Anglo-Saxon humanity compared to everybody else's humanity."" So, in Django, do we have a post-modern, anti-Ford American West, where a freed black slave is the hero, and the White Man the devil? Well, kinda. But this is Tarantino, and from what was clear from his previous film Inglourious Basterds (2009), he doesn't do things the regular way.Very much like Inglourious Basterds, the most intriguing thing I found with Django is its sheer unpredictability. The later work of Tarantino have elected to follow very much they're own path, ignoring narrative convention or story-telling tradition in favour of certain scenes or ideas that the director wants there, or focusing on a certain character when they really have no purpose being there. For example, August Diehl's Major Hellstrom appears from nowhere in possibly the finest scene from Inglorious Basterds. He has no other scenes, but his character is instantly intriguing, whereas such a scene and character wouldn't have been given neither the depth or the screen-time if done by somebody else. It is a basic cover-gets-blown scene, seen in a thousand other films, but in Basterds it becomes a masterwork of tension, and features some of Tarantino's best ever dialogue. You could call it indulgent, but Tarantino sees the opportunity to squeeze as much as he can from every possible moment.Django follows the same idea, but whereas this approach complimented Basterds' chapter-based structure and plethora of supporting characters and extended cameos, Django has neither the wealth of central characters, nor the sheer scope to be a complete success, or to justify it's massive 165-minute running-time. The narrative hook of Django finding his wife is given very little screen-time or focus that by the time this becomes important, its very difficult to really care. The more intriguing relationship that comes out of the film is in fact the one between Django and Schultz - polar opposites in terms of societal position and background - yet both in a situation that calls for them needing each other. The main bulk of the first two-thirds follows the two in the tradition of a buddy-movie, only they get along, and Tarantino manages to eject some fine comic moments into these scenes, as well some actually quite touching ones.Although he doesn't possess the sociopathic charisma as his Hans Landa from Basterds did, the character of Schultz is another triumph for Tarantino and Waltz both, the latter being recognised again by the Academy and receiving a Best Supporting Actor nod. Like Landa, Schultz is a social intellectual, a man able to use his wits and charm to lure his victims into a false sense of security before either blowing the top of their head off, or outwitting a town's marshal. But it is Waltz - and DiCaprio's maniacal plantation owner - that comes out of this most memorable, not the film's protagonist, Django. Foxx is perfectly fine in the role, as angry and posturing as you would want (""you gonna let me pick my own wardrobe?""), but sadly just as un-memorable. Tarantino seems so wrapped up in Schultz and the film's extreme violence that Django gets left out in the rain, lacking the iconic costume or the stand-out scene that, say, Uma Thurman's The Bride in Kill Bill (2003-2004) had.Spike Lee has said he will be boycotting the film, claiming the slave trade is not a subject for exploiting or trivialising, and opposes the excessive use of the 'n' word (something he complained about in Jackie Brown (1997) - a film that celebrated one of the most important era's for Black Cinema). It's a shame he will never see the film, as he would realise that not only does Tarantino take the matter seriously, but is the most brutal and explicit depiction of it I've ever seen. The violence is often over-the-top and cartoonish, yes, but is also disturbing and genuinely horrific (the Mandingo fight and dog scene being particular memorable). Tarantino also mocks the KKK (or an early version of it) in a scene which is in direct reference to John Ford playing one of the charging KKK in The Birth of a Nation (1915). Before the charge, they argue about the badly made eye-holes in their masks. It's a light scene given their intention, but goes on far too long to remain funny.As much as I dislike Tarantino (as a person), his films will always be irresistibly intriguing. Regardless of whether they're self-indulgent missteps such as Death Proof (2007), or strokes of genius like Inglourious Basterds, you will always be getting something profoundly different to anything that any other director is even contemplating. Django is no different, setting out on one path and ending up wandering several detours, like a fat kid happily chasing the scent of gingerbread. When we do get to the end, it suffers from a serious anti- climax - disappointing given the 150-minute build-up. This is not the great film it really could have been, due to the neglect of its lead, a lack of real focus, and a final half hour that seems to strive for super-cool moments of iconography, rather than giving the film the satisfying ending that it really deserves. Ennio Morricone's title song is amazing, however.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Two great actors, story needed cut before it became useless fantasy","Waltz and Jackson were great. The story should have ended shortly after Dr. Shultz loses in a cheap buy for Django's wife. Good story to that point, but from there it turns to fantasy.Ten lines needed to complete--okay. At the end Django hides behind a body and shoots who knows how many rifle and pistol shooters. These shooters can only hit the body he is hiding behind. These are shooters who are used to firearms, but they can't hit the Django--what B.S. After the Candie episode, It should have been cut short without all the fantasy at the end. I thought Shultz should have shook hands and ended the film shortly thereafter.

An entertaining yarn worth at least one viewing,"The acting was pretty solid all round, especially CW and LD, but also SJ who seemed to be enjoying his role no end.The stereotypical southern white landowners were amusingly portrayed and there was a fair amount of dark humour to be had from all the OTT racist remarks flying about.The opening half hour or so was very well done, but the story itself seemed to drag on a little towards the end and some of the latter plot directions lacked punch. It's a notch below the likes of Pulp Fiction and whilst at least one scene did attempt to build tension in typical Tarantino style, it wasn't as well done as perhaps a comparable scene in True Romance between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper.Overall an enjoyable couple of hours and a good addition to the Tarantino portfolio.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Intentionally bad, but utterly fails at being anything else.","Tarantino's third casting choice Jamie Foxx plays Django, a freed slave on a quest to rescue his woman from a plantation owner played by DiCaprio. The aim of the movie is to satirize the Spaghetti western and blaxploitation film and the way to achieve this, apparently, is to botch the entire thing as humanly possible as to make the end result so unwatchable, no one in their right minds could offer a serious critique anymore.The film consists primarily of intentionally bad shoot-em-up scenes, superfluous dialog, outrageous yet totally unwitty cinematic clichés, lousy editing and ridiculous cameos. The soundtrack has to be heard to be believed.The heap of adolescent nonsense Tarantino has been writing/directing over the last decade or so fails to meet any expectations one might have had after seeing Pulp Fiction almost 20 years ago. Quentin's films have been so consistently and distinctly inferior compared to that masterpiece, they can hardly be considered disappointments anymore.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

certainly delivers on its promise,"Tarantino is back at it again, taking his talents to another genre and presenting this bold, brutal, and unconventional 'western' set in the Deep South during the late 1850s. Django is a man on a mission—a freed slave who forms an unlikely alliance with a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter as he goes on a daring trek through various slave plantations to try and rescue his wife from the clutches of a cruel, eccentric Francophile. Combination western, buddy movie, and action-thriller, it delivers what you'd expect with searing action scenes, appropriately incendiary dialogue, and larger-than-life characters, all presented in an anything but straightforward manner. Takes much too long to get where it's going, and has a third act that runs on violent overdrive, but like most of the director's previous efforts it's memorable and well-acted. Foxx is well-cast as the titular character, Waltz matches him as the secondary one, and DiCaprio has an especially meaty role as the vile antagonist, but no one shines more than Jackson who creates one of his most memorable characters to date. Odd, outrageous, and unsettling, but wildly good fun. ***",,Anonymous,Drama
"Terrific Acting, awful music choices, cheesy violence.","I'm going to start with the positive. The acting is PHENOMENAL. Especially DeCaprio, he stole the show in every scene he was in, creating a superbly played villain. Jamie Foxx pulled off a style (later in his character development) that I haven't seen in a western character in a long time and loved. SOME of the soundtrack is good... the parts that sound like a Western soundtrack. Given that the movie starts off with classic Western music and titles, my hopes were up.The Bad:The Music: the occasional and random rap songs took me out of the moment that the acting pulled me into. Completely ruined the mood and the immersion. This movie could have been incredible if it had stuck to the Western-style score.The Violence: The blood, which is prolific, is very fake looking, a pale red and in cartoonish amounts. While I think a rated R western could work out very well (just dial up True Grit's PG13 violence slightly), this comicbook - style violence broke the immersion of the otherwise very realistic setting (the brutality of the pre civil war south). Poor style choice alongside the random rap pieces makes you feel like this is Black Panther: 1859 edition.The Editing: While in some ways the cinematography was very well done, the post processing adds some very strange and unsettling filters to many of the shots. I found it to be highly annoying.Ultimately, the climactic moments of this film ended up leaning heavily on the aspects of the filmmaking that I did not like, which was unfortunate. In my book, this movie was so close to being a 9/10, but for a few choices in the making that make parts of it neigh unwatchable.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fantastic!,"I was aware of Django's existence more for the infamous Krishnan Guru-Murthy interview with director Quentin Tarantino than anything. You know the interview. It's the one where Quentin is asked about the link between film violence and real violence, to which he ""shuts -the interviewer's- butt down."" It's one of those great badass Quentin Tarantino moments, and I couldn't be happier that this is the film that would be tied to the iconic moment. Because the interview, despite that segment, isn't altogether bad (on Quentin's end, anyway) and the film itself is incredible.Django Unchained portrays (in the best way someone forced to work under the MPAA censors are permitted) slavery in an eye-opening way that manages to be heartbreaking while still maintaining the interest of the viewer. It was successful in creating an open dialogue about slavery and racism that we didn't have prior to this film, and it's something I'll always be grateful to Quentin for doing.
Django is a sobering movie with an important message, respectfully handing the subject matter when necessary but also giving the audience the cathartic violence they come to expect from a Tarantino picture. It's an epic 165-minute piece that doesn't feel at all like it runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes. It was incredible, without a dull moment or a minute of filler.

Art is not found in seeing a semi-detached human head continue to bleed, the result of multiple gun shots.Whether practiced by street crooks or fawned-over Tarantino, serial killing is ghastly.

I left the theater disappointed, because IMDb counted this movie very well, and, in my opinion does not deserve this high quotation of 8,6, because Tarantino decided to make Django an hero like an Jean Claude Van Damme character', known for killing seven men in a role. Tarantino, if you wanted to show how a black slave suffered in the 19th century, you shouldn't have improvised the end , to transform Django a killing machine. With that horrible ending, in my point of view, Tarantino took serenity and realism to the movie. Despite those errors, the film is good.

"Good fun, but self indulgent even by Mr. Self Indulgence's standards.","I would love to get inside good ol' Quentin's head and know exactly what his intentions were when making this thing as that would make it a damn sight easier to review the bugger. For me Django Unchained is potentially many things but fails to be specifically anything, making it almost an enigma. However I prefer to refrain from using that word as that sounds too much like a compliment.Is it a serious depiction of the age of slavery in America? Is it a buddy comedy? Is it a spoof? Is it a homage to westerns of a bygone era of cinema? Is it just an orgy of over the top violence? Well, there is potential for Django Unchained to be any of these things. However, all that it feels like is Mr. Self Indulgent being even more self indulgent than ever with no actual idea of what he is trying to specifically make.I fail to see how it is possible for this to be a serious document of a moment in history. I would be out of my depth commenting on this too much, but when there are so many moments of outrageously cheesy and over the top dialogue, as well as some outrageously hammy performances (DiCaprio and Sam Jackson in particular) and moments which are intended to be farcical and humorous this cannot simply be possible. There have also been complaints about the language used throughout the narrative, but I am not going to dwell on this as I think it is pretty obvious that this is not ever meant in a derogatory or insulting way. Anyone who knows me will know I have plenty of bad things to say about Tarantino, but I firmly believe the language used is solely there to represent the language used of the era it is set.However, to say Django Unchained is not like Blazing Saddles is not entirely true. There is far too much farcical humour here that is genuinely funny, but detracts from this ever being a serious film. It is the comedy and Tarantino's eye for snappy and witty dialogue that is Django Unchained's saving grace. The first third is an absolute blast; it is tremendous fun and works perfectly as a buddy comedy that never takes itself too seriously. Waltz is on top form and a joy to watch whenever he is on screen, Foxx is however very forgettable in what is supposed to be the title role. It is the charismatic and extremely likable character of Schultz that not only seems to drive the narrative forward but makes Django Unchained effortlessly watchable and tremendous fun.However, when the two protagonists go to retrieve from Von Hilda from Candie in the final two hours (!), this is when Django Unchained takes a serious nosedive and becomes almost knotted up in its own self awareness and indulgence. As with most Tarantino films Django Unchained contains many obvious moments of 'inspiration' from films and genres of the past. There is of course nothing wrong with this, but Quentin just seems to be like Peckinpah, then Sergio Leone, then John Ford. These are all great film makers of this genre, but here this just leads to a frustratingly uneven tone to the narrative which does actually get quite boring at times. Quentin is obviously a man full of ideas, but he needs to develop some kind of filter to know to leave the bad ones out of his films. There is still an amateurish sense of a man that knows a lot about films, but nothing about making films. I know a lot has been said about the running time, and I am afraid I will have to say I am in agreement as Django Unchained is at least 45 minutes too long. There are so many moments, both of action and dialogue that add nothing and just make Django Unchained an effort to watch.In the final third when the (occasional) action happens and the whole theme of 'vengeance' takes over this is once again all done with a lot of filler that detracts from the potential guilty pleasure fun that could be had by the ridiculously over the top violence. The whole experience feels very frustrating in that when things are going to kick off, they infuriatingly do not. There are also some very lazy plotting devices to keep things ticking over: The plot device that Schultz is German and Von Hilda was raised by Germans feels a little too contrived and almost Dickensian in terms of its neatness. This would work if the film was constantly tongue in cheek, but due to the running time and self indulgent tone, it cannot help but feel a little lazy.In my opinion, the fact is the protagonist and actual story are too weak for this to ever work as a serious character driven vengeance thriller, especially one that is 165 minutes. Also, two minor quibbles: A director cameo involving an embarrassing Australian accent and occasionally using 21st century rap music were very bad ideas Quentin!In summary, (yes, finally) with all the comedy, over the top performances, even more over the top violence and a (much) shorter running time, Django Unchained would work perfectly as a not to serious fun period romp that even gets away with a little self indulgence. It is certainly worth a watch with some genuinely great moments, but prepare to be frustrated by an uneven, inconsistent self indulgent narrative mess.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
total waste and terrible exploitation of the genre,"One can not stand without wondering as to how on earth someone can spend so much money with so great actors in the middle of a huge financial crisis all around the world. Except Samuel Jackson's great acting, there is nothing but a total carnage in this film. One crazy lunatic comes along, spends a huge budget, uses great names, like Morricone, and all the actors, and come up with a total waste of resources. I guess this film shows the level of mess Tarantino is at his film making ability. He totally messed up the entire Django and spaghetti western related themes, ruined the memories we had about these films.I just don't know where to begin in criticizing this film. The storyline flow, meaninglessly long but nonsense dialogues, exuberantly extended gory blood scenes, and on and on. As I kept saying, Tarantino has been on a downward slope in his career since Jacky Brown, and this film is probably lower than the bottom side. I think, or, if I were in level of authority in Hollywood, I would have banned Tarantino in making any film without going thru some treatment of some kind. I am having serious problem in understanding how on earth studio execs would fund such a carnage. I guess, this would be the last time I go and watch any Tarantino movie anymore. The level of mess in the film is beyond any explanation. If any person would do what Tarantino does in his business, he probably would be taken directly into jail by the account of misusing the company resources. What Hitler has done to the world is nothing compared to what Tarantino did to the world of spaghetti western genre. It is also bewildering to see such names like Morricone putting his name to this carnage. Despite the fact that I am a huge fan of Spaghetti Westerns, I fell asleep three times during the film. Such a huge failure beyond any explanation. I hope Tarantino stops fiddling with old films, and leave us alone with our good old memories. It is almost as disrespectful as pissing on your grand father's grave. I think people like Franco Nero should have rightly gone crazy to see how his main film was exploited so badly, and people like Sergio Corbucci would have turned twice in his grave seeing this carnage.I suggest don't even waste your time in considering this film.

Brutality and fun,"On my continued journey across Tarantino films, the next that was immediately available to me was Django Unchained. Of the Tarantino films I've seen, this is my least favourite although I've only seen 3 others. Despite this, Django Unchained is an excellent film and worth-watching.Like many Tarantino films, it is well-shot, well-acted and expertly written. The dialogue is once again a highlight and once again we see Tarantino's remarkable ability to imbue dialogue scenes with huge amounts of tension. The film doesn't shy away from the brutality faced by slaves yet like Inglorious Basterds, there is a masterful balance of humour and drama.Of course the cast and characters are excellent. Jamie Foxx does pretty well as Django however he does lack some of the charisma and range that other Tarantino protagonists possess in the films that I've seen. Obviously, the star of the show is Christoph Waltz as Dr King Schultz, completely charismatic, charming yet angry and upset at the treatment of slaves. Another major standout is Leonardo Dicaprio as Calvin Candie. He brings such menace and humour to the antagonist and while he doesn't reach the heights of Hans Landa, his introduction and presence provides the most amount of tension in the film.Overall, Django Unchained, while my least favourite Tarantino film I've seen, it is still an excellently acted, directed and written movie and is a terrific movie nonetheless.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

How do you like the bounty hunting business?,"My favorite Tarantino film so far, Django Unchained is a masterpiece of storytelling set in the backdrop of 1850's America where slavery is the norm. Dr. King Schultz and Django Freeman embark on a quest to enact justice upon the most wanted in the country while taking a not-so-slight detour to save Django's wife, Broomhilda. With incredibly well-shot scenes and excellent character development, Django fails to disappoint with both its deep dialogue and themes as well as its over-the-top action and blood (of which all in the film seem to be laced with gunpowder). DiCaprio as Calvin Candie, Jackson as Stephen, Foxx as Django and Waltz as Schultz present some of the best performances I've seen to date, fully embodying the good and evil of the Deep South, their facades as deep as the shallow mass graves. Touching on slavery isn't an easy thing to do, but Tarantino manages to weave these excellent personalities into the mix with fantastic dialogue that is both superficial at times but also peppered with meaning and depth. And as always, the soundtrack is wonderfully made with the help of Luis Bacalov and many others, providing a western that's on par with Clint Eastwood's greatest hits. Much like Tarantino's other films, Django Unchained fiddles with time and at first glance it may be difficult to understand the plot, but watching the film over (and over) again results in clarity befalling the viewer and the uncovering of uniquely grim, but expertly woven, metaphors that illustrate the desparity of the time.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

For example, Christopher Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio talk on the dinner table for literally an hour before anything happens. The pace of the ending ten minutes is very very quick, and if the previous 2.5 hours were that quick the film would have been shortened by at least 1.5 hours.

"Some of his best, and some of his worst","I always have somewhat mixed feelings about QT's movies but only in scrutinizing specific sections or scenes. The overall effect for this movie lover is pure joy. Quentin loves the same movies I did growing up. His obvious admiration for them is always welcome. Not sure which of his are my favorite but I'll start with Pulp Fiction as my number 1 (yeah, easy and safe i know) and then maybe Jackie Brown. Followed by The Hateful Eight and Inglorious Basterds. Of course all of them including Django Unchained are not far behind. I think my only criticism of Django and some others is based on the same issue - QT has a tendency to oversell certain scenes and points. The easy to pick on ones from Django are the scenes with Big Daddy and his gang complaining about their hoods, and the Mandingo fighting. They could have been trimmed or in the case of the hood scene, cut altogether. Also the final scene at the dinner table hosted by Candie was unnecessarily long. I know QT is in love with language and the scenes with his characters talking are sometimes a highlight, they also can drag the movie down.That said, I again love Tarantino's flicks and a few are on my desert island list. There are minor quibbles in comparison to the overall effect of a viewing of any of them. Just my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good Tarantinoesque Entertainment,"I watched this movie knowing it was a movie by Quentin Tarantino, and what did I get? A Tarantino movie. I'm not his fan, nor do I despise any of his films in particular, but I've watched and heard enough to know what to expect from him. Thus, I didn't hope this one to be historically accurate, too logical or unexaggerated. That being said, what I got was: exciting, gory and even fun scenes, which managed to keep me awake past midnight during the almost 3 hours this film lasts. That alone is an achievement. Some of the actors were cast better than others(i.e.: Waltz>Foxx), but none of the performances were less than decent. The soundtrack was going really neat. However, I was truly disappointed by the rap/hip hop tracks. I'm all up for anachronisms and culture mixes when they fit the purpose, but these just didn't flow along with neither the scenes or the theme of the film itself. There were some weak points in the plot which turned me down a little bit (especially after the 2 hours mark), but the outcome, though predictable, makes up for it. All in all it is a very entertaining experience, all the more enjoyable when you are prepared on what you might get from this director... Also, I enjoyed his little cameo.

Unshackling History,"""Django Unchained,"" directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a film that unapologetically tackles the brutality and absurdities of slavery in America, all while weaving a narrative of revenge, love, and liberation. The film starts with a strong narrative foundation, introducing us to Django (played by Jamie Foxx), a slave who becomes a free man under the guidance of Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German bounty hunter. The story's arc is clear and engaging, driving towards Django's quest to rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), from a malevolent plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).Tarantino's unique style is evident throughout, blending stark violence with dark humor. The thematic depth here is not subtle; the film confronts the horrors of slavery head-on, juxtaposing them against a backdrop of stylistic choices that are quintessentially Tarantino - including a carefully selected soundtrack and his trademark extended dialogues. These elements add a layer of complexity to the film, engaging the audience in a narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is visually compelling.The technical expertise of the film is commendable. Cinematography by Robert Richardson captures the sprawling landscapes of the antebellum South with a richness that is both beautiful and haunting. The editing and pacing keep the audience engrossed, though some may find certain scenes indulgently lengthy.Performance-wise, the cast delivers exceptionally. Foxx portrays Django with a simmering intensity, evolving from a subdued slave to a confident, vengeful hero. Waltz, as always, is a delight, infusing Schultz with a mix of charm and lethality. DiCaprio's portrayal of Candie is chilling, presenting a villain both charismatic and repulsive. Samuel L. Jackson's role as Stephen, Candie's senior house slave, adds another layer of complexity to the narrative, showcasing a character torn by survival instincts and ingrained servitude.On a personal note, ""Django Unchained"" resonates deeply. It's a film that doesn't shy away from the uncomfortable truths of history, yet manages to deliver a story of empowerment and justice. The emotional journey of Django, his transformation from a chained man to an unchained hero, is both satisfying and thought-provoking. The film's ability to balance historical commentary with a compelling personal story is a testament to Tarantino's skill as a filmmaker.In conclusion, ""Django Unchained"" is a bold, unflinching portrayal of a dark chapter in American history, told through the lens of a master storyteller. It's a film that stays with you, challenging your perceptions while delivering a narrative that is equally entertaining and enlightening. This is a film not just to be watched, but to be experienced.** PLEASE NOTE: THIS MOVIE IS GRAPHIC AND SHOWCASES OUTDATED CULTURAL DEPICTIONS. HOWEVER, IT'S 100% WORTH A WATCH FOR EVERY MOVIE LOVER. **",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"it's Tarantino, you know what to expect","So, it's a Tarantino movie, we know we will get over the top violence, we know we will get abusive language and we know it's supposed to chock. The movie itself is good.Jamie starts out a very believable slave and sells his character very well.Naturaly or maybe not, it depends on your taste, Sam ""Jules"" Jackson and Christoph Waltz steal the show.It's a shame Kerry Washington's character didn't get to be better developed, but then again who had the time, right?The music is expertly used throughout the movie and the ""Trinity"" wink at the end is a wonderful addition.On to what really got people fired up: the word most people from the US are afraid to use and refer to as the N word.Yes, it gets used a lot, and I mean a lot. Yes, the overall language might be offensive for some people but no, this particular part of the movie is not over the top.It's about slavery, it's about racist views of most characters including black characters. So the N word is well used, it's not exaggerated it's very appropriate having in mind the time and place where the actions happens.Yes, slave owners, as well as regular folk would call black people the N word, it was as natural as saying the sky is blue and that slave is a N The violence doesn't spoil the picture at all although it is very exaggerated.And there is no reason to find this a racist movie, nor it depicts all white men as ""the villain"".",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

The amazing Tarantino,"""Django Unchained"" rides into the Wild West with my 7/10 rating, and I must say, I liked it. Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the titular character is a captivating journey of vengeance and justice, while Christoph Waltz delivers a masterful performance as the eloquent bounty hunter. The film editing weaves a brutal yet compelling narrative, with Tarantino's signature style leaving an indelible mark. Its strength lies in its unflinching exploration of slavery's horrors and the cathartic satisfaction of Django's quest for freedom. The music, blending Ennio Morricone's iconic compositions with modern tracks, adds an electric backdrop, and the cinematography captures the stark beauty of the American frontier. ""Django Unchained"" is a bold and unapologetic take on a dark period in history, a reminder that justice can sometimes wear a cowboy hat, and my liking for it is as fierce as Django's resolve.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Emperor has no clothes,"Straight to the top of the most over-rated movies of all time list, easily over-taking Inglorious Basterds at number two. The weaknesses of this director should have been seen through years ago (pretentious music, in-jokes, ridiculously gratuitous references, no chemistry between actors EVER, characters sitting around explaining the plot to each other halfway through etc.) but for some reason millions of people seem ready to fork out admission in order to make the scene. Oh that's right, I remember the reason... the same reason that makes Grumpy Cat a blockbuster YouTube hit and soccer the world's most popular sport... the Dumb are taking over the world.Strictly for the easily impressed who need Cool spelled out, and actually a cautionary tale of what cocaine can do to a once precociously-talented writer, this is cinema mendacite, both derivative and indulgent... all of Fellini's excess with neither Melville's detachment nor Cassavetes' restraint... perfect for disguising Christoph Waltz's negligible talent but a blot on the copybook of Walton Goggins.Preposterously stereotyped characters chew plot contrivances so thin the moments of luridly fetishist violence and trite liberal humour need to overlap, exposing trite liberals as more easily pleased by shout-outs than substance, let alone annoyingly happy to re- gargle the latest Tarantino this-and-thats while slouching around water coolers, unaware that a whole other half of the world is as scornful of their tasteless degeneracy as they are desensitized by it.Congratulations twerps, by scoffing this spicy baby food of dismemberment and buggery with both hands, all you've done is gone and made Christianity edgy. Yes Quentin, we get it, Republicans are evil because daddy didn't love you enough. The morality of Michael Moore meets the aesthetic of Steven Seagal and the ego of Donald Trump. Vile. The emperor has no clothes. Wake up.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Django Unchained,"Quentin Tarantino is insane. And I say that with a complete smile on my face. This is yet another one of his great pieces of work that has his style written all over it. The film takes place in the south during the 1850s, which is when slavery was still legal, and man buys a slaves freedom and he then helps him as he is a bounty hunter chasing down fugitives. But during this process he then discovers that Django has been separated from his wife due to slavery so he helps him locate her on a absolutely evil plantation with a evil plantation owner. This is classic Tarantino and just a great film. Samuel L. Jackson and Jamie Foxx are fantastic in this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Very Tarantino-Esque Movie Set During The Slavery Days,"Pros:
1. The set and costume design is fantastic as they're well-designed and incredibly intricate.
2. The score and soundtrack add a fresh and lively feel to the film.
3. The blood and gore is amazingly gory and devastating, thus adding more weight to those moments.
4. The comedy is expertly placed, and it never out-stays its welcome by confusing the tone.
5. Both Jamie Foxx (Django) and Christoph Waltz (Dr. King Schultz) have brilliant chemistry together.
6. Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio (Calvin Candie), and Samuel L. Jackson (Stephen) deliver great performances.
7. The cinematography is really beautiful with the zoom-ins doing a wonderful job at adding to the tension.
8. The dialogue, as usual with Quentin Tarantino, is mesmerisingly and intelligently crafted - especially with Dr. King Schultz.
9. The action scenes are thrilling, well-shot, and amazingly choreographed.Cons:
1. Most of the white characters, aside from Dr. King Schultz, are cartoonishly presented as either evil or bumbling fools.
2. The slow-motion looks awful and is completely unnecessary.
3. The Quentin Tarantino (The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Employee) cameo was severely distracting, particularly with his awful Australian accent.
4. Somehow, when Django shoots Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly (Laura Cayouette),she flies backwood suddenly which makes no sense.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A movie you can watch again and again,"It's funny rifling through some of the bad reviews on here. People that ended up giving this movie 1 or 2 stars. It just amazes me how people go out of their way to put down something I'm sure they genuinely enjoyed.Just check out a few of the 1 or 2 star reviewers history and you'll start to see a pattern.. like one reviewer gave other movies like American sniper, arrival, nocturnal animals, shutter island all the same treatment.. I just don't get it. If these movies were so darn awful then what do u find entertaining and worth ur time. These reviews can't be taken seriously and it skews the overall metrics for a great movie. I can understand if you could possibly give this movie around a seven if you have some decent reasoning around it; but 1 star??? Just unbelievable and laughable.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
