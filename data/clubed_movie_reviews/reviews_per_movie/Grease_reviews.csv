It's improved with age...,"The movie has proved more durable than anyone would have thought. It took substantial critical hits for being a Califoria-ized, Olivia-Newton-John-ized adaptation of a beloved, long-running New York show. At least, we mused at the time, they changed the story so they wouldn't have to make Ms Newton-John affect any sort of American accent: certainly not a New York one.And yet it seems to stand up well on its own. The New Yorker observed at the time that nobody involved with this movie was alive during the era it was supposed to depict, but they clearly had a fine time with the music. Yes, the scenes were clearly from sunny 1970's California, but this didn't bother the kids who saw this in 1978, and enough time has passed that it shouldn't bother us who remember that it was supposed to be in Brooklyn, in the '50's.Have fun, kids.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Energetic, good spirited nostalgic fun!","I will admit I didn't like ""Grease"" very much at one point, but like some other musicals, it has grown on me. It is just a fun film, yes with some corny dialogue and some slow moments, but the performances, choreography and songs more than make up for any misgivings. I like how ""Grease"" is filmed, the cinematography is smooth, and the costumes are lovely to look at. The script has some nice raunchy humour, if a little corny at times. Also there is a nice compelling story in general, even if it is slow in spots. The performances are of high energy. John Travolta, is it just me or wasn't he really sexy here? I thought Tim Curry was sexy in ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" but Travolta's Danny who swivels his hips like Elvis brings a different kind of sexiness as well as acting like a tough kid, which he isn't really. Olivia Newton-John, dressed in whites and creams looks beautiful and is appealing as Sandy, she is almost unrecognisable in the final musical number. Stockard Channing provides a voluptuous contrast as Betty Rizzo, and does it with swagger. What makes this movie enjoyable are the song and dance numbers. I wasn't keen on the songs when I first saw the film seven years ago, but as I have been re watching the film over the years, like the film they have really grown on me. ""Summer Nights"", ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", ""Grease Lightening"" and ""We Go Together"" are classics. Overall, this film is fun, you mayn't like it first time, but if you give it another chance it could well grow on you. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
'It's Still the Word',"Sandy and Danny, their names alone mean nothing, together they represent the film we all know and love that brought us 'Summer Nights' and 'Greased Lightnin'. Grease is an infamous musical-play turned film, adapted and produced by Allan Carr, chartering the summertastic rock 'n' roll of the 1950s, centring on the highs and lows of a group of teenagers at high-school, Rydell High.The film begins with two people having a summer romance, Sandy (Newton-John) an uptight, na√Øve, nerdy Australian girl and Danny (Travolta), a 'jack-the-lad' 'T' bird. After the opening credits which are amusing cartoons of the main characters we see the two well known groups of teenagers, the Pink Ladies and the 'T' Birds going back to school after summer vacation. The rest of the film centres mostly on the relationship of Sandy and Danny, the problems they face, and the ups and downs of their high school chums. The main characters and the unusual pairing of Sandy and Danny makes for comfortable viewing.My favourite part of the film is the music, this film has such a brilliant soundtrack. If you have the chance to watch the film on DVD you get the added bonus of a songbook. However with a musical film you do find some parts unrealistic when they sing, why would a group of lads sing Summer Nights for example? Yet that aside the songs, mostly corny love songs are addictive and easy to pick up unfortunately will be in your head all day. Grease may not have had a lavish budget like films made today, but this 1978 film directed by Randal Kleiser still manages to have great audience appeal. Its' scenes and costumes are basic and probably didn't break the bank to produce but this all adds to the realism of the film.I like the film and could watch it over and over again. Newton-John's debut performance is excellent but her character Sandy is too 2D and has no depth. Travolta's performance is to perfection and this film benchmarked his film career. Danny is 3D, he can be loving, self obsessed, a saviour and a winner, whereas Sandy to me is just a bore. All characters bring something different to the film making it a success. Rizzo is the hard nosed cow, bitchy about Sandy, possibly jealous, who seeks revenge on her boyfriend by going out with his arch enemy. There is also Marcy who loves the men and has lots of boyfriends, and Frenchy who becomes Sandy's best friend who is caring.This uplifting, audience grabbing film may be slightly cheesy but there is just so much to love about it, especially the soundtrack and dance moves! This gives it longevity making it such a great film that could be the best musical ever made. This classic film deserves a 5/5 just for being groovy! But I just can't stop thinking why is it called Grease?!",,Anonymous,Romance

A timeless classic.,"I watched this when it was transmitted over Christmas, and then watched in horror as the offended brigade started complaining.Made in 1978, it's the ultimate feel good film, sure it's over the top, it's absurd, and some of the scenes will have you maybe feeling a bit cringe worthy now, but it still remains a great film.As a youngster I watched it frequently, it's funny how some films stick with you, could I really believe in most of them as High school students, well I did back then.It is all about the music, music which is still iconic, and hopefully will be heard at theatres in the not too far off future.Would you make a film the exact same way now, of course not, is it ok to love a film made back in 1978, yes it sure is.Watch for the music, ending, and of course John Travolta.It really is the word. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Brings Back Memories,"Every time I see this movie it brings back memories of the first time I saw it. It was my first year away from home at boarding school. Most teenagers loved Olivia Newton-John, well I did anyway being a 13 year old Australian.It was probably one or the first movies I saw away from my parents and it has stuck with me ever since and I am by not stretch a fan of musicals at all. In fact I rarely ever watch them, but this one I have seen more than a few times.There are few films that have had such a lasting impact on popular culture and it is one of the few films, that are parodied and remembered as well.John Travolta and Olivia Newton John were in my opinion very good portraying the cool, streetwise 1950's teenagers, although both at the time were well into their late twenties. While neither are the greatest of actors, but they don't need to be. Grease is all about the song and dance.Some of the most memorable songs ever to be put on film are here. ""You're the One that I Want"" ""Grease"" and ""Summer Nights"" are songs that are unbelievably catchy and songs that are known by pretty much everybody from the first line to the last.This movie always makes me smile and at the end of the day that is all that is important to me, I enjoy it each time I see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

One Of Those Films You Can Watch Over And Over Again,"""Grease"" is one of those films that I can watch over and over--and I do. Set in the doo-wop fifties, it centers on a group of high school seniors who share the joys and concerns of all teenagers: dating, popularity, first love, the unknown future, fitting in, sexual awakening.The two main characters, Danny (John Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) are the primary love story and the core of a great ensemble cast.One of the best things about this film is the music--a string of sing-able fifties-inspired gems that entertain and advance the narrative.There are also plenty of humor, fine dancing, and numerous references to fifties culture.""Saturday Night Fever"" put Travolta on the track to film stardom and ""Grease"" (released the following year) cemented his place among top cinema stars. Both films were co-produced by Robert Stigwood and their soundtracks (On RSO Records)made them huge successes in two genres.""Grease"" is so dense with cultural references and appearances by 50s-era stars, that it takes multiple viewings to appreciate them all.

Grease still is the word.,"Well, I certainly got chills after this first time watch, pretty sure they were multiplying. Oh, and I most definitely was losing control. Mostly because of the power this musical was supplying. Gosh darn it, t'was electrifying!...""You better shape up. Do-do-doooo""! Alright alright, I'll stop there. Cited as one of the most popular musicals of all time, and my mother's favourite sing-song marathon, I had to give it a watch. Remember, me no likey musicals...much. Surprisingly, the unapologetic good time vibes this film holds is just something else. I couldn't help but tap my feet and do my best Newton-John impression whilst dancing like Travolta. Greaser Danny Zuko and Aussie darlin' Sandy Olsson fell in love one summer at a beach. The season ends and school starts, only to find that Zuko has to uphold a ""cool guy"" image to which Sandy dislikes.Cue ""Hopelessly Devoted to You""! Or was it ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee""? Hang on, I've got it. Bring on ""Summer Nights"". Aside from the three big showstoppers that everyone and their dog still sing today, the majority of songs escaped my life. Yet, just after one viewing, I can pretty much recite them all. Heck, even the fantastically surreal ""Beauty School Dropout"". It's a testament to the original musical's songs and the stunning vocals of Newton-John and Travolta. ""Harmoniously Devoted to Getting No. 1s"" more like. Kleiser presents them with a barrage of colour, flamboyancy and well orchestrated dance routines to get the audience jiving and kicking. The frequency to which these performances are embedded into the narrative were well paced, despite the slower and less memorable second act.What really tickled my ""Greased Lightnin"" (you can have that one!) was 70s Hollywood interpreting a 50s high school musical. Not uncommon at the time, but its style and energetic approach gives it a sense of timelessness and infectious aura. The costumes, the Elvis Presley swagger and the constant combing of the greased back hair. Definitely had a ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On""! Travolta consistently dominated the screen. Even when the angelic Newton-John was sharing the screen, who's acting was mediocre at best, he would simply move his hips and put everyone in a trance. Undeniable star power. The acting in general was fairly sporadic, with no real standouts in either the T-Bird or Pink Lady gangs.But my biggest complaint is with Sandy's character. For someone like Danny to treat her so poorly when in front of everyone, just to maintain a public image that actually comes across as egotistical, only for her to then change herself to try and win him over. It felt wrong. I wasn't entirely invested in these two as love birds because of how negligently they were written. Change yourself to win the other person over? No. I don't buy it. It may have been passable back in the 70s but doesn't sit right with me today.So aside from them two as characters, Grease was a blast. The soundtrack reigning supreme with a multitude of excitingly choreographed scenes to accompany them, allows many of the technical flaws to be forgiven. It's a fun, rock n' rolling time that it ""happened so fast"". Last one, I promise...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best (and most enjoyable) musicals!,"GREASE (1978) **** John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Jeff Conaway, Stockard Channing, Dinah Manoff, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, Edd `Kookie' Byrnes, ShaNaNa, Frankie Avalon, Joan Blondell, Ellen Travolta, Eddie Deezen, Lorenzo Lamas.

This movie is the best..... a true classic,"Since I am still just a teen, I know that many others might say I am not one to criticize a movie, and in most cases I might disagree, but with this movie... what is there to criticize?

I myself dressed up as ""new"" Sandy when I was little... and I still wish I could have been in the movie. I admit, the sequel to it seemed horrible to me after watching the original, and I wished they had kept all of the original actors, and well, not tried to even make the sequel, but, well a movie like that can only be made once I suppose.

Tale as old as the 20th century,"Starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, this musical from the late 70s will take you right back to the 50s, when boys were boys, girls were girls and having a car actually meant something. Is it dated? Yes, but in a loving manner.Danny (Travolta) and Sandy (Newton-John) separate after a summer romance, believing that they will probably never see one another again. Then they find out that they're attending the same high school and that Danny has not been as straightforward about his personality as he probably should have been. It turns out he's a greaser and while in the presence of his friends about as misogynistic and old-fashioned as a redneck from 1800s. Yet he still loves Sandy, so what are they to do?This is a fun musical. Both the main leads are unbelievably charismatic, despite Newton-John being thirty years old - yeah, I find it hard to believe as well - and even Travolta being well over twenty. But they make up for it in chemistry, great song numbers and good old-fashioned charm.The music is also great. Greased Lightnin', Summer Nights and You're the One That I Want defined a whole generation. Sure, not all of them, like Beauty School Dropout, are all that memorable and some, like Summer Nights, contain somewhat sexist lyrics, but overall the songs are great and the whole film has this energy to it.Grease defines the word fun.

"The Best ""High School Musical"" of all time!","John Travolta and Olivia-Newton-John lead a terrific ensemble cast.

"Charming, Sweet, and Wonderful!","1978's Grease, in many eyes, is a classic film. It is adored by all ages, and it seemingly passes down from generation to generation with love. This is one of the first movies I remember that have a sense of nostalgia. This movie plays well with the baby boomers because it hearkens back to the 1950's, when love was swamped in innocence. This movie got the feel of the 1950's correct, I have been told. The clothing, the background music, the charm, the acting, and the overall look of the movie. The actual songs are 1970's rock'n'roll style, and they are wonderful songs. The tone of the movie is upbeat, fun, and innocent. It may be somewhat predictable, but the movie itself was made well.There are a variety of reasons why I enjoy this movie. From the interpretation of the 1950's lifestyle to the wonderful tunes to the themes of true love-all of it elevates this movie into 'classic' territory. However, I am irked by a few things though. Mainly the age of the cast. Don't get me wrong, I think the performances are wonderful, but I despise when movies cast people in their late 20's or early 30's to play teenagers. Now some films can get away with it, but not Grease. You can tell that the people in the cast are not teenagers. Check out these ages at the time of movie release. John Travolta was 24, Olivia Newton-John was 30, and Stockard Channing was 34!!! But who am I to complain. This movie gave Travolta and Newton-John the career boost they needed.As for the story, it's nothing new. The story is one that has been told to death, but it is all about how a story is told that can make or break a movie. This love story was told with a passion thanks to the high-spirited screenplay from Bronte Woodard and the energizing direction from Randall Kleiser. This musical starts off at a California beach in 1959. Complete opposite personalities have fallen in love. Greaser Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and an Australian chick Sandy Olsson (Olivia-Newton John). After a summer romance expecting not to see each other again, both of them attend Rydell High unbeknownst to each other. They do their own things at first. Danny is a leader of a gang of greasers called the T-Birds and Sandy joins the Pink Ladies, led by the charming Rizzo (Stockard Channing). When they run in to each other for the first time, Sandy realizes Danny is a different man from the one she met at the beach. But will that stop her from getting back with Danny? Well, just watch the movie! Despite my concerns on the ages of the cast, I cannot deny how effective the performances are. In particular, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Travolta eventually became a major movie star, thanks to this movie. He knows how to sing and dance very well for an actor. It seems like he models his character off Elvis Presley. With the hairstyle and the black leather jacket, he seems to be Elvis-lite. He exerts fantastic chemistry with Olivia-Newton John. She also sang very well and her performance as the new girl in town is excellent. I liked the supporting cast very much. Stockard Channing did a solid job as the sex-happy leader of the Pink Ladies. Jeff Conaway as Danny's right-hand man, Kenickie. There are some veteran cast members who did a fine job particularly Eve Arden as Principal McGee and Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun.I was most impressed with Grease. I remember seeing it as a little kid and enjoying the music. But as a young adult, it resonates with me because it reminds me of my high school days. The music is great and most of these songs will stick in your brain for a lifetime. Such numbers to keep an eye out for are ""Hopelessly Devoted To You,"" and ""You're The One That I Want."" The former song actually went on to be nominated for an Oscar. This film is all about song and dance. Two of my favorite sequences include the ballroom dance scene which was being filmed for national television and it features some slick dance moves. My other favorite scene is the ending dance sequence at the school's carnival. Very fun! On the whole, this film is upbeat, sweet, and a film to remember.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Iconic campy musical of high school life in late '50's Southern Cal,"Released in 1978 and directed by Randal Kleiser, ""Grease"" stars John Travolta as a high school greaser in 1958 Southern California, who takes interest in a new clean-cut girl from Australia (Olivia Newton-John). Stockard Channing plays the leader of the Pink Ladies with a bad rep who romances the leader of the greaser Thunderbirds (Jeff Conaway).

Adorable,"I hated this movie when I was a teenager and I'm so pissed at myself because of that. Looking at this movie now in my 20's I can appreciate what a fun-loving view of life this provides. All the songs are of at least decent quality but three of them in particular are just amazing. This is hands down one of the better musicals out there. The choreography can't be more well done than shown here. It's funny because I liked ""Saturday Night Fever"" better when I was younger but now I don't care for that movie and the exact opposite happened with this one...go figure. Olivia Newton-John is just gorgeous, why she didn't star in many movies afterward I'll never understand and god what a voice!!! John Travolta was great, and everyone else (especially Stockard Channing) were all fabulous. Oh and if you ever go to a Karaoke night make sure you do the ""Grease Megamix"" sometime throughout the night as it'll get the crowd pumped guaranteed.Final Synopsis:Movies : I did see this when I was in high school because it was re-released in the late 90's in theaters but stupid macho me back then didn't care for it.

empty-headed 50s pastiche,"John Travolta's high voice and Olivia Newton-John's impossibly tight trousers as sweet Sandy Dee is on a mission to romance slick-headed jerk Danny ... the plot of 'Grease' is simple and mindless and the characters flat and one-dimensional.  The film is shot in the manner of an oversized cartoon and the caricatures played out by the cast (Jeff Conaway, Stockard Channing, Didi Conn in particular) are laughable.The music though does grow on you, although it has an artistic value of about -100.  Everyone knows ""Summer Nights"", ""Greased Lightning"", ""You're The One That I Want"", and ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", although personally I like the wit of ""Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee"" (often omitted from TV showings of the film), ""Beauty School Dropout"" (drippily sung by former teen idol Frankie Avalon).Movie old timers Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, and Joan Blondell (her last film) are in the cast, and add a lot to the proceedings.

Grease.. a very poor film in my opinion...,"Having seen this film I am of the opinion that it is one of the most over-rated films ever. Its basically juvenile piffle, a very weak story line is compounded by equally poor acting from the entire cast, this is a film that should never have got further than the cutting room floor.n The storyline has been done so many times and in the case of this film results in a truly awful film of epic proportions. As per usual, it aims to portray the American way of life as squeaky clean and the soundtrack is so poor, it beggars belief that the songs released into the pop charts fared so well. John Travolta proves once again what a one-dimensional actor he really is, whilst Olivia Newton John shows no ability whatsoever.

Stranded at the drive-in...,"Brilliant choreography, memorable songs and John Travolta's performance, raunchy, cheesy lines and the actors being glaringly much older than the teenagers they are meant to be portraying ... that is ""Grease"", widely declared as being one of the best musicals of all-time. Musicals are not my thing so I can't really comment on that, but what I can say is that from a general movie experience perspective, it is actually not as glamourous a film as I remembered it to be. Sure, the performances are great and the music is very catchy, but the main problem with ""Grease"" is that it is a very simple concept based around a thin plot that struggles to maintain its high once it reaches its peak in the opening ten minutes. It spends the remainder of its duration trying to repeat the brilliance of ""Summer Lovin'"", and while it does manage to do so at times - with ""Grease Lightnin'"", in particular, it only just manages to be anything but dull, and by the conclusion, I breathed a sigh of relief that it was over. But overall, ""Grease"" is very enjoyable, even when you factor in the awkward moments where the jaded looking actors trying to portray the young people crumble, and you realise that the story really is nothing special.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I end up thinking, I don't really give a damn if the two of them ever get together. Does anyone else care. The movie is lightweight, but it never takes itself seriously anyway. It's a series of really great songs and interactions, primarily among the hoodlum element of the fifties (who seem to be the standard bearers of that time, even though most kids weren't part of that culture). The movie rides along on its production numbers which put forth the things that kids thought important at the time. There's the fear of pregnancy. The fear of being an outcast. The cars. The primping and showing off. The worst thing of all--being labeled a good person. The adults are even bigger buffoons. And the fact that an older Frankie Avalon shows up, doesn't quite work. These guys are dying off now so they probably will have to start casting people to play them as characters. Anyway, if I pick up this movie, I fast forward to about ten places that I totally enjoy and ignore the plot (I guess there is a plot somewhere, but it doesn't matter). I was surprised that Travolta is a pretty decent singer.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fun Musical that Leaves you Dancing,"'Grease' is a classic, lively coming-of-age rock'n'roll musical, one of the most popular musicals of all time. I was first introduced to Grease by my 4th-grade music teacher, who was a huge fan of musicals. We watched several musicals in 4th and 5th grade music and also sang many of the timeless songs. Grease was one of them, but we didn't watch Grease in class. Until now for me, two decades later. A High School student, Danny (John Travolta), falls in love with Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) during 1958 summer. Upon returning to school for senior year, he realizes Sandy has moved to his school. However, the two are in very different social circles. Danny is a cool greaser running with a rowdy crowd, while Sandy is a well-behaved cheerleader and a Ms. Goody two-shoes trying to fit in. Danny, unwilling to abandon his fake stuck-up ways (aka being a prick), creates a rift between him and Sandy. Their relationship develops as he tries to woo her, while she longs to be with him again.Grease is a feel-good movie that leaves you with joy and excitement. It's a nostalgic celebration of youth and life. I don't think you will find a best musical list without Grease listed. The music was so popular that I found myself humming ""We Go Together"" many years after my elementary school days. It stayed with me all these years, despite never watching the film. Outside of the soundtrack, the smooth choreography, 50s-era costuming, and the atmosphere have stood the test of time. The cast has excellent chemistry, especially Travolta and Newton-John. Both are charming in every scene. I will say that you have to leave logic at the door when watching this today because some scenes will make you cringe. But it's still fun and leaves you feeling like dancing. A few other interesting tidbits. Grease was by far the highest-grossing film of 1978 and the highest-grossing musical until 2008. Grease is the word! The zipper on Newton-John's pants ripped with no alternatives, so they had to sew her into her pants daily for the entire week. Grease 2 was done with a new cast, and it bombed at the box office. The cast of Grease pushed for Grease 3 with the original cast, but Grease 2's failure ended any chance for Grease 3.Would I recommend this? If you like musicals and coming-of-age films depicting High School, I believe you have to watch 'Grease'. Outside of that, I don't think it's a must-watch. I'm a huge fan of coming-of-age films, so I was going to watch this, eventually.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
See it for the numbers at least,"It's got style, I can't deny that. But whenever the script takes centre stage is when Grease becomes an ugly mess.Each musical number is where it becomes box office. The cinematography and just general musical structure from it all oozes with creativity. Grease is best during those moments of heightened reality, but then it flies back down to Earth and that's where it gets tough keeping enthusiasm for it. Apparently this deviates a lot from the musical it's based on, which sounds horrid because this already comes off so theatrical it's hard to believe it isn't a one to one adaptation.I can why Grease inspired, more for its presentation than the story cus it's not got much to boast for narratively, but I'd be much more interested in why it's still hanging around as a cornerstone of the campy musical genre, because watching it now it seems..fine? The most 70s Grease gets is the end when Sandy goes from innocent cross-bearing Aussie to a biker lass you'd find at a Florida bar four shots in. I feel gaslit by the poster because it paints a very different picture of her character, though I guess iconography isn't always reasonable. Quick, make her look hot! Get those books out of her hand! I can't tell if this is more stupid a last minute makeover than the one in John Hughes' Breakfast Club. Why did Hollywood think this was a good trope?While we're at it, why did John Travolta not join a band of sea lions because that's clearly more his habitat than shuffling on a soundstage; guy's got vocals to make your headphones cry.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good,"Released in 78 but with references to a time that dates back to the 1950s. A musical that is a classic! Perhaps the most acclaimed of all time and why?! ""Nos Tempos da Brilhantina"" in the middle of the golden age of capitalism! A representation of what was a time of consumerism - and we see this in the film through the attachment to cars, from appearances - in which adolescents exalted their rebelliousness in order to show their independence, but still full of childishness. And that childishness is given to us through animated scenes, like the beginning of the film that is caricatured. It is brilliant how Randal Klaiser gives us the child that still exists in the characters, while sharing cigarettes and drinks. Grease is lively, throbbing, shows us the effervescence of adolescence and Travolta vibrates here! As an actor, singer and dancer! And he won the nomination for best actor at the Golden Globe! It was the peak of his career! But the entire cast is well directed accompanied by a well-kept production. In the race for the Oscars, Grease won the nomination for best original song ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"".

When you remember that, and view it with that in mind, and perhaps use it to spark conversation, it can still be enjoyed.

"Decent movie making fun of the 50's with no ""bad"" message","Two comments. First, some reviewers are taking the movie too seriously, it is supposed to be a caricature of the 50's. One earlier reviewer cited Sandra Dee and James Dean parallels, etc, no need to repeat it. While it had fun dance music and hits (although I am usually not a Bee Gees fan, even when I was younger) with several famous and soon to be famous actors, the reason I give it a 7 versus something higher is that it gets a little too serious regarding Sandra and Danny (inconsistent with the rest of the movie, even the possible pregnancy is taken less seriously) and it did not keep true to the original musical.Second, the comments regarding sending bad messages was bit confusing. I don't see this message. One of the earlier reviewers talked about losing virginity as a must based on this movie. Well, to start this is inconsistent with the pregnancy issue where the character is mocked for being ""knocked up"" and even referred to as trash. The character tries to defend her actions by saying it's better than being an insincere flirt, but you can see she really regrets what she did inside. It also shows how virginity was still the vogue back then and that all the other provocative women were putting on a show. Next there are the comments about Sandy conforming to Danny's (and the T-birds/Pink Ladies) behavior, look etc in order to be accepted. The movies clearly shows that she was accepted before she made the alterations. One of the pink ladies befriends her, and Betty thanks her for her support. Danny letters in track and tries to change HIS LOOK for her in a mutual sign of affection. Sandy is not conforming to Danny as much as it may seem. She is mature in that she is kind to everyone and is responsible. However, she is immature because she lacks confidence in herself and how to deal with Danny. At the end she matures in that department by asserting herself and getting her man. She changes her dress, look and attitude not to conform but to get Danny's attention that she really wants him, and that she is the one in charge, not him. She now is asserting herself, showing confidence and at the same time saying she is willing to accept him for the way he is by ""dressing up"" for a day. It is interesting though that no one mentioned Danny putting on that awful sweater with the letter on to conform to his image of Sandy. Sandy knew that Danny's jacket, T-bird routine was just a ruse for whom he really was and she figured to play the ruse with him....Lastly, several commented on the women's roles issue and minorities. It appeared to me that the women had the upper hand in these relationships and a woman was a principal of a school in the 50's, etc. As for minorities and their appearance in the 1950's Rydell was in California. Was there segregation in California? I wasn't aware of any. Secondly, anyone know the percentage of African Americans in a typical LA well to do high school in the 1950's (or the 1990's for that matter)? Let's just say it was really low. So, it was realistic. I do agree that it is not nostalgia for the 50's I feel in this movie, it mocks the 50's. It to me is more nostalgic of the 1970's and the actors who became the stars later on and the music that I heard when I was a kid.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This was a hit?,"The dumbness of this film, and its mediocre production values, make its hit status an utter mystery.  Like the television show, ""Happy Days"", ""Grease"" is a 70's version of the 50's.  Not for a second are you lost in the decade in which the film is set.  It is far too 1970's in its feel, for that. The film's only appeal comes from its two stars, the only cast members who look young enough to be in high school.  The rest of the over-the-hill gang mugs and overacts, shamelessly.  It is horribly directed and the musical numbers look like rejects from a much better show.  The film of course isn't entirely to blame.  The stage production of ""Grease"", is just as bad. Perhaps worse.  It's all a matter of taster. So if ""Grease"" is the word for you, then by all means, enjoy.  I didn't.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Sizzles when the music is on, fizzles otherwise","It's simple to describe ""Grease"". When the musical numbers are on the screen the movie sizzles (for the most part). When the music is gone the movie fizzles, especially when John Travolta is not on screen.On the whole ""Grease"" is an enjoyable film. It's not without its flaws though. A few of the musical numbers are downright awful. I especially dislike both of Stockard Channing's songs and since Channing is such a strong actress one must put the blame on the material itself. I have never been a big fan of the ""Beauty School Dropout"" number but it has started to grow on me through the years.As I said the film nearly washes out everytime the music stops and the story tries to move forward. One major flaw in the story has Travolta abruptly changing his mind about hanging with his friends to try and win Olivia Newton-John back. I don't mind that but the script gives Travolta no reasons for this change. It just happens. Another flaw is that these high school ""teenagers"" look too old to be believed.On the plus side are the terrific musical numbers. The dance contest sequence is far and away the best in the movie. As for the songs ""Summer Nights"" and ""You're the One That I Want"" take top honors for me with ""Sandy"", which takes place at a drive-in, and ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" come in a close second.It's clearly obvious why Travolta became a superstar. He lights up the screen everytime he's on it. And when he sings and dances all bets are off. He's a captivating performer. One may wonder why Travolta chose to do ""Grease"" following the blockbuster success of his first major film, ""Saturday Night Fever"". The answer is simple. Travolta signed on and shot ""Grease"" before ""Fever"" was released. I have a feeling had he known the phenomenon ""Fever"" was going to be he would have either done another project in between or turned this down all together.""Grease"" is an enjoyable romp but far from the classic some have touted it as being. I say watch and enjoy and you'll be humming some of the tunes for days after.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

An fun cartoon unfortunately distorts expectations of stage revivals,"The original 1972 stage production of GREASE was a delightful, mildly dirty salute to rock and roll and the leather jacket and poodle skirt crowd of the late 50's and VERY early 60's. It set long run records on Broadway with its low running cost. When the powers that be got around to doing the film version they blew it up out of all recognizable proportions into a bubble gum cartoon that (to everyone's surprise) captured the essential insouciance of the original. It was buoyed by the canny casting of a number of performers (not least John Travolta's Danny Zuko) who had prepared for their roles in various stage productions.All well and good as far as that went, and the movie with its (dishonest to the period and piece) overlay of Bee Gees music and re-orchestration of the stage score became an enormous commercial hit as well.Viewers discovering the piece today will undoubtedly have a ball with the broad thesping of Travolta (newly shorn of the baby fat so in evidence in his early Broadway run with the Andrews Sisters in a musical called OVER HERE and subsequent TV ""Sweathog"" role on WELCOME BACK KOTTER), the bizarrely cast but delightful Olivia Newton John (""Sandy's"" supposed to be a transfer student but from Australia!?!) and Stockard Channing's Rizzo (not yet having played her career defining roles in SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION or THE BIG BUS), but those who love the original musical will always lament a bit that the solid success of the movie bodes ill to forever distort potential audience expectations and prevent a honest revival of the superior but small original stage piece.GREASE has been back on Broadway once already at this writing (a long run revival top billing Rosie O'Donnell and later Brooke Shields, both as ""Rizzo"") and at this writing is scheduled for an ill cast (by a national ""reality show"" elimination contest) summer revival during 2007. BOTH revivals were designed to be pointedly closer to the unsubtle aesthetic of the movie than the original Broadway staging. Productions like this have to be about making money as much as about making art, but if the movie had been a bit more about making art (as the occasional superb SUCCESSFUL movie musicals since GREASE - think CHICAGO - have been), the stage revivals would have been far better and probably more successful.Fun film, but one can't help thinking of the old (inaccurate) joke about Chinese food - an hour later you'll be hungry for some real intellectual stimulation.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It was life before the matrix world when all were equal economically and infatuation flourished with the opposite sex. The pranks, slumber parties, drag racing matches, and the intermixing of subgroups of greasers, pink ladies, nurds, good boys and girls, jocks, and teacher's pet types were all part of the ongoing effort to, ironically, define one's self.

Klutzy musical-comedy has two left feet...,"High schoolers in 1959 pair off for nostalgic romance. Musical comedy adapted from the hit Broadway show features choreography so stilted, it's amazing that director Randall Kleiser ever got the juices flowing. His picture has some exhilarating moments, but much of it is fumbled. The sock-hop sequence gives John Travolta a chance to strut his stuff, though the dance moves are mechanical and he comes off looking a little soft (perhaps that's because he's saddled with Olivia Newton-John, who's all fluff). The movie's rampant vulgarity can be deemed ""cute"" (it seems to make everyone laugh, but is it out of embarrassment?) and the music (some original B-way tunes and several new songs) is half-hearted. The film has a cleverly chosen, colorful supporting cast, and Travolta as Danny Zuko is really in the spirit.

Zestful version of the Broadway hit...,"GREASE is the movie version of a Broadway hit that began off-Broadway, where I saw it originally--and always remember it fondly because it provided me with a good glimpse of someone who just happened to be in the audience that day--INGRID BERGMAN with her son, Roberto. Saw her in the lobby during intermission and she was avoiding eye contact, and seemed to enjoy being ""left alone"". At the time, I thought it was odd that Bergman wanted to see GREASE, a strictly American type of look at the high school experience that she probably had no part of.Anyway, the film is full of pop songs that were high on the chart at the time with the standard number of stock characters you'd expect to find at Rydell High School. JOHN TRAVOLTA and OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN are the leads, Travolta repeating his Broadway role as Danny. Frankly, as the years passed, I became less and less interested in Travolta as an actor/celebrity--ditto with Olivia Newton-John--but this, apart from Saturday NIGHT FEVER, is probably tailor-made for his brand of singing and dancing.The talented supporting cast adds a lot to the proceedings--STOCKARD CHANNING, SID CAESAR, EVE ARDEN, JEFF CONAWAY and JOAN BLONDELL all contribute nicely to the overall flavor.Not my idea of a ""favorite musical"" (unlike so many of the commentators here), but it passes the time quickly and amusingly.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

But believe me, there are many more fantastic songs that just those 3, there are maybe 10-12 songs over the duration of the movie and every single one fits perfect to the picture.2)Dancing & Choreography What can I say about John Travolta, it really surprised me how much of a great dancer he was. The whole cast put in great performances and the stages/scenes are created perfectly offering really interesting and sometimes outrageous dance scenes.3) The Cast John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are fantastic as leads in this movie, I couldn't fault them one bit. There on screen chemistry, especially when dancing is perfect. The supporting cast do their job and bring depth and excitement to the scenes.Overall i was thoroughly impressed with Grease, I went into it not expecting much as I said before, I don't usually like musicals.

"""Grease"" will melt today's Snowflakes...","I was just 11 years old when I saw this at the cinema for the first time with my family & I absolutely ADORED IT! Kids in my school where all into the Grease fashions & we would practice the Grease dances in the school yard at break time....Oh how times have changed! I often wonder why this classic, fun film is never re-run on TV anymore (I am in the UK) as it hasen't been since the early 80's & the simple answer is that it is not ""progessive"" & shows a time the socialist elite like to call ""past mythical nostalgia"" which may upset ""global citizenship"" neoliberal state education, so I must add a word of warning to our gentle youth. Grease is not for the PC minded, diversity, inclusive, female empowerment brigade & who will find Grease's primary message of ""girl must dress up like a tart to get her man"" will be decidedly disturbing!Yet for those of us who can remember a time of fun, entertainment, enjoyment & free thinking, Grease is & will remain a sublme, exquisite peice of entertaining JOY! A down to earth age old tale of boy meets girl with excellent song & dance numbers which may still be played today. There is no underlying message or agenda in Grease as it is simply a movie to put a smile on you face, sing a long to the tunes & tap your feet. If your having a bad day & want to unwind, THIS is the film that will help. Grease was a movie made in a much simpler time & Grease is one of the best ""feel good"" movies ever made!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cool musical,"This has to be probably one of the only musicals that I enjoy a lot.  John Travolta made himself worthy of being called a great actor in this and Olivia Newton John proved the same that she is a great actress.  They can both sing wonderfully and so can the others.  The songs are very creative and the writers of this movie must be geniuses.  The whole cast is really cool.  Stockard Channing did good as the leader of the ""Pink Ladies"" and all of the other woman in the ""ladies"" were cool.  All of the other guys in the ""T-Birds"" were all cool and I enjoyed them.Overall the songs are great and the actors and actresses sure do know how to sing them.

Nostalgic Nostalgia Fest Maintains Its Superficial Bounce,"It's hard to think of a bigger slice of 1970's Hollywood kitsch than this candy-coated, mega-successful 1978 musical comedy. Capitalizing on the tidal wave of Eisenhower-era nostalgia pervasive on both big and small screens at the time, it manages to be stridently artificial and mindlessly entertaining at the same time, although it still boggles the mind that it has had such an afterlife, including sing-along versions playing at art-house movie theaters. Part of the ironic amusement is watching actors obviously in their late twenties and early thirties pretending to be teenagers. Credit should be given to director Randal Kleiser for his unapologetic stance on maneuvering the contrived silliness with spirit if not much finesse.Set in a period of the 1950's that existed only in Hollywood and lacking any semblance of reality or dramatic conflict, the threadbare plot focuses on greaser Danny, the cool leader of the T-Birds, and wholesome Sandy, a good-girl Aussie blonde enjoying a summer romance on the beach prior to senior year at Rydell High. Sandy was supposed to move back to Australia, but she ends up staying stateside and attending Rydell. With image being of the utmost importance, Danny initially rejects Sandy - now a cheerleader - when they meet again, and we follow all their romantic complications over the course of the school year until graduation. There is also the ongoing power struggle between the T-Birds and the rival gang, the Scorpions, as well as the peer-pressure shenanigans caused by the T-Birds' girlfriends, the Pink Ladies, headed by sleep-around tart, Rizzo.All of this merely provides an excuse for the various musical numbers, the most energetic being the ensemble pieces like the cleverly edited ""Summer Nights"" and the stylized ""Jailhouse Rock"" knock-off, ""Greased Lightning"". Most of the numbers are from the Broadway show, though there are some deliberately anachronistic insertions such as Barry Gibb's disco-accented title tune and the peppy funhouse duet, ""You're the One That I Want"". John Travolta is perfectly cast as Danny, even if his singing voice threatens to evaporate from his sincerity. Olivia Newton-John has the right manner and looks for Sandy, though she is hardly challenged to develop a compelling character here.The standout is Stockard Channing as Rizzo, the only character that has any connection to the reality of the times, and she expertly sings the mocking ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" and frankly outdoes Newton-John on the touching ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"". Several familiar faces fill out the cast - Eve Arden in Miss Brooks mode as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar rather constrained as Coach Calhoun, Joan Blondell equally pallid as malt shop waitress Vi, Edd Byrnes as a Dick Clark-type lothario, Alice Ghostley as the auto shop teacher, Dody Goodman as the ditzy school administrator, and of course, Frankie Avalon serenading ""Beauty School Dropout"" to squeaky-voiced Didi Conn's Frenchy.Serious examination of the film is useless since it is more a cheery variety show with superficial references to the sexual politics of the 1950's. The new 2006 ""Rockin' Rydell Edition"" DVD package comes with extras that should satisfy fans. There is an insightful commentary track by Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch; eleven minutes worth of deleted scenes in black-and-white; a nostalgic ""Grease Day"" featurette that contains interviews with Travolta, Newton-John and producers Allen Carr and Robert Stigwood; and coverage of the 25th Anniversary DVD launch party, which includes spirited performances by Newton-John, Travolta and the remaining cast.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""We'll Always Be Together"".","I was sheltered as a kid, and even though I loved movies there were tons of movies I couldn't see- like Harry Potter for witchcraft or Titanic for the drawing scene. Most of my childhood was around Veggie Tales, Disney, and old movies.Grease was one of the first ""grown up"" movies I ever saw. Surprisingly, I was about 8 when I first saw it. From age 10-21, I went 11 years without seeing it. Before COVID hit, I got the DVD and saw it early into the pandemic lockdown. I liked it as a kid, but seeing it as an adult, it is now one of my favorite musical movies.The plot takes place in the 1950s and follows a romance between high school seniors Danny (John Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John). Danny is a greaser and Sandy is a goody-two shoes. (As her friends tease in a song, she can't smoke and she's ""lousy with virginity."")Grease has a very catchy soundtrack. The first song (and my favorite) is ""Grease"", and when I think of the title or hear it said, I can't help but think ""Grease is the word, is the word, is the word, is the word...""As a kid, I loved the song ""Summer Nights"", which also comes to mind when I think of the movie. Other catchy tunes include ""Greased Lighting"". ""Saundra Dee"", and ""Beauty School Dropout', among others.The cast is also good in their parts, and it's impressive that they look like high schoolers. For example, John Travolta was 34 in 1978 and Olivia Newton-John was 30, and yet they are convincing 17-18 year olds in high school. (There are a bit old, as some critique, but I personally hardly notice that.)Grease is also well paced and entertaining, and anyone who lived in the 50s would feel nostalgic watching it.Judging the film from the time period, Grease is a 10. That said, some things don't hold up. For example, there's a scene where Danny tries to r*pe Sandy at a drive-in movie, and they still stay together. There are teens smoking and implications of teenage sex throughout. (Read the lyrics to ""Greased Lightning"".)While I don't condone behaviors like this, and it's a little cringe to watch over 4 decades later, that in no way deters Grease from being the great musical it is.If you love musicals, movies from the 70s, or the 50s time period, then I highly recommend Grease. When it comes to great musicals from the 70s, Grease certainly is the word.PS: I have written this review in response to the passing of Olivia Newton-John. May she rest in peace.

Disco Hound Dog,"Well golly gee whiz, I don't even know where to begin with this one. To its credit, it does have energy ... lots of high voltage zing and zest, hyper kinetic hubbub, in that optimistic spirit of high school days, with all that singing, dancing, and chattering like magpies. And the production design and costumes are colorful and splashy.""Grease"" also has two terrific songs that function as musical bookends. At the beginning, we get to hear ""Grease (Is The Word)"", sung by Frankie Valli. I've always liked that song. And near the end, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John dazzle and electrify with the snappy, pulsating sounds of ""You're The One That I Want"" ... ""oo-oo-oo, honey"". Marvelous.Trouble is, both those songs engender a 1970's disco flavor into a film ostensibly about the 1950s. So where are all those really great oldies-but-goodies? Sha-na-na sings a few oldies, like Elvis' ""Hound Dog"". But the missed musical opportunities are striking.The film's story, about high school romance, is not original. And the plot is choppy, and lacks scene transitions, or any sense of logical progression or flow. Plot points seem placed almost in random order, a result of poor script structure.Although the film is a comedy, the jokes aren't really funny. The writers are trying too hard, and the humor comes across as forced and unnatural.One of the worst elements of ""Grease"" is the ""Greased Lightning"" segment, which has John Travolta acting like a jerk, as he struts and prances in an auto garage. Wearing too much makeup, he comes across as a poor imitation of 1970's singer Freddie Mercury, from the 1970's rock band ""Queen"".The film's casting is terrible. Most of them look too old to be high school seniors. Not for a microsecond did I think Stockard Channing was 17 years old.What's good about this film is really, really good. And what's bad is really, really bad. But overall, ""Grease"" fails to engender a sense of the 1950s. Instead, it looks, sounds, and feels like an homage to the 1970s disco era.",,Anonymous,Romance

Classic yet new.,"This film has an X-Factor, a certain something that just makes it brilliant for all ages. It's a 1978 film about the 50's that still manages to have the production values and likeability of a film made today.The cast is superb. How does John Travolta manage to keep those hips from moving when he's not dancing, surely they have a life of their own? My God he was gorgeous back then. And Jeff Conaway as Kenickie can get me pregnant any time he wants. The supporting cast of the T-Birds and The Pink Ladies are all brilliantly selected too. My only concern really is Olivia Newton-John who's just a bit stiff with some of her lines sometimes, but her singing is glorious. I still want to go out as her one New Year's Eve in that black number at the end of the film, but I doubt I could get my hair to look that good.Personally I am hugely jealous that I have never had that much hair to style like John and Jeff and I can only dream of having the co-ordination to 'Hand Jive' (That's not a euphemism). That scene is just amazingly well choreographed and a joy to watch.The final scenes are brilliant too, you can't help but feel positively about a film that leaves you on such a high note with 'Summer Nights' closely followed by 'We Go Together'.It's full of laughs, romance and just good old fashioned heart.I do find it funny to watch this film and think back to when I was younger imagining that I would be a bit like Sandra Dee one day, but realising that I'm much more like Rizzo, at least I used to be, now I'm more of a Jan.I'm just in awe of this film. There are very few out there that can continually bring the fun on repeat without getting tired and this is one of them. If only all the directors new the magical formula used to make this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Phony Fifties Made Glorious,"Following a great run on stage, this film adaption features Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta at just the ages (Newton-John was 30, Travolta 24) at which they could play teenagers and get away with it, and much of the movie's success hinged on their appeal singing songs like ""Summer Nights"" and ""Hopelessly Devoted"" (my personal favorite). Of course, realism is never the point in a musical; the point is romance and fantasy and looking a something in a new way. It has always amazed me that science fiction fans can believe almost anything-walking on Mars, invaders from Venus-but they cannot believe a simple romantic fantasy. The title song, performed by Frankie Valli is a signature song of the last half of the 20th century. This movie represents in one very special way a stretch of Hollywood history that seems pretty obscure in the 21st century. Joan Blondell appears in this film as a sympathetic waitress; keep in mind this is the actress who delivered ""Remember My Forgotten Man"" Gold Diggers of 1933. ""Beauty School Drop-Out"" with Frankie Avalon is memorable, as is film legend Eve Arden as the clueless principal delivering the line, ""If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter."" Grease is the musical that sums up the repressive, nasty, ignorant, terrific 1950s. There was also a Grease 2 four years later, which you will want to check out if ""Grease"" does it for you, but it was generally panned. Arguably John Travolta is the best all-around actor-singer-dancer of the last half of the 20th century. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loveee the song!,"My intention was to watch Dirty Dancing and having not watched either, I picked the wrong title and began. Grease was on my list too, but just later. Anyway, I didn't expect to love the movie, it's from a different era, an era I did not exist in. But it is enjoyable. It bought back all the songs I've loved so much and didn't know were from Grease! And Olivia Newton-John (Sandy), is a charm, an angel. I am currently singing Hopelessly Devoted To You on repeat! The movie is entertaining, sweet and has lots of dancing. Maybe it's outdated for my tastes, but it's not a bad watch and if you want an idea of what the 70s looked like, it paints a nice picture.I love musicals but here the songs are better than the entire movie and that isn't a good sign.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A superb movie enjoyable by everyone,"I first saw this movie about seven years ago, aged roughly 13. At such a young age, there were parts of the film I didn't comprehend, but it didn't matter. The singing and dancing are well-produced and the majority of the dialogue CAN be comprehended by kids. Over the past two years I've watched it several more times, because there is a lot more to get out of it. It is both a movie for kids and a movie for adults.Firstly, each character is unique and endearing in their own way. Stockard Channing's performance as Rizzo, the bad girl, is a particular stand-out and believeable. True, she is nearly twice the age of the character she plays, but I doubt an 18-year-old could done it anywhere near as well. Sandy (played by Olivia Newton-John) can be a bit sugary-sweet at times, but it contrasts well with Rizzo.Incidentally (some may not find this paragraph of interest) I find it puzzling how Sandy is described by other reviewers as a 'good girl' and 'virginal' and contrasted with the Pink Ladies. From what I can see, while Frenchy, Jan and Marty are 'cool', I didn't find anything particular suggesting they were 'bad girls'. Indeed, at one part in the movie, when the T-Birds are outside the window, Rizzo describes the others as 'goody-goodies', and the other girls appear oblivious as to her intents.In my opinion, Kenicke (Jeff Conaway) upstages Danny (John Travolta) at times in terms of being slick and cool and he doesn't slip up once (although some of it's contrived); I would rate him as the standout male character. Contrast Danny's 'cool-guy' image with the real him that you see at the beginning  and when he sings 'Sandy. Leo (leader of the scorpions) does an impressive job also in his relatively minor role as leader of the Scorpions. The other 3 T-Birds are very much followers, although Doody comes up with a lot of funny lines.Events that occur along the way are those young adults could relate to: a major formal (where a few of the dancers play up), a car race, a drop-out of high school and a colourful celebration at the end, to name a few. Indeed, most of the film is very colourful, the costumes are stylish and emphasise the kind of lifestyle these people enjoyed.If I could make any criticism, it would be on some of the songs:'Hopelessly Devoted To You' could definately have been omitted as it is just emphasising a point, and there are a few others that weren't really necessary. However, some songs fit in perfectly, like 'Summer Nights' where the lead guy and girl tell their respective sides (and versions) of their summer holiday; 'Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee' is very funny and shows how Sandy doesn't fit in; I prefer to fast-forward through 'Greased Lightning' but it has a lot going for it nonetheless. I shouldn't be too critical of the songs; it is, after all, a musical.This production represents a successful conversion of a musical into a movie and has everything the way it should be for a classic (and should never had had a sequel, which, fortunately, I haven't seen). The sort you can watch over and over again. In fact, one of the few movies I give 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's a delight to watch, still 20 years after it first appeared on the screen","Grease was a big hit and the musical remains one of its kind's most popular movies. After the Grease and Saturday Night Fever pair came out, John Travolta was catapulted to the top shelf of fame, and hiseasy to see why-the guy is charming, can sing well and has the gestures. Grease boasts what all successful movie musicals have: fun actors, an easy but not insignificant plot, and lots of enjoyable music. Undoubtedly, familiarity with the soundtrack is one of the reasons for the success of the film-several of the songs have reached pop hit status. Grease works in the 1950s as a musical, comedy, a light romance, and a gentle satire of adolescent life.It's a delight to watch, still 20 years after it first appeared on the screen, partially because of its enduring high spirits.

Probably the worst movie ever,"Talking about movies without an argument, talking about nonsensical musical extravaganza, talking about glorification of frivolity, talking... Well, let the images do the talking. I just didn't catch the movie way back in the seventies and kept away from it in the eighties and nineties, but heck, you certainly run out of luck one day and you come to see this... (fill in your favorite gut revolver). As some popular character said, ""we were idiots back in the fifties"", and it would be great for the movie to point it out; problem is that it celebrates the whole idiocy of the times, making satire only to the clich√©s and actually selling the real misery of social uses and customs as nostalgic empathy. The whole macho pose on which the supposed conflict is based finally rears its ugly head in all its disgrace and there is dance and joy everywhere to enthrone it. As entertainment it also lacks punch and, of course, intelligence, for the purpose seems to be an exhibition of pseudo-romantic gags and ill-conceived phoney humour. On the other hand, the movie is excruciatingly dull even skipping the sung parts. Not difficult to categorize with an adjective or two, but from my personal point of view, the ideal film to watch while you write the note to the judge and proceed to hang yourself.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Greatest Musicals Ever Made,"Grease (1978)**** (out of 4)Bad boy Danny (John Travolta) meets good girl Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) and the rest is Hollywood history. GREASE was a smash when it was on Broadway but I don't think anyone involved with the film could have imagined that it would become such a hit and now such a legendary film. With countless soundtracks sold and several theatrical re-releases over the years, GREASE is certainly one of the most loved musicals and in my opinions it's one of the greatest. I always laugh when I say that because the first time I watched this movie I really hated it but a few months later I went with a girlfriend to see it on the big screen and ever since then it has been one of my favorites. I personally think this film is just about flawless in regards to charm and fun because it's impossible not to love the characters, their situations and of course the countless great songs that are scattered through the picture. ""You're the One That I Want"" is clearly the most memorable and fun song here but there are other classics like ""Summer Nights,"" ""Hopelessly Devoted to You,"" ""Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee"" and of course the show-stopping ""Beauty School Drop-Out"" by Frankie Avalon. The entire film just has a very fun feel to it and obviously there are many homages to the era that it takes place. The performances are certainly among the best you're ever going to see because everyone is just so perfect in the roles they're given. Travolta and Newton-John clearly have a great chemistry and their charm just oozes from the screen. Stockard Channing, Jeff Conaway, Barry Pearl, Michael Tucci and Didi Conn are also wonderful. Plus, getting to see guest stars like Avalon, Joan Blondell and Sid Caesar is great as well. GREASE is certainly a film that is going to live on just as long as there are still movies around. It's clearly one of the best of its type and there's a reason why it remains so popular.",,Anonymous,Romance

Iconic,"Full confession: In a '50s musical, my favorite song is Frankie Valli's titular disco track. That's what's kind funny about this movie: it's youthful midcentury Americana by way of the '70s.

Eventually it is one of the best songs of the seventies that we can find in the oustanding musical movie : Grease.Directed by Jim Jacobs, the famous movie was released on 1978 but it is based on a play dating from 1971. The leading actors in this film are John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.The story is about two young people in a High School. It is a love story between a girl coming from a rich background and a boy who is the leader of a school gang.All the film is rhythmed by lively musics and dances. The subject is entertaining but the end is too predictable there is no real suspense. It isn't a gripping movie but it is rather a girlish movie.Today Grease is a reference movie.

"Fun, silly and cheesy...","Entertaining, silly and cheesy/goofball late 70's ""classic"" musical about (supposedly) 1950's high school students.  To me, this film has much more of a late 70's ""feel"" than anything else, despite the 50's hairstyles and cars. Characters are likeable enough to get attached to by film's end, despite lots of stereotypes and near zero character development all around.  I was 14 when this came out in theaters, and certain lines (even tone of voices when uttered) still strike a chord, although this film fails to evoke a nostalgic feeling.  ""Sandra Dee's"" sudden transformation at the end is totally unconvincing, which doesn't help the film any.  Lots of ""gratuitous smoking"" (not a terribly good message for kids), although given when it was made and the time period it's meant to portray I'm not terribly surprised. Overall, a feel-good musical from a more innocent time (1978), great for those who get a nostalgia kick from it but little else. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I just don't get it,"Everyone raves about this movie and I just don't know why.  I saw it when it first came out and even after all these years I don't understand the attraction and I'm appalled that schools have productions of this wretched waste of time and money.Does anyone else see what I see in that movie?  The music is ""okay"" with some catchy tunes, but has anyone REALLY listed to the lyrics from ""Greased Lightning""?  And does anyone else see the message that the film sends out - that in order to be part of the ""in crowd"" and popular a ""good girl"" should dress and act like a slut?  And she should chase after a guy who is a total punk and doesn't respect her at all?Everyone goes on and on about ""Grease"" and I see parents take their adolescent children (especially daughters) to see it or they own it.

See something from the 1950s,"Grease is a nice movie/musical to catch a glimps of the U.S. high-school life in the 1950s - it helps explain what we have inherited from those young people of yester-years.Though well acted, the story emphasized too much on the party aspect of the school-life, making it look like effortless and sensual.  Instead of showing some National Grandstand of dance at some high school gym, why not present some students working towards winning some international championships of some math/physics contest, or some design contest.  For a few minutes I though Danny was about to go into some sports and win Sandy back through his achievements, but instead Sandy returned to him through his flop on his hurdle running track!  Quite motivational, isn't it?  ...and then Danny's pursuit in sports ended in the movie right there!Maybe I am well beyond teenage years when I watched this movie, but I can't help but notice a complete absence of parents in this movie except Frenchy's brief mention of her Daddy as the only man (male) she trusts.  No wonder the kids in the '50s loved it.  How every youth wished they could be just doing what they wanted, like in the movie, instead of being ""ordered around"" by their parents and teachers!Well, that was my few cents of cold words.  Still, the movie is worth seeing, to learn about what the kids in 1950s did and liked.  I rated this movie 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Still the best!,"Grease is the story of two teenagers (Danny Zuko, played by John Travolta and Sandy Olsson played by Olivia Newton-John) who meet the summer before their senior year of high school. At the end of the summer, they are both sad because Sandy is supposed to head back to Australia. Little do they both know at the time that Sandy's father is staying there for work and she will be attending the same high school as Danny. Danny is the leader of a group of boys that go by the name of the T-Birds. They portray themselves as a tough group who hang out with/date their female counterparts, the Pink Ladies. Sandy is portrayed as a wholesome, sweet, na√Øve girl who is the complete opposite of both the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies. The film centers on the challenges that Danny and Sandy face to try to make a relationship work while overcoming their differences. By the end of the film both Danny and Sandy try to transform themselves into something more like the other. Danny joins and letters in track to try to become more ""wholesome"" like the both Sandy dates during the movie. Sandy transform herself into a cigarette smoking, big hair, leather pants wearing girl that she thinks Danny prefers. The films subplot centers around the other members of the group, focusing mainly on the problems with a couple of the Pink Ladies, Frenchy (played by Didi Conn and Rizzo (played by Stockard Channing). Frenchy decides to leave high school and enter beauty school. She ends up having a tough time with it and comes back to high school. Rizzo is the tough acting one of the group and ends up having a pregnancy scare that she tries to work through on her own. The costume and makeup designers did a great job making you feel like you were really there in the '50s with the actors. The clothing was realistic throughout. The on screen chemistry between all the actors is fantastic. You get the sense that they all enjoyed working together that came through on screen. And you can't talk about Grease without talking about the music. The songs are still enjoyed as much today as they were when the movie came out nearly 40 years ago. The film does a good job in showing that friends stick together through problems and trials and tribulations of going through high school and surviving any way you can. Overall, Grease is a great feel-good movie musical that will have you watching it time and time again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good girl meets a bad boy or a Boring and disappointing cult musical with cult status,"Musical. A screen version of the stage musical of the same name by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, from which some social subtext was removed and the sharp edges were smoothed out. I looked at the picture again on the recommendation and ... however, about that after. I note that this picture has a cult status in the West, which has not subsided so far, which has become news to me if I have garlic, but despite this fact, I will still judge it by my personal impressions that arose me while watching it. And here is my brief opinion - a frustrating and boring musical. Quietly, without nerves, dear and respected fans of the picture, I will explain my position and intend to describe not only the minuses, but also the advantages of this movie, for which it is deservedly loved and appreciated. Let me begin, then.
So, the pros:
1. Atmosphere - what is wonderful in this picture is just that. The picture is filled with a light, romantic mood, which will completely freely disperse the melancholy of dull gray everyday life. And I'm not joking right now. If you do not believe me, then check it yourself. Yes, I watched this picture on the recommendation, but I myself had a desire, which only accelerated. After watching a war movie, I wanted some lightness and musicality - and in this regard I was not deceived!
2. Fifties - Elvis, a special style of youth, cars of the thirties, skillfully remade by these very guys into something special, summer, romance, and most importantly - the music itself, the influence of which cannot be overestimated. All this is, it all looks almost perfect. What to do, because the fifties for America really stood out calm and musical at the same time. What else to do, how not to love and be loved?
3. A simple story is the classic love story of a bad boy and a good girl, before which various and such familiar to everyone obstacles come up, ranging from different circles of interest, moral views and ending with a radically different look at the future. Of course, the ending of this story is predictable, and this is good. For the genre, this is it, because the emphasis is on something else, which will be the next plus.
4. Songs - why love this picture? Yes, it's for the songs, light, romantic, vulgar (as without it), but so emotional and sometimes even touching. Songs from this picture occupied the highest places, and some were even nominated for the then-prestigious Academy Award. One title track is worth it!
5. Dancing - there are a lot of dances in the picture, and a lot of extras. Moreover, the characters dance so flawlessly and expertly that it causes genuine admiration even today, in the age of high technology and computer graphics. Some dances are already unknown to a wide range of viewers, because the fashion for them has passed, so this picture can be safely used as a history textbook on dances of the fifties. They are vulgar, sometimes very - but very shocking, you can't argue with that. I especially want to note the patience and work of the masters in choreography, because what frame do not take - movement, plastic, everything is almost perfect. And given the number of dances in the picture and extras - this is really an achievement.
So cons:
I warn you, now I will whine and find fault with the cynicism of the pathologist! I warned.
1. Not hooked! - I love musicals, although there are hundreds of us in Russia, if not tens, of the same kind, for example, among my acquaintances and friends, no one likes this genre. So, I watched both old musicals and new ones, and in each I found something special, usually a song, or several. There were times when the musical was well shot, but the songs are a complete failure. But here is the bottom. The songs are completely unremarkable, despite the good performance by the actors. Melodies - similarly. Everything seems to be monotonous, sometimes crumpled, torn, and most importantly - uninteresting. At one time, I criticized ""The Greatest Showman"" for everything except the title track, so here it is not. Already in the twentieth minute I wanted to turn it off, but I restrained myself, because there was still hope inside, as when watching the picture ""Spike Island"". There I waited for a sweet and touching scene, after which the picture began to sparkle with new colors, but this did not happen here. As at the beginning the picture was dull and uninteresting - by the end it remained the same. The dummy that I spent two hours of my time on. Well, it happens.
2. Vulgarity - the fact is that they did not show the picture in the Soviet Union, because censorship did not pass, considering it to be ""vulgar and licentious"" - and this is true. No, there are no explicit scenes here, but hints, movements, some dances clearly indicate the object of desire. I didn't like this, and if I forgave Spike Island due to good, sweet, touching and dramatic scenes, I won't forgive Briolin, because he has no such excuse.
You can throw tomatoes, apples at me, but I'm telling the truth. I have no one to crouch in front of, I am frank with you. I wanted to enjoy the picture, but in the end I only paid tribute to its technical part, which saddens.
A little about the main characters:
1. Danny Zuko performed by John Travolta is a bad boy, the leader of the school company, not indifferent to the weaker sex. Having met a new girl, I realized what the strange word ""love"" means. It is changing before our eyes. Young Travolta is admirable. Dancing, singing, playing - just great. Well, appearance certainly plays a key role!
2. Sandy Olsson, performed by Olivia Newton-John, is a good girl who fell in love with a boy who turned out to be a little not as romantic as she knew him. A naive, radiant, beautiful girl that Olivia brilliantly performed. Her Sandy turned out to be a classic good girl, but this image has always been, is and will be popular. Good girl!
As a result, we have a boring musical with cult status, with a simple and memorable story, great atmosphere and aesthetics of the fifties, famous songs and magnificent dances. The duet of Travolta and Olivia is wonderful!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Fifties As They Should Have Been,"Despite occasional revivals, the early seventies marked the end of the cultural dominance of the traditional Broadway-style musical film. (""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Cabaret"" were the last two great examples). ""Grease"" was perhaps the nearest equivalent in the second half of the decade. Although it uses popular music rather than the quasi-classical music of Gershwin or Rodgers and Hammerstein, it shares two features in common with earlier Hollywood musicals which set it apart from the dance-based musicals of the late seventies and eighties like ""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Fame"", ""Flashdance"" or ""Dirty Dancing"". Firstly, it is based on an earlier stage musical. Secondly, it uses songs in a non-naturalistic way as a means of commenting on the action and of demonstrating the characters' emotions, unlike the dance musicals in which the characters only sing and dance in situations where people would sing and dance in real life.The film is set in 1959 in the fictitious Rydell High School and tells the story of a romance between two of the pupils, Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson. (Sandy is an Australian, a detail presumably invented to allow Olivia Newton-John to avoid having to attempt an American accent; the equivalent character in the original stage version was American). Also featuring are Danny's gang, the T-Birds, and their female counterparts, the Pink Ladies. As is common in American high school movies supposedly teenage characters are played by actors in their twenties or thirties. Stockard Channing in particular looks more like a member of the PTA than of the student body.Recent films about the 1950s, such as ""Far from Heaven"" and ""Revolutionary Road"", have tended to take a negative view of the decade, seeing it as a period of hypocrisy and social repression. In the seventies and eighties, however, film-makers were inclined to take a more positive view, partly because the studios were still under the control of a more conservative generation who had grown up before the social changes of the sixties, and partly because of the trauma of the Vietnam War which led Americans to see the period immediately preceding that war as a lost golden age. Like ""Diner"", a film from a few years later also set in late 1959, ""Grease"" looks at the fifties through rose-tinted spectacles.The title derives from the fact that the film celebrates the ""greaser"" subculture of the era. ""Greasers"" were young men who adopted a distinctive look involving leather jackets and the greased-back hair from which they took their name; they were generally lovers of motorcycles, fast cars and rock music. (In America they appear to have adopted the ""greaser"" name as a badge of pride, but in Britain their preferred name was ""rockers"", ""greaser"" being an insult hurled at them by followers of rival youth gangs such as mods and skinheads). One of the most popular television programmes in the seventies and early eighties was ""Happy Days"", which featured another ""greaser"" character, Fonzie, played by Henry Winkler. Winkler was offered the role of Danny but declined it, apparently because he did not want to become typecast.Winkler's loss was John Travolta's gain, as ""Grease"" helped him consolidate the reputation he had won in ""Saturday Night Fever"" the previous year as Hollywood's coolest young actor. The success of the film's soundtrack also gave a massive boost to Newton-John's career as a singer, although her acting career never really took off in the same way, possibly because her follow-up to ""Grease"" was the forgettable ""Xanadu"". (Forgettable, that is, to all except trivia quiz junkies desperately in need of an answer to the question ""Name a film beginning with X"", and even that need has since been undermined by the X-Men franchise).The film's music, in fact, is really better than its plot, which is no more than a standard boy-girl romance reminiscent of sixties beach movies. Some of its cultural references now seem very dated; I am not sure why the scriptwriters were so keen to satirise the long-forgotten Sandra Dee, admittedly a huge star in 1959 but by 1978 already a prime candidate for ""Where Are They Now?"" There are no really great acting performances, but all the stars do what is expected of them. The real star is the music, based on the popular music of the era and unfailingly cheerful and high-spirited. Some of the songs have become classics, such as ""Greased Lightning"" ""You're the One That I Want"", the love-ballad ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" and the witty ""Summer Nights"" in which Danny and Sandy independently tell their friends about their romance from different viewpoints. (As might be expected, the boys are obsessed with sex, the girls with romance).There are some similarities between ""Grease"" and ""Absolute Beginners"", a British musical from eight years later also set in the late fifties. In terms of their visual style the two films are very different, and the soundtrack to ""Absolute Beginners"" is based around jazz rather than rock. (It deals not with the rockers but with their ""mod"" rivals for whom jazz was the music of choice). The British film also makes some serious points about racism; ""Grease"" does not really tackle social issues, apart from a minor subplot about teenage pregnancy. What the two films have in common is that both present an irresistible, upbeat celebration of youth culture; what we see in them is not so much the fifties as they actually were but the fifties as they should have been. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hot Grease,"Who doesn't like fun? Then, there is high school fun which no one can figure out either in that moment or later but it was fun never the less. Watching this movie brought back memories of just what happened in American high schools around the 50's and some. We are reminded of how much we knew and didn't know and the nagging thought decades later of how much more we could have done and didn't because we didn't know. The characters bring it all to life imitating what was going on at that time and making fun of it. The actors had a good time doing this movie making the viewers catch the afterglow of it all. Enjoy the songs which become not only memorable but sing-able too. Who hasn't sang at least one of them? Be honest here!

Broadway Musical Makes It Big With Disco Sounds,"John Travolta, & Olivia Newton-John dominate this film. Everyone else is just a bit player though kudos to Eve Arden who has a nice cameo here even though she was getting pretty long in the tooth when this was made. There are some others who do nice support, but it is clear from the beginning who the big man & woman on campus are in this one.There is a little bit of a side plot about losing virginity which was really a mild plot for 1979. The rest of the film & the main plot is that John & Olivia are in love. If you realize this before watching the film, your better off. There is no rocket science in this movie.This film is a transformation film though. It has elements of the big musicals of the past & the start of the transition to the 1980's style musical. Past musicals have big stages & production numbers. This movie has that. 1980's Musicals have a feel good, put your brain away feeling & light plot. This movie has that too.The disco beat dominates the sound track with Franki Vali warbling the closing theme in dominate fashion. The disco makes sense as Travolta had done Saturday Night Fever shortly before this one. The photography & staging are crisp. The film is the right length that the performance don't get bogged down. Even Travoltas voice is OK doing the songs (unless that is lip sync-hing). This is by far the biggest of the 27 films Randal Kleiser has directed even though he also did Big Top Pee Wee.This is a put your brain away for something light on a Saturday afternoon type of film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
You're a fake and a phony and I wish I never laid eyes on you!,"Grease is directed by Randal Kleiser and stars John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing & Jeff Conaway.

She ends up going to the same high school as he, but he's under peer pressure to stay cool and uphold a tough guy image. They fall out, argue, make up, their friends are equally unstable. Oh and there's the small matter of some truly memorable songs and dances too.As full of gusto as it is cheese, Grease is the musical that's hard to dislike. The acting is so-so, the direction one dimensional and the plot could have been written on a 50s beer mat. Yet we love it because of its faults, the kooky charm that sidles up alongside those roaring tunes. We care not that these actors are too old to play high schoolers, the fun is watching them have fun being teens again. Hell there's even innuendo unbound and cheeky lyrics for those of an adult mind. A truly great fun movie that's longevity shows no time of ending any time soon.

Too slimy to be grease,"This is a sexist piece of rubbish. The girl has to get into tight clothes and talk about shaping up to be with the guy who supposedly likes her as she is (as long as his friends aren't around while she is as she is). Way to tell girls they need to be fake and put on prostitutes clothing to get a boy and way to tell boys how to treat girls and what to expect from them.The songs and script also degrade girls. Any girl who has a boyfriend and everyone knows she is ""putting out"" is labeled a tramp and teased while the guys get to dance around dry humping on the pussy wagon like cave men and celebrating while sharing stories of their conquests (even fake stories i.e. that in ""Summer loving"" from his perspective).A really unattractive and sleazy adult male is able to pick up a minor female student at a dancing contest purely because he's on the radio and no other adults care or notice. No sex offender registry for that obvious repeat offender with his smooth ""I'm in your bedroom"" line.I'm not the first to mention this but the actors are so old most of them should have been playing the parents of school kids. Stockard Channing even had freckles obviously drawn on her face with an eyeliner pencil to make her look younger. It didn't work.Overall the songs are catchy and if you don't listen to the lyrics you might think it's a cute love story. Listen to the lyrics and you'll see what the real message and purpose of the movie is. Encouraging young people to change themselves because they think what someone else wants is more important than what they want.

"Great musical, questionable casting","Grease made Travolta an American icon, symbolizing the 1950s. The music was great, the plot was good & so was the acting. The only problem I have with the movie is the actors look old, most of them were in their 30's. Stockard Channing (Rizzo) was 34 when Grease was released! Maybe they cast so many old actors for historical reference, since many were teenagers in the 1950s.The movie has become a classic, and despite the aging actors epitomized the 1950s, especially since during the 70's many people who grew-up in the 50's were nostalgic for those days. Travolta became an even bigger star as a result after having skyrocketed into stardom from Saturday Night Fever. All in all a great film.

I was 2 when Welcome Back Kotter was on. What a smart kid I was! This is still my all time favorite movie. I pretty much know all words & songs to it. Its simply the best!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A great movie to watch on a date, a must see if you want to be in with the ladies.","This movie is good, not great , but good. I am not really into it, but I am am more of a Grease 2 fan myself. The one cool thing for guys in this movie is, of course, John ""the coolest man on the planet"" Travolta. He plays Danny, who falls in love with Sandy one summer at the beach. I really shouldn't waste the reader's time because they all know the story. I only want the young generation of guys who might think that Grease is just a movie for girls to stop and think. As a young man, I realized that by watching and liking Grease, I stood a 50% better chance of picking up women. So even though it is a chick flick, guys can greatly benefit from the movies greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Good Golden Oldie,"Every year I will sit down and watch Grease. And i will never ever get tired of the romantic love, the comedy, and the outstanding songs performed by the cast.A lot of people today are talking about how good High School Musical is and what a perfect movie it is. But nobody remembers Grease. If you ask me, High School Musical is a 21st century copy of Grease.If you want a good movie, than it's Grease. It is not rushed like many movies, or stretched like others. It tells the story at it's own pace, which is why it is such a good movie.I would recommend this movie to all of you people. Trust me you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not a good message, but, sometimes fun","Well where do I start, it is far from my favorite movie. The songs were heavily overplayed in 1978, and ever since. It does not have a good message.It also has one good and very upbeat song, that they play during the dance-off. (I really don't know why that did not get played on the radio. I liked it a lot more than, ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""Summer Lovin"" and ""You're The One That I Want"") This movie had not too great massages: fitting in is very important, and a girl has got to make a guy jealous, if she wants attention from him. A guy should change himself and become a jock for the sake of getting the girl.I really did not get the Travolta-Newton John magnetism either. Neither did many others, judging by the number of people who saw or even recall that they made a second movie together, six years later. (There's a Trivia Question)However, I watched it a number of time. There must be something about this movie that makes it palletable, when I have nothing else to do.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I apologise to fans, but this is as honest as it gets.","Based heavily upon the stage-show, Grease is an up beat, feel-good musical that has spawned an appalling sequel, countless CDs and a larger fan-base than most premier league football teams. But why don't I like it? With the exception of the Blues Brothers, I'm not a fan of musicals, I find them shallow, ill conceived and heavily dependent upon merchandise, but that's just me. The main reason I avoid all things Grease is that I saw the stage show before the film. It was in the London west-end, nearing the end of its run in a small theatre, with an unknown cast and no big star. And despite myself, I didn't find it disagreeable. The songs were acceptable (even amusing at times), the characterisation was incredible for a stage musical (in a cartoon-character kind of a way) and the comedic moments were actually funny. I was amazed that there was no taste of bile in my mouth, and that I had no need for therapy afterwards. So when my friends finally managed to get me to watch the film (as part of a deal: I would watch Grease if she would watch Blues Brothers, she got the better deal) I didn't complain too loudly. I wish I had. 	Despite being an almost direct adaptation of the stage show of the day, somewhere along the line, something had been lost. The characters seemed less cartoon like, and more two dimensional; the songs packed less of a punch, and at times made me desire the fast-forward button and the comedic moments just weren't as good. I don't know if it's because twenty-odd years have passed since the filming, but it just seemed . . . tame.The songs are famous to get toes tapping at `any' party, there's Summer Loving, Greased Lightning, that one with the line `You'd better shape up' and those other ones. Out of an entire musical, only three songs are actually that memorable (I know I'll be criticised by all of you who know the lyrics to every single song in the film, but hey, everyone needs a hobby), taking up about 8 minutes of the film. That's kind of pathetic when you factor in at least two yawn-worthy songs (about 6 minutes) and the film seems less of a musical and more of a chore. 	Now, I wouldn't complain about the music if there were some decent filler material in between warblings, but the film was lacking in this area too. Dialogue was cheesy at the most, or as I like to call it, just plain bad. Today it seems ridiculous to watch John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John exchanging some lines that wouldn't seem out of place in a twelve-year old girls love story. If you're someone who likes to hear actors in their thirties play kids in their teens, spouting seventies dialect in the fifties then this is the film for you. If you like to watch over-ripe, then don't let me stop you. If however, you have a shred of taste in your body (and/or a Y chromosome) then stay well away.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Vocals and Lyrics,"Everyone knows by now the story of Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson, who meet at the beach during the summer, and due to a change in plans, (Sandy's parents decide to let her stay in the USA) they wind up at the same high school. Nineteen-fifties mayhem ensues, with greasers, girl gangs, jealousy, dance contests, and rivalries. I know all of the questions about Sandy turning ""bad"" to get a man, and whether or not the movie is a bad example for children. Those are questions about parenting, not good or bad movie-making.I saw this movie when it was initially released; I was a kid! I really loved it then. Yesterday, it was on TV, and I was somewhat disappointed. The dance numbers were not nearly as tight as I remembered, especially the TV dance contest number, and ""Beauty School Dropout."" Stockard Channing's role was not done as well as I had remembered, but Dinah Manoff was really beautiful. I had forgotten that she was such a knockout.The soundtrack is brilliant, and ""Hopelessly Devoted"" is absolutely classic. Newton-John's voice is spine tingling, definitely deserving of an Oscar. I think it is wonderful that all of the actors did their own vocals. Despite feeling somewhat critical toward this movie, the vocal performances make it a must see for any fan of musicals.

The first song and Greased Lightning are my favorite songs of the show, but it is a hard choice since all of the songs are amazing.This movie just makes me happy every time I watch it. I love the beginning scene with Danny and Sandy on the beach. I love how Sandy is introduced to the pink ladies. I love the ending of the movie and I love the sense of humor in the show. Sonny, Frenchy, and Rizzo are amazing supporting characters. No matter how sad I am- this movie puts a smile on my face.

Grease Fanatic,"Grease has always been and will always be one of my all time favorite movies. It was the highest grossing movie of 1978 and the most successful musical ever. Yet it didn't win any Oscars that year. Instead some crappy less popular movie that no one remembers won. For the one or two people who have never seen it, here's a summary. Sandy and Danny meet the summer before senior year. Sandy was from Australia and was supposed to go back. Turns out she was able to spend a year in the USA going to Rydell High. She meets up with Danny, and he acts like a jerk. They get back together and he acts like a jerk again. They get together when they realize how much they mean to each other.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Divisive, controversial and extremely camp","It's hard to describe just how much I hate musicals, but I can just about tolerate this relatively enjoyable adaptation. Grease is far from perfect and, for a 110-minute film, there isn't much of a storyline to speak of. A lot of the acting is pretty abysmal and there are some dubious messages about what it means and what it takes to be popular. There are also some highly sexist moments that are hard to accept regardless of when this movie was made. Despite all this, the gloriously camp performance of John Travolta and the legendary soundtrack are enough to make this an iconic classic for many viewers.The film is very pretty, with the crisp colours of the 50s and a visually dazzling cast. Travolta is absolutely mesmerising as Danny Zuko and dominates every scene he is involved in. Olivia Newton-John is perfectly lovely although her acting is quite wooden and a little childish at times. I never felt much of a chemistry between these two characters, and the trajectory of their romance doesn't feel particularly believable. Stockard Channing aside, the rest of the cast are fairly useless and many scenes are quite painful to watch.The music is amazing, just pure unadulterated fun. Four decades later and it sounds as fresh and charming as ever. There is an innocence about this music, this era and these characters which may be overidealistic but certainly creates a great feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived through this time period. I can understand the highly polarized reviews of Grease; it is both fresh yet dated, charming yet disturbing, edgy yet corny. A fascinating part of 20th century pop culture that makes you question if we have gone forward or backward as a society.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It may be just a musical, but it touches on a lot of different subjects, not just high-school romance. the acting is unforgettable, the sets are all very nice and representative of that era. and who can forget the songs? the songs are just the icing on the cake. and, oh, what a sweet, sweet icing it is! Olivia-Newton John and John Travolta had such an on screen chemistry that made the movie come alive. How else do you explain that this is still one of the most popular movies out there, even today?

The only real problem I have is the sound mixing. The songs all sound weird, like they were recorded in an echo chamber.

From the opening credits and the Barry Gibb title song, through to the 'hollywood' ending where Travolta and Newton John drive away into the sky, this movie never stops being entertaining. The main cast does well as does the support.  The songs are all well staged and enjoyable.  Rydell High is actually a combination of a number of schools, the outside being Venice High School in Hollywood.   New songs written especially for the film were, Grease, You're the one that I want, Hopelessly devoted to you and Sandy and compliment the original score of Summer Nights, Greased Lightnin' etc.  I totally recommend this film to anyone who hasn't yet seen it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Inexplicable,"Why THIS? Why is THIS, of all musicals, so popular?And why was THIS film re-released all over the world - in mainstream cinemas that were unwilling to touch even ""Apocaypse Now Redux"", no less - rather than some other musical of the 1970s? (I presume ""Grease"" appeals primarily to people for whom cinematic history begins in the 1970s, otherwise the question of why not some other musical becomes even more perplexing.)  Why not ""Scrooge""? ""Fiddler on the Roof""? ""Jesus Christ Superstar""? ""The Slipper and the Rose""? I'll admit I haven't seen those last two, but that's partly the point - I'd LIKE to see them, whereas ""Grease"" is the kind of thing I watch either because of a compulsive behaviour disorder or out of duty, to see if this time around I'll get to find out what makes it so popular.No luck so far. I'll admit it's mediocre, no worse, but it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. In the course of the whole we-made-it-up-as-we-went-along narrative none of the characters, with the possible exception of two of the Pink Ladies, demonstrates that he or she has a soul, or any of the standard mechanics that make up a human being: beliefs, desires, passions, and so forth. The shallowness goes beyond the fact that the characters are shallow. The characters aren't even really THERE; the film comes across as a circus, a revue, something to enable the songs to be strung together. Each song, considered by itself, sounds as though it's expressing something (which is why the early songs, particularly ""Summer Love"", work best), but this usually turns out to have been an illusion. The unpleasant undercurrent of cruelty is probably accidental. The aggressive barrage of sexual references (it might have come across as playful, but it doesn't) probably isn't, although I'm amused at all the people who pride themselves on being able to play Freud with ""Greased Lightning"", almost the only five-minute sequence that ISN'T sexual.Someone here said, of ""Grease"", that it dates from the era when people knew how to make musicals, when the song-and-dance routines exhibited real performing talent and energy. And so it does; but it comes from the very end of that era. It's the dying gasp. Vey often we can see THAT the performers are energetic, but a sustained display never quite makes it onto the screen. Part of the problem is sonic. The songs, never the best, have been shockingly recorded; listen to ""Sandra Dee"" with your eyes shut, and you can't fail to notice that the words sound thin and the music even thinner, and the voices in ""Greased Lightning"" (which has been ineptly staged) vanish into no particular musical texture even if you keep your eyes open and TRY not to notice.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not so much a review of this film, but...","This is not so much a review of this decent musical film made over 40 years ago about a period in time that took place two decades earlier than when the film was made, but a comment to those who complained that the amazing and perfectly-cast Ben Platt was too old to play a teenager at the age of 26 in the film version of HIS musical, ""Dear Evan Hansen.""To those of you of that foolish opinion, in spite of the fact that Ben was the youngest person to ever win a Tony Award for Lead Actor in a Musical for originating the role he portrayed in the film, please take a moment to look up the ages of the majority of the actors in this film. Most were in their late 20s, and one was even in her 30s!So, if you had no issue with the ages of the actors in this film portraying teenagers, but did have an issue with Ben Platt playing one while in his mid-20s, I have an issue with you.

Why - because the music, every one, held up well and still sounds great. Stockard Channing's Rizzo is still my favorite character but Didi Conn the beauty school dropout was still lots of fun.

Bu this is what they were like, set in that time period, and it's a musical snap shot of those times, So at least it's not the cut to bit versions of the film we had to suffer way back when.

BEST All time feel good movie,"First of all I will not say this is the best acting or even close to the best acting in a movie I have saw. However, the characters were believable and made you want to be part of the school. The music alone was great and really (as a musical should) got you involved emotionally. I found myself rooting for/against certain characters and feeling like I lost when when events did not happen the way I wanted. One of the few movies I have felt that way about. There are many up and downs, but I think most people can relate in one way or another to some character in this movie.

Re-visited,"The songs are wonderful (all but the `Sandra Dee' number), the scene with Travolta trying out for the different sports is top notch, and this musical/movie has been an inspiration for many.  The last 15 minutes of the movie is pure musical brilliance (except for possibly the dumbest scene in musical history: when the car started to fly).  Personally, I had not seen this movie in 18 or 20 years, and I must admit that it has tarnished quite a bit for me over time.  In fact, I can only give it a 6.8/10¬ÖBottom line, I think most people must have a sentimental attachment to `Grease' in order to like it after all these years.  Too much fluff for me, but I can see why people dig it.  Not that I cannot get into syrupy type movies; however, I found myself loathing the parts where it sounded like everyone talking at once.  There was very little breathing space and only so many leather jackets and 30-year-old teenagers the eye could take.  Also I am more of a film-as-art critic than I was the first million times I saw `Grease"" )back in the early eighties).Don't get me wrong. I mean, I am of the generation in which this movie came out; nevertheless, I have since become a firm believer in keeping stage productions off the silver screen.  Combining the two genres has done nothing but muddy the waters a bit.  It is like 99% of the time when a band covers a song it is never as great as when the original artists did it. What's more, it does not really seem like art to me when a Director or a Producer takes an existing stage production and trys to pass it off to the film crowd as something new.  If all it takes to make a box office smash is to take someone elses work, add a few extra lights, nifty camera angles, and a few big names, then hell, I want a piece of that action!  It is a lazy man's game and it does not support artistic integrity.  A case in point, take any opera, film it, put it on DVD...a few people will buy it, but most of the purist will snub their collective noses at it. Then again, the movie going public (in general) do not SEEM to be so pure in the search for excellence in their chosen genre. *NOTE* I am not so much talking about ""Grease"" here, but a certain movie named after the Windy City, that won a best picture Oscar. What a travesty  But, hey, if people never mixed different styles of art together then we would not have nearly half the music that we have today¬Öso who am I to complain?Nonetheless, as pure film/art I think `Grease' would have been better off on Broadway.  And I bet John Travolta was not even driving that car in the big car race scene (ha) (Not really funny).Fun to watch 68% of the time.  6.8/10I could say so more, but nobody reads this stuff anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bar none my favorite movie ever produced!,"This has been my favorite movie since I was ten years old, and without revealing my age, let's just say that is quite a long time.

It gave me a love of musicals that has only grown over time. It made me a lifetime fan of John Travolta (I had seen him before I was a big ""Welcome Back Kotter"" fan). Same goes for Olivia Newton-John and Stockard Chaning to a lesser degree.There was something about this movie that touched me to the core back then. It is fun, wholesome entertainment. Almost everyone loves a good love story but this one provided fun, great music, and John Travolta in a killer leather jacket.Now, in my family, it is a tradition. We have passed it down to our children and they have become fans. I have a picture of my godson dancing with John Travolta to ""Greased Lightning."" It's the cutest thing you will ever see.

A masterpiece musical that deserved it's huge success,"Along with most other households in the UK for members of Gen X (the best generation by the way), we had the soundtrack for the film Grease. When the film was finally shown on UK TV I recorded it and watched it fat too much. It was a 'go to film' for a time when I was young.But this was stopped when I asked my brother's new girlfriend if she liked the film and soundtrack. She frowned and said 'It's a bit tacky...' This stayed with me. How could I have been into something so lacking in sophistication and tacky?! My love for Grease abruptly ended.I found myself recently revisiting the film when it was shown on TV again. Would I cringe and snigger whilst wondering how I could have possibly have watched such rubbish as a child? No! I loved it!For those who have been living under a rock since 1978, the film concerns the holiday romance between Danny Zuko and Australian Sandy Olsson. As Sandy finds that her family are staying on in America rather than returning to Oz she starts at Rydell High School, not knowing that Zuko attends there. She also doesn't know that he is the leader of a greaser gang known as The T-Birds. This leads to the tough and streetwise Danny she meets rather than the sensitive and caring Danny she knew from her summer holiday. Sandy is taken under the wind of a girl gang known as The Pink Ladies led by the inimitable Rizzo.I love how theres another layer to the wit within the film that completely went over my head when I was a kid. Grease is full of filthy references as the teenagers characters (most of whom look like they're actually at least 35) are unabashedly full of hormones and lust (except the pure and virginal Sandy). And so we get fantastic 'blink and you'll miss them' gags such as a car door being slammed on Danny's erection at the drive-in after he tried to get it on with Sandy and the appearance of the cling film during the Greased Lightning sequence.And then theres the music which is just as steeped in nostalgia and a lost era as the film's visuals and narrative are. And just like the rest of the film, the songs are just as funny. Possibly the greatest of these is the Beauty School Dropout sequence resplendent with Frankie Avalon. Surreal, hilarious and utterly inspired.But there are also poignant musical moments such as Sandy singing Hopelessly Devoted To You and Rizzo's There Are Worse Things I Could Do. This isn't a one note movie.Grease originally started as a stage musical on Broadway in 1972 and was instrumental in a revival of all things 50's Americana in the 70's which continued with American Graffiti and Happy Days. The film imbues the same wistful nostalgia which is gleefully part fact, part fiction as times gone by normally are when viewed through rose-tinted glasses. This doesn't matter a jot however as Grease is still a fantastic piece of escapism.In fact, theres very little difference between this and say, John Waters' Cry Baby which just goes to show what a fantastic era both films draw inspiration from and how close to the bone and risqu√© they are.Grease has also been the subject of many different kinds of film analysis. My favourite is the one that sees it as a lesbian text with Sandy being 'femme' and Danny being 'butch'.Grease is a film that was the highest grossing of 1978, with the soundtrack being just as successful when it came to record sales. And it was utterly justified.Watching Grease after so many years was like being visited by an old friend.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Grease,"""Sandy"" (Olivia Newton John) is a well brought up young girl who meets and falls in love with ""Danny"" (John Travolta) during summer break in late 1950's California. When they both start high school, though, we discover she to be the archetypical preppie-type who hangs about with Stockard Channing's ""Pink Ladies"" and he the leader of the ""T-Birds"" - the school's leather and white T-shirt clad greasers. Their obvious attraction to each other is hemmed in by their respective roles at school and they've got to find a way to sort it out! Channing is the star for me in this film. She's great as ""Rizzo"" - loads of attitude, earthy wisdom and ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" - that helps ""Sandy"" to hook her man. Along with some entertainingly well choreographed dance routines, the other songs are superb too - a mixture of toe tappers and sloppy ballads from the likes of Frankie Valli, Frankie Avalon and of course, the two stars with ""You're the One That I Want"" and ""Summer Nights"" that frequently outdo the rather banal script. It's a gently engaging, slightly competitive love story that, though a bit dated now, was certainly an important film as I grew up!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very old 'teenagers'!,"This is a romantic comedy musical film that was released in 1978, but is set in 1958 in Los Angeles.The film is well-written and well-acted, with good song-and-dance routines.

"Style, style, style. Style over substance.","I've always had my difficulties with this piece, I'm probably just too hard-boned. The ladies love it! So the film. After many attempts, my relationship has only improved minimally. I can definitely relate to the fan impact, cool, (stereo)guys, attitude to life, great visuals, iconic cast, fantastic music, style, style, style. Style over substance. Comic-like characters celebrate no plot whatsoever. A bearable lightness of being. Not really a film, just a mosaic of ideas and clich√©s, a big colourful choreography. A good relationship with musicals is definitely a prerequisite here.

A Pretty Good Musical-Comedy,"With her summer vacation in California over a high school student by the name of ""Sandy"" (Olivia Newton-John) sadly says goodbye to her boyfriend ""Danny"" (John Travolta). Although he is equally sad that they have to be separated he reluctantly goes back to school where his buddies in a gang known as the ""T-Birds"" eagerly greet him. Naturally, he falls back into his tough-guy routine and life continues as it was. Then one night Sandy appears and tells him that she is a student at the same high school. But rather than being pleased Danny puts on a show in front of his peers to avoid embarrassment which he immediately regrets afterwards. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good musical-comedy which earned quite a bit of money and was also nominated for an Oscar along with several Golden Globe awards as well. The dance routine at the end was also quite impressive. In any case, although I wasn't quite as overwhelmed by it as some viewers were, I still liked the film to a certain degree and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Grease,"This is one of my all time favourite films. Grease is just a sheer feel good film, a reminder of more innocent times and freer days. I can still watch it over and over 27 years later and not get bored with it halfway through. It had a fine cast who even though they were much older than teenagers - think Stockard Channing was 35 at the time and hers is one of the best performances of the film, - played their roles with conviction.With regard to John Travolta for me personally it's not his most major role, I think he hit the jackpot in this respect with Saturday Night Fever, however it's the role many people remember him for and will probably continue to do so. A classic it is and so it deserves to be",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Musical Masturbation,"However much sugar you coat this with, Grease is a movie about teenagers expectations for future sex.The film is essentially split into two components. The first is the pre- puberty story of boy loves girl with sugar coated candy floss. The second, the post-puberty, part of the film only takes up the last 15 minutes, is about boys and girls doing the stuff they do prior to back-seat copulation.As a musical the songs essentially come from the pages of a girlie magazine for 13 year old wannabee love hearts. But as adults we view this with nostalgia, for those days before we had to go to work, take out mortgages and bring up families of our own. It reflects that short period of exciting sexual frustration and freedom that society soon inoculates us against until we rediscover it somewhere around our mid-50's.More socially importantly, this is a movie about the beginnings of the Baby Boomer generation.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Uggghhh...,"As I have mentioned before (in my review of Singin' in the Rain) I hate musicals.  I think they are lame and unengaging.  But then a film like Grease comes along.  I hate myself for liking it.  I hate, hate, hate myself.  But dammit, I do like this film.Grease is one of those rare creatures, a musical with a genuine heart.  It is effective. The characters are somewhat engaging, the music is downright infectious, and I really can't stand to say it, but the story is actually kind of fun.I am not a lover of fun movies.  I tend to like dark, sardonic comedies and darker dramas, but then there is something about boyant innocence of Grease. It is a fun film that actually succeeds at being fun.  I don't know if this is just because my older cousins (girls) used to play the soundtrack and lipsynch it to me when I was little.  Of if it was because of my love of 50s rock and roll.  Or even if it is because Olivia Newton-John looks hot as Sandy.  I don't know, but Grease is, and always will be, one of my guilty pleasures.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Guys and dolls.,"'Grease (1978)' is actually really strange, a bizarre mix of songs and high-school drama that doesn't have a proper structure to it. It can't decide if it wants to be campy and surrealistic or straight-forward and sincere. It also doesn't have a strong story, instead simply feeling like a series of independent skits in which its characters bounce between the 'will' and the 'won't' in their 'will they/ won't they?' dynamic. If it's about anything, it's about peer-pressure. The main tension in the focal relationship is the fact that Travolta's Zuko has to hide elements of his personality - including the fact that he actually likes Newton-John's Sandy - simply to sate his narrow-minded friends. Plus, characters are actively encouraged to drink, smoke, change their physical appearance and, even, have unprotected sex. The thing isn't against peer-pressure, though. In fact, it's a huge reason why things 'work out' the way they do. In general, the affair is very flawed. Yet, because it doesn't take itself too seriously (almost feeling like a parody of itself at times) and its song and dance numbers are usually enjoyable, it isn't a terrible experience. It isn't particularly engaging or, even, well-conceived, but it has its moments and it isn't exactly boring, either. It's just about alright. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"OK, one eentsy-beentsy little problem...","I first saw this movie when I was ten, but it wasn't until I was about 15 or 16 that I was old enough to really appreciate it. You know, going to high school in 1959, in the long run, wasn't really that different from going to high school in 1997 (when I went), so I enjoyed the movie and could identify with the characters. One thing I hated about it though: why does almost everyone look like twentysomethings with godlike physiques? The truth is that most high school boys are gangly creatures with bad acne and embarrassing falsetto voices, while many girls at that age are stunted, awkward midgets with pillarlike legs. Heck, there are even college students who fit these descriptions. Oh well, I guess that's the beauty of cinematic license. I love GREASE and hope to see it on stage someday.",,Anonymous,Romance

A classic...,"Well, as much as I am not overly into musicals, then I have to admit that the 1978 ""Grease"" is definitely a classic, right up there alongside the likes of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". I mean, this is something that is a part of pop culture, and most people know of the movie or at least one of the songs.Writer Bronte Woodard and director Randal Kleiser put together an enjoyable and feel-good musical here. And it is definitely one that has something to offer for anyone in the audience, regardless of whom you are.They had a great cast ensemble for this musical, with the leads being carried nicely by John Travolta (playing Danny) and Olivia Newton-John (playing Sandy). But the musical also have the likes of Jeff Conaway, Stockard Channing, Alice Ghostley, Sid Caesar and Eve Arden on the cast list, to mention but a few.The music is good in ""Grease"", and there definitely are some memorable and easy to sing along to songs in the musical. And whom among us doesn't know songs such as ""Summer Nights"", ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", ""Greased Lightning"" and not to forget ""You're the One that I Want"".And there are also lots of dancing in the movie, again the cast really performed well and put on good dance shows.""Grease"" is a musical that has replay value to it, and it is definitely something that you can watch again and again. I have seen ""Grease"" a couple of times throughout the years. And I am genuinely entertained every time I watch it.As for the ending, well it does leave something for the audience to speculate upon, whether or not it was all just a dream or a fantasy.

Great Great Great Movie,Great movie with awesome songs actors and acting. I have loved this movie for about all my life. It is still one of the best movies. People are still comparing musicals to it. Also people are still talking over it. I think that it has some of the best music that I ever heard. The songs were very original and people are still basing movies on them such as High school Musical. Also people are still singing the songs till this day. Studios are still putting it on the cable and satellite channels. Such as ABC Family which is a big hit with most family's an younger children. In about 10 years it will still be a classic and people will still be comparing it to other movies.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good film,"The movie rides along on its production numbers which put forth the things that kids thought important at the time. There's the fear of pregnancy. The fear of being an outcast. The cars. The primping and showing off. The worst thing of all--being labeled a good person. The adults are even bigger buffoons. And the fact that an older Frankie Avalon shows up, doesn't quite work. These guys are dying off now so they probably will have to start casting people to play them as characters. Anyway, if I pick up this movie, I fast forward to about ten places that I totally enjoy and ignore the plot (I guess there is a plot somewhere, but it doesn't matter). I was surprised that Travolta is a pretty decent singer.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
That's entertainment!,"""Grease"" is a quality musical with a tremendous cast. Danny Zuko (Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) meet at the beach during summer vacation and fall in love. Sandy has to return to Australia, but then her family unexpectedly decides to stay in the USA. She enrolls at Rydell High School having no idea that Danny attends there. When they finally run into each other, Danny acts differently because his friends are watching and he has a tough guy image. Sandy is very upset by Danny's behavior and although she tries to get over him, she can't deny her feelings for him. Danny is a sweet guy at heart and does his best to win Sandy back. The entire cast is well chosen and the chemistry between John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John is perfect. The choreography is excellent, especially in Greased Lightning and the dance-off contest.Some viewers have commented that they don't like the fact that Sandy changes her image at the end of the movie. I didn't think this was a big deal, but I guess one could interpret this as a result of peer pressure. I think Sandy was waiting until she was confident enough to deal with the consequences of an adult relationship with Danny. Sandy sings that she's scared and unsure of herself shortly before her transformation. Another viewer comment I read is that the viewer thought it was bad that the Pink Ladies never accept Sandy as one of their own. The Pink Ladies not completely accepting Sandy is extremely realistic of cliques. I think it is positive that Sandy strived for the relationship she wanted with Danny despite the comments and jabs from the Pink Ladies. If we all waited for the acceptance of other people before pursuing something, most of us would still be waiting around 20 years later.I'm glad casting decided to choose 2 leads who can sing instead of picking non-singers to lip sync. The film gives you a good idea of what going to high school in the 1950s is like with the peer pressure, cliques, music, clothes, etc. I wouldn't change a thing about this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Grease is the Worst,"Post-""Welcome Back Cotter"" and ""Saturday Night Fever,"" John Travolta was the biggest star on Earth in 1978. The teenyboppers would have lined up around the block if someone had filmed Travolta picking his nose for two hours. Unfortunately, he did ""Grease"" instead.""Grease"" bears little relationship to the fun, modestly-scaled stage musical from which it takes its name. It looks a lot more like a late-70s ABC TV special with a gargantuan budget. All the elements that made ABC such a pandering, lowbrow success are present: a phony, sugar-coated portrait of the 1950s (a la ""Laverne & Shirley""), smirking double-entendres (a la ""Three's Company""), and, of course, Travolta. The musical numbers even look cadged from a variety show -- the camera is so static during the ""Beauty School Dropout"" number you'll think it's a colorized episode of Ed Sullivan. And thematically, it's all about the importance of being cool -- could there be a more TV-worthy message? Add in special guest appearances by a battalion of TV has-beens (poor Sid Caesar) and you have an insanely overwrought sweeps-month special splashed onto the silver screen for a filmgoing public which had its collective standard lowered by ""Happy Days."" The plot, such as it is, involves John Travolta falling in love with Olivia Newton-John, and the pair encountering a handful of easily overcome obstacles, the greatest of which seems to by Livvy's penchant for straight hair and cardigan sweaters. Travolta has made a career of looking comfortable in ridiculously contrived circumstances, and as Danny Zuko, he's perfectly believable belting out an angst-drenched torch song in front of an animated hot dog jumping into a bun. The lovely Miss Newton-John fares much worse. She can't act and she's a very limited singer (please note ""Have You Never Been Mellow""), and up to this point she had survived on her sincerity and sweetness (again ""Have You Never Been Mellow""). The transformation of her character Sandy from sap to sex goddess neatly parallels Olivia's not-wholly-successful attempt to do the same with her career: she spent the years after ""Grease"" trying to be sultry, kind of a pre-Madonna Madonna, and all she wound up with was a million-selling aerobics anthem (""Physical""). As for the supporting cast, it's a pretty mixed lot. There are bona fide talents like Stockard Channing, who plays Rizzo, leader of the girls' gang the Pink Ladies, and is far too old for the role but brings real sassiness to ""Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" and real sadness to ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do."" And there are pieces of human scenery like Jeff Conaway, who plays ""Kenickie,"" the world's least threatening thug. And there are slumming pros like Eve Arden and Joan Blondell, who add nostalgia appeal and look happy to be getting a paycheck. The songs, save for the obscenity-sprinkled ""Greased Lightning,"" are pretty bland and sound like overproduced cover versions of 50's R&R, plus, the musical sequences in the film are utter yawns to a generation raised on the jump-cut editing of MTV. If your attention doesn't wander while Livvy is wandering around a back yard warbling the Connie Francis knockoff ""Hopelessly Devoted To You,"" you have superhuman powers of concentration. So why do I know so much about this movie, which I dislike so much? Well, I was a tween in the late 70s, when pop culture was boring put flawlessly promoted, so people my age were force-fed bilge like ""Grease"" and swallowed it whole.

There are no bad performances in it. There are no bad songs, actors, situations, nothing - it is PERFECT.Travolta and Newton-john couldn't have been better cast, they both look and sound fantastic. Olivia gives the performance of her life. She fails to match up to this movie in anything else, and Travolta went from strength to strength (forget ""Sing""). The supporting cast are perfection with an honourable mention going to the majestic Stockard Channing. When Rizzo sings ""There are worst things I could do"" I was heartbroken as a child, as a grown man the woman can reduce me to tears every time.

But for me, this film is without question pure magic and will always be my number one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Prefect! Despite not really being a movie.,"At times it feels more like a collection of music videos than a movie. With paper thin characters, no real plot, forward movement, drama or conflict. Sure, things come up that seem like they put our heroes in a difficult spot. Pressure to have sex, dropping out of school, teenage pregnancy, a potential deadly drag race, a gang fight, but then you look down at your phone for a text or tweet and you completely missed the 5 seconds of runtime the filmmakers took to resolve said issue before the next musical number. So why do we or I all love this movie so much? I think when you have really likable characters you don't want to see anything bad happen to them, especially teenagers. Because we've all been at that point in our lives where our future is ahead of us, we think we know it all, we think the friends and loves we have at that time will be there for the rest of our lives. However, we now know almost all of those things are false and our parents that we rebelled against so much for telling us what to do were right about almost everything they warned us about, but man oh man wouldn't it be cool if our past selves or these characters were right?

Bubblegum for the masses.,"When this came out in 1978, I had just hit my teens, so just about the right age to enjoy it. But I never understood the appeal, even then. A series of 1950s pastiche songs permanently in the charts made this the last film in the world I'd want to see. It was one of those inexplicable and inescapable pop culture phenomena which annoyed the hell out of everyone who was not enraptured by it.Seeing it for the first time all these years later, I have tried to take as unprejudiced a view as I can. I have tried to watch it a few times before, but always found it leaden and predictable. The music is not the only clich√©-ridden thing in it, indeed it consists of nothing more than a series of 1950s clich√©s strung together. Two rival gangs (safely sanitised naturally). A school dance. A drive-in movie. A car race. Looks like the authors watched Rebel Without A Cause and Westside Story and blended them together. Minus any of the threat inherent in those works of course. Danny's gang sound and act like Top Cat's gang from the 70s cartoon.It might be said that these things have become 50s clich√©s because they were so prevalent at the time. Fair enough. But these scenes have no organic connection with each other. You just feel the writers say ""what shall we do now? I know, let's have a song about a t-bird, they had those in the 50s."" Nothing has any real consequence in this film nor is there any character development. One girl has unprotected sex and for a time thinks she's pregnant. Then it turns out she's not. Yippee.Sandy wants to be respected by Danny. But has a volte-face after seeing him win a car race. She then turns into the local skank and comes onto him, which would drive most men to run a mile. Its lucky this is set in the 1950s when the worst vice was smoking; if it were set today, she would turn into a crack whore.All of this could be countered with the fact that this is not a plot or character driven film but a musical, and the plot merely exists to hang a series of set pieces on. After all many musicals of Hollywood's golden age have laughable plots merely designed to frame spectacular song and dance routines. So that brings us back to the quality of the songs themselves. Are they good enough that we can overlook the film's obvious faults? Well ""Summer nights"" and ""You're the one that I want"" are good songs and produce the most memorable scenes. There is nothing spectacular or even inventive about them in the manner of old Fred and Ginger numbers, however. The other songs are largely forgettable but I do like the production ""beauty school dropout"" which is the most imaginative thing in the film.Worst of all is the title track which stands out like a sore thumb. It is a disco-era song, completely at variance with the rest of the music. And its lyrics are incomprehensible. ""Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion and grease is the way we are feeling"" would rank high as the most mindless ever written.Ultimately this is very non-threatening entertainment. Agreeable enough but it says a lot about public taste that something so derivative has been such a sensational and so widely imitated.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Much Ado About Not Much,"I may be in the minority, but i just wasn't all that impressed with this movie. The two big stars - John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John - gave kind of lackluster performances, and I didn't feel any chemistry between them. To me, the love story of Danny and Sandy was boring, and I much preferred the one between Rizzo (Stockard Channing) and Kenickie (Jeff Conaway). These two did a great job (much better than the stars) and I'd have rather seen them as the leading couple, with the story focused on their relationship.I also liked Didi Conn, and my fav song (the only one I really liked, aside from the title song) was ""Beauty School Dropout"", sung to perfection by Frankie Avalon.Aside from that, the songs were hokey, the actors too far past high school age, and the idea that goody two shoes sandy turns herself into a hot chick overnight was way too over the top.

A must watch,"The movie Grease is a required viewing for me. The way the movie plays out is done very well. Olivia Newton-John plays Sandy very well, portrays her as the innocent person that she is. While John Travolta plays the bad boy Danny and does that very well. Aside from the fact that the movie was made a while so it is a little weird, it is still good. As a teenager it portrayed what being in high school is really like. Everyone cares what you think and does whatever it takes to fit in. Also the music in it is very genius. They got people who could hit the high notes. Some people that you cast in musicals could not hit the high notes. The movie has a lot of sexual innuendos which pull people in and if they are in high school like me provide a little laugh. The music is brilliant especially the song ""Hopelessly Devoted"" because it explains exactly how a girl feels about her crush in high school and how bad it can get when you like someone that much. ""You're the one that I want"" is also a very good song because it shows that in the end some people can get together if you have a strong enough connection. Even with the fitting in, Sandy just wants friends not so much fitting in just wants to make some friends out of the whole experience. Frenchie later decided that she wanted to follow her dreams, but in the friend group no one ended up caring about that anymore. The movie does deal with some serious topics. As in people wanting to have sex so that they can fit in is a huge problem. Rizzo faces maybe going to lose her friends if she does not have sex it shows this vulnerable side of her that we had not seen in the rest of the movie. I don't think that Rizzo knew exactly what would be the consequences if she went through with this only thinking about the friends that she wanted to keep made her do that. The fact about doing that to fit in was okay shows the difference between high school then and then you see now where it has that, but has been amplified and worse. I feel that Grease can tell a story about the hardships, great ending or not it still shows the struggle of what you have to do if you care about someone enough. Sandy and Danny they were a couple I doubted a lot but they ended up fighting and were able to come through with so much experience. Even though the friends may have judged them they still liked each other enough to make it work. I feel that all the pressure put on can fall off if you watch this movie you can see people that really care about you versus who is using you.

High School Was Never Like This...Too Bad,"A jukebox musical that redefined its genre and has lasted well beyond all expectations, ""Grease"" is easy to dismiss on the basis of its simplistic story and characterizations that never rise above stereotypes. But it is also a galvanizing entertainment that works.Danny (John Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) are high-school kids who meet at the beach one summer, not knowing that they will be seeing a lot more of each other next fall at Rydell High School. Danny runs with a tough crowd, while Sandy is a sweet and wholesome girl whose affections threaten to hold him down and make him look weak in front of his pals.""I got this image, right?"" he tells her. Like many high schoolers, the characters in ""Grease"" are all about their image, only few ever looked as good worrying about it as these guys do.The unlikely triumph that is ""Grease"" is often ascribed to its soundtrack, which includes a number of recognizable hits still familiar nearly 40 years after the movie's release. But the film's place as a cult favorite is as attributable to two other, related things: tone and balance.Director Randal Kleiser took a fairly rough and raunchy Broadway musical and reinvented it as a paean for Hollywood nostalgia. An opening cartoon, primitively animated, effectively sets up the rest of the film as a gaudy, goofy take on growing up, with plenty of sex jokes that somehow manage to maintain an overarching aura of innocence. Serious topics are introduced, but in a way that never drags down the light tone.The musical numbers are the highlights, mostly ensemble pieces that include two of its biggest hits, the opening ""Summer Nights"" and the closing ""You're The One That I Want,"" both staged with the kind of lavish choreography and tight camera-work that rewards multiple viewings. Kleiser favors long mid-shots with sharp cuts, which works because there's a lot going on and the syncopation is what sells it.Yet for the purposes of emotional investment, the two best numbers, surprisingly, are solo ballads: Travolta's ""Sandy"" and ""There Are Worse Things I Can Do,"" sung by the school's make-out queen, Rizzo (Stockard Channing), both of which achieve an intimacy that gives ""Grease"" a kind of power. I get a lump in my throat whenever I watch a hot dog jump into a bun in the former number that has nothing to do with the double entendre involved.The dialogue, by producer Allan Carr and Bronte Woodard, offers pretty silly banter in place of story for the most part, yet like the songs it keeps the energy moving and the energy light. ""Grease"" is motion, like the Frankie Valli song says, and that's what you get.Even the dead-end scenes that clog the film's middle, regarding a pep rally for a big football game we never see and Danny's varsity sports tryouts only referenced briefly again at the end, don't tax your viewing patience. You enjoy the changes of pace while the scenery is being moved offstage for the next big number. ""Grease"" captures a sense of being young, with its heady enthusiasm and eagerness to please. It's a shame the formula seems so difficult to repeat.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"sometimes funny, but mostly painful","I should admit from the start that I'm not a huge fan of musicals. I was forced to watch this movie by my girlfriend, possibly in retaliation for my having made her watch three Jackie Chan movies in a row. So, take this review for whatever it's worth.Grease's status as a classic is, for me, quite perplexing. It's just a formulaic love story set in the 50s around a bunch of high school students (most of which, incidentally, appear to be at least in their mid 30s -- some, like Riz, look about 50). Although funny in parts -- the Frankie Avalon song, and the sequence where John Travolta tries to be a jock come to mind -- it largely just consists of stilted, cheesy dialogue and some of the lamest songs imaginable. (""Ramalamadingdong"", anyone?) This movie might work if seen as an over-the-top satire, I guess, but that doesn't make it any less painful to watch.As a mode of vengeance for girlfriends, then, this movie rates a 10. Guys beware.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Grease is the word!,"For the very first time, I watched Grease for free on YouTube, just tonight. And I've gotta say, outside of the rather ridiculous stereotypes, it really holds up!Set in 1958, Grease centers around bad boy Danny Zuko (played by John Travolta) and elegant Aussie exchange student Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John), who develop an attraction for each other during a summer romance. However, things take a strange turn when school is back in session at Rydell High School, where Danny resumes his role as leader of the T-Birds greaser gang, consisting of Doody (Barry Pearl), Sonny LaTierri (Michael Tucci), Putzie (Kelly Ward) and of course, his best friend and trusted number two, Kenickie (Jeff Conaway). Sandy, meanwhile, meets greaser girl clique the Pink Ladies, consisting of leader Betty Rizzo (Stockard Channing), Jan (Jamie Donnelly), Marty Maraschino (Dinah Manoff) and Frenchy Facciano (Didi Conn, pre-Shining Time Station!). Will Danny and Sandy's romance cross clique lines?The acting in this movie is spectacular! John Travolta is very slick and charming as Danny. Olivia Newton-John (may she rest in peace) is wholesome and graceful as Sandy. The actors playing the T-Birds and Pink Ladies are great, too! In particular, I didn't expect Didi Conn to be in this. She's very lovely as Frenchy. Y'know what, everybody does great with their roles.The writing is fantastic, too! Ignoring the dumb stereotypes, the movie is packed with charm, wit and great humor. Some of this movie's comedic highlights include Sandy's first sleepover with the Pink Ladies, Danny's hilarious failed attempts at joining a sports team, the ""Blue Moon"" bit (you'll have to see for yourself), and many others. Also, the movie is even heartwarming, especially at the ending.And lastly, we have the music! Being a movie adaptation of a play, Grease, as expected, is a dedicated musical, with some really funky songs you can bop to. The title song, ""Grease"" by Frankie Valli, is really catchy. But so are the other ones, especially ""Summer Nights"", ""Greased Lightnin'"", ""You're The One That I Want"", and my personal favorite, ""We Go Together"". I specifically bring those up, because in those ones, John Travolta really gets to show off what an incredible singing voice he's got (and still has, in fact)!When all's said and done, Grease is a fun, bouncy, feel-good movie that withstood the test of time very well. It's got charm, it's got great humor, and it's got great music! Highly recommended!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Classic Film That Almost Everyone Loves,"In 1978 Hollywood seem to be the best year of produced movies since in 1939. Many films in 1978 became templates for their genres that later other films copied. Films released in 1978 include ""Animal House"", ""Magic"", ""The Boys from Brazil"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Superman: The Movie"", ""Heaven Can Wait"", ""Foul Play"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Every Witch Way But Loose"" ""Halloween"" and ""Grease"".All the above films still are still popular. They all sell millions of dollars worth of DVD Sales each year. ""Grease"" of course out sells them all.In case you didn't know the story ""Grease"" is the story of ""Danny and Sandy"". They are both crazy for each other and yet they are polar opposites. The catchy score has now produced classic tunes. If you missed out on the original theatrical release that is sad. The film had such a high energy level that you left the movie theater wanting to sing.The major criticism about the film was that ""They all looked too old to still be in high school"". Well that is true but I would rather see talented performers playing roles than untalented age apposite actors.This film is family safe but today the film would be rated PG-13. There is some very adult jokes in the film but, it will go over most children's head (and some adults).My complaint about the film is that it has never had a great Blu- release. Yes there has been releases that had ""Deleted scenes"" but not all of them. There is still plenty of deleted footage that has never been released and I would love to see them.I would also love to see a documentary that explores the making of the film.

"After previously watching this several times during my youth, I got a great kick of seeing the sing-a-long version of Grease","Just watched most of the sing-a-long version on CBS hours earlier (I came home from work after the first 30 minutes had already played). My mom claimed she had not seen this movie before but when I was younger, I remember her commenting on some of the scenes when watching the VHS version with my siblings. When I was a pre-teen kid, I had watched this particular movie lots of times, whether at the local library, at the Broadmoor Theatre, or on network TV (which censored certain lyrics of ""Greased Lightning"" and cut out the mooning scene). The version I just watched on CBS simply muted the offending words-as well as not print them on screen though the sh-one got various typed symbols-from that song and just didn't show the bare butts on camera during that mooning scene. Anyway, all those times I previously watched it, I enjoyed it sooooo much, it for a while was my favorite movie. Since 1981, It's a Wonderful Life took that place. Still, it's always a treat to watch John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John on screen together whether talking, singing, or dancing together. And the songs are always a thrill to watch and listen to especially since I've heard the songs several times on record before my first time watching this movie. The lyrics printed on screen also added some visual symbols to basically humorously comment on the action on screen. Of the older adult characters, I especially liked the interaction of Eve Arden and Dody Goodman as the principal and her assistant, respectively. And Sid Caesar is aces in those PE training scenes with Travolta, that's for sure! And then there's that John Wilson cartoon during the opening credits while Barry Gibb's title song is playing that's also a fine addition to the movie. Really, all I'll say now is Grease is still the word, after a little more than 40 years... Update-I finally got to see the sing-a-long versions of ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"", ""Summer Nights"" and the first ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" number on YouTube just now...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Grease,"Grease is an energetic, upbeat musical that takes place in the 1950's. The movie does a fantastic job of capturing the time period and bringing the audience back to when Rock and Roll was here to stay and everyone danced the Jitterbug, with the costumes, hair and makeup, set designs, cars, and the music to match. All of the songs are very catchy and further engage the crowd into the film. Grease has made such a lasting impression that even people today for Halloween still dress up as the iconic main characters, Danny and Sandy.Grease is the story of a bad boy, Danny Zuko, who has a summer fling with a sweet girl from Australia, Sandy Olson. At the end of the summer they believe their love is over and they must go their separate ways, but find themselves at the same school in the fall. The rest of the movie goes through their senior year of high school and the ups and downs of their relationship, as well as their relationship with their friends.John Travolta does an excellent job playing the bad boy Danny Zuko. He has the right look and attitude that really made the character come to life. With this bad boy attitude, Travolta made all the girls in the movie, as well as watching the movie, fall in love with him. He brought out an inner Elvis Presley type character when he sang and danced that fit right in with the era of the movie that made the plot so much more convincing. Olivia Newton-John played the sweet girl from Australia, Sandy Olson, who goes with Danny Zuko. Olivia Newton-John just has the lovable, innocent, pure look to her that makes her character more believable. Her voice is very smooth and elegant when she sings and it just makes the audience more engaged in her character. The director did an outstanding job selecting the actor/actress to play the main characters, as well as the rest of the cast.Even though the overall film is entertaining, the theme presented is controversial for teenage girls. Grease gives the message that in order for a boy to like you, you need to change for them; whether that be looks, attitude, personality, etc. Not only does the movie send this message, but media and magazines today give young girls the sense that they are not good enough. A girl should not have to change to make a boy like her. We need to be sending messages to young girls to be confident in their own skin and they are perfect just the way they are. ¬† ¬†¬†¬† Grease has changed the musical genre. There have been many movies made similar to it, like High School Musical and Hairspray. It has been a hit since it premiered in theaters and is still a favorite among many people today. If you are looking for a musical with a cheesy love story and great singing and dancing, this is the movie for you.",,Anonymous,Romance

I don't care what anybody says---this film is SPECTACULAR!,"This movie came out when I was just 1, and I'm amazed by the hate reviews it got. For those of you that hate this, you need to know this: (1) It's a MUSICAL, so what do you expect? In a MUSICAL, people are expected to sing and dance when they're supposed to because it's called ACTING. It's not supposed to be a real thing. (2) Everyone in the movie can act and sing, and that goes to John Travolta too. (3) At least it's not the same thing as High School Musical. What lesson do you think HSM teaches you? Grease teaches you that love is all about making sacrifices for the other person, because that's just what love is. Those of you that hate this are completely missing the point of what it truly is about. Maybe next time when you see a film, watch the WHOLE thing first and then you can judge so you don't look like an idiot. Great storyline, great acting/singing/dancing.

One of my favourite musicals that was a highlight of my youth,"The first time I saw this film in its entirety (prior to this I saw the musical number clips on VH1) was at the cinema when it was re-released for its 20th anniversary when I was 11 and in my first year at secondary school. Re-visiting this film today brought back many memories, especially my Eisteddfod performance of 'Summer Nights (one of the best songs)' with my form. Before I saw the film in full, I'd listen to the film's soundtrack on tape on 'Wet Play' days (playtime in the classroom on rainy days) with my fellow classmates at primary school.There are plenty of positive aspects of this film such as the majority of musical numbers being memorable (with the exception of There Are Worse Things I Could Do,' Rizzo's second solo performance that I completely forgot about), especially 'Grease Is The Word,' 'Summer Nights,' 'Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee,' 'Hopelessly Devoted To You,' 'Greased Lightning (and the dance to go with it), 'Beauty School Dropout,' 'Sandy (my housemate does a brilliant rendition of this one),' You're The One That I Want (which I also remember from a Shape yoghurt advert from my childhood) and 'We Go Together (which sounds a little like all versions of 'The Tide Is High') as well as a version of 'La Bamba' being played in the background in the first Frosty Palace scene; the costumes and vehicles that were true to the 1950s setting; the impressive choreography (especially the school dance scene) and the odd funny moment, especially the scene where Jan imitates the beaver in the toothpaste commercial at the slumber party at Frenchy's house - I couldn't help myself laughing at that today! I also liked the animated segments consisting of the title sequence, toothpaste commercial and the promotional refreshment animations at the drive-in. After having watched the Nostalgia Chick's review of this film, she helped me notice things I hadn't on previous viewings such as Rizzo feeling like a defective typewriter and her pregnancy rumours, although one thing I noticed for the first time today was product placement (a Reese's Peanut Butter Cups billboard ad in the opening sequence and Jan eating a Twinkie at Frenchy's slumber party). The songs made the film go quickly and they were broken up by the various antics of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies whether they were hanging out at Frosty Palace or partaking in a car chase. I also remember the up-and-down relationship between the two protagonists very fondly.Overall this is a thoroughly enjoyable musical that has sheer nostalgic value and I'd undoubtedly like to see it time and time again. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great musical,"Director Randal Kleiser knocks it out of the park with this musical.Personally, I don't find the 1950s era all that interesting. All I've seen are leather jackets, greasy hair and a superficial gangster type of attitude with the bad boys.But Kleiser takes all of those elements, which ultimately was written by Jim Jacobs, Warren Casey and Allan Carr and Bronte Woodard, and has a whole bunch of fun with them. That translates real well on the screen.Also contributing to the fun and energy of GREASE are its main characters, portrayed beautifully by John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing and Jeff Conaway.The music is fantastic all around.

Will always be the word.,"Grease was the first movie that I saw when I was a kid that caused me to go back and see it again and again. Then the re-release came out in 1998 and I saw it for old's time sake. I ended up seeing it three more times while it was still in theatres because it brought back the same feelings plus new ones from having watched the film from an adult perspective. On the one hand, it's easy for me to watch it so many times because it's a musical and when you find the tunes catchy you can't resist it. But it's not just that. Much to my surprise, I remembered every line of dialogue. What makes this movie a classic is that it is still great even if you cut out the songs. How many musicals can you say that about? The dialogue and one liners are so colorful and energetic and the movie works as a 50s comedy. It's funnier than I remembered and it is without a doubt the raunchiest PG movie ever made. Parents be forewarned, especially the Greased Lightning song. All in all, a film that should be re-released every twenty years so a new generation of children and teenagers can watch it, not just because it was one of the last great musicals but also because it truly captures the essence of what it was like to grow up in the 50s. This ranks just below Back to the Future (another 50s type movie) as my all time favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is the greatest musical film of all-time.,"""Grease"" (1978), this is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best musical of all-time. You're probably thinking: ""what?"" Let me explain, yes, two of my top ten favorite films of all-time are musicals. ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968) and ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" (1999) are also considered musicals. But, those two movies are so much more than musicals, and I certainly love both of them in that aspect. However, from strictly a musical standpoint, ""Grease"" is the best in that category. My favorite genre of music is rock and roll, and most of the musical numbers in ""Grease"" are rock and roll songs. Aside from that, ""Grease"" also has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story just seems like your traditional high school love story, but again, it's a lot more than that. It's presented in such a unique and creative way, where it has managed to revolutionize the high school film and musical genre. It is based off a play, but this movie is a rare exception where the movie is better than the play itself. All of the acting is phenomenal, from all of the actors and actresses! But, the two shining stars are John Travolta as Danny, and Olivia Newton-John as Sandy. These two have such an electrifying (FORGIVE THE PUN, AS THE WORD ""ELECTRIFYING"" IS SUNG IN THE SECOND TO LAST SONG), chemistry between them. The performances from the rest of the actors and actresses are nothing short of perfect. This is one of the top ten best casts I've ever seen in a movie, they practically live and breathe their respectable characters. The sets/locations are fantastic and give the movie just the right atmosphere. All of the special effects are very well done, and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack is perfectly composed. It's one of my top ten favorite film soundtracks of all-time! All of the songs work, and help to tie the movie together. ""Grease"" is a cinematic marvel, I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Grease"" yet, go see it. If you've seen it before, watch it again. What are you waiting for? Yes, this movie is that good. ""Grease"" is definitely the word!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A timeless classic!,"Grease is a 1978 American musical romantic comedy film based on the 1971 musical of the same name by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. Written by Bronte Woodard and directed by Randal Kleiser in his theatrical feature film debut, the film depicts the lives of greaser Danny Zuko and Australian transfer student Sandy Olsson who develop an attraction for each other. The film stars John Travolta as Danny, Olivia Newton-John as Sandy, and Stockard Channing as Betty Rizzo, the leader of the Pink Ladies.Grease was originally released to North American theaters on June 16, 1978 and was an immediate box office success. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $8,941,717 in 862 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking at No. 2 (behind Jaws 2) at the box office for the weekend and with the all-time opening weekend records. Despite losing the weekend, it set a record gross in its first 19 days with $40,272,000.In the United States and globally, it became the highest-grossing musical ever at the time, eclipsing the 13-year-old record held by The Sound of Music with a worldwide gross of $341 million. It was re-released in March 1998 for its 20th anniversary where it grossed a further $28 million in the United States and Canada.It remained the highest-grossing live-action musical until 2012 when it was overtaken by Les Mis√©rables and the US champion until 2017 when it was surpassed by Beauty and the Beast. Grease is now the seventh highest-grossing live-action musical worldwide. A further re-issue for its 40th anniversary in 2018 grossed $1 million.

John Travolta was great looking and I enjoyed watching him dance and hearing him sing. He did a great job. All the singing was great.

Great but did it give out the wrong message???,"I loved this movie, even when I watched it at the age of five and didn't understand the theme; the dancing and singing were great.I've watched Grease and Grease 2 (both totally different but same in some ways). The reason is: Danny and Sandy met at a beach, fell in love, then parted their ways at the end of summer. Then comes high school, which coincidently, they both have. Danny is someone Sandy would had never expected and does he seem to change his ways from the bad boy look (the T-birds)? No. And despite the original and great vibe this gives out, the romance, comedy, bad boy, good girl kind of thing, it kind of sends out a bad message.Only because people are being or rather pretending to be things they are not for the love of others, i.e Sandy, whom at the end was an official Pink Ladie and she was smoking or whatnot, whichever the case. And even though it was good, it was great, really (!), it just had you thinking; ""like wow, is that forreal?"" And Grease 2 did the same but i didn't watch the last thirty minutes of it so I won't say, maybe Michael decided to actually be true to himself and realize that Stephanie was just not his type.

Grease : What Keeps it Running Smooth,"I'm not going to just put out multiple paragraphs, praising 'Grease' and telling you why I like it. Wont even cover the plot, we all know it.Grease is set in my mother & father's era , much like 'Happy Days' was, so that's all I needed. As a kid one's mind (usually) is pretty open to something like this and it appealed to me instantly.As I got older I came to notice, the more adult elements of both movie and soundtrack. Yes, one of them being those 'words' in the ""Greased Lightning"" song and also the more mature themes. All of this actually gels well in a film that's set in a time where these things weren't always (or maybe never) talked about in the home.This movie is a favorite because from start to end, the young players ,at the time, put all of their energies into the song and dance numbers. All of them put every bit of themselves into their roles and most of all, in case no one noticed, this movie has a perfect balance of comedy, music , wonderfully choreographed dancing and somewhat serious elements.Not 'too' serious or else you'd be watching a musical remake of 'Rebel Without A Cause'. For me it's just fun and enjoyable. That's all it is for me.It's nowhere in the realm of 'easy' to put a film like this together (and based from a stage play as well), knows nothing about movie making and in terms of dancing, how tough it is for a choreographer to get everyone's movements in synch together.I've always wondered why some look at sining in musicals as 'bursting into song' . In a well done musical, there has to be a justified reason for someone to start singing. They can't for example be talking one minute and then suddenly sing ""La Bamba"" (or whatever), it has to make sense.It's no different here than it is in a Broadway musical and musical films go back nearly 100 years now. It's nothing new and not difficul to understand.Mainly, it's a faster way of telling the story. If Danny just stood there on the bleachers and talked bout his summer with Sandy, that'd take over 10 minutes. The 'Summer Nights' song helps both Danny and Sandy tell the story, without tedious dialog. As do other other songs .The 'Born To Hand Jive' number at the school dance is everyone giving their all. Especially Travolta and Newton John (and then the woman who takes over from Sandy.)The whole dance number is electric. It may sound 1970s, but, that's because that's when the stage musical came out and when this was made. It's supposed to be fun and entertaining. There's no reason to take things literally or seripously. I don't , I just enjoy the mvie.The closing song 'We Go Together' is almost as energetic and in the extras on my DVD, the choreographer stated how proud she was of that cast of young people, whose youthful enthusiasm and energy and dedication made that and all the other numbers what they should be. Entertaining.Yes, the teens depicted were all actors over 21 and had more time to be on the set than teenagers would. For my money, they all did a great job acting like teen-agers. If one can't suspend disbelief for 2 simple hours, you instatly ruin it for yourself.About Sandy, everyone seems to forget hat Danny also was trying to change some too , by getting into athletics, which is a god way to learn that everything isn't all about him and what he wants.He was finally, just as willing to change for her and she was for him at the end. She made that choice herself because as the song Grease states 'conventionality belongs to yesterday'.She was what society 'then' said a girl should be, a 'good girl' but (sorry to say by the way) in the world of youth, it's tough to be an individual. Parents wanted (and still do) their kids to be what they say or their peers want them to be the near opposite.For the reviews I read here, they all seemed to be either based on their viewing of the movie or they're all hung up in the ending where Sandy changes her personality. (To put it lightly).If musicals don;t appeal to you, OK that's fair but some act like they're 'angry' they watched it. Its just a movie. I love the film but I treat it as such.You can't apply today's ideals to something that is over and done 44 years ago. It's amazing how mad some get when a movie 'today' puts what they call ""wokeness"" in it...but at the same time get bothered over old movies that aren't ""woke. (You can;t have it both ways.)Lastly, in regards to those saying see the play. Well hey, not everyone can afford something like that and secondly, if anyone in 1978 or now, thought this would be 'like the play', they were crazy to think it would be in the first place.For me, 'Grease' is a great movie and none of my enjoyment of it has been or ever will be lost. It has nothing to do with nostalgia.... I like the movie, period. I'm only sorry it took me this long to review it.(END)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"far too camp, too long, and with no moral centre","The cinematography is strong, with beautiful (if unimaginative) compositions throughout. and there are occasional moments of charm.The songs are occasionally catchy, but many feel like they belong on some insufferable cruise ship tour.The film is also far too long. With many scenes overstaying their welcome.Overall, it's far too camp. The men in the film feel like gay men trying to act straight, and it's awful.The narrative: that Sandy has to act like a tramp to get Danny's attention is a terrible lesson for young women. Films like this should have a moral centre, and this one sorely lacks one.For a classy musicals, start with these:

Granted, looking from today's perspective, many might feel that its love story is a bit cheesy and naive, but then again - which love story isn't that way?Grease is a light-hearted and fun-loving musical which will leave you with positive emotions after watching it.

"It's the word, it's the word, it's the word........","Movies that takes place in the day of music and fun only goes so far. In ""Grease"", this movie is totally filled with classic nostalgia. Based on a hit play, and casted with the best stars, this movie will get you on your feet faster than a drag race on the streets. Olivia Newton-John plays Sandy, a beautiful Aussie chick who meets a greaser named Danny, played by John Travolta(Vinnie Barbarino on ""Welcome Back, Kotter""). These two have the funnest summer of their lives, and when that ends, oh well. Or so it is. When it's senior year, Danny gets the shock of his life, Sandy is going to his high school! Now Sandy's the nice girl, and Danny's the bad-boy, who said opposites don't attract? The good part of the movie is when that Danny gets the Greased Lightning to run, and the crew put on the show about it. It's a winner!The really good part is the music. Everyone was really put it on. With so many stars, and very cool music numbers, no wonder this movie was such a sensation. As The Four Seasons have said it best, ""Grease IS the word!"" Stockard Channing was great at playing Rizzo, The Pink Ladies and other cliques made the set a fine hit. A classic of 50's nostalgia, ""Grease"" is a phenomenon! 5 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Some nice tunes,"The music had been part of our culture for forty years and some if it is good.
As for the rest of the film, oh dear...My wife saw it when it first came out. My daughter has watched it, by choice, many times. I was required to watch it as a family evening.
It was rubbish.The acting is lacklustre.
The plot is paper thin, land continuity or purpose.
The themes are banal, dipping into either irrelevance or being morally unacceptable.
The characters are unlovable, two dimensional, unbelievable. Worse, they are not developed over the course of the film. Many of them are jerks. Few are sympathetic.
Most of the set pieces are irrelevant to the plot.
There appears to be no effort to get the actors to try to sing in time with the recorded musical pieces.It's some of the worst writing I've encountered.There are some good bits. The school principal and school secretary are nuanced, funny and well acted. Some of the dances are good.If it were released today, it would be panned more than Cats, and rightly so. I totally get that it comes laden with nostalgia and I'm glad other still enjoy it, but frankly and objectively, it's a terrible film. Fine as a guilty pleasure, but far, far short of the great reviews.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hey Putsie...15 minutes,"GREASE was on AMC tonight and I happened to catch it.This movie is so great. There's no pretension to it. It is really hard to make a movie musical that isn't pretentious and uppity. Has anyone watched ""Chicago"" lately, even though it got all those Oscar noms? Yeah, I thought not.Sure, everyone's seen the movie. But here are a few facts about it you might not know.The original Broadway production was a hit, but the music was REALLY hokey and many of the songs were different.Can you imagine a movie musical being made today from a musical where new songs are added that are BETTER than the originals? Grease (the opener), Sandy, Hopelessly Devoted and You're the One That I Want are all new for the movie, and all are now classics.It's fun to watch the Pink Ladies scenes knowing that Stockard Channing was 33 and Dinah Manot, who played Marty, was only 18 when the movie was being filmed.(Side note -- if you haven't seen Dinah Manot in Ordinary People, watch it -- you'll be amazed at what a good actress she was).Another interesting cast note: the woman who played Jan (brusha brusha brusha) basically was in this movie and that's it except for like three tiny cameo roles in other films. How's that for a film career -- one movie and it's one of the biggest hits of all time! Not bad!When you talk about the movie version of Grease, you have to talk about Travolta. Seeing the bloated, bad actor that he's become, you have to go back and watch this movie to realize that this guy is one of the most talented all-around comedians who ever hit a screen. He can sing, he can dance, he's funny as hell, and he has a style all his own. I dare you to find a young actor today who pops off a screen as much as Travolta did. Unbelievable.The thing I love most about Grease is that it was such an underdog as a project.Helmed by a 31 year old TV director Randal Kleiser (who was George Lucas's roommate at USC, and apparently wrote his own IMDb biography, so maybe he'll read this and correct my mistakes), Paramount didn't expect much out of this movie, and they kind of left the young cast and director to do their thing. There's a fast-and-looseness to the movie, an almost improvisational feel at times, yet the comic timing is always DEAD ON.This is a movie that respects comedy. Sid Caesar, Eve Arden -- these are giants of comedy that were at a career ebb around 1977, and the director shouldn't have been able to get them, but he did, and they make the movie hugely better.But it's all about the young cast. You can tell that this is a group of actors that really felt like friends and were just having a good time. You've got actors in their late 20s and early 30s playing high schoolers, but somehow it's the best of both worlds -- there's plenty of sophomoric humor, but when Stockard C. sings ""There are worse things,"" she gives it a depth Christina Aguilera never could . You've got actors like Jeff Conaway who never really did anything even close to good after this but he's brilliant as Kenickie. You've got a screenplay written by some woman I've never heard of who, once again, dropped off the face of the earth after this movie -- but how many classic lines are in this movie?! It's just amazing.I salute every one who was a part of Grease. I loved it as a little kid and I still love it today.JM",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
My Favorite Film Of All Time. A Revolutionary Landmark In Movie Musicals.,"Grease is, and always will be my favorite film of all time. Sure some have come very close to topping it off at My Number 1 Favorite. But Grease Is Special to me.How special? Well, I have the DVD, I Have The 25th Anniversary VHS With CD and Script and Tape of the film. I sing all of the songs when watching. Also, This is one of the few films that I want to be one of the characters, the few films that make me want to be one of the main and supporting roles in the stage musical that inspired it, its that special.One of the reasons Grease is perfect is because of the characters. Danny and Sandy stand out as one of the greatest couples in film. The casting of the characters is perfect! Also, There is an excellent amount of emotion. Not too much soft dialog, not to much rough dialog, the script knows exactly what to do with the characters.But I want to talk about the music. It is cherished by everyone around the world and is what made the movie so famous and a smash hit at the box office and earning an nomination at the Oscars for Best Original Song for Hopelessly Devoted to You. The songs have a awesome beat, clever and original lyrics, and some of the best choreography in a musical ever. If I had to choose my favorite song, it would be all of them! You just can't pick one.The Televised Dance Sequence is one of many show stoppers. I have never been amazed this much at this amazing sequence with such memorable songs such as Born To Hand Jive. It ends with a very funny scene that everyone will laugh out loud at.The movie portrays the 50's as a hot time with cool cars and gangs and high school chicks with fancy diners with jukeboxes and pregnancy rumors flying around town. The art direction is amazing and I wish I could see the production pictures made by Art Director Phillip M. Jefferies.Everyone will love Grease. Even Your Friend next door who is denying the fact that he hates it! Grease is the most special movie in the world for me. It is still to this day the highest grossing musical of all time and for a good reason.100/100 A+",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The musical of my life,"This movie is just excellent, more than that. I love it since the first time i saw it, because is such a happy movie, is like a dream. And the songs are really good.This movie is set on the 50's This movie is about, Danny Zuko, and Sandy Olson romance (John Travolta, Olivia Newton-Jones). He's a T-Bird boy, and she's a cheerleader.He's a rebel, he and his friends wear black leather jackets, and they walk in an arrogant way. She's, like the perfect woman; blue eyes, blonde hair, thin, and she's very polite and correct. Stockard Channing's role;Rizo, has a strong personality, and is careless and very sarcastic. She as Marty, Jan, and Frenchie belong to the pink-lady's sorority. I think the best song of the movie is 'There are worst things i could do', performed by Stockard Channing, who has got such a beautiful voice. The best moment of the movie, i think it would be the National Band Stand ball. That's the moment when you see all dancers, dancing and jumping as fast as they can. John Travolta's, Olivia Newton-Jones, and especially, Stockard Channing's performances are brilliant. They sing as well as they dance, and act. The music is the best. The rhythm of some songs, like, You're the one that i want, make you stand up, and dance. I can't compare this movie with an other, but let me tell you that Grease 2, isn't as good as this one.

The Innocence and Colour of the 50s has been captured excellently in this movie, and what I found most refreshing about this movie is that there are no dark sub-plots and no real twists and no surprises. Critics nowadays would think it's a lame musical, but there is such a lot of good to be taken from a happy musical like this..Oh, and did I mention the music?

Teen rebellion and romance and music!,"'Grease' always seems to make its come-back in the world of theatre and television every few years or so. The film seems to come and go with popularity, but it is still considered one of the great musicals by some people, but I really did not think it was as great as some people make it out to be. It's just a simple teen rebellion love story. Olivia Newton-John falls in love with bad-boy Travolta. There is a little bit of denial and reluctance in the romance as Newton-John is a wholesome good girl. The music and the dance routines are pretty good, so it does make a good musical, but by the end of the film, Newton-John sports bad-girl image with big hair and clothing with an attitude.

Grease Truly is Kool,"I loved Grease. I thought it was the best movie i've seen in a long time.

Another Reason which makes this one of those true Classic Movies of all time is it's Cast. Who could forget that adorable lil Olivia Newton-John playing Sandy. Grease has one of the best supporting cast team ever. Then there's Keniki, Danny and Rizo. It's just the way High School was meant to be. Happy, Fun and well forfilled, as in not wasting a second. I think Grease will be watched by many generations for years to come.P.S I hope they never make a grease 3 it'd just ruin the original even more, unless it had a really decent cast and was made for those of the younger generation TODAY.Oh Well< THat's It from me, What y'all think?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
best musical I have ever watched,"I will NEVER get tired of this movie, I love it so much. Whoever rates this below a ten really has no good taste in movies. Way better then the crap they have these days. It's so fun to watch and it's a healthy movie. All of the characters have there own vibe and problems in high school and they reveal it in a healthy manner! I love the way that the characters sing. Sandy and John Travolta really outdid themselves, probably one of John Travolta's best movies. For real. He needs to make another one like this but I don't know how that's gonna work now hahahaha. I would have rather been in high school around that era because the kids back then seemed so much more fun and out going and healthy. Nowadays all kids wanna do is get effed up and text or get on facebook. But amazing movie, I love it, which is why you should watch it. Whoever hasn't watched Grease is missing out. Watch Grease rather then Grease 2 because the second one just isn't the same! 10/10 deff.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The good parts can not make the longer worse parts fade away,"This film certainly has it's quality, but the lesser parts are longer than the good parts and that actually sets most of the films score. Adding to that, the fact that I could really not feel for any of the characters or identify with them does not make it better. A bit of bun shaking by Newton John (or Travolta if you're a girl) does not make up for the lack of story and depth. Plus I've seen the 50's characterized better and cooler in Roadracers by Robert Rodriguez. If you like Rock and Roll watch Roadracers, if you like Grease and schmaltz watch this one.5 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gotta love the classics,"I saw this movie a few weeks before writing this review and I have to say, I thought I was about to watch something embarrassing and childish. I was wrong. This movie was fun in a way appropriate not just for kids, but for adults too. Back then, movies just put a smile on your face, this movie is a great example. I have loved musicals my whole life and this has got to be my favorite one ever. Annie was my favorite musical before Grease came along. Think about it, a musical better than Annie, it's got to be pretty good to beat a masterpiece like that. Ever since I saw this movie I have been a huge fan of John Travolta. I am also a fan of Olivia Newton-John because I have always loved Australia and I also know what it is like to be taller than your average girl.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funniest part of movie,"The funniest part of the movie lasts about 1 frame or so. It's where Cid Ceasar tells John Travolta he'll have to cut his smoking down to 2 packs a day pulls a cigarette out of his mouth and gives him a look that was so funny I totally cracked up. I even stayed to see it again but I missed it! I've watched ""Grease"" many times since and have never seen that look again but I know it's there. I guess it's Ceasar's timing that's so spectacular. if you can catch the look, it's the best part of the whole movie, and the whole movie is just terrific, really typifies the 1950's and the music is stupendous, and Olivia Newton-John's voice is as lovely as she is. The cast was perfect, the story line was really fantastic. The spark plug in the tail pipe of the car looked so awesome at night.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The ultimate fifties movie,"This movie, although made in the late seventies, recreates school life in the fifties superbly. To me everything looks as if it was made in the fifties.

Overrated 1970s musical melancholy disguised as cool 1950s drama.,"Well what can I say, except I wasn't left hopelessly devoted to the picture. Grease is a musical surrounding the senior students of Rydell High in the 1950s. The boys or T-Birds? Include John Travolta as cool (apparently) Danny Zuko. The female students or pink ladies include an Australian newcomer Olivia Newton-John as Sandy.What follows is 100 minutes or so of various musical numbers as Danny pretends to act cool in front of his male mates whilst really wanting to be goody two shoes in front of Sandy. Sandy gets rather narked. Danny gets jealous. There are scenes of masculinity as the T-Birds fix an old banger for a street race that is more Chariot race off Ben-Hur than Fast and the Furious. Interrupted by musical numbers such as ""Greased Lightnin'"" which has some rather interesting lyrics cleverly hidden amongst the shawaddywaddy that is going off. I found using the subtitles function on the DVD showing rather enlightening with regards to that!The film begins with a rather Barry Gibb/Bee Gees sound straight out of Saturday Night Fever a year earlier! On watching the credits they revealed Gibb had indeed written the song Grease Is The Word. Not my type of film really but had to be done for completist reasons.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Of Course Not, It's Only The Beginning!""","When it comes to film and musicals, I am not a big fan. I don't know why, but I can't seem to get into musicals. However, Grease is more than just a musical. It's practically the way of life. This film brought back fond memories of my high school days and this film plays a major role in my childhood. As a musical, this film has many foot-tapping rock'n'roll songs that are very good. As a movie, this story doesn't offer anything new, but it's still entertaining and you care about the characters which I find matters most.Randal Kleiser's film starts off with a young couple, Danny and Sandy believing they will never see each other again. But little did they know, Sandy happens to be the new kid at their high school. Will Danny, a member of a gang, will be able to capture the heart of the girl he loves?The acting is pretty good and memorable. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John have very good singing voices and they know how to rock their hearts out. They are also good actors and this is the film that put them on the map. The rest of the cast led by Stockard Channing ranges from pretty funny and goofy to mildly annoying. Nonetheless, they are important factors in this story as they are the soul to Travolta's/John's heart.Overall, this is a near instant classic thanks to some energizing music. Despite the lack of newness, coming-of-age films always hold a dear spot in my heart and I will always cherish them and this is what makes Grease special. My favorite scene is the ballroom dance scene towards the end. There are some groovy dance moves here and was very entertaining to watch, just like the film itself. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Innocent Fun,"When I first watched Grease, when I was 11, I had the same opinions as most the people here who don't like the movie - it's shallow, unimpressive, bad acting, streotypical, etc. I wondered how it could be possible that so many people loved this movie. Then, when I was 13, I saw the stage show and it hit me - it had the exact same qualities as the movie (mind you the movie and the stage show are too incredibly different storylines, different music, etc.) It's meant to be silly,  over the top, stereotypical, shallow and almost stupid. That's what some musicals are supposed to be - Kiss Me Kate and The Boyfriend are two perfect examples of this. We're not talking the epitome of dramatists here - obviously if you've seen any of John Travolta's films (with the possible exception of Pulp Fiction) you know what I mean. Take it for what it's worth - it's fluff. With really catchy music. If you want to see a better example of the real story of Grease, try to see the stage version - they are so completely different. The film version is just that - it works well on camera. I watch it when I don't want to think while watching a movie. I love the movie, but not because it's a shining example of movie genius - it's innocent fun. Laugh at it, laugh at the sexual jokes you didn't get when you were 11, laugh at the insane dance party at the end of the movie. Laugh at the cheese, cause that's what I is. And I love cheese. :)",,Anonymous,Romance
Its only flaw is its fatal flaw,"Great story, good cast, timeless themes, good music, and just about everything one could want from a movie or a musical. So what's the problem? Answer: check the birthdates of the actors against when this movie was made.The cast was so far beyond high-school age when this movie was filmed, and it showed. Putting on high-school clothes and acting immature are not enough to wash away this terrible oversight. It's not like there aren't good actors of high-school age, and it's not like most movies don't cast young twentysomethings as high schoolers, but this movie went way too far.Stockard Channing as a sexy 17 year-old? She was THIRTY-THREE when this film was made, and she never was that sexy. Travolta was 23, Olivia Newton-John was 29, and Jeff Conaway was 27. There was plenty of good teen talent around at that age, but I suppose the musical requirements limited their search.The age problem ruins what was otherwise a great movie that should have been entitled: ""Grease: The Left-Back Years.""",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable musical with great cast,"Everyone in this movie from the main stars to the hundreds of dancers clearly enjoyed themselves and so will you. My favourite character was Kenickie played by Jeff Conaway. (He also plays Bobby in Taxi.) He was the coolest in my opinion and he really ought to have sung Greased Lightning, saying it was his car. At least he got some cool dance moves to make up for it. The T-Bird trio were fun to watch, providing a steady run of practical jokes & gags. John & Olivia had great chemistry especially during the fantastic end sequence. The songs stick in your head, especially Summer Nights, You're the One & We Go Together. The dance routines were electrifying and well worth seeing again. The plot is thin but who cares? It's the music & actors who make this film what it is. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Rizzo! Genoffathatthiganoffashun!""","I was amazed to find that, at date of writing, Grease had scored less than an average 7 with IMDb voters. Surely this film is a classic, an iconographic representation of an age? That is, not the 50s, but the 70s, where filmmakers were becoming more knowing. Grease stands as the greatest of all film musicals as, while possessing the requisite laughs, character, romance and song; it is also ironic and self-aware, which puts it way ahead of turgid and dated bores like ""Carousel"" and ""South Pacific"".Of course, we've seen it a million times now, so there's really not a lot left to say. We can still thrill to Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, she the better singer, he the better dancer, neither of them terribly good as actors. We can still be amazed that Stockard Channing as Rizzo never really took off after this film, largely absent from the screen until 1993's ""Six Degrees of Separation"". What really helps with the superb set-pieces are the fact that each of the supporting players get more than a cursory character, each holding their own sub-plots well. My personal favourite is Doody (Barry Pearl), who, while not getting a lot to do, meaning his name isn't that apt, does get to perform some very funny faces. Then of course, there are the songs. Maybe the supply of good songs run out just before the end (""We go together like ramalama dingadingadong"", anyone?) but for the most part they're first-rate.The lack of strong song material was what really hindered the weak sequel, Grease 2. Instead of traditional structures of verse-chorus, the 1982 movie had characters merely melodising straightforward lines to a tune. Even the teacher joins in at one point, seriously negating the cool. Catchy choruses were out of stock, with extended words inadequate substitutes. ""We're gonna scoo ¬ñ oo - oo ¬ñ ore tonight"" goes one song, forgettably.  Other songs sounded like weak rip-offs of the original's ""Sandy""; with only ""Girl for All Seasons"" being a worthy number. Two other numbers managed to become more than their parts, such as ""Back To School"", thanks solely to a blistering vocal from Levi Stubbs off-camera. The other, Cool Rider (again, chorus: ""Coo ¬ñ ooo ¬ñ ooo ¬ñ ool ri ¬ñ der, Coo ¬ñ ooo ¬ñ ooo ¬ñ ool ri ¬ñ der"") was saved by a seductive interpretation by Michelle Pfeiffer, suggestively riding a stepladder. Maxwell Caulfield was okay as the English Michael, (Though was Cliff Richard to Travolta's Elvis), but generally it was an artificial and lifeless retread, the others (Pfeiffer included) adding shame to their resumes. Grease is a brilliantly witty pastiche of 50s b-movies, whereas Grease 2 is a not-so-witty pastiche of Grease. Like a photocopier, duplication always produces inferior copies. Thankfully Grease is one of the few films ¬ñ unlike say, Planet of the Apes or A Nightmare On Elm St. ¬ñ not to be denigrated in light of its sequels.But now that the dust has settled on this one, all that's really left to ask is questions. What sort of moral message is being handed out by a virginal girl only achieving happiness by dressing as a slut?; What is the line that Kenickie shouts to Rizzo on the fairground, almost inaudible?; Who is the guy that sits alone in the stalls for the girls' perspective on ""Summer Nights?"" ¬ñ is it a cameo?; why have I seen two versions of this film, one where ""Summer Nights"" ends in a split screen, the other not?;  Isn't it ironic that the drive-in plays an acne commercial, ending with the line: ""It's time to face up to Face/Off""; Lastly, we can also marvel at the laughable stupidity of the BBC, who, every time this film is screened, crudely edit out a whole verse of ""Grease Lightnin'"" because John Travolta couples the word ""tit"" with ""sh**"". Yet then leave in the entire next verse as he proclaims his car to be a ""real pussy-wagon""!!! Finally, if nothing else, watch this for the spot-on 50s take-offs (The Greased Lightnin' visuals; Olivia and John in the prologue with deliberately cheesy dialogue and ""Love Is A Many Splendoured Thing"" playing in the background; Frankie Avalon appearing as an agony aunt angel); or for Barry Gibb's superb theme score. An exceptionally good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

John and Olivia Newton-John are both incredible actors, and both of them in this movie makes it so much better, too.

Olivia Newton John's singing voice is beautiful, especcially in Hopelessy Devoted to You.ONE BLOOPER: in the song You're the one that I want and Sandy pushes Danny into some dust, there is some dust on his top (unsurprisingly).

A generational and musical artifact.,"Granted, a number of great songs came from this, it is one of the most popular musicals of all time. However, as a movie it feels like it has a lot of filler, the story is disjointed, the scenes do not flow from one to the other, some of which are eyebrow raising to say the least and don't actually add to the narrative. Some of the scenes are somewhat fun albeit over the top (which is the point and not lost on me). I'd go so far to say it's a (musical) American Pie of the boomer era. I found myself losing interest and wanting it to end. Aside from the main numbers, it hasn't aged well. If we're going to talk great musical movies, Hamilton and La La Land that are the gold standard; Grease doesn't hold a torch to these. People voting this a 9 or 10 no doubt have an emotional attachment or nostalgic of their era. For everyone else, the lenses aren't so rosey.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still a wonderful movie decades later.,"I remember as a kid when my father sold bubble gum cards showing scenes from ""Grease"" in the 1970's. I had never seen this movie before; to be honest I didn't start watching movies until I was around 10 or 11 when I could understand movies. This was one of the first I saw with the advent of the VCR.Grease, of course, is based on the Broadway play and is a superb film version; it seems one thing Hollywood can do right is taking successful plays and making them into films. While the story is of two lovers from different backgrounds who struggle to try and accept each other's high school images, the movie is really a celebration of the 1950's. The movie makes a case that living in the 1950's; despite the spectre of The Cold War, was a terrific time. The kids of the 50's never had it so good. They didn't have video games, PCs, satellite dishes, the 'Net, or other diversions. They had what we always have had: Love. Perhaps the only flaw is the 1970's trappings. Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees wrote the theme song and while the film captures much of the 50's you see the occasional disco trapping or such of the decade.John Travolta is brilliant as Danny Zuko. Although he may have been drawing heavily from his Vinnie Barbarino character from Welcome Back, Kotter and his admiration of Jim Morrison he portrays Danny as a multi-faceted individual. He can be a charming, naive student or a cigarette-smoking, image of cool. He plays a man who wishes not to be pigeon-holed with a single image but fears to be shunned from his peers. Despite being too old for the role, Stockard Channing is awesome as Betty Rizzo, the leader of the Pink Ladies. She is irresistible and you can't help but fall for her rough charm. Her scenes in the slumber party are fiery; especially when she dons a wig and sings ""Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee"". In her small role at The American Bandstand dance, Annette Charles murders the dance-floor with her performance. Her superb dancing steals that scene. And while her singing is fine, Olivia Newton-John's performance as Sandy is lacking. She just plays her as a bore a little too much. The supporting cast is excellent, with a mix of just about everything.After 27 years, few musicals top this one (Chicago, Moulin Rouge perhaps) but this one was done in a different era of Hollywood. You need to see this one once a year at least. Oh, and avoid Grease II or the veiled 2003 remake called From Justin To Kelly.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun for everyone, but does it send a bad message?","Perhaps the best musical of all time, surely right up there with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Chicago"", this 1977 film set in the 1950's and based on the play of the same name is fun from the opening credits until closing - and beyond.The musical numbers are outstanding, ""Summer Nights"" ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""We Go Together"", ""You're The One That I Want"" and ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" are among my favourites. All the cast sing well and the dancing is amazing. Everyone looks great in the 1950's style outfits too, and the hair is awesome.Of course Olivia Newton-John, John Travolta and Stockard Channing are the stars of the show and are each amazing in their own right, but the supporting cast is terrific too. In particular, Didi Conn who plays Frenchy and, my favourite Dinah Manoff as the sultry Marty. Watch for Susan Buckner and Lorenzo Lamas in smallish roles as the school over-achiever and the school jock respectively. And let's not forget about Eve Arden and Dody Goodman as the school principal and her assistant, both so very funny.The one problem I see with this film is that it seems to send the message that if you want to be accepted by a new group of people then you need to change how you present yourself. All throughout the movie, Sandy (Newton-John) was never truly accepted by the Pink Ladies (except Frenchy), and Danny (Travolta) couldn't act like he liked her in front of his friends. I realise that those are genuine issues that take place at school, but the end result is disappointing, for Sandy changed her appearance and attitude, so everyone else could stay (mostly) the same. Still, it makes for a amazing movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Grease - a great 50's parody!,"Fun, fun, fun till Daddy takes the T-Birds away! This is a great, great movie...if you take it at face value: as a musical parody. If you read the comments about this movie, people either love it for the music (or Olivia and Travlota) or hate it for the cheese. But that was the whole point of the film and the original play it is based on!I suspect most people commenting on this haven't actually seen many of the pop movies of the 50s that this play is based on. But from the opening sequence at the beach, to the dance sequences (thank you John Travolta), to the final two ""events"" of the movie (Danny vs. Leo and Danny & Sandy), this has 50's pop film all over it. And that's what makes this so great. It was supposed to be a parody of 50's Hollywood and culture.Some examples: Sandy's character is based on real-life 50's actress Sandra Dee, Travola and Kenickie are based on James Dean, the intermission clip showing on the drive-in in the background behind Danny's ballad ""Stranded at the Drive In"" is the actual intermission that drive-ins used up until the early 80's (which I remember seeing), the ""angel"" singer in the ""Beauty School Dropout"" is Frankie Avalon, who starred in the king of 50's cheese movies ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" with Annette Funicello (which is who Rizzo refers to when singing about Sandra Dee at the girls' overnighter), and the coach (Sid Caesar) is a comedian from the 50's who used to have his own radio show and eventually TV show in the early 60's.This movie is a must see for a slice of 50's pop culture, a truly enjoyable musical, and doesn't take itself serious at all. We've had great fun introducing our kids to it (I've probably seen it several dozen times since first seeing in theatres in 1978 - front row, first night!). But enjoy it for that: music and great cheese!",,Anonymous,Romance
A mystery to me,"I have never understood why this film was so popular. It must have been the popularity of Travolta and Newtown-John at the time.At least she can sing. It certainly isn't the witless screenplay or the static, indifferent direction. The staging of the songs is so clunky that in ""Greased Lightning"" Travolta drapes himself briefly in cling wrap. Significantly almost all the hit songs were added for the film with the title song (under bad animated opening credits) was written a Bee Gee.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Here it's the music and singing and dancing that matters, nothing else. If you want serious drama, this movie is not for you, but if you want a musical, you've come to the right place.

Is this supposed to be funny??,"How such a mediocre movie like ""Grease"" can be considered a classic and loved by so many people is beyond me.Sure, everybody's got their own tastes and I respect that, but seriously what's so special about this movie? For me, this is nothing more than a mediocre movie full of cheap humor and bad messages. How can this be still such a hit after all these years?? The best thing about this movie is the brilliant soundtrack. The songs are classics, not the movie. Songs such as ""Greased Lightning"", ""Sandy"", ""You're The One That I Want"", ""Summer Nights"" and the opening song are great and timeless, not the movie.Apart the music, there are very little good things about this movie. For example: the romantic beginning with Danny Zuko and Sandy on a beach during the sunset time, exchanging love promises.What else? The original opening credits (with bizarre cartoons and a cool song), the ""drive-in"" sequence and every part with those wonderful songs.The characters are, most of them, annoying. The T-Birds are the most irritating characters of the movie, except Danny Zuko (the only T-Bird who isn't annoying). About the girl characters, only Sandy isn't annoying. Of all the things that anger me in this movie, what angers me most is its dirty humor which is absolutely irritating... not to mention about the ""message"" of it.Plus, one of the things that made me cringe most is that the women in the movie say that ¬´All men are rats¬ª and then they say something even worst ¬´They're the fleas of rats¬ª. I am a guy and I find that an extremely offensive and insulting observation. That is not a nice thing to say.The ending is somehow too childish, surreal and ridiculous. What was the point of putting a car flying?? Not to mention incredibly long... after too much nonsense, that's when the flying car comes.John Travolta is great as Danny Zuko and so is Olivia Newton-John in the role of Sandy Olsen.Overall, it is a movie to forget and it doesn't deserve all the attention it gets. Anyway, this is just my opinion. I don't want to get into fights because of this...",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
An all time classic,"I don't even know where to start. This movie is one of my all time favourites, and I can never get enough. It's not one of those cheesy, I can't stand it, musicals that you just have to switch off. The musical sections fit nicely into the storyline and give it what I think is that extra little bit that makes this movie a favourite on pretty much everybody's movie list. I don't know many people who don't like Grease, as its such a timeless classic movie. This was made years before I was born, but is still a favourite of mine, many friends my age, and many people younger than me. Who can't help but fall in love with Danny and Sandy, and Kenicke and Rizzo? Not to mention all the other characters as well. With all time classic songs like ""Grease"", ""Summer Nights"" and ""You're the one that I Want"" this movie is an unforgettable classic that whilst following the trials and tribulations of the typical high school love story, leaves you jiving in your seat and quoting all the best parts.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A classic...,One of the best movies ever made! When it comes to sing-along/dance movies there are only a couple that stands out. Grease is one of them!

My review,"I liked the movie and the songs a lot when I was a little girl but as I got older I didn't like the fact that it sends very bad messages to the youth about getting involved with bad people. Also, the demoralization of the principal character, Sandy is noticeable and her lover ( Danny) makes her change her into a bad woman with no values nor morals in order to have fun and be popular. Her friends celebrate at the end of the movie her sexy image and the fact that she became like one of them..a bad woman. There are too many sexual scenes and vulgar phrases in the movie. Her boyfriend is brainless, has an IQ of an amoeba..totally 0 and his friends are brainless too implying the harmful influence he and his T friends had on her and other people üôÑ. No respect is given to women, the T birds glorify sex, excessive partyings and corruption in their lives, there is no focus given to the importance of being polite, having good values and getting a good education. The characters in the movie didn't learn good manners, didn't get well educated and were never in a good environment. Makes you think of the purpose sending kids to public schools and the effects bad friends can have on young people. I have always been someone with lots of morals and values and realized I didn't need to wear provocative clothes and become a sex ,alcohol addict to make friends and have fun in school. I never changed, Sandy and Rizzo did all the wrong things and changed. I didn't change, I was in a dance team,I went to restaurants and hang out with my friends after school even a prom and I never changed. I kept my values, didn't hang out with bad kids who drank and smoked, studied and graduated from school. Be true to yourself, keep your morals and values and get a good education and don't hang out with the wrong crowds and watch good movies.üòâ",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
hizo una bonita labor con Maggie ...,"This is the best movie I have ever seen! Grease your hair and get into this punky movie: it's a remake of the modern industrial revolution. Actors John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, both acclaimed classic actors, recount their encounter of a summer, the most romantic summer they have ever had. The soundtrack is fun, safe, sane, well taken care of in the distribution of the musical notes. One of the most intelligent scenes is at the house where there is a well staged scene of a ""pajama party"". The boy though is not feature in the ""pajama party"": he is racing cars -a la REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE-, an error of the movie perhaps.

A classic that will never disappoint,"Grease is a film which takes you back to the 50's and makes you wish you were born in that time. Two teenagers, Sandy, played by Olivia Newton-John, and Danny, played by John Travolta, fall in love during vacation and sadly have to say goodbye because they live in different countries. Danny goes back to the USA and Sandy stays in Australia. The main twist occurs when Sandy moves to the USA and goes to the same high school as her summer love, Danny, but he doesn't react to her arrival the way she would have expected...Although it is a bit of a clich√©, what I think makes this movie special and a classic is how well the two actors played the main characters and that it is a musical. I really like musicals and this is one of the best I have ever seen. All the songs are amazing and even if you haven't seen the film you know, at least, one of them.I recommend this film to people who like musicals and romantic comedies but, I don't think that you have to be a fan of either of those types of genres to like Grease.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

How you view this film may determine your love or hate of it!,"Okay, I am not a big fan of this film. The first time I saw it-I found it apalling, repulsive and downright idiotic. However, with age-I now look upon it in a slightly different light. It is to the musical-what Ed Wood's Plan Nine From Outer Space is to the horror genre. It is so bad, it is funny. Remember, this film came out in a time in film history when it was at it's lowest. Very few films made in the 70's are what you could call classics. Yes, there are some-but this ain't one of them! The music overall is terrible, the dance numbers even more wretched and the acting-arghhhhhh! Still, if one watches it from another angle and that of such an awful film that it is funny-then it has much to offer. Travolta was and is about the worst actor to ever have been able to secure a lead in a big film. He ranks up there with such other film legends as Sonny Tufts, Lex Barker and Jock Mahoney. Yet, he does entertain with his unique style of being awful-especially in this movie. His role in this film is only topped by his horrible performance in Urban Cowboy-that film and this can only be explained as a way Hollywood wanted to reach out to redneck americans.If you liked this film I am sorry to be so harsh. After having seen so many great musicals-I cringe at the thought of this being lumped into the same genre. Cult comedy maybe-but not a musical!",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wash Yourself of It.,"Unbelievably over-rated musical mess has motorcycle punk John Travolta meeting the pure and cute Olivia Newton-John over a summer vacation with a 1950s backdrop. Soon school starts back and by coincidence Newton-John moves to Travolta's California town. Naturally they both have feelings for one another, but both (Travolta in particular) are bound by their moronic friends and their youthful reputations. Each realizes they want to be in each other's life (with neither knowing what the other is feeling) and thus Travolta tries to change his image to get Newton-John to like him again and vice versa. Tiring music numbers and dull characters (except for Stockard Channing who steals the show as the leader of a group of would-be tough girls) make this one a tough pill to swallow. Still a movie that stands the test of time somehow. Followed by a sequel that is even worse. Mediocre iconic picture at best. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
Quite Simply Critic-Proof,"There are some films that are quite simply critic-proof: GREASE is one of these. Forget the flat filming style (by Randal Kleiser) and the fact that the Rydale High students seem way too mature - we should just sit back and enjoy the songs, color, movement and sheer energy of the film. John Travolta's Danny is both arrogant yet touching; someone willing to show bravado in front of his male buddies, yet extremely weak when it comes to showing off his emotions. His body movements are a joy to watch - especially during the sequence where he presents Sandy (Olivia Newton- John) with a cheap ring and asks her to marry him. Newton-John is especially good as a Doris Day/ Sandra Dee-type figure who cannot quite understand why Danny should behave so differently in front of his buddies. Stockard Channing's Rizzo quite simply steals the show; she cultivates a hard-boiled exterior (her real name in the film is Betty), yet cannot cover up an essential vulnerability, especially when she thinks that she is pregnant. GREASE also contains a clutch of memorable cameos from television and film old-timers, from Sid Caesar's Coach Calhoun to Eve Arden's Principal McGee, to Joan Blondell's Vi. In short, there is something in this film for absolutely everyone, regardless of their age and/or cinematic tastes.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
RYDELL HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS OF 1959,"In 1959 I was 17 years old and a junior in High School. How do you cast actors to play 18-year-old high school seniors about to graduate? You don't look for actual high school seniors  - that's how! Because, the industry would not have such acting talent available with the experiences of singing, dancing, and acting to make this film.Solution? You cast, 34 year old Stockard Channing, 30 year old Olivia Newton-John, 31 year old Annette Charles, 28 year old's Jeff Conaway and Michael Tucci, 27 year old's Didi Conn and Susan Buchner, 24 year old John Travolta, 22 year old Kelly Ward, 21 year old Eddie Deezen, and 20 year old Dinah Manoff to play the roles of high school seniors. Believable? YES.You can get away with the 45 year old Edd Byrnes as Vince Fontaine and the 38-year-old Frankie Avalon as the teen idol. Joan Blondell was a 72-year-old waitress! Eve Arden was a 70-year-old principal? Dody Goodman was 63 and still a school secretary. Sid Caesar was 56 and still coaching? Alice Ghostley was a 52-year-old auto shop teacher?No kudos to TBS who broadcast an edited version on 12/26/01 eliminating some of the great sophomoric comedy scenes from the film. An example is Sid Caesar's ""admonition"" to the senior class at the gym before the dance was to be televised. The comedy was that he ""laid down the rules"" and the students in student fashion broke them during the dance contest. But, this scene was not shown. Edd Byrnes scene trying to ""put the make"" on Marty Maraschino was also cut as well as some of the attempts by Sid Caesar to find a sport that John Travolta could ""letter"" in. High school comedy is replete with ""innocent sexual innuendoes."" Such is a transition from juvenile to being an adult -- which is what high school is all about, anyway! Don't eliminate them for the sake of a ""G"" rating. Just show Grease after the kiddies go to bed!Now, although the entire cast garners praise for this movie performance back in 1978, the real show stopper is Stockard Channing. Without her Betty Rizzo character as a subplot there would be major weakness in this screenplay. Ms. Channing's performance is the strongest acting of all the ""student"" players. She brought to the role the struggles of typical high school students who don't always fit into the peppy, socialite, ""Patty Simcox"" roles where everything is provided to spoil the student; where her daddy doesn't buy her a fancy car; where her clothes are functional and not typical ""coming out"" wear. But, Stockard Channing makes this role believable. She is sympathetic to understanding her character. She is a decent person trying to find her identity on the brink of adulthood. She is searching for a good love relationship and absorbs the heat thrown her way by fellow female students who are ""boy teasers."" Rizzo is real. Ms. Channing's rendition of the song, ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" solidifies her character in song. Without that song there would have been a terrible ""gap"" in this film. Ms. Channing ""carried"" all her scenes and deserves the ultimate praise for helping to make ""Grease"" the hit movie that it is! When you watch Grease again, make sure you catch an unedited version to fully appreciate it!If a cable station is going to play ""marathon"" movies back to back then there is no reason to make them fit into a neat time slot. Fit the commercials in, if one must, but let the movies run full time! Cutting films is not the act of ""preserving"" good quality motion pictures for future generations!Once again, the highest accolades to Stockard Channing.

Does exactly what it says on the tin.,"I've seen this film and I've read the other user's comments. What I find incomprehensible is how some of my fellow amateur critics on here seem to want all the films they see to be well acted, or plausible, or credible, or have some kind of hidden meaning or depth or whatever. Lighten up please; for sure it isn't Citizen Kane or Repulsion or The Idiots or something by Wim Wenders. What it IS is a load of escapist fun with some pretty enthusiastic performances and as such it should stand on its own merits. Yes some of the acting is dodgy and let's face it, all songs in all films are always mimed anyway, to greater or lesser accuracy. But the dancing and the sheer cheesiness of it all make it totally endearing. Or to put in another way: you don't go to a play by Neil Simon or Ray Cooney expecting Shakespeare, do you?",,Anonymous,Romance
Sweet sump oil is just false 50's nostalgia,"A shallow, accessible big studio trifle which had the right songs, the right stars and the right 'feel good' vibe AT THE TIME for the comfortable, uncritical (mainly) white, middle-class audience that it was expressly made for and hyped to in the late 70's. As a light, frothy, inconsequential film which thoroughly entertained its undemanding demographic audience, it was a marketer's dream. The film does not stand up to any sort of critical scrutiny, but it was never meant to. Phony situations, lazy plotting, forced tension, pretentious drama and most of all a naive and ignorant knowledge of teenage culture at the time combine to make this the perfect 'false nostalgia' film (ie. a clever lie) - we are drawn in to pining for a guilt-free innocent past that never existed. 'Grease' treats its characters and 'story line' in a camp, jokey way without ever taking the leap into satire, which would have made for a much better film. Rizzo's persona & worldly cynicism is what a better film might have explored; this is why she feels like the most authentic character in this.
The filmmakers treat the story's participants as silly, which undercuts any kind of believable tenderness and tension between the main characters, so any attempt at meaningfully exploring what 'real' teenagers actually go through (peer group pressure, finding identity, discovering romance, breaking up, making up) is lost.
What's left? 'Grease' is primarily a catchy soundtrack over which pretty, innocent, meaningless pictures and story are laid - you are in effect 'watching' the soundtrack, like an extended MTV-style music clip, which this film helped usher in via 80's pop culture.
Want something better, with good songs, but also believable drama? Watch 'American Graffiti', or even better, find ""American Hot Wax'' and see what a good filmmaker did with similar source material. '..Wax' was my 'Grease' of 1978; better made, gritty, knowing and believable......that's why it found a very limited audience. Enough said !!!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
3 things about grease,"Grease is one of my favorite musical movies ever. it gains strength out of three important causes: 1-historical , as it archived the era of crazy sixties in America and the rest of the world . rock'n roll, clothes, hair style,dance moves, cars, and even slang.. i really enjoy watching and recollecting memories out of this movie than a dull documentary one..2- musical:some of the best songs ever composed and performed were introduces in grease 1 .. actually the soundtrack alone is a very interesting masterpiece.songs of romance,heartbreak,challenge and dance are all included..i really appreciate the efforts done by the actors to sing and dance along the music.. believe me it's not easy at all 3- the spirit:when i first saw grease I thought it was shot in a real public school.with students, teachers, contests and parties.. the spirit you find in grease is ultimately a teenagers' spirit.. and that what's great about it though it's difficult also... how to hunt this spirit and introduce it on screen without getting dull through the process of screen writing or directing or even editing...it's always there..eventually. it's amazingly entertaining movie, regardless dancing sketches which are not thoroughly done and/or dancers' movements which are not so synchronized .Oh ,and I like so much the animated entrance of the movie... it's very funny8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Grease is great,"My high school drama teacher pointed out something that a lot of this viewers don't get -- it's a satire! People who hate Grease actually think it's supposed to be a true reflection of early 1960s America, but it's a comedy, a spoof, and it's meant to be fun entertainment. The songs are the best thing, from the pounding opening song, Grease, to the lovely Travolta showpiece ballad, Sandy to the dance spectacular, Hand Jive. There are quite a few silly bits, such as Jan singing the toothbrush song and most of Frenchy's dialogue, but you've got to remember that this is a movie about teenagers, for teenagers, although most of the cast were aged in their 20s and 30s. Highlights for me included Beauty School Dropout by Frankie Avalon, There are Worse Things I Could Do by Stockard Channing and Hopelessly Devoted to You by Olivia Newton-John. Grease was a musical we did at my high school, and it'sjust a quality production that's hugely enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Favorite Musical of 70s/80s Theater Kids Still Holds Up,"When I was in high school in the early '80s, I was a ""theater kid"" - participated in high school plays and voraciously watched musicals on TV (cable was a novelty then). And back then, every theater kid loved the hell out of Grease. We all saw it multiple times in the theater, wore out the soundtrack, then watched it over and over on HBO until we could recite the dialogue by heart. So what if the ""teenagers"" in the film were almost old enough to be our parents and the portrayal of '50s gang warfare was more than a little sanitized? It was a candy-colored carnival with great songs well sung, fabulous dancing and eye-catching costumes - Olivia Newton-John's costume in the finale launched a fad for Candies, backless wooden spike heels with leather straps.
Caught the film recently, many years removed from my theater kid days - and found that, surprisingly, it had lost little of its charm. The songs sounded as good as ever, the dialogue was just as snappy, and the film's mashup of '50s and '70s pop culture gave it an odd sheen of timelessness. Plus, as an adult, I could better appreciate Danny Zuko's crisis of identity - trying at once to please his straitlaced girlfriend and his car jockey friends. We've all been there. So if you were a fan back in the day, give it another spin. Heck, you may even want to show it to your theater kid offspring.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Olivia Newton-John was born on September 26th, 1948","Grease (1978), leaves a good feeling in a person's heart. From beginning to end, it is a good time that is spent watching these kids go through their senior year in high school. The interesting part to this film is the fact that you are watching a film about the 1950's, that was made in the 1970's. It produces all the images and colors that capture the essence of the 1950's. Along with those images, it tackles topics much more prevalent in the 1970's such as birth control, and pregnancy. This mix of image and content is what creates the flavor of the film. It gives you the song and dance that is expected from a musical of this kind, and at the same time it throws in topics that make this period piece something more tangible in this day and age.There are some scenes that are silly and none of these actors look young enough to be even college students, but if the film was completely serious than it probably would not have accomplished what it wanted to do. It gives you the images and scenes found in Happy Days, and it gives you the energy and spark found in Footloose. Some of the most wonderful images found in the film are those scenes with 1950's icons such as drive-in movies and drive-in restaurants. The acting and singing works fine and the songs are perfect for each scene. Stockard Channing gives an excellent performance as the rebellious Rizzo and it was very refreshing witnessing two legendary faces from film and television in the guise of Eve Arden and Syd Caesar.8.1 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Late to the party.,"I had managed to avoid watching Grease for 44 years. The reason being that Grease is primarily a movie for girls. The reason I say that is that even as a child I can vividly remember girls reactions to the movie which was basically the same as they would to a boy band. This response is guaranteed to repel any male.
Not to mention its basically a love story from the female perspective and the males are basically goofballs along for the ride. All of the main characters are female, dont believe me? How many males versus females get their own song?
There are some very odd complaints about this movie which are common. First is they thinks its anti-women. Which is impossible being a female focused cast. The other so called ""anti-feminist"" belief about the movie is that they think the message to girls is they have to change for a man. This is bizarre. We know that both the lead male and female make superficial attempts to change for each other. So to argue that its only the female who makes an effort to change is easily proven wrong. Not only that but if anyone genuinely believes that changing your clothes and hairstyle (which they both did) means a change in personality then psychological science has it all wrong. Everyone has to make allowances for their partners but in this case it was basically two people who made small changes in order to be closer and in effect try and take on some of the others' personality or likes, to be together. The thing is it was obvious that this wasn't actually required of either of them.
What made me actually watch this was the current trend of live orchestral music during a movie. This is not a cheap option as its basically attending theatre (with theatre prices) while a movie plays. This is expensive event cinema. Luckily for me I obtained a complimentary ticket and attended, so this review is from someone who caught this as a movie with live orchestra which greatly enhanced the event. Basically without this I was unlikely to watch this on a big screen.Other odd complaints are that it feels dated (it was set in the 50s) or its not serious enough. If you want serious there is always Rumble Fish. This a musical comedy and supposed to be fun. Which it is. The enthusiasm of the cast and their joy on screen is what elevates this movie. Basically the grumps who dislike this are basically saying they don't enjoy watching people have a good time. Yes these people exist.
The music is iconic and the performances perfect, yes we all know that they arent kids in this movie but hey, if it was it wouldn't be as good.
There isn't much else to say about this apart from if you havent seen it you should as its part of the best American movies ever made. If your a guy, try your best to avoid watching it with large numbers of females (because they will get overly excited and sing along). And if you do get the chance watch it with the live orchestra, it brings a whole new level of enjoyment.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

This film aged like a wine.,"Grease is a musical romantic comedy film directed by Randal Kleiser. The film stars John Travolta and Late Olivia Newton-John.While vacationing in Australia, Danny and Sandy indulge in a passionate love affair with each other. They part ways believing they will not see each other again but fate has other plans.One of the most wonderful film which aged like a wine. The film has great storyline, great execution, some of the greatest music and a stellar cast which never disappoints.The chemistry between the lead cast is also one of the strongest aspect of the film.Screenplay of the film is superb and will keep you glued. The climax of the film is also good. One of the greatest films to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very cool musical,"I am most certainly NOT a big fan of musicals.  But, Grease is one of the few exceptions.  I really like this movie.  Yes, it drags a bit in the middle, but the main songs are staples of pulp culture.  And the chemistry between Travolta and John is great.  The dancing of course it nice.  This was also the movies that really started the careers of several people including Travolta and Olivia Newton John.I especially like the Rizzo character played by Stockard Channing.  Although she wasn't the cutest kid in the movie, she was a very good character and Channing did a really good job.If you like musicals, this has to be one of your favorites.  If you don't (like me) this is probably still a good movie for you to see.  It is a light fun movie with lots of really good musical numbers.",,Anonymous,Romance
"For a musical it is tolerable, even if it has virtually no plot.","Like I start off saying before I review most musicals, I really do not care for the musical format in a movie. That being said this one is more tolerable than most musicals I have had the misfortune to see. In fact, some areas of the movie are rather good. To put it bluntly a five is a very good score for me to give a musical. The main problem I have with the movie has less to do with the fact that it is a musical and more with the fact it has almost no plot whatsoever in the film. Also, it seems to be trying to teach people that the only way to be accepted is to act like everyone else and not be an individual. So not the best message in the world that is for sure. Still, the songs in this one are actually kind of catchy compared to some musicals, though my favorite musical number in this one is the song played in the opening credits. There are a couple of other rather good songs in this one though, I have to say the worst song in this one is better than anything heard in the dreadful sequel to this film. There are also a couple of humorous scenes in this one too, like the sleepover where they make fun of poor Sandra. And speaking of Sandra, Olivia Newton John is very good in this film as is most of the cast. Even Travolta is rather good in this one and to be honest I am not a big fan of his usually (when I usually can tolerate him is when he is a bad guy). So while not something I would want to see every day, this musical to me is tolerable which is high praise coming from me who hates musicals usually.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Grease"" IS the Word","An evocation of a time and place often labeled ""the good ole days,"" ""Grease"" is a near operatic salute to bobby socks, taffeta dresses and black leather jackets. Quoting its own vernacular, it's peachy keen, whirling its viewers through chorus tunes inspired by 50s rock 'n' roll. Comic book characters make out, sing out, break out at pajama parties, sock hops, soda shops, drag strips and high school carnivals! Did your school have carnivals? Mostly staged around Hollywood-built sets, ""Grease"" is a throwback to 50s movie musicals.While the cast members are well beyond their teen years, it is no matter. Just have fun with it.

40 years later it's still the word!!!,"When Grease first came out on the same day as Jaws 2 nearly 40 years ago, it broke records for a big budget musical on opening weekend at the box office yet it landed in 2nd place to the shark sequel. Luckily, Grease went on to become the most profitable film of that year and became the most popular musical film of all time, a record that it broke from Sound of Music which has been broken by Chicago (Oscar winner for best picture), and Disney's live action remake of Beauty and the Beast. A sequel was soon comissioned in 1982, and sadly it didn't do well as it was released on the same day as E.T. That year, Grease would come out on home video for the first time, with some minor changes from the theatrical release. In 1998, the film was reissued in a heavily remixed and digitally restored 35mm print to moderate success. It was also the first time that the movie was on DVD and then Blu-Ray. Thankfully this year, Paramount has gone back to the original 35mm negatives and the 70mm six track 4.2 audio to create the definitve Grease experience, which is now available on Itunes as well as DVD, Bluray, and 4k bluray. As for the movie itself, it's a classic. Based on a musical that ran on broadway and continued to run even when the movie was still in theatres, this movie tells the love story of two high school lovers in 1950s america. Both Olivia Newton John and John Travolta shine as well as Didi Cohn and others. Even though the movie is rated PG it's more aimed at teens than kids.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Go Greased Lighting!,"Pros:
1. The film is brimming with well-written, well-sung, and catchy songs. Certain songs such as, 'Summer Nights', 'Greased Lightning', and 'You're the One I Want' became - and still are - classics.
2. The choreography is fantastic, especially in regards to the dance numbers and the car race.
3. The humour lands and stems from genuine high school banter.
4. There is mesmerising chemistry between all of the actors and it really pays-off onscreen.
5. The set and costume design look amazing and they set the 1950's feel superbly.
6. The movie does a great job at highlighting how differently men and women approach love and relationships.
7. Both John Travolta (Danny) and Olivia Newton-John (Sandy) give really good performances.
8. The film leaves you with an appropriate feel-good feeling.Cons:
1. All of the actors are clearly not in their teens, and it's really distracting.
2. The acting at times is rather over-the-top.
3. Some lines of dialogue have clearly been added post-production.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

What a drag,"This huge hit from 1978 is a rather silly, occasionally funny comedy-musical about high school life and love in the fifties. Randall Kleiser's film has enjoyed several revivals and still holds a baffling cult status today.The acting from John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing and support is painful, even if the dancing is, along with the music, quite good.

Whoever doesn't like Grease? GO AWAY!!,"I was doing some researching on Google why Grease doesn't have a higher IMDb rating? Personally I think it should be in the upper 8s if not a 9, or 10!

Seems Gease is back in the spotlight 43 years later after some social media users called out the pop culture mainstay's ""problematic"" themes, labeling it misogynistic,"" ""sexist,"" ""rapey"" and saying the high school musical displays ""racism."" The conversation was sparked on Twitter. Who cares! And that's exactly why I don't partake with the deadhead social media noobs. I mean, misogynistic? Rapey? Racist? Oh please! Get over yourselves whoever those 'selves' are on social media or anywhere else. Real America is sick and tired of EVERYTHING about race and gender today!! Hollyweirdland incites it all stirring the pot. Nowadays we can't even have some 12th or 13th century period movie without peppering in a few of this or that's all in the name of some gender hang up or the big ever boring racial equality? It's the same as if making a movie about some Congo tribe deep in the Africa jungles and throwing in a few Anglo-Saxons for scenic comedy.

Travolta's great role,"When I first saw this movie, I guess I liked the music most. I had a season going on-I listened to old music from the '50s, '60s and the '70s and gathered some information about politicians and actors from that period. Then I caught my eye on the chemistry between John Travolta's and Olivia Newton-John's characters. It was really something else. I had to see the movie over and over again.Then there was a break of something like 5 to 10 years. Until some year, I'm not sure if it was 2001 or what, I had to buy it for myself, as a Christmas present, because I had seen some movie from Travolta and had liked it. When I looked at him in Grease, I could relate to the fans who had admired him those days. He really could dance. And he can also act.

Listening to `Summer Loving' could lead one to believe this was a simple story about 50's high school students.  Whoops, it's not, it's actually a parody of that. But, that gives it a lot of amusing (adult) humor.But the most impressive thing about the movie is how energetic it is.  They really don't make them like they used to.  The music and dancing really gets you excited as you start tapping your feet with the rhythm.  Just compare this energy to today's computer-generated films, like Star Wars Episode II!

A Splashy Adaptation of a Broadway Hit,"1978'S GREASE is the nearly perfect screen adaptation of the 1971 Broadway musical with a score by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. The musical centers around the romance between cheerleader/exchange student (Olivia Newton-John)and a hood (John Travolta). Travolta and Newton-John are charming leads but the film is practically stolen by Stockard Channing, in her knockout performance as Rizzo, the leader of the Pink Ladies and Danny's ex. The musical has been ""cleaned up"" for the big screen (the Broadway show was WAY raunchier) with sharp direction by Randal Kleiser and imaginative staging of the musical numbers by the stage show's choreographer Patricia Birch. Musical highlights include ""Summer Nights"" Danny and Sandy's duet on how they met. ""Greased Lightning"", ""Beauty School Dropout"", a very funny fantasy number led by Frankie Avalon, ""Born to Hand Jive"", and Channing's solo ""There are Worse Things I Could do"". As is the case with most Broadway to Movie Transitions, songs were cut and added. Some of the songs cut from the play can be heard as background music if you listen and ""Grease"", ""You're the One that I Want"", ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", and ""Sandy"" were written directly for the screen. For many years, this film held the record as biggest moneymaking musical film ever and the validation is up there on the screen. It's a little corny and predictable, but you can't help but get caught up.

A good movie with even better musical numbers,"Grease as a movie is a  good movie.  Just like Footloose, it is the songs and the dancing in it that make it so enduring and rewatchable. I think the acting is okay for the most part. The best performance comes from Stockard Channing as Rizzo the leader of the Pink Ladies.  She has the most complex character to play and she pulls it off very well. I think the actions of the T-Birds minor players, Doodie, Sunny, Putzzie are immature and stupid and don't seem to fit in with Danny   and Kenickie coolness and take away from this movie; just like Jar Jar  ruined Star Wars everytime he was in a scene.  Look even their names are dumb. THe least enjoyable song and dance number was ""Beauty school Dropout"" because i thought it was an unneccesarry  detour in  the movie. The best song and dance number was ""You're the One I Want"" because I liked Oliva Newton John in that black outfit and ""Summer Nights"" because of  the way Danny and Sandy are singing together. I was more interested in following the relationship between Rizzo and Kenickie which had more layers and complications to it thAN OF Danny and Sandy which was simply a love story of bad boy and good girl falling for each other. There are  a lot of subtle and not so subtle references to taboo stuff, like teenage sex, oral sex, condum use, pregnacy, corutption of a minor by a tv personality, underage drinking and smoking, street racing and how the best way to get someone to love you is to change who you are even if that means dressing like some street walker; which I found surprising in a movie from the 1970's aimed at it's target audience of young people. So overall this movie is enjoyable and gets 8/10 in my books",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Star rating: 5 out of 5,"Grease is everything a musical film should be.  It is a visual and aural feast that has captured the imaginations of audiences for over 25 years. Everything is larger than life and the action occurs amidst a riot of 1950s colour.  Who cares if the cast is largely composed of 30-somethings playing teenagers?  The key to Grease's success is not realism, but the enormous amount of infectious energy exuded by the cast.This zest for life is particularly apparent in the lively and eminently sing-able chorus song-and-dance numbers.  The tunes of retro party favourites such as 'Greased Lightning' and 'You're The One That I Want' will probably be familiar to many viewers, but lesser known songs, including the short and sarcastic 'Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee' and 'Beauty School Drop-Out' (with Frankie Avalon in the role of guardian angel) are also fun toe-tappers.Musicals work best when, like Grease, they concentrate on the music rather than the plot; however, the story here is completely adequate.  Sandy and Danny had a summer fling at the beach, but at school Danny has an image to uphold - which Sandy doesn't really fit - so their senior year at Rydell High is spent in a daze of ""will-they-won't-they"" teenage angst.John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John set the screen alight as Danny and Sandy; there are some fabulous character roles in the ""Pink Ladies"" and ""T-Birds"" school cliques, and some very funny cameos - particularly the pairing of Principal McGee and Blanche the office lady.  There are sexual innuendoes aplenty if you look hard enough, and despite the fact that the movie is set half a century ago, the viewer is led to conclude that teenagers have been, and will always be, teenagers.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The whole film feels like a cartoon (and I love the opening credits too!) and for that reason, you can't take any of it seriously.

It's the Word that You Heard,"In the early 1970s, composers Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey brought to musical theater one of the cheesiest yet most lovable coming of age 50s rom coms, Grease. Following its smash success, a film adaptation was inevitable, thus prompting theater and film producer Robert Stigwood and screen manager Allan Carr to create just that. Released in 1978 to glowing reviews and huge financial returns, the film version of Grease remains a culturally and aesthetically significant treasure in musical cinema history. So in honor of its lead stars, John Travolta and the late Olivia Newton-John, it's time to look back and see how they did so well.Set after the summer of '58, the film depicts the lives of American greaser Danny Zuko and Australian transfer student Sandy Olsson, who develop an attraction for each other in spite of constant peer pressure from their respective groups. What could have easily been a dramatic soul crushing feature about two distinctive student's conflicting worlds is instead played up in a more cheesy lighthearted manner, although not without its fair share of intensity. As a tribute to the 1950s, the film both mocks and embraces the stereotypical culture of high schoolers back then, highlighting Danny's greaser gang and Sandy's new found clique of greaser girls. While the plot is easy to guess what will come about of both leads, the intentionally awkward chemistry between Travolta and Newton-John make the film all the more gratifying, especially when one can tell how much one wants to change for the better. By delving into how much social peer pressure and adolescent behavior can affect even the most well-intentioned romances, Grease shows the way we are all feeling.Adding onto Danny and Sandy, the overall cast is a good mix of hysterical delinquents, misunderstood archetypes and humorous side leads. Compared to Danny's tough minded greaser gang and Sandy's overtly feminine group, members Kenickie and Betty Rizzo take the cake for most memorable. On top of an obvious rivalry with a street gang, the aforementioned couple walk on eggshells more than Danny and Sandy, aided by some shockingly wholesome performances from Jeff Conaway and Stockard Channing. Arguably the other most significant of the gang would be Frenchy, who would rather stick by the team and help guide Sandy through her rocky relationship than pursue beauty school. The rest range from minor opponents like the typical principal McGee asserting authority across Rydell High, Coach Calhoun attempting to move Danny to a more physically nuanced direction, to Charlene ""Cha Cha"" Di Gregorio and Leo ""Crater-Face"" Balmudo conflicting Danny and Kenickie even more. Sometimes, even in film, a musical cast is the best kind of cast.Going into the filmmaking, director Randal Kleiser paints the film as a charming send off to 50s musicals by keeping the contrast between the upbeat goofy musical sequences and the more laid back dramatic moments. As corny and ditsy as the film can be, it also knows when to sit back and let an emotion come out from one character to another, aided by Bill Butler's moody cinematography and John F. Burnett's sporadic editing. Although often a bit cluttered pacing wise, the frantically diverse range in dances and movements pay their respects to acclaimed choreographer Patricia Burch. And of course, the soundtrack is what keeps old fans and new fans of Grease coming back to the film version. On top of the numbers from the original musical, John Farrar's beloved classics Hopelessly Devoted to You and You're the One That I Want showcase Newton-John as the real singing star of the movie, with Travolta almost taking the passenger's seat. With endless parodies and renditions of these songs, it's now wonder people are still singing their praises today.It may be a bit too silly to hold up for everyone today, but Grease still remains a household classic thanks to its energetic musical tone and an ode to young love that cannot be forgotten. In loving memory of Olivia Newton-John and as a tribute to nostalgic musical theatre, this film is absolutely worth the viewing for those who have not yet caught a taste of the greased lightning. Given how the film was successful enough to warrant an unnecessary sequel, a live televised rendition and an upcoming prequel, it's easy to say that the film has been believing that it can be what it is, and then some.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Olivia Newton John seemed at times to be on another planet as everything came to her as 'such a surprise' and all innocence lost!The score was bouncy in a brassey, sing-a-long medium kind of way and the lyrics easy-to-remember without being syrupy and candy floss hype.The script was no pulitzer prize winner but ""teens"" in those days were never very bright.

A fun movie to watch (and sing along to...),"The songs are great and the plot is classic. Those two qualities alone make ""Grease"" a memorable movie.

If you haven't seen this movie, PLEASE go out and see it! However, this movie is not perfect. There are two things wrong with it. First of all, I hate it when Sandy goes from a perfectly nice, sweet girl to a raunchier (and less classy) Marilyn Monroe. What was wrong with her previous nice girl persona? Did the writers feel that there was something WRONG with nice girls? That there should be less nice girls than raunchier (and less classy) Marilyn Monroes? I think it should be the other way around. It also didn't quite fit into the storyline. Second of all, what was with the car flying into the sky into the end? That didn't fit into the movie at all! Since when did it become a magical, Herbie-like flying car? I think it was the writers' desperate attempt to put something ""magical"" and ""romantic"" into the movie.

You Can't Help But Love It!,"I remember this movie really causing a sensation when it was released in 1978.   I saw it at the drive-in in 1998 on the big screen for it's 20th anniversary release.  It's a cute '70s interpretation of the '50s, which was fun to watch back in 1978, and just seems to get better as time goes by. Everything from the songs to the '50s fashions, and the little sexual innuendos throughout, make this film memorable and endearing.  I am glad to see that it is available on DVD, but even if you opt to go for the VHS version, this movie will not disappoint.  The VHS version is mastered from a digital transfer, so it looks great!

Grease...is the word!,"I remembered watching the 20th anniversary edition when it's on the television. It was kind of over-hyping then in terms of the media side, with also my parents remembering what happened to them when they were first aware of the movie during its original release. (It was way before they met each other.)The movie musical of a good-girl Sandy (Olivia Newtwon-John) meeting the greaser Danny (John Travolta) is the main plot of this feel-good movie. Being so retro all over again is something I had been so liking to be because not many I know is aware I am a closet retro music fan too. The song 'Tell Me More' between where Olivia's and John's characters is the one which always stood out for me because maybe...it's so darn catchy.For someone like me who was born in the late 80s...it's actually kind of interesting I do also like some of the songs before my time.

Grease,"John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John star in this '70s version of the '50s. Olivia came from Australia and won the hearts of music fans. ""You're The One That I Want"" is the hot number from the film. The pair dress in black. ""Tell me about it, stud!"" she coos. Grease appeals to younger generations. Male/female duos perform Summer Nights to karaoke tracks. The film also exaggerates. There were no T-Birds or Pink Ladies in my school. Or maybe I was too young and naive to know what was happening. The cast of Grease was long out of high school, ranging in age from 19 to 35. Barry Gibb composed the title song. Oddly enough, it is closer to disco than to rock 'n' roll.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Almost overcomes the nagging flaw in the climax,"Highly energetic and enjoyable adaptation of the hit stage musical sees ""summer lovers"" Danny (Travolta) and Sandy (Newton-John) re-united for the last year of high school. Complications in love follow, but none of that is really important as the film zips along from one catchy show-stopping tune to the next. Randal Kleiser's spirited direction and wide-screen photography make sure that both story and musicals are carried off with the traditional level of flare, but never succumbing to style over substance, although the plot is wafer thin, we do really care about the varied cast of characters.One thing that struck me whilst watching Grease again (As an adult) is just how filthy the film really is (but in a good way) I can't believe that my parents used to let me watch this when I was four years old. Truthfully at the time having Travolta refer to a car as a ""Pussy-Wagon"" went way over my head, but at least the climatic race kept me enthralled. Now I see the films subtle humour, crass sexual innuendo and topical issues (Teenage pregnancy is covered) and it only helps to give the film a little more.The cast should be applauded, not only for their excellent singing and dancing, but also for making their character believable, we hardly ever ask the question as to, why there are so many high-school students in their early thirties, in some films this could be a problem, but Grease manages to grab you from the first animated frame of the opening credits and never let go right up to the final lively staging of ""We Go Together"".If the film is flawed, then it comes naggingly at the end, with the final shots descending into pure fantasy, destroying any ""realism"" (this is a musical, I use the term lightly) the film had expertly created, it comes off as a phoney, sell-out gesture on the part of the film-makers, and in all honesty I hate it. Still, the film does just about over-come that nagging flaw, and the long list of (then) celebrity cameos and classic songs (Look at me (I'm Sandra Dee), Beauty School Drop-out and Grease Lightning are just some of the highlights) make Grease and endlessly watchabale, piece of feel-good fodder. Even if the ultimate message of conformity is a bit messed up. 9/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Boring,"Well...I don't know what to say. I love musicals. I think John Travolta is a great actor. I love the song ""You Are The One That I Want"". I had never seen the movie until that night a few weeks ago when they aired it on the TV. I don't think I should hide it. I barely succeeded to watch the entire movie. It was just plain boring. I guess it was supposed to be a slice of the 60s teenagers's life but it just failed. The story was dumb and the acting was uninspired. All of the actors looked too old for their roles. It was kind of disturbing for me to see a 35 years old looking woman trying to act as a teenage girl. Come on... Stockard Channing looked old enough to be a teacher in that school, not a student. The same thing could be told about Olivia Newton-John and about every other teenage character in the movie. Of course this was not the only problem of the movie. It was not the biggest problem of the movie too. The story was idiotic and boring. What did they try to show us? Some boy and some girl in love? The conflict between the two bands? The teenagers' growing up? Whatever they wanted they didn't achieve it. The characters were one-dimensional and plain dumb.The songs were... Well, one of them was nice. Guess which. The others...

Later, when my parents let me see it, it did not live up to the expectations my childish imagination had set. Twenty five years later, I realize that the music and some of the dancing is what salvages this somewhat dumb scenario.  The film is a compact package of images and archetypes of a certain US culture  (50s mixed with some 60s and 70s in them). Cars, leather jackets, american sports, american fast food restaurants, american high schools, competitiveness... He/she who has more of all this is the winner.  Typical of this agenda is when Sandy sings near the end ""Look at me I'm Sandra-dee"" as a mourning of an identity she has to give up.  She will be rewarded when she uglyfies herself proving that she is capable in conforming.  Danny also has to prove himself. One wonders what could had happened had they had not done otherwise! Like in most simplistic movies, there are good and bad guys and complicated teenage situations such as pregnancy are dealt with superficially simplistic solutions.

Not the music from the actual 50's, no, I just mean the music they come up with themselves. The two songs I believe are actually good are Greased Lightning (though I don't like the fact that John Travolta sings it, as Kenickie is the one who sings it on stage, but that isn't too big an issue) and Born to Hand Jive as it works well with the moves the characters are singing on screen.

Great Mix of Music/Comedy/Romance,"This classic musical/comedy/romance has two big things going for it. One is the great music as there is not one bad song in the bunch. Very catchy and people are still singing to this day. Number two is the plain fun you have watching it.Two teens Danny Zuko (John Tavaolta) and Sandy Olson (Olivia Newton-John) have fallen in love during the summer. When school starts up again the two have each gone their separate ways. So Danny tells a few fibs about his summer and the girl he met. Sandy though ends up at Rydell High where Danny is for the school year. Danny acts differently around Sandy and is not the same caring, warm boy he was in the summer. So Danny must get himself back into shape or show the true person he is or he will lose Sandy forever.The film is also loaded with sexual innuendos and I would suggest to forget how old the actors appear to be. I mean yes they all look like they are pushing 30, but the whole point is to enjoy the musical numbers and laugh. Also starring Stockard Channing who plays the memorable Rizzo who is the gang The Pink Ladies that Sandy later joins, Jeff Conaway as Danny's best buddy Kenickie and even a musical number from Frankie Avalon. A winner and not to be missed if you are a fan of musicals, Newton-John or Travolta.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A trip down somebody else's memory lane,"It's kitchy, it's sassy, it's full of adults acting like kids trying to act like adults. In a way, it's very confusing in the discrepancy between how cool Tavolta is in contrast to his suck up cronies, who are as nerdy as can be. Then there's Stockard Channing, looking like a cradle robber but delivering the best lines of the movie. Understandably overstated, as all Broadway Musical Hollywood remakes are repackaged, but if the mix of 1970's BeeGee-ism at the beginning of the film doesn't throw you off your tour of somebody else's' mash up of 1950's nostalgia (and let's face it, most of the theater goers 1950's exposure was pretty much limited to ABCs' ""Happy Days"") then the rest of the picture is pretty easy to swallow. And just like cotton candy, it disappears very quickly and is quite unnutricious. That criticism aside, there are classic song and choreographed numbers that have stayed with me throughout the generations. ""Greased Lightening"", ""Summer Loving"" and the eternal Frankie Vallie singing ""Beauty School Dropout"" are outstanding. I'm always surprised to have forgotten the best song of the film sung by Channing, ""There Are Worst Things I Could Do"", which I deem the only honest moment of the entire film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Frankie Valli said it best,"In the grand scheme of Broadway musicals turned films, the one everyone seems to know is the 1978 adaptation of Grease. It has proved itself timeless with its over-the-top portrayal of 50's culture and hilariously broad performances by its two wonderful leads. It may not be the best musical, you'll be hard-pressed to find a film wackier, more enjoyable, and more subversive than the 1975 cult musical which I believe doesn't need to be named, but for a film that works mostly on its own terms, it's flyweight and easy to love.John Travolta, always a charming, energetic actor, plays Danny, the kid at the school who sports black leather, jeans, and greasy, slicked-back black hair affirming his style and attitude. Singer Olivia Newton-John plays Sandy, a good girl with hair of gold. We see the two say a long goodbye on the beach after a summer of clear passion and enjoyment disintegrates into distant memories as Sandy must return to Australia.Cue the wonderfully animated title cards with the Frankie Valli song we all know and we are at Rydell High School, the school where people wear their social cliques and popularity status like a brand new leather coat. It comes as a surprise to us and to the characters that Sandy has switches to RHS, and, after a fabulous ""Summer Nights"" dance number, this discover their newfound romance can continue. Well, in a perfect world that is, and that would not be the case.Danny Doesn't want to risk his astronomical reputation as a bad boy just so he can date some goody-two shoes girl. He provokes her and her friends to impress his, but we can see he doesn't mean what he says. The rest of the pictures involves the two desperately trying to express their love for each other and singing whenever they get the chance.Like many musicals, the exposition is rather slim, while the production values and the performance of the songs are put ,more into focus. This isn't a bad thing, but after a catchy music number returning to mildly interesting setups can be an abrupt, awkward change at first. Thankfully, the film knows how to punctuate its antics.The film's charm mainly comes from Travolta, who delivers energy and dominance in limitless quantities. He seems fully comfortable when he needs to be, mainly during the songs, and totally capable and reliable as the person at the wheel during the scenes in between the singing and dancing. He is only made better by Olivia Newton-John, whose smile and personality go a long way in the picture.As far as films go, this isn't a very great one. It's choppy and so sweet it causes cavities and puts the viewer at risk for diabetes (face it, I like John Waters' Cry-Baby, the even more self-aware parody a bit more than this). As far as musicals go and as far as cheery camp goes, Grease shines through it all, completely showing its viewer just why it has been loved for so many years. It may not have the grand amount of depth I crave when I watch films, but its production values, charismatic leads, and infectious song and dance numbers provide it with enough substantial entertainment value.Starring: John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, and Stockard Channing.

Tender Nostalgia of Unlived Times ...,"At a time that confines now to prehistory, when box-office top-tens weren't made of franchises' appointed reboots or frankly disappointing remakes, of Pixar marvels or Marvels pixilation, two school movies could make it in the Top 3 of the highest-grossing movies of the year. From third to first, it was ""Animal House"" and ""Grease"" (for the trivia, ""Superman"" was the second).And these two movies -regarded now as classic- worked because they didn't conflict one to another, each one carried its own spirit and did a damn good job at that. John Landis' ""Animal House"" was set in 1962 but was clearly impregnated by a touch of absurdity and a sense of anarchy, obviously too mature for the very time it depicted, like a raunchy and adult variation of something that was closer tone-wise to George Lucas' 1962 in ""American Graffiti"". Granted the actors were all baby-boomers who lived the real 1962, but it was their 1978 selves acting there, no doubt.Things work in reverse for ""Grease"", it's set only three years earlier, not a huge chronological leap, but it's an obvious over-the-top, fantasized version of the 50's, one that the cast knew as kids or pre-teens and could only re-enact with a tender nostalgia, which is what ""Grease"" is about. There's no way you can watch that ""We Go Together"" sequence at the end without feeling some magical sentiment invading your heart. The only proper description I can give (from a guy born four years after the film) is 'paradoxical nostalgia'. Basically, I feel like I lived at the film's time or the release's time, who said Cinema acted rationally anyway?And the reason, I, and I believe many fans who're from my generation, feel that way is because ""Grease"" plays the cards straightforwardly and doesn't pretend to be anything else than a good old-fashioned romance and a heart-grabbing musical. Does it sound too reducing? Maybe; but then again, how many romances fail? How many musicals were swept-off by the passing of time? It's not easy, and sometimes, you need two strong protagonists to make it work. In the case of ""Grease"", directed by Randal Kleiser (because the director deserves some credit) and I apologize in advance to Olivia Newton-John's fans, I think the film works primarily thanks to John Travolta, who plays Danny Zuko, the cool and handsome T Birds leader.Indeed, if there's anything ""Grease"" did, is to have proved some skeptical minds that Travolta wasn't a one-hit wonder, the hit being his success in ""Saturday Night Fever"", the cocky disco dancer staggering down New York was meant to 'stay alive'. He had the looks, the charisma and just as he knew how to be funny even in a dramatic way, in the case of ""Grease"", he could be serious in a comedic way. Travolta's success wasn't accidental and although he had many ups and downs, he was an actor who could act and move his way out of a good story, so that his persona wouldn't desert the screens forever.Of course, everyone remembers the names of Olivia Newton-John who played Sandy, the sweet and innocent Australian girl falling in love with the bad-boy, macho man and cool greaser, in another take of ""Romeo and Juliet"" meets ""Beauty and the Beast"" myths, as we all remember Stockard Channing as the scene-stealing Pink Sisters' leader Rizzo and ¬Ö you know, that actress who played Frenchy¬Ö it gets tougher, now. I know the rest of the cast includes many nice- looking guys and dolls, 2uko's friend, Kelk.. Kell¬Ö never mind, the torrid 'Cha-cha' (whom I just learned from Wikipedia that she passed away) but also a first-class list of supporting players who, by their sole presence, pay a genuine tribute to the old days : Sid Caesar, Joan Blondell, Frankie Avalon and Eve Arden, to name a fewBut it's Travolta's movie nonetheless. And he might have half of Astaire's dancing talent or half of James Dean's iconic appeal, but both halves makes a 'one' that oddly surpasses these two legends. And it doesn't shine only during the romantic moments, because like I said, it took two things to make '""Grease"" work: a romance and a musical, and I guess the streak of stinkers Travolta had during the 80's was because each time, something lacked. But even when your plot is predictable, all you need are catchy songs and memorable lyrics. ""Grease"" has more than needed, and there's never one moment you feel like skipping. From ""Summer Nights"" to ""Sandra Dee"" from the sweet ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" to the defining ""You're the One that I Want"" and the final apotheosis of ""Go Together"", every emotion is rewarded, and the fun is always there.""Grease"" made it in both AFI's Romances and Musical List with ""Summer Nights"" in the Top 100 Songs (""The One that I Want"" was unfairly overlooked). The film was the last musical to throne on the box-office and it is the most successful one in history, and almost forty years later, its appeal is undeniable. It might feel laughable in a sort of juvenile naivety whether the two friends pretending to act macho after a hug, the way one gets knocked down by a car door or the whole 'all's well that ends well' finale but it still works. And as I suspect most viewers in 1978 weren't high school kids in 1959; and thankfully, so they couldn't spot the exaggeration, we love the film now for its timeless quality and tender simplicity; one that made the success a series like ""Glee"".That's the power of music, always carrying a personal resonance. Speaking of mine, I remembered spotting during the dance-off the choreography from that Spanish summer hit ""Asereje"" and using Zucco as my first nickname when I started chatting (good old Caramail days). That among many other things.Oh yeah; and it was Didi Conn playing Frenchie (thanks, Wikipedia)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The opening animated sequence is a one of a kind-you don't see many films start out like that anymore.

A musical romantic comedy classic.,"Made in 1978 but set in the 1959 high school Rydell High. They say it's America's favorite musical. It's a classic, that's for sure. Catchy tunes, attractive cast, good choreography. Followed up by a good enough sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why did I wait so long to watch this musical?!?!,"At long last, I've finally gotten to a musical I've intended to watch for awhile now, and I'm so cross with myself for having not gotten to it sooner! Why did I take this long to watch Grease?!This is a new personal favorite musical of mine, alongside Little Shop of Horrors and Hairspray! Just like in Hairspray, beautiful colorful style and costumes! Just like in both Hairspray and Little Shop off Horrors, groovy, catchy songs! My favorites from Grease were: the Grease theme song, Summer Lovin', You're the One that I Want, and definitely, Greased Lightin'! Unique and interesting special effects as well; I loved the cool transitions that occurred when a new song was starting, which seemed to magically transport the character, and the audience into the character's personal imagination! I could also feel and see the struggling between Greaser boy Zuko, and Australian newcomer-to-America Sandy, as they struggle to keep their love alive, even through all the changes they're making to themselves throughout school time. Sandy seems to be trying to be a perfect little girl for her folks and friends, while Zuko's time with his friends has turned him a bit rowdy. Aware of this, he tries to change for her, but keeps slipping up. Later on, as Sandy watches Zuko having fun, she starts to wonder: ""Maybe it's me that needs to change for him..."" Of course, as we all know, you don't need to change a thing about you for people to like you.I'm so glad I finally watched Grease! It really made me feel happy, giddy, and hopeful! As a new favorite musical of mine, I highly recommend it!! Plus, a little fun fact: the actual Grease Lightin' car is currently on display at the Volo Auto Museum in Volo, Illinois! Check it out sometime!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mixed messages but great songs and choreography,"One of the most well-known and widely celebrated motion picture musicals of all time, there is no questioning how iconic the songs and hairstyles of 'Grease' are. The film benefits from spirited choreography and imaginative costumes, plus the film paints quite a vivid picture of 1950s high school life. All of this flashiness and vigour comes at the expense of good characters and a solid story though. It speaks volumes that Stockard Channing's unwanted pregnancy has more dramatic weight in an elaborate subplot than the 'will they or won't they?' question that hangs over the two leads, both of whom are self-obsessed teens who we could hardly care less about. He is a jerk who only cares about acting cool, and she seems pleasant, but is prepared to change her entire appearance just because he's the one who she wants. So much for feminism! The film does not work that well as a comedy either. Some of the song lyrics are funny, especially the interjections from Travolta's friends during ""Summer Nights"", but there is an absolutely groan-inducing gym training scene in the mix in which Travolta's lack of physical fitness is awkwardly played for laughs, and nothing ever really seems as funny as the opening animated credits. The film certainly suffices as mindless entertainment, but for a musical that spends more time depicting 50s high school life, more time on gags and more time exploring its characters, 'Cry-Baby' is recommended as a worthwhile alternative.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timeless,"I wholeheartedly believe that this film and musical will never fade away due to its iconic cultural influence today. Sure, the prevalent character and plot niches are corny and cliched, but these aspectes don't discourage the film at all. The music score, setting, costumes and the casting of characters has been very well done to fit the overall theme and aesthetic of this film.John Travolta, coming off the Saturday Night Fever hype, performs tremendously, showcasing his prime musical repetoire. He is pretty much the star of the film because everyone, whether they like to admit it or not, wanted to be like Danny Zuko one way or another at some point in their life.The songs are very catchy and fun, especially 'Greased Lightning' considering the dirty foreplay that is hidden underneath the lyrics! Some other classics include Summer Nights, You're the One That I Want and Hopelessly Devoted to You which showcases the beauty and charisma of Olivia Newton John as she encapsulates the role of good-girl Sandy Olsson.Overall, there is no doubt Grease will remain a timeless classic whether you're 5, 15, 25 or even in your 60s, this film is for everyone because everyone needs to see it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Fun Light-Hearted Romance Flick,"This is a great film that highlights the many talents of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

The rest of the cast are just as great as the two leading characters which brings the film to elevated heights. It's a great film that all movies lovers should watch.The movie has a groovy soundtrack - and well sung by the cast.

Surprisingly Entertaining,"I remember watching Grease as a kid and loving it, but then growing up and going into denial and classifying it as cheesy nonsense, even the music.Then, a few years ago, I rediscovered the title track 'Grease ' by Frankie Valli, which bookends the movie and was written (did you know) by Barry Gibb? It's a fantastic song in its own right.I never considered watching this movie again, but one day just stumbled across it and gave it a whirl for old time's sake, only to find myself totally entertained with its mix of good music, friendly vibes, fun and jokes and great choreography. I never expected it in a million years!Maybe, like the original Star Wars or The Sound of Music, old flicks that were brilliant then, still remain fantastic today: great casting, scripting and dynamics that age really well.There are a few slow points in Grease, not all the music is perfect and not all the singers are top class either, nor will I conscientiously make an effort to watch it again, but Grease is a very enjoyable and uplifting experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great Songs, Poor Story","I first saw this film when I was 12 and the main reason I saw it was because for a few months prior to the film being released, the radio was pretty much dominated by many of the songs in the film, especially the Olivia Newton-John/John Travolta duet ""You're the One That I Want"", which went on to top the singles chart and the soundtrack went on to top the album charts as well. Unfortunately, while the album was a classic, the same can't be said of the film. If you take away the music, the film is nothing more than a typical teen-age love story. It can also be called a mild teen sex comedy as well. Travolta and Newton-John are okay as well as Stockard Channing as Rizzo and Didi Conn as Frenchy. This may have been one of the most popular films of the 70's, but it hasn't stood the test of time.",,Anonymous,Romance
Always ready for Grease,"Grease is the kind of movie that always puts me in a good mood. With Travolta and Newton-John in their iconic roles as Danny & Sandy, you can't help but join in the fun and sing along happily. Personally I feel that this movie shouldn't be over analyzed, as I feel it creates a darker tone than what the movie tries to convey, after all it is a musical.The music is, in great part, the reason I love the movie. Combining the great performances and script with the perfectly synced dances and beautifully sung pieces only makes for a more enjoyable experience, especially with a musical nut such as myself. Among the memorable soundtrack my 4 favorite tracks are Summer Nights, Greased Lightning, You're The One That I Want and We Go Together. With Grease, I know that I will have the time of my life, and every year the movie never ceases to amaze me, as it grabs my full attention and appreciation. Overall a great musical classic in its own right.Rating: 9,5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A True Classic,"Grease is a musical that managed to stand the test of time. 44 years after it's release, Grease is still as fresh, fun, catchy and energetic as it was the day it was released.Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta (an actor I haven't been favourable toward over the years) absolutely shine in this movie, showcasing fantastic singing and acting skill that definitely lives up to the challenge of the script.Being a toned-down version of the borderline scandalous Broadway musical, Grease still maintains a lot of its edge. It beautifully captures the spirit of the 50s in tone, music, set design and costuming. Watching this film is like stepping into a carefully preserved time capsule from a bygone era.The editing on this film is fantastic as well. The cuts, such as that with Danny sliding under the car in Greased Lightning, create enough eye candy that no theatrical stage can ever convey to make this a truly interesting film to watch.Grease is also yet another example of a paper-thin, cookie-cutter plot that simply works through the decisions in the writer's room. This film is every bit as delightful as it's soundtrack, a penultimate summery album to listen to during a long drive in the hot weather.Grease is definitely a classic and headed directly to my favorite movies list.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Overblown and overrated,"I can't believe the incredible raves this travesty has received
I saw the original stage play in the mid-70's and it was nostalgic, understated and even a bit quaint by today's standards. This film exaggerates all of the story and characters. The only part I really liked was ""Summer days, summer nights"" which was staged beautifully and brilliantly. But the rest -- ugh!
Some reviewers did point out that all the ""teens"" were in their 20's and even 30's. This is not unusual -- remember 90210? Some did complain about the sexual innuendos, but what teen movie doesn't deal with sex? Teens have sex, whether their adults like it or not. It's part of growing up.
One other difference from the play is the slutty makeover of Sandy, which was not in the original.
Other gripes include the prom dance. What school would let girls in high heels dance of the gym floor? My high school dances were in the cafeteria with tile floors. And no high schoolers I ever knew danced like these kids. Much too choreographed to be real.
Sorry folks! This is just one, big bomb!",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

RE : I just don't get it,"GlenysThom , after reading your letter I'll try to help you the best I can.To start off with , from what it sounds like you're a little bit out of line from the way Sandy was dressed at the end of the movie. The reason she did this is because she had to change somehow and wanted to get Danny's attention once and for all. Listen to the song at the end of the car race. After all this time she had been a little church mouse and wasn't making any progress , she changed into a mountain lion that no one ever expected.As for Danny , the reason he treated her like he did at the football game is because he had a reputation to keep as a T - Bird like his buddies. Even when he was with them , at times you could tell she was on his mind.During the movie you could tell they had something for each other no matter what happened and wouldn't give up.As for the song , I'll have to agree with you but I didn't write it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Is there a better classic than this one?!?! Best musical ever!,"John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are the heart and soul of Grease. Their on-screen chemistry is pure dynamite. Travolta's Danny Zuko is the epitome of cool, and Newton-John's Sandy is the perfect balance of sweet and sassy. Their love story is a rollercoaster of emotions that'll make you root for them all the way.But let's talk about the real showstopper - the music! Grease boasts an iconic soundtrack that's nothing short of legendary. From ""Summer Nights"" to ""You're the One That I Want,"" every song is a timeless classic that'll get stuck in your head for days. The toe-tapping beats and catchy tunes are what make Grease an all-time favorite.Now, I know some people might argue that the film's portrayal of high school life is a bit exaggerated and unrealistic. But come on, it's Grease! It's meant to be a fun and nostalgic ride back to the '50s, complete with a touch of over-the-top drama. So, don't take it too seriously and just enjoy the fabulousness.The dance sequences are another highlight of the film. The choreography is energetic and infectious, making you want to jump up and dance alongside the cast. The hand jive scene is a total crowd-pleaser, leaving you grinning from ear to ear.In conclusion, Grease is a feel-good musical that's full of heart and nostalgia. The electric performances, unforgettable songs, and infectious energy make it a timeless classic that continues to charm audiences of all ages.If you're in the mood for a fun and fabulous movie night, Grease is the ultimate choice. It's a high-octane trip back to the '50s that'll leave you singing and dancing long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sometimes people need to change themselves to get the person they want to love them back.,"The main conflict of the movie has to do with Danny's true sensitive self conflicting with his masculine self. The entire plot of the movie could not have existed if Danny cared slightly less about his friends. Rizzo is judged by women and men in the movie for her promiscuity. However, I see a troubled girl trying to gain the confidence of her friends by showing she is one tough cookie. Sandy's transformation highlights a message that sometimes people need to change themselves to get the person they want to love them back.

To me this seems like it would be pretty fun.Now from the way I see it , this movie gives you a pretty good example of how kids would act and the way they dressed.

The silliness is very engaging.The story is simple, perhaps even formulaic. But it's the lighthearted and lively approach that makes it a masterful representative of its genre. It's campy, but in a good way, I'd say.Certain creative settings, like the sky or the workshop, were great. The choreography is neat. Nothing new can be said about the amazing and catchy songs.The casting decisions are horrible and hilarious because of the discrepancy between the fictional and real ages.

Greatest musical on film,"When I think musical I think of this movie. The music, the dancing, the acting is all top notch for a genre that can grow cheesy very quick.

I absolutely love There Are Worst Things I Could Do as well.I'd say the weakest part for me is the car race.

Busy and simple musical,"Inspired by and inspiring film successes like Pulp Fiction and many persons to sing songs at karaoke bars early in the night, expectations were high. Too high.First, the plot is razor-thin. Boy falls in love with girl, by chance they end up in the same school and try to get back together. Some other subplots develop, but they're not much more complicated than the main story.Second, the film is almost two hours of noise. There are no silent moments, and it's irritating. Dialogues follow each other up, and in between there's music. Even when the music plays, you are left wondering why and which background noises, like footsteps, are mixed in the audio.Third, the visual noise is giving headaches. The screen is always filled, often with colours that pain the eyes, and often with too many actors and extras.Fourth, acting is as thin as the plot. Almost no character development. Too many caricatures with no meaning. Humor that resembles too much to slapstick.So why give it five stars? Despite the excess of actors, choreography is very good. It must have taken a lot of time to put all those actors and extras in the right order. Also, a look at greaser culture was interesting, as well as the car scene in the sewers.If you're into busy, superficial musicals: give it a try. If not, just leave it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fun and exciting movie for everyone!  It's still the word!,"Grease is my favorite movie of all-time.  Stockard Channing deserves much praise for her role as Rizzo, which I think helped her acting to reach the peak.  The fifties are a popular time to focus on in the movie industry, but Grease is different.And although John Travolta broke windows in Summer Nights [at the very end], he carried himself as though he truly was a Greaser.And you believed it, all the way through. Anybody who has not seen this movie, go out right now and rent it. After the movie, it'll leave saying, ""Tell me more, tell me more, 'it was' love at first sight."" [from 'Summer Nights', Frenchie's solo, 'tell me more, tell me more, was it love at first sight?']I liked this movie because of the originality.  I havenever seen the Broadway show, but I believe Marty (sorry, but I don't remember the actress's name) and Danny (John Travolta) gave stunning performances, and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) was right up there with them.  The only thing I've seen slightly similar is Happy Days, an American television series in the 70's. Aaaay, the Fonz is still better, but Grease is the word!",,Anonymous,Romance
Still have every song memorized from my gatefold record album,"My middle schooler is super into Broadway musicals right now, so she, of course, had to see this classic. I don't know how many times I listened to my gatefold vinyl soundtrack album of this movie as a kid, but I probably could have sung along with every single musical number if I'd wanted to, but that may have negatively impacted my kids' enjoyment of the film. My main takeaway from this viewing is that ""Grease"" is WAY dirtier than I remembered. Not just innuendo, but there are some pretty overt racy jokes and conversations (I chose not to explain the ""flog your log"" joke). Regardless, it's a classic and a whole lot of fun, despite some really old-looking ""teenagers."" I think my main complaint about ""Grease"" is the dull subplots, which I never found all that interesting, even as a kid. The main Danny/Sandy storyline is solid and keeps you engaged, mostly because of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, but everything else is pretty dull. Overall ""Grease"" is an iconic must-see film for absolutely everyone.One aside, I've always been fascinated by director Randal Kleiser. He's a director who no one really seems to remember or give much regard to, yet he was responsible for two of the biggest blockbusters of the late 70s, this film (his feature film debut) and ""The Blue Lagoon"" two years later. That film isn't a classic and really isn't all that good, but it was wildly popular. He's probably forgotten because he didn't have any subsequent hits, but did consistently make entertaining films, including ""Flight of the Navigator,"" ""Big Top Pee-wee,"" and ""The North Shore"" (my favorite of his filmography).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's such a great musical film from Paramount starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, which Danny and Sandy themselves are likable, well-written and memorable characters that have perfect chemistry.

Too Cheesy. Too Sweet.,"Grease is a romantic musical movie that is about a teenage couple that meet each other and start a relationship, in a normal teenage way, if you know what I mean. It was a lot of singing, a lot of romance, basic music, but I just didn't like it. Something about the construction of the movie was bad. I think this movie could be much better, much more complete, and now I will tell you what was bad and why I didn't like it. First of all, the acting in this movie was so plastic and unrealistic, too sweet and too much ""I Love You"" and ""I Love You Too"" stuff, the songs were basically about the same, just about that you love me and I love you, too much of the same, it started too get boring in the end, the dancing scenes were too long, and the whole romance connection feeled to me not organic. One more thing. All of that teenage stuff and back to school stuff was so generic and unoriginal. They use all of that elements everyone use in that movies. It was very cheap, and you could see the low budget very clear in the movie. So if I have to be honest, nothing new, very boring, to cheesy and sweet, and not a rememberable movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Always a musical classic,"John and Olivia are at their best. I love the songs and the dancing, but there was one thing I didn't like.

It's fun . . . but it's a Nostalgia Ride for Me,"I remember the very first time I saw Grease. I was around the age of 7 or 8, and me and my family were on a road trip and we stopped I believe at a Walmart, and my parents saw Grease the movie there. They remembered how good it was, so they wanted me and my siblings to see it . . . And firs time watching it, it became a hit with us because after that we saw Grease more times than I could count, and Grease was always a movie choice for our road trips! Now 9 to 10 years later, I come back again to watch Grease, and let me say: it's a nostalgia ride for me because it brings back so my childhood when me and my siblings were into this movie and its songs!There were a lot of things in Grease that went over our head, but now older and I hope a bit wiser, none of it goes over my head. But I don't care how inappropriate it gets because the soundtrack, humor, and I guess even the story distracts me from it. And not to mention all the memories it brings backs when we were into Grease. Now a movie critic, I thought it was time to rewatch it to see how good it was. And to be honest, I really, really enjoyed my time with it The music were as good as ever (with an exceptional few I still dislike), and the characters are a whole lot of fun to be around.I like this movie because in some sort of shape, way, or form I can relate to these unmature high school kids. Because I'm still one, and I can relate in more than one way to them. They're just high school students hunting after girls, getting their heart break, and getting into some mischief if they can. At times it can be a feel-good movie because you can relate to these characters. Plus, the Grease characters are a whole lot of fun to be around. They crack me up, they make me be like, ""I so would have done it,"" and I approve at their underage drinking and all their smoking . . . Because they're just high school students who don't really know best.If you really come to think about it, the story is a bit of a cringe and predictable! I mean, a boy running back to regain a relationship he didn't exactly mean to brake with a girl . . . I mean, you know the outcome without having to watch all 1 hour 50 minutes of it. But what makes the story interesting is how it is told. It's told through some misfits, and humuores situations. It's a story that yeah, it may lose your interest but when we have high school students being themselves, it's hard to lose interest. The soundtrack is good in some respect; while there are some songs I dislike and could care less about, there are others are still awesome to hear and one that is my 1# Nostalgia song which is ""Grease!""Without a doubt, this movie has its fault whether I try to think about it or not. But what outweighs it in a lot of ways, is that this movie knows it has faults. But the writers/directors didn't want a pure perfection movie, they just wanted to protray high school kids as they are and not trying to do some professional thing, and for me it works! I like to see these high school students romp around, goof around, and go after every girl they see. It's just a blast to chill back and watch a simple, predictable story and see how it is going to unfold and lead you each time . . . Because this time, I had a whole lot of blast, and it was even a better ride than I thought because of nostalgic it turned out to be!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Grease is the Time, is the Place, is the Motiond","As I've written many times here, when it comes to musical adaptations to film, if I like the music and the dance, there's very little that can ruin the rest of it. With every rule, of course, there are always exceptions. As far as ""Grease"" is concerned, what's not to like?What never receives the credit that it deserves is the outstanding theme song, written by Barry Gibb and sung by my fellow Newarker, Frankie Valli. The song, a favorite of mine, establishes the upbeat tone of the rest of the film and should never be taken for granted. Speaking of Newark, when I grew up there in the 1950's and 60's, I always believed that we owned the patent on grease and black leather, but I must have been misinformed. I can understand competition from Chicago, the original locale for the story, but the southern California of the Mouseketeers, Annette Funicello, and the Beach Boys? That was a real shocker to me.Another surprise was a cast in which most of the members were twice as old as the average high school student. This may have had an initial weird vibe to it, but I suppose that they pulled it off in the end. Director Randal Kleiser may not have believed that a cast of 17-year-olds could produce the results that he desired. Having worked with teenagers in several stage musicals, that is completely understandable.Writing from the perspective of a child of the 1950's and 60's, a very welcome bonus to the music and the energy were appearances by a parade of icons of the era, including Joan Blondell, Eve ""Miss Brooks"" Arden, Sid Caesar, Alice Ghostley, Frankie Avalon, and Edd Byrnes. Is there anyone out there who remembers ""Kookie, Kookie, Lend Me Your Comb"", sung by another star of the era, Connie Stevens?While I agree that the message to teenage girls may be controversial, this is a film that one shouldn't take too seriously. As Olivia Newton-John herself has said, ""it's just a fun movie meant to entertain people. That's all."" I couldn't say it any better, and Dame Newton-John, without a doubt, was a true asset to this film. What a doll!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't even finish it.,"I usually love musicals, rom coms, old movies-they're great. Crybaby, Hairspray, I love them. But this... no gracias. I turned it on because we're dancing to some songs from it in my dance class. Turned it off after the Dance Off. It feels like a poorly written will they won't they where they justify the man being a dick as long as he apologizes.And the songs. Some of them genuinely go so hard, but can someone please explain what the purpose of Beauty School Dropout was ? I felt like I was high. I can really only see people who are fans of people such as Elvis justifying some of these songs. Like the Sandra Dee one ? When Sandy comes in at the end, I figured it would've been a plot point, but it was literally just: ""You're making fun of me ?"" ""Some people are so touchy."" And never even thought about again. Grease Lightning feels immature. What do you mean the entire point of that song was ""let's fix up your car so you get some"" ??I dunno, I just can't with this movie. Which was surprising, because I thought it'd be right up my alley.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
What's that on your hair?,"Do not take my tag-line as an insult.  I love this movie - it was one of the first musicals I ever saw.  It is definitely NOT the best musical ever made or filmed, however it ranks one with the very best.  When it was filmed in 1978 it was one of the last musicals to be filmed, so it was a magnificent finale to the musical film era.  The music is rocky and the dancing sequences are great.  It is very different from the soapy musicals of the 1950s, the story (as little as it has) is more realistic and it is set in an era very closer to us - 1959.  It was a great nostalgic movie of the rock 'n' roll era.",,Anonymous,Romance

Adults posing as teenagers! üôÑ,"Definitely not a film for men!! And how did the producers think that 30 year old adults could pass off as teenagers, I'll never know. üôÑ If you like a film totally based on dancing and singing, this is a film for you. But as a straight male, I definitely had no interest in watching this film. It reminds me of a musical version of a James Dean film, based around the same time. The name of the film I cannot remember. This is a film that has bad acting, poor singing and crappy dancing. I don't know how it was a hit film at the time. Maybe it was the storyline that got it through. Even John Travolta's sister got a part in it, as one of the diner waitresses.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Love 'Grease' Every Time I Watch It,"GREASE **** I fall in love with 1978's 'Grease' every time I watch it. With its energetic formula that depicts the 1950s era of dance, music, and love, the quirky moments and irresistible charm that make this motion picture coming-of-age - no matter how far ahead we move in our lives - it never ceases to be a classic entertainment. After they meet and enjoy a tender summer romance, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John tearfully part. Unbeknownst to him, Olivia becomes the new girl at his high school. But when he comes to this understanding, his Mr. Tough Guy image around his friends creates quite a turbulent relationship between him and her. Stockard Channing, Jeff Conaway, Barry Pearl, Michael Tucci, Kelly Ward, Didi Conn, Jamie Donnelly, and Dinah Manoff make up the delightful supporting cast. None of the players could be better.",,Anonymous,Romance
Rockin' in the 50s,"In Grease, directed by Randal Kleiser, a girl named Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) came from Australia to the Stated for the summer.  She met a guy named Danny (John Travolta).  She planned on going back when school started, but her family had a change of plans.  They ended up staying in America.  On the first day of school, she met Frenchy (Didi Conn) and her friends called the Pink Ladies.  Sandy became friends with all of them. When Sandy saw Danny at a prep ralley, they both were excited to see each other.  She realized when his friends would be around; he acted totally different than he did over the summer at the beach.  He acted like a bad ass around his friends called the T-Birds. Two young teenagers fell in love over the summer.  It tears them apart when one had to go back home.  The director is trying to show how teenagers act and fall in love in the 50s.  Teenagers act totally different now. The movie ended up being the way the viewer wanted it to.  The viewer also got a chance to listen to the different kind of music from the 50s.",,Anonymous,Romance

Grease,"Grease is my all time favourite film, I have seen it so many times I literally know the songs and actions word for word. I could watch it a countless number of times more and still not get bored of it and i even have the sound track. (gulp)But the thing that I am not happy about is the rumours of 'Grease 3'. Grease was a classic, as many other films were, Grease rocketed the cinema's and was voted number 2 in the top 100 musicals ever. So why revisit the the story, totally defeating the object of Grease 1 living happily ever after.The point of a film, it is a unique story and plot which grasps audience's attention as a fresh film is produced, and keeps the interest through-out cinemas, However, revisiting and trying to mould and carry on a storyline that has already brilliantly ended?",,Anonymous,Romance
As Good As Musicals Get!,"I'm tired of some people trying to make every film out to be Shakespeare. No, it isn't the deepest plot ever seen on Celluoid, nor with the world's greatest actors. ""Grease"" is simply the greatest musical of all-time! When judging a film I think it's important to figure out what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish. It's obvious they set out to create a nostalgic love story with catchy, memorable songs, and likable characters. I think they achieved on all three.If you are one of the six people on Earth that haven't seen ""Grease"" it centers around the story of a bunch of friends going to high school in 1959. John Travolta is Danny Zuko, the leader of the T-Birds. The leather-jacket wearing, slick haired, tough guys of the school. After spending the summer with a girl named Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) he must return back to Rydell High, where to his surprise, is reunited with Sandy. The rest of the story is Danny's attempt to win back Sandy, his gang's attempt at fixing up an old car to race against another gang, and the National Bandstand Dance-Off, being broadcast live from Rydell.""Grease"" is basically a feel-good, 50's tale about the adventures of a group of high school kids. Every actor was great at their part, and I disagree with anyone who says they looked older. I mean with the exception of Stockard Channing, all those guys could pass for 18. ""Grease"" paints a picture of a simpler time, when there were malt shops, leather-jackets, and dance-offs.

Sewage,"Phoney-baloney movie critics like me know very well that our opinions are usually only important when we torque someone off.Prepare yourself--I'm about to feel important.Grease is a fecal remnant of a movie, a messy, unfunny, glob of excrement masquerading as nostalgia, love story, and musical. For all the reasons the great horde of Grease-lovers love it, I find it revolting. It's pop-culture without the fizz, a high-concept, sanitized inanity based on a rough and raunchy Broadway play.I remember sitting there in the theatre, grimacing and squirming as if a movie had somehow morphed into a hemorrhoid. To add to my discomfort was my idiot sister, sitting beside me and idiot-grinning as if Jesus himself had donned a Fonzie outfit and had begun warbling with Olivia Newton-Magdelene.There is simply nothing I can say about this effluvia other than . . .Grease is the turd.",,Anonymous,Romance

One of the few musicals I can watch,"I dislike the musical genre. Silly choreography blending with silly scenes. Usually means a transport for some singer who can't possibly act, but at least can sing. Yet, in Grease these scenes are somehow less distracting.Rewatching this movie made me think of its script and execution. This is not the regular studio fare where we have an opera play on multiple stages. It certainly feels less theatrical and more natural. And the cues are simple, almost childish, but effective. This way the message gets through even if there are strong cultural differences.I also liked the side stories. In a puritan America that still damns the contraception you have the ""easy"" Rizzo saying to hell with the condom and than the probable pregnancy. It would have been the usual moralist undertones if the girl leaves with a boy only to let the audiences find out later that she is pregnant.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",,Anonymous,Romance
I love this movie!!,"Grease is one of my all time favourite movies! Why? I really don't know - Grease just has this amazing quality that makes it watchable, ridiculous yet somehow believable, and most of all, downright entertaining! It's such great fun to watch - although some of the raunchier scenes (namely THAT scene with Rizzo & Kenickie in the car!) may be embarrassing for the whole family to watch, most of the bad language and sexual innuendo in this movie will go right over young kids' (and even some adults'!!) heads! The acting is great, with the whole cast appearing to have a very enjoyable time making the movie, which adds to the whole 'fun' feel of the movie! The chemistry between cool tough guy Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and the sweet and innocent Sandy (Olivia Newton John) is electric, but Stockard Channing as bad girl Rizzo is definitely the stand-out - she adds a serious, but not depressing note to the movie, as well as having some brilliant one-liners! The supporting cast is also impressive, with some genuinely funny characters, who all exude an adorable sweetness, however cool and tough they might try to be!! The songs are also great, and I defy you not to sing along or tap your feet to infectious numbers such as Summer Nights and that karaoke classic, You're the One that I Want! Overall, this is a great movie that is hugely enjoyable to watch, and if you haven't seen it already (where have you been for the last 20-something years??) rent it now - Grease IS the word!!",,Anonymous,Romance
A sappy but good film,"This film is obviously one of the earliest and original american teen comedies and in my opinion, it is one of the best ones yet. This movie is set on the west coast of America in the 1950s. It is set around the timeless story of summer love and then the inevitable parting but in this case, Sandy( Olivia Newton John) doesn't leave her summer love Danny(John Travolta) but instead, decides to move into his neighbourhood and descend on his school. Unfortunately, Sandy discovers that Danny is not the boy she spent her summer with. The costumes and hair styles in this film are utterly classic; giving the movie an almost vintage atmosphere and the props, such as the old cars, bring back hundreds of memories for your grandparents and other older relatives bringing a real family feel to the film. Grease is honestly one of those films that no one ever tires of as it is completely timeless and classic and I must say that this has been proven by the thousands and thousands of people who recently went out to see it in the cinema when it was re-released last year so remember:Grease rules!",,Anonymous,Romance

"Shh, don't tell anyone, but...","The best kept secret of every school drama teacher in the English speaking world.  Find an uncensored version, forgive the dodgy sexual politics, patchy musical numbers and shaky production values, and just grin yourself sick at the deliciously smutty lines, gestures and inuendo, delivered - as Riz would say - with relish.The legacy of Grease can be seen clearly in Gen X shows like Buffy and (to a lesser extent) Clueless.  The acting is naturalistic and underplayed, packed full of attitude without resorting to hammy mugging; the smart and smutty lines are delivered so casually that they slip right under the radar of network censors and twitchy parents; and perhaps not coincidentally, the cast is largely way too old for their roles.The wonderfully salacious Stockard Channing in particular is clearly having a ball playing a teenager at the ripe old age of 34, and again this fine tradition has been carried on by actresses such as Charisma Carpenter (Buffy, Angel) and Stacey Dash (Clueless).  As an aside, how scary is it that Jeff Conaway hasn't aged a day since 1978?  I suspect he's been preserved by his liberal coat of hair grease.It's easy to write Grease off as a ""dumb musical"".  Do it and you're really missing out on a sly and knowing treat.  Another quote from Riz to sum up: Grease is just peachy keen.",,Anonymous,Romance

It's stupid, but it's fun.My favorite in the film was always Betty Rizzo (Stockard Channing) and her song, ""There are worst things I could do"".

Magic!,"The fact that I'm a sucker for musicals may have an effect on me, but GREASE IS THE WORD, and it ALSO IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE. From the first second of this movie I was totally pleased, and that isn't a feeling I get very often when I watch a movie. The intro is hilarious for us who are familiar with John Travolta from movies in the 90's. He's just looks like a total dork and I couldn't stop laughing. Then the opening credits hit me and I am totally paralyzed. The rest of the movie is nothing I can put my word on, when it comes to entertainment, that is. Too bad that the directing doesn't hold up all the way.But who cares? Not me anyhow, with the unstoppable cast, coreography, sets and those gorgeous SONGS!!!! When I first heard ""Summer Nights"" in this movie I was in exile, I was that pleased. But, then again, I'm a sucker for musicals. So the directing might be too ""ordinal"" to make this a 10-pointer, sure it's one of the most entertaining movies ever (I think) but direction lacking is a big minus. Very often wrecks an entire film. But not here. Why? Many reasons. One of them is terrific cast. Travolta is just too cool and still so extra-ordinary dumb (that hou-hou-hou laugh for instance) and Olivia Newton-John is so very, very ""Sandra Dee"" and with that accent in the middle of hyper-americans it's too great. Sidecast involving... everybody, is over the top. Kenickie and Rizzo were the best of that bunch, he was incredible in his Danny Zuko-wannabe style it had to be given credit. Rizzo was a bitch that wasn't annoying, only that is a 10.The script doesn't involve that much things, but it's better than the directing and it holds up perfectly to the rest of the movie's materials. Over to music. This is, together with acting, the best thing in the movie. Every single little song in this movie (even the Sandra Dee-reprise) is worth a 10. They are just so incredibly great it drives me crazy. Overall a very good movie, with the two ending numbers (You're the one that I want, We Go Together) that made me high.I give it 8.5, and nine, maybe even ten stars if the direction was just as spectacular.",,Anonymous,Romance

It's not an earth shattering special effect hyper flick, it's not over flowing with great emotion... it's just FUN.The only really negative thing I can think to say about this movie is that it spawned a sequel.....

It's gradually good.,"It actually took me a number of years to watch 'Grease' in its entirety.  I first saw it many years ago but never did I get the chance to finish it. Needless to say it took about four or five more tries until I saw the whole thing.  Personally, it's the kind of movie that is bad at first, but by a couple of full screenings, it's good.Well, I like it now.  The cast is great, the songs are fun and addicting, and the singing and the dancing (but specifically the singing because some of those actors just could not sing even though I like ALL of them) are a little weak but I guess there has to be a low point to every movie.John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are perfect together.  They make a perfect team.  I know that they're the main characters, but I've got to really hand it to the entire cast because this is one of those casts that just clicks.  Everybody is wonderful, even those actors with the tiniest of roles.While the plot is a little iffy, it somehow pulls through probably because of all those entertaining dance/sing sequences.  All of those scenes are choreographed and performed well.  And you know what?  Any movie that leaves a song, or in this case, a number of songs, in my head well after the film has ended is okay by me.  Yeah, it's a little annoying how there ARE so many darn songs throughout 'Grease', but that's what makes it good, I suppose.Everything else such as set decoration (yes, I have to point that out because it looked very good), and the actual writing, though limited due to the movie actually being a musical, were great.It's safe to say that I like 'Grease.'  I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's one of the best movies ever made, but it is good.  It took me a while to finally watch the whole thing, but I'm glad I did because it's...fun.",,Anonymous,Romance
