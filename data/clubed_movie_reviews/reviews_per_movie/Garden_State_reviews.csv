Revisited this gem from my teenage years,"I grew up watching this movie in the 2000s, loved it then, and just recently re-watched it for the first time in many years. Definitely feels like a mid 2000s movie. Wow how times have changed. It's still a great movie, whose best scenes are mostly the ones with Peter Sarsgaard. I miss movies like this so much, sad that Hollywood doesn't seem to make them anymore, those introspective arthouse films that defined the teenhood of so many of us growing up in the 2000s.I just recently got into listening to Hugo Kant's music, that kept reminding me of Garden State, so I had to revisit the movie, and it brought back so many memories of my life back then, what I wanted to do, and how life has just kind of drifted along these past several years.I long for travel again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Garden State,"This movie was incredible. As a massive fan of light romance 80's movies and old action films, I absolutely fell in love. The plot was no where near heavy, the characters were inspirational and once again, Natalie Portman's cute and quirky character played a massive roll in the beauty of this movie. The story, though containing heavy content to do with the death of Zach's mother, managed to stay subtle and tenuous keeping the comedy theme going. An incredible piece and a must watch to all that have the chance to witness the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""True Stories from Suburbia""","""Garden State"" has a very specific brand of humor that not everyone is going to get immediately. But as writer/director/star Zach Braff says in the bonus interview, ""Is it funny? {Interviewer says yeah} Good. I never know if anyone else is going to find them funny. If nothing else, I'm making a movie that I'll enjoy.""And that's why this movie works. In comedy, the worst thing you can do is try too hard to be funny. ""Garden State"" falls squarely in subtle, almost deadpan territory... meaning there aren't any big sight gags, slapstick or knockout punchlines.In that respect I'd put it in the genre of ""movies like Bill Murray would act in"" except there's no Bill Murray. I'm referring to flicks like Coffee & Cigarettes, Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic, which is essentially saying it's like a Wes Anderson film, or maybe Terry Zwigoff (Ghost World, Art School Confidential). There's a lot of visual storytelling, as in quirky symmetrical shots, stationary cameras on meticulously arranged sets, or a surreal vibe punctated by the camera slowly rising into the sky.The story is something like famed French existentialist Albert Camus would write if he did comedy. A late-20s, emotionless, estranged son (Zach Braff) returns to his hometown to bury his mother. He seems devoid of all sentimentality as he wanders around meeting all sorts of crazy (and I mean crazy) characters from his past. Whether he's being nearly shot to death by an overenthusiastic cop, or molested by a hot blonde at a party, his range of emotion barely budges between bored and slightly perplexed. Then he meets his antithesis, a 20-something girl (Natalie Portman) whose range of emotion is somewhere between very amused and insanely happy.It's the delightful contrast between these 2 characters, and their great on-screen chemistry, that turns an otherwise brooding sarcastic comedy into a really entertaining treat.Another thing that really defines this film is the way every character, even the minor ones who only have 1 scene, are so bizarre and interesting that you feel like an entire movie spinoff could be made of each one. These characters include: 1) the grave digger who makes his real living by doing questionable things at the hardware store; 2) the grave digger's hot mom who is sleeping with her son's sworn enemy from high school; 3) the kid who got rich from inventing ""silent velcro"" and who now spends his time doing absolutely nothing; 4) the West African immigrant who is studying criminal justice and is obsessed with figuring out which dog is pissing on his phone; 5) the strange ""Guardian of the Abyss"" whom I won't spoil for you; and the list goes on.The second half of the story focuses on a bizarre suburban quest the 3 main characters undertake, almost like in ""Stand by Me"" but with grownups and maybe a pornographic peepshow or two (btw the location of the climactic scene, ""Kiernan's Quarry"", is a real place--or at least it was until it got filled in & converted to condos a few years ago).But as strange and nonsensical as it sounds, these are in fact ""true stories from suburbia"" as Zach Braff says. The entire film is a compilation of stories that happened to him and others in his small Jersey town growing up. ""Garden State"" has a magical way of bringing these seemingly random vignettes to our attention, making us understand the epic nature of obscurity.So no, there may not be crazy car chases, bank heists or wacky jewel capers (...oh wait, actually there sorta is 1 wacky jewel caper), this film delivers a really entertaining ride from start to finish.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A blooming, Wonderful Garden State!","'Garden State' came out in the Uk on December 10th. I had heard wonderful things about it from friends and relatives in the US - I wasn't disappointed...From start to finish, the film made me laugh and cry. I thought the opening in which we met Braff lying emotionless in bed. Listening to the answer machine message from his dad about his mother's death was disturbing and really drew me in.So many memorable moments: The funeral, touching and funny, the party scenes, the scan scene...And as for the dialogue - well, sharp and witty. I don't think I will ever forget Natalie Portman's dancing in her bedroom - just to be 'unique' or Zach Braff's touching comments about what makes a 'home' in the swimming pool.Even those touching moments were funny; the fact that he couldn't swim!As a mid twenty-something, This film really spoke to me. It's that question we all dread. We've graduated university, got jobs....then what?Fantastic...just a shame it is not on wide release here...One of the best films I have seen in ages!9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Unpolished Movie With Blatant First-Timer Mistakes,"Perhaps the most notable and visible issue with this film is the narrative structure. The writing is done in a sort of encounter-to-encounter style, like a layman's Odyssey. I feel though that this is not a result of a specific film styling but rather poor writing on the part of Zach Braff, who, mind you, is not the Epstein brothers (of Casablanca fame) but rather a TV actor who is breaking into the big screen for the first time. As a result, plot weaving becomes non-existent, and character development, even in the case of Large (the main character) is shallow and doesn't really show much change, or rather, the script doesn't provide an opportunity for change. When he then has an epiphany at the end of the film, a terribly contrived moment, he praddles off everything that he already knew as if it were terribly profound, and the moment entirely misses.Also, characters, specifically Large, seem to go off on philosophical tangents which are neither profound nor insightful, but seem to be what he really wants the audience to derive from his movie. In this classic case of ""Telling"" instead of ""showing,"" I personally was annoyed as I felt that as an intelligent viewer I didn't need to be spoon-fed these ideas but rather, as in any well-written movie or literary piece, could have derived them from the work itself without them being thrown into my face.Please keep in mind that this was something of a Devil's advocate opinion as I did enjoy parts of the film, and certainly recommend it above most of the other films in theaters now.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
life is a state of mind,"First off, for anyone thinking about seeing this movie, go do it!! No matter what anyone has told you already about the film. I notice a lot of people writing that they didn't like Garden State and that's fine, I personally thought it was excellent. To me it was real life on film, and within that real life there are very different people. Unfortunately not everyone wants to see movies that remind them of reality, and I guess not everybodies reality is the same as mine. Even so Garden State is well worth the watching, if only to remind us that the comatose state most of us live in is only temporary, and the joy of a life well lived is forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A backseat drive,"The movie feels like a long drive in the backseat. There is some good music, a bit of good dialogue with the driver an scenery to see. You can feel some chemistry between the Couple in the front seats, but in the and it just takes you from A to B.While the plot unfolds in a thoughtful and sophisticated manner, it just goes where you expect it to go. It is a movie with some good camerawork, great music and subtile moments, but it is just a bit too straightforward.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful Effort From First Time Writer/Director Zack Braff,"I really loved this movie.  I mean, really.  So it surprised me to come here and find it rated so low.By no means is this a perfect movie.  It can be slow or awkward from time to time and there are one or two moments that just don't work.  But.  By and large I was really impressed.It's a great little story with just the right balance of comedy and drama, full of quirky characters and interesting performances.  Ian Holm demands attention, as always, and Natalie Portman's Sam, while offputting at first, definitely grew on me as she grew into a real character.But the real story here is Zack Braff.  It should surprise no one who has ever watched Scrubs that his performance keeps the movie together; or that he is able to create a jokey, distant, somewhat sarcastic character who also elicits real empathy from the audience and manages to emanate deep wounds. What amazes me is the work he has done here as a first time writer/director.First off, there is an actual narrative here with meaning and relevance. Too often, the big Hollywood movies will have a plot that resolves itself, but means nothing; on the flip side, independent movies almost seem to disdain plot for mood and thematic concerns.  Braff is able to weave both together--a difficult task for a young writer.  The dialogue is witty, plot situations intelligent and creative, and overall the writing is just--good.As for his directing, there are a few odd choices.  I'm still not sure I like one scene the main characters are screaming into a deep ravine and the camera sweeps away into said ravine.  It just tossed me out of the movie a bit.  I'm also not completely sure what to make of the movie's ending, which I won't go into further except to say that I felt it almost changed the focus of the movie up to that point and made it about something else. However, there are moments of absolutely beauty as well, here.  The entire scene where Sam and Andrew talk in his friend's pool has some great shots, and Braff's comedic flair and timing are evident in his directing style, which still manages to pull back for the more dramatic and poignant moments.I urge you to see this movie.  It's not a ""big"" movie.  It was never meant to be.  But I have little doubt that, once it finds an audience, it will be remembered for years to come.  Sort of a modern day Graduate with a more hopeful outlook on life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet Film, Killer Soundtrack","I first heard about this film from The Shins. James Mercer mentioned this film in an interview and talked about how it raised awareness for the band. I decided to watch this movie only because of this, and I actually thought it was pretty sweet. I like the contrast between Andrew's junkie friends and Sam's innocent, loving family. You can really see how much the colors change from depressing browns and whites to warm reds and yellows. I think Zach Braff did a great job directing the film in that sense. Braff also did a good job playing Andrew. He really portrayed the numb mindlessness of Andrew, and really changed throughout the film. I like how we see Andrew go back to that numb mindless state when he is waiting on the plane after leaving Sam. It really goes to show how much he needs her. Overall, the film was very well made and the soundtrack is gold. I was elated when I heard an acoustic version of ""Such Great Heights"" by the Postal Service playing at one point. I didn't know how versatile Natalie Portman was as an actress until watching this movie She played Sam very well and was one of the highlights for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I really got it,"Movies with guns, explosions, Barbie/ken romance... You know the drill. They can be good films, but it's rare I ever relate to those movies.I *really* related to this movie - both the main character played by Zach, and the pure concept and analogy on display here. This film earns itself a place in my DVD collection upon release for the sheer fact it matches my 20-something experience to a huge degree, and all the feelings along the way.Normally films such as this tend to end up becoming ""coming of age"" stories - this isn't. It's simply about living life, but not knowing why you are living it.An excellent film on many levels - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"We all have dreams, I know I do","This was almost the perfect movie. The acting was great, the direction was great, the script was brilliant, and the location shoots were perfect. Probably the most amazing thing about this movie was the screen stealing show stopping performance of Natalie Portman. She showed this brilliance in ""Leon"" aka ""The Professional"", and once again amazed with her talent. It contains different humour to your usual American movie and was a needed hit in the movie circles of 2004.My only problem was a little part of the story that seemed out of place and not needed. This is not a spoiler, it is his friends wealth and invention. They just seemed unnecessary to me. This is a minor complaint and I eagerly anticipate Zach's next work. He could quite possibly end out being more famous behind the camera than in front of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good film, Great directing","This is a really watchable film from a great new young director. Zach Braff, you may well know from the brilliant scrubs, writes and directs this very competent film. Basically it is a simple plot about a few days in the life of a man coming back to his home town for his mums funeral. Anyway what is really interesting in this film is the relationships between characters especially Zach's character and his dad and between Zach and Natalie Portman's character. There is a lot of quirky humour and surreal daydreams that can be seen as a direct influence from scrubs. If you liked Donnie Darko you should enjoy this, yet if also if you thought Donnie Darko was a pile of sentimental, surreal dross you should find that this is a much better and more 'real' film.This is a film well worth watching",,Anonymous,Romance
Good? Yes. One of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time? Hardly!,"Garden State is an entertaining and downright visually stunning piece of film-making by Zach Braff. It is both painfully sad and hysterical, and overly melodramatic cheesiness is always interrupted at the perfect time by comic relief, usually delivered by Natalie Portman's character. And, as other users have noted, it does speak to my generation; as a 24-year-old I am at that stage where home is no longer the same, and there's an abyss in front of me that I'm terrified to face since I have no idea what's in it.With that said, Garden State's screenplay is flawed to the point of being patronizing. The movie succeeds and has been so well-received because it plays off the emotions and experiences of all 20-somethings, but it does so with a great deal of half-hearted philosophizing that tries way too hard to make a point about life that just isn't insightful. Yeah, life is hard, but you're off your drugs, you're in love, and, aside from your mother dying, you really don't have any problems. You're in your 20's, and there's lots to figure out but it will happen in time, so stop obsessing over it! And the end, my God, the end! Without giving anything away, the ending of this movie is the worst kind of forced dramatic tension and predictably melodramatic resolution when there is just no dramatic tension coming from the story itself. We know that Andrew Largeman has a flight back to LA that he has to get on, but why is it such a big deal for him to go back to LA? Is his life there really so important that he can't stay in NJ with Sam? There is just no dramatic energy to create the tension that the character seems to be facing; it just comes out of nowhere as a vehicle for Largeman to spout off some final words of quasi-philosophical self-evident baloney. His life is not that bad, and the decision is not as hard as Braff wants it to be.So, this movie gets a 5 from me. It is beautiful, the acting is superb, and it does speak to me. But it tries way too hard and the plot and drama ultimately fail to deliver.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very impressed,I would give Garden State a 9 out of 10. The only reason I'm not giving it a perfect 10 is b/c it had a slow start. Besides that this movie overwhelmingly surprised me with its directing and acting. Natatlie Portman did an amazing job playing Sam. She really worked the part. Zach Braff's directing debut is stunning. I had never heard of Braff except for his character on the TV show Scrubs. He also did an excellent job acting. There were so many surprising elements thrown out during the movie. Braff just kept piling one thing on top of the next to make the story more interesting as it rolled on. I was very pleased with Garden State!!!!!!!!!11,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film is given too much praise,"To me The Garden State is a film which tries too much to be artistic. Some scenes with some coldplay/Keane music in the background don't make a movie artistic.I have the feeling that I know what director and writer Zach Braff wanted to do, but he failed by wanting it too much. This movie looks likes a nice, artistic, honest movie about a young man who returns to his home after nine years and discovers himself. The strange characters, his old friends, put in the humour. But the story is too cliché. As are the dialog. The dialog aren't good enough to keep my attention. The dialog want to learn us about live or should be romantic, but they aren't. Come on, I've seen this in other movies a hundred times.I will try to explain it:When I watched this movie I had the feeling I had seen it all before, but then slightly different. Of course almost every movie has this, but in this movie I couldn't get rid of this feeling. I also had the feeling that the scenes with the music and the shots of Jersey were too much planned. It didn't really add much to the story. It is a movie that is written to be special instead of just being special. And not only that, the story isn't good enough to get away with the things I said above. That is why it has failed in my opinion. I don't understand why it has such a high rating here on IMDb.It is not a bad movie, but it is not as good as the voters on IMDb say.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quirky comedy about a quirkily comedic everyman returning to his home town.,"I had high hopes for this, what with Scrubs being consistently hilarious, well-observed and occasionally moving. Sad to say this isn't even half way there.Although in the guise of an offbeat indie film, this never feels authentic, and can be grouped alongside those other contrived pass-offs - The Secretary or Chocolat. This isn't in the same league as Donnie Darko or Happiness.It all seems a little too by the numbers, lacking any real insight, as it desperately tries to wear its kooky credentials on its sleeve. Natalie Portman's excruciatingly overwrought turn JUST HAD to be pushed way beyond the realm of credibility with the liar's tick or the hamster run in the house. Zack JUST HAD to get around via an old army bike and sidecar combo. His friends JUST HAD to include a wacked out grave-digger, a feckless millionaire and a charmless pyramid scammer.Now I have nothing against gentle whimsy, but it upsets me when there were glimpses of a much better film here. A nice opening half hour with good visual riffs on lack of communication and stifling conformity. But when the lead actor / writer / director falls for the perky, Portman pixie the whole things descends into idle wish fulfilment.Rather give me the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to see two properly fleshed out characters written and performed with acres more indie credibility.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great little movie, great acting by Natalie and Peter","A very promising film debut by Zach Braff.The plot isn't all that original, the movie isn't all that flawless, but ""Garden State"" has a unique and sincere quality which make it totally differ from other flicks. In short, this movie is ""real"" and sensational.Let's not forget about the acting. Zach was lucky enough to have two of the very best young actors starring in his movie: Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard. Especially Nat Portman, her Sam is so lovable that I just want to give her a big huge. Her smile lights up the screen. NP's character and acting are definitely the highlights of ""Garden State"".8 out of 10. Very touching.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"OK, but somewhat over-hyped","There's nothing wrong with Garden State. It's a competent film that delivers a gentle, if somewhat awkwardly laid-out plot. There are times when you'll be wondering what the relevance of several scenes are, and other times when your attention will wander.But mostly it rewards the perseverance of its viewers with its ending which, although horribly predictable and Hollywoodey, still manages to raise a smile.But Garden State does suffer from hype. A full half of all IMDb votes rate this a 10. Maybe I saw a different version of the film, but I doubt it. There's a growing trend of ""following the loudest voice"" when it comes to rating movies (and I don't mean just on IMDb, but generally in all reviews). People will read a review and think that the film must be good simply because someone else said so, and rate the movie accordingly, even though they privately might not have rated it that highly. Oh well, I guess that's how the Academy Awards work anyhow.I won't say Garden State is entirely a feel-good movie either. At times it's a feel-bored movie, but not that often. Neither is it a comedy. It has it's moments, but they are not laugh-out-loud moments so much as snigger-and-chuckle moments.In short, it's a movie that isn't certain what it wants to be. A mixed bag that does none of its elements proper justice. A Jack-of-all-Trades movies that, ultimately, doesn't satisfy as well as it could have.But, that said, its a very good first effort from Zach Braff and miles better than ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" - Clooneys first effort. So not all first efforts suck. And Braff is heading towards superstardom, whether he wants (or knows) it, or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful gem hidden in the Garden State,"This is a movie about youth, about the past memories, it's about how growing up can be difficult. It's about searching your own identity when compared to others and finding yourself and who you are in the path of life. It's about being different than the others; and still finding yourself and a satisfying path to walk in life. It's about being sometimes odd and weird but still being accepted and lovable. It's about finding the lost connections and friends of childhood and reviving and reliving those connections. It's about seeing how different roads life can take each one of us once we hit the adulthood, and how everyone makes their own decisions. It's about painful memories of the past and gaining acceptance and peace with them. It's all about life itself, sometimes difficult and bittersweet, but also having undeniably beautiful moments in it.I am one of those who would fit to the life timeline of the main characters in the movie. Although I don't live in the States so although some of it is different (no drug or excess alcohol use here among young people), this movie reminded me of my youth. I grew to adulthood in early half of 2000's and I could find myself in these characters in broader sense. How beautiful depiction of the stories of these characters.Excellent performances by the main actors/actress. Especially Peter Sarsgaard is excellent in his role in this movie, I've grown a huge fan of his work. I would definitely recommend to see this movie. There's a wonderful gem hidden in the Garden State.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"This movie proves why we all live life, and it does it very well.","Garden State is a wonderfully made movie with extreme talent. Zach Braff directs, writes, and stars in this movie. And it is his debut movie as a director and a writer and he couldn't have done better. If you are looking for a stupid movie where you really don't have to think about anything, avoid this. But if you want to see a movie that can possibly change your life, then see it. The Main Reasons I liked it were:1. The screenplay, the writing in here is brilliant. Everything is memorable.2. The acting. Especially Natalie Portman. She took my breath away. I have to say she is the next talent to look for, with this movie and CLoser she is sure to be an A list star. And if it wasn't for Closer this performance would give her a supporting actress Oscar.3. The memorable scenes. I have to put this because there are many that i walk out and will remember again. This is a great romance. From the beginning Dog Licking-Doctor's Office scene to the Most uniquely original thing in this one spot, to the yelling into the open canyon, and then the very end. That is the most memorable romantic scene all year.4. The Soundtrack. The soundtrack almost made the movie what it is. It brought it from great to greater. Especially the songs they play during Natalie's screen time.This movie is by far the best of the year, and it teaches you about life, and love, and when to take risks. So to sum this up in about 2 words SEE IT. It will change your life. (The Shins- no pun intended).I Recommend seeing it if you Liked Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or if you like this see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Angst Justified,"The desire to be pretentious and different has hit young people like a plague, and Garden State is merely the newest strain. The film can easily be broken down into two categories, one being Natalie Portman and the other being Everything Else.As a whole it is a sadly embarrassing film that seems to somehow justify the angst that is common to most everyone's teenage years, years that most also grow out of. Were I given the ability to write, direct, and star in a film at the age of fourteen, it probably would have turned out quite the carbon copy of Garden State.Ian Holm is forced into a role that is so shallow and static that it could have been performed by any older male with ability to frown. Of course, the older male would have not even needed to frown if he simply wore a sandwich board sign declaring ""I'm the dad. I'm emotionally distant. I'm the bad buy.""Braff, being a bit older than fourteen, realizes he has to contrive a need to justify this angst. Improper medicating. This would have been acceptable if the film made it out to be more than a shoe-horned plot device. However, it resurfaces seemingly at random, and the emphasis isn't on WHY someone would do this to their son, but that fact that the son can now LEGITIMATELY be angst-ridden.Which sets the stage for the rest of the movie's downfalls. Scenes seem to be forced along, painfully at times, to simply deliver lines of dialogue so awkward that the desire to look away and blush is almost overwhelming. The rhyme and reason of the film is simply ""That happened so that this could happen."" It is not the fulfilling flow ""This happened BECAUSE of these stimuli."" Poor writing.The saving grace? Natalie Portman. She's winning and likable, quirky but not alienatingly so. You WANT to love her, which judging by the rest of the characters, is directly her fault and not that of the writer/director.With the trite teen comedy/romance ending, this film rapes any further indie dignity it seems to carry, but if you were a discerning viewer it came as no surprise. Yet sadly, it's hailed as genius, and delightfully outside the mainstreem.It's a sad state of affairs when this could somehow, at this moment, be in the top 250 movies of all time.There are better movies out that are pretty easy to get at your rental place. If you're looking for legitimate characters that are engaging yet quirky, proceed directly to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. If you're looking for an engaging romance/comedy flick, go straight to Lost in Translation.But please, don't stop in Garden State.",,Anonymous,Romance

A gentle reminder that everyday life isn't as bad as it seems.,"My first exposure to Garden State occurred six years before I would actually see the film. My older sister had just bought the soundtrack and was in love with it. Already a huge movie fan, I was interested immediately in seeing it. However, I wouldn't end up seeing Garden State until the first few days of 2011. After waiting all that time, my expectations were quite high and I almost feared that it would not live up to my hopes. I had nothing to fear. The Zach Braff that I knew from Scrubs was gone. Sure, he was still very funny. In this film, though, he was different. Braff's writing and direction demonstrate a high maturity and understanding of what we all go through that I would never have guessed he had in him. Natalie Portman embodies the role of Sam so well that I think I might be in love. Yeah, she was good in Black Swan. She was BETTER in this. When half of the films out of Hollywood lead us to believe that one can only achieve happiness through epic quests and magic, subtle works of art like Garden State exist to remind us that life is in fact wonderful. Thank you, Mr. Braff.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Your basic movie trying hard to be original,"This movie is well-intentioned, but it ends up really falling in line with your basic movie... not necessarily a bad thing.One reason why I say this is that movie stands stalwart behind it's two main characters. During the course of the movie they are inspirational, whimsical and seemingly never wrong, yet somehow they have highly-checkered pasts. They also conveniently don't spend enough time together to get into the guts of what their relationship would be like... a sort of post-Sleepless-in-Seattle phenomenon that this movie does nothing to break away from.Of course there must be an enemy, in this case it is his father. I don't understand why he is made to play the villain. It is certainly not necessary. The character is designed to have excellent inner-conflict and motivation for his actions, he's also played by a fantastic actor, yet he is made to be a cold, plotting, one-dimensional villain from start to finish. A villain such that the movie can climax with him being put in his place by his son, as any cheap trick movie would.The movie is nice, but utterly fanciful in the same way as say, The Shawshank Redemption or Forest Gump, where it has a realistic plot, but unrealistic execution. This is not Mean Streets... not that a movie has to play it straight to ring true. An outside-the-box movie can have an unrealistic plot, but realistic execution. Take Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; the plot is out there, but the movie is genuine. If you've seen both Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Garden State, think of the weight and depth of the central characters. In Garden State, the characters are fun and neat, but their depth is falsely created in a few sentences of plot-work that doesn't match what's on the screen. What's on the screen is NOT a study of an over-drugged boy (with a severely traumatizing incident) falling in love with a girl who has clinical mental issues. That topic is really left for documentary because how, as sane people, can we begin to structure the feelings behind such a plot? What's on the screen fits a couple normal slackers, there's nothing wrong with simply making them slackers and that's who these characters should be. Slackers can be clever and endearing like these characters, they don't have to be defined as insane and on drugs.Maybe I was in a grumpy mood... but what was with all those barely funny sight gags? These 2-3 second, no-dialogue shots of stuff like, all of them on the motorcycle, or all of them wearing the plastic bags for the rain etc. It looked like the stuff on sitcoms, I was wondering where the laugh-track was (cue laugh-track)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Growing Up and Loving,"Zach Braff's Garden state is a successful coming-of-age story focusing on a standard personality type in early 20th century suburban America - the over-medicated dysfunctional male whose moorings are so tenuous that he appears to have no personality whatsoever. Braff depicts this creature o well that it is tempting to wonder whether or not he was acting. And Natalie Portman, his habitually lying love interest, is a perfect compliment.Most of the plot set-up is implied, rather than explicated, and the film is just expository enough to make it all clear. Andrew Largeman (Braff) is detached from essentially everything - starting with his family and even including his own life. His mother dies, and he must return home after a very lengthy period of removal. What he finds there is a bit surprising.Unlike most romantic films, Garden State is intelligent, unpredictable and more disturbing and ironic than it is actually funny.

Garden State of mind.,"GARDEN STATE a film by Zach Braff.What ever happened to the BREAKFAST CLUB kids? well they headed down to middle suburbia in the garden state where angst has turned into an utterly depressing feeling and reality is not a place where you wanna spend 24 hours a day. Andrew (BRAFF) is a failed actor trying to make it in LA, when his mother dies he is forced to go back to his town in New Jersey for a couple of days where he reencounters his past. This might sound familiar till you met the Klingon medieval knight, the man who reinvented the wheel with a twist and the misfits version of Noe's biblical apocalypse, to top that Andrew's family is the mount Himalayas of dysfunctional families facing a Murphy's law gone mad kind of scenario. He put his mother on a wheel chair when he was nine and has his own father giving psychiatric advice and a lot of pills. The last thing I would expect from the funny doctor of SCRUBS is to write, direct and act in what is hands down the best story of the year. Already comparisons with ALLEN let me tell you that for a debut feature he has managed to trash the early years and move straight to the best subtle blend of comedy and drama that are MANHATTAN and ANNIE HALL. There is nothing classic about the structure that works as a relentless succession of magic moments chain together with great gags. Something that opens musically with COLDPLAY can not possibly go wrong and it doesn't, gets even better when we are introduced to the song ""that will change your life, I promise"" or so says Sam (NATALIE PORTMAN), I'm not sure if somethings can be change that easy but certainly will have you running to buy the soundtrack when the credits roll, the song NEW SLANG... the band THE SHINS. BRAFF acts his way out even when he struggles with the more dramatic bits thanks to his companions. I have never understood all the buzz with PORTMAN so he played an OK role in LEON and moved on to the galaxy far away... so what? I really think this is the turning point for her, at least she has been given the chance to chew a very challenging persona and delivers an honest performance and then we get PETER SARSGARD who is mastering the art of getting great chunks of acting from the STAR WARS puppets as he did with VADER in SHATTERED GLASS. He is the most talented actor of this crew following GABRIEL BYRNE advice that in acting the most important things are looks, movements and silences. In the best year for both music and films since the Tarantino revolution I dare to say, if you only watch one film this year make it to GARDEN STATE and you better make it quick because HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS may have that edge. Like the SHINS would say ""it's a luscious mix of words and tricks"", watch it. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a bad first effort,"Zach Braff's directorial debut, 'Garden State' gives us the story of Andrew Largeman, a thinly employed L.A. actor whose mother dies, leading him to visit his home state of New Jersey to attend her funeral. Soon after he arrives, he falls back into his friendships with people he went to high school with, most notably Mark, played by Peter Sarsgaard and continues in the barely-there and shallow relationship he shares with his father. (Ian Holm) From there he encounters Sam (Natalie Portman) a girl who is off the scale in terms of quirkiness. He spends several days hanging out with his friends and avoiding his father, all in search for deeper meaning in his life.For a first time directing effort, Braff did a pretty good job with 'Garden State'. Two things were glaringly obvious to me from the onset; most striking was that he has obviously been heavily influenced by the music video age. The use of slow-motion for dramatic effect, various film speeds, etc. all show direct influence. The other thing is that he is not afraid to let the camera focus on his face  he was very comfortable to give the camera many long, languid looks; so many that the thought popped into my head that he probably practiced these looks in his bathroom mirror or something. Certainly both of these points did not take anything away from the film, indeed the dynamic cinematography was an asset. Unfortunately, the film was higher on style, but the story lacked real meat. There were several times where I found myself looking forward to some plot points (particularly the one involving Andrew's father) being expounded upon, but they just kind of fizzled with a little metaphorical sigh. Having said that, there were several plot elements that didn't pan out in the manner in which we've become accustomed to with Hollywood films, so that was certainly refreshing, and stood out as a definite positive. Also, I appreciated the 'real life  real speak' aspects of the film. It's obvious that the film was written by a Generation X-er, inspired by pop culture, because there were many times during the film where I would chuckle to myself because I'd had an almost identical conversation with someone in my life at one time or another.Unfortunately, the biggest negative in the film was probably the biggest name of the film- Natalie Portman. Her character, Sam, is quirkiness personified. She says pretty much anything she possibly can, and contorts her body into goofy positions to scream 'I'm different and perky!' as loud as possible. Whereas I found Kate Winslet's 'quirky girl' character endearing in another independent film from earlier this year, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', Portman simply grated on me more and more throughout the film. Rather than thinking she was special, unusual and deep I found her to be a negative component of the film. Conversely, Peter Sarsgaard, who has been REALLY good in the few films I've seen him in, kept it up in 'Garden State'. His obviously intelligent and well-spoken Mark is a solid, believable and complex character and Sarsgaard embodies this character brilliantly.I've never seen the show that made Braff 'famous', 'Scrubs', so this was my exposure to him and his talents. 'Garden State' is certainly flawed, but it is quite good for his first work and I'm looking forward to his future writing and directorial career. I enjoyed 'Garden State' on a basic level enough where I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates independent cinema, but I didn't get the emotional, intellectual or spiritual impact I was led to believe would occur based on word of mouth. Braff is a long way from Hal Ashby-caliber writing and directing, but this is a decent start. Still a good film nonetheless, 'Garden State' is definitely worth a look.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An amazing movie from start to finish. Zach Braff should be a big name in directing.,"Garden State is an astonishing film. It's proof that a first time director can make a film very could that you'll rewatch it often. Similar to Bradley Cooper' s A Star Is Born and Jordan Peele's Get Out, Zach Braff's Garden State can show that a director's first film can be one of the best films of that specific year. We all know Zach Braff for his Emmy Nominated role as John J. D. Dorian in the hit comedy drama series Scrubs but he takes a quick change here. He writes, direct and stars as Andrew Largeman, a struggling actor who works at a Vietnamese restaurant in L. A.. He is forced to go home when his mother dies from drowning
NM in the bathtub. This takes the movie to New Jersey, where Large sees his estranged father (Ian Holm) for the first time in years. He also sees his old buddies, one of them played by Peter Saarsgard. While at home, he meets a girl named Sam (Natalie Portman), who they immediately connect while meeting in a waiting room. This takes him on a journey to find who he really is.The soundtrack is also incredible and won a Grammy for Best Compilation soundtrack. Braff shows us a movie that may have the romantic comedy drama elements but feels more real than most romance stories today. One scene includes him screaming on top of a crane with his friends into an empty abyss as the beautiful cinematography zooms out. Garden State is a much watch. Let's hope Zach Braff directs another great comedy drama like this soon.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Still a very good film, but the best thing to happen to it these days, regardless, is nostalgia.","I surprised myself in deciding that this didn't hold up as well as I had remembered it. It no longer feels like it's doing as much as I used to think, and while some moments are still affecting in the way they tackle things like depression, guilt, and budding romances, some of the less effective moments somehow take the air out of the film as a whole.Most jarringly, the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope is obnoxiously front-and-center in Natalie Portman's character and, while I found her to be endearing and charming when I was 15, I can scarcely stomach the character they wrote for her as an adult. The quirkiness has become a distraction, and I just can't get behind it anymore. However, I have to give Zach Braff credit: the dark comedy angles still land the way they always have, and he made licensed music (normally a pet peeve of mine) work really well in this instance. You can tell that the songs were selected with great consideration, and the film actually felt stronger with their inclusion. Very difficult to pull off. Bravo.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Natalie Portman has never been better,"A simple story that was brilliantly portrayed by each actor. The bittersweet homecoming for Zach Braffs character captures the audiences attention and doesn't release until the story concludes. What may come to be the greatest thing to be associated with the state of New Jersey, Garden State will leave you smiling and glad you invested 2 hours of your time to watch it. This movie also has a phenomenal soundtrack featuring some of the best indie artists of today. Each character is special and unique in several ways and yet they flow together perfectly. After watching it, you may find yourself hoping that Braff writes/directs another film. Worthy of an Oscar nomination, Natalie Portman has never been better.

Feels Empty,"I wasn't even sure if I should write this review as I struggled to come up with words to describe it. On the one hand there are some good things about it, quality moments where you really empathise with Zach Braff's character and his feelings. The movie really well captures the numbness of depression. And on the opposite spectrum I really liked Natalie Portman's character as she brought a lot of energy to it. There are some funny scenes and interesting characters but after a while the quirkiness becomes old and stale. Just being random doesn't make it funny.But there is a profound emptiness that comes upon me when I think about the Garden State. It left me feeling nothing, as if I had forgotten half the film and now struggled to remember what was good about it. The film's better moments don't come together to a satisfying whole and the plot just feels unfinished.Overall this is by no means a bad film. But it's one of those movies that you watch when there is nothing better on. It's satisfying as long as you don't expect too much.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Natalie Portman Rules!!,"Zach Braff makes his directorial debut with Garden State, a really good first movie. I saw this movie with 3 of my friends, and through out the whole movie we were laughing and we were touched by it. After it was done, we all felt good to live in New Jersey and we all realized that the movie made us feel good, period. Natalie Portman blew all of us away! She was hysterical (especially the part where she meets Zach and can't believe he's not retarded) and in my opinion, she is the best character in the movie. After seeing this movie, I am now know what to do when a dog humps my leg (kick it in the balls).9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Toooo Hollywood,"I didn't like this movie because it was way too slick. I wasn't able to get into it because I felt like I was watching a manufactured movie that was trying to pass itself off as an Independent film. The line between an Independent and Manufactured/Hollywood film is pretty wide, but this movie made it seem narrow and broken. It crossed over that line too many times in some of its gags (which were way too cliché), it's moments of pseudo 'profundity' (I know, profound is a pretty subjective concept, perhaps I am past what this movie preaches, or maybe I am just cynical and haven't reached it), and its characters (the friends of the main character seemed to be all shallow jerks, the kind you'd find on some reality based TV show or girls gone wild). Lastly, to say that the medication issue was oversimplified would be an understatement. I don't believe the writer had much familiarity surrounding the issue of medication.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"How pleasant it is to see from time to time a work that is undoubtedly imperfect, but sincere, touching and personal.","This Garden State indeed bears the paw of its main actor, Zach Braff, and it is the whole film that shines from it : the talent and the sensitivity of this young man is palpable at all times, so that this story quite banal appears to us as an enchanted parenthesis, nostalgic but not too much, a beautiful praise of reverie and the gap with reality.But if the whole seems to us ultimately so successful, it is also by the presence of an extraordinary actress not yet consecrated international star: Natalie Portman. The beauty and emotion that emanates from each of her appearances is incredible, witness to a potential and a rare presence, the kind of actress that we meet once a decade...So too bad if the finale may seem a little forced and slightly misses the incredible naturalness that until then caracterized this Garden State, but what does it matter : in front of a film so refined and touching I prefer to retain only the positive. A delight. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Walk In The Metaphorical Garden,"'Garden State' is a triple achievement for Braff. As writer, director and actor he is nothing short of superb. This is one movie that speaks to and of people of my generation. The film has a heart, the characters are very relatable and it boasts of so many memorable moments such as Sam taking Andrew to her room and telling him to do something unique, Sam doing a tap dance and the three standing at the edge of an abyss and screaming (note the brilliant cinematography in this one scene). It's these little moments that beautifully stand out. 'Garden State' tells a simple story and it is Braff's wonderful storytelling that keeps the viewer involved. The dialogues are funny and the characters already say a lot with less words. Performances are solid. Braff is totally different from 'Scrubs's Dorian. Acting and directing couldn't have been easy but he makes it seem otherwise. Peter Sarsgaard proves to be a chameleon actor and does a great job. I have never been a fan of Natalie Portman and I haven't liked her in any of her films (that I'd seen) with the exception of 'Cold Mountain' but here she took me by surprise as she's excellent as the vivacious Sam. I hope she does more such good work as she has shown that she can indeed act. The rest of the actors all look comfortable in their parts and do well. Soundtrack deserves a mention as we are presented with some moving songs by various artists. In a nutshell, 'Garden State' is a small movie with a big heart. It is uplifting and brings a smile with its subtlety (even the serious moments are toned with humour).",,Anonymous,Romance
Fulfilled expectations from the trailer,"It can be seen from the trailer that this movie is going to be different from all the other movies in its style. Being Zach Braff's debut movie, the film does share some comedic style as Scrubs, but slightly more subtle. The main characters, especially Sam played by Portman, are very well developed. Portman's performance is superb and brings the character to life. The soundtrack of the movie is not only appropriate, but almost defines moments of the movie. Some scenes would just not be the same without the music.Overall, Zach Braff does a great job in delivering the message of ""living"" through this movie in an entertaining way.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Solid Film About Self Discovery,"When I think of coming of age movies of the last decade, there are several movies that come to mind, and quite possibly Garden State will be in that list. The film does a good job at capturing the time in your life when you are in between school and the real life and still trying to figure out your priorities in life. I really like how Zach Braff directed and wrote this movie. Even though it feels like a lot of other self discovery films, he brought something new to the table.Having Natalie Portman as the lead female is also never a bad choice. Portman is one of the few actresses that bring a tremendous amount of realism to her characters. And she may very well have the best crying face in Hollywood. Her quirky Sam character perfectly complimented Braff's Andrew. Their chemistry is apparent right from the first scene together all the way to the last airport scene. Although I think the ending was one of the few major weak points the movie had. I was also a bit confused on the whole day-dreaming sequence up until the final scene when it started to come together.Peter Sarsgaard was also a good fit with the cast. I'm glad that he didn't turn into just another druggie, and actually had depth to his character. The father felt rather flat to me, and even in the bedroom scene, I didn't feel much compassion for the man. But the real gems are the scenes just between Sam and Andrew. I think for that reason alone is why this film is constantly on top movies of the 2000's lists. What I really enjoyed about this movie, is that it's basically genre-less. It's not a true romance, comedy, drama or adventure. It's simply a pretty good movie about life.+Chemistry between Braff & Portman+No genre +Relatable life situations-Ending falls flat-One note dad character7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Review of ""Garden State""","Zach Braff directs and stars in the 2004 dramedy ""Garden State"". The movie follows the story of a a 26-year-old actor/waiter (Braff) who returns to his hometown in New Jersey after his mother dies. First off, for a first-time attempt at directing a film, Zach Braff does an incredible job. I found the majority of this film to be entertaining. One of the best aspects of the film, is its really clever screenplay written, of course, by Braff. It features a lot of real witty and endearing dialogue between characters. Which brings me to another great aspect of the film - the performances. I found pretty much every performance in the film to be very very well done. Braff does a really great job of depicting what a person would be like if they've been taking lithium carbonate for most of their life. I also found Natalie Portman's portrayal of Sam to be adorable. Whenever her and Braff are interacting on screen their chemistry is just palpable. The film also features a very great licensed soundtrack. In the end, I found Zach Braff's ""Garden State"" to be a very intelligent romantic comedy that doubles as a very effective mood piece.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Real, poignant and brilliantly done.","I never had an IMDb account until I read some of the user submitted reviews on here which dramatically moved me to inject a degree of sense into the apparently helpless minds on here.Garden State is a touching, emotional and above all else REAL film that apparently lacks a certain degree of message and pace for the people obviously incensed at having not 'got' the film first time around and desire to verbally bash it.The simple low budget poignancy of its narrative about the embracing of life and shedding the fear of what else may come from it is something relevant and brilliantly done by Braff's slow, focused and apt script and direction. Getting slowly to the point much like how slow the character has been in getting to this point in which he is ready to shed all else and embrace life.Some people don't like films, I get that, but I implore all people reading the reviews on here to not listen to the imbaciles giving it a verbal battering when it deserves all 1 1/2 hours of your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A delightful slice of life,"Aspiring actor Andrew 'Large' Largeman hasn't been home in nine years but he returns for his mother's funeral. Here he sees his father, who is also his psychiatrist, and it is clear their relationship is frosty. He also meets up with old friends and makes one new friend, Sam. Sam is a girl he got chatting to in a doctor's waiting room. Having left his medication at home he decides not to get more and starts feeling emotions that had been numbed for some time.This isn't the easiest film to categorise; it has plenty of funny moments without forced gags; it has emotional moments and it has romance, even that doesn't develop too quickly. Instead it looks like a glimpse into Andrew's life at a point where things are likely to change. The main characters are interesting without feeling exaggerated. The cast is impressive; Zach Braff, who also wrote and directed, does a fine job as Andrew and Natalie Portman is very likeable as Sam. Overall I'd recommend this to people not requiring action and obvious gags but wanting a gentler, 'real' film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I hope this doesn't define this generation.,"I saw Garden State today and am writing in response to another member's comment that this move defines this generation. I hope that isn't true. While I do know many people in their 20s who have no focus, no ambition and no hope in their lives, I also know many others who do. During the scene where Sam and Andrew bury Jelly in Sam's backyard, I thought ""Oh no, another movie that tries to 'depict' suburban white kids as living a meaningless existence. Is this supposed to be 'brilliant'?"" I admire Braff's writing ability for being accurate in the dialogue with Large and his father where Large tells him that they need to be okay with not being as happy as his father always dreamed. But it bothers me that a movie about how depressed people of my generation are is a movie that would define us! This movie certainly does not define any of my friends.

They are relatable and profound at the same time such as 'I'm okay with being unimpressive because I sleep better.'

Anything before that, although some crucial moments for the plot, are so incredibly slow your eyes might fall out just to see something interesting. It picks up after the boat scene but is still a pretty empty plot. The idea behind it is nice, simply a movie about a man who has lived his life numb on prescription meds and finally decides to live his life and experience pain, anxiety, sorrow, anger because these are human things. He no longer wants to travel through life numb with medication.I follow the basis, but ... it just seems like a super long movie for such a simple point that you don't even realize they are making until the very end.

I love this movie (and Zach Braff...),"""Garden State"" is absolutely (now, I am trying very hard not to be too cheesy) amazing! I fall into the eighteen to twenty-five age range, and I have to say that this movie depicts what life is today for the aforementioned age category perfectly. Zach Braff captured the confusion and just plain craziness of life for us kids born in the early to mid-eighties in such a poignant (and comical) fashion that it made the movie so full of heart. When watching the movie, I could tell that Braff worked extremely hard on the screenplay. Plus, how can you not love his gigantic smile?Also notable are the performances of Braff, Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm and the entire cast...they are all to be commended. The characters they played resemble (maybe not exactly, but close) people who are near and dear to us in our own lives and although their stories may not be exactly like the ones seen in ""Garden State,"" they still provide life lessons and that was what the whole movie was about...life.For those of you who bashed the movie and said it was ""doody,"" give it another try.

Truly promising and ambitious indie-film,"Half depressed and reluctant to face his traumatizing past for the first time in nearly 10 years, Andrew Largeman returns to the New Jersey region where he grew up, and this to be present at his mother's funeral. It's destined to be a short trip, since there's absolutely nothing there for Andrew. He's still estranged from his father, his old friends assume he has a successful acting career going on and  worst of all  the parental house reminds him of the accident that crippled his mother. But, shortly after his arrival, he meets Samantha and her spirited persona finally brings some joy and hope in Andrew's lonely existence. For the first time ever, Andrew actually has a reason to return home permanently...but then he has to find total peace with himself, first. A simple movie about simple characters with simple values in their lives...we don't get to see many of these and even when there occasionally is an enthusiast director who's attempts to make a clever little movie like this, they're straightly condemned to video-hell because nowadays movie-goers exclusively pay to see wild car chases and giant explosions. Even though Zach Braff was one of the few debuting young directors who DID receive some recognition and praising reviews for his ""Garden State"", a large majority of film fanatics still hasn't discovered it. And they all should, since it's heart-warming and identifiable tale, written and directed by someone who clearly loves and respects real cinema. It's highly praiseworthy how Braff finds an almost perfect balance between bittersweet melodrama and gallows humor! ""Garden State"" is a drama with a rather serious substance and yet it never becomes feeble or pitiful. On the contrary, the script's subtle sense of humor and the beautiful characterizations resuscitates hope and happiness!Yes, ""Garden State"" is a very good film and Zach Braff surely knows which way he's going in the movie business. But still we shouldn't acclaim him as a new and long-awaited prodigy just yet! Although very admirable, his film isn't entirely flawless and definitely not groundbreaking. The story lacks some truly brilliant elements (ingenious ideas  if only just two or three  is what really makes films like this terrific) and it's a shame that too much of the characters' troubles are blamed on drugs. To focus more on the genius aspects again: the soundtrack is excellent (containing a great Coldplay-song and a downright mesmerizing track by Simon and Garfunkel) and the acting of an entirely talented cast simple couldn't be better. Nathalie Portman is particularly impressive in portraying the sweetest female character ever shot on film. Zach Braff already damn well knows how create moody atmospheres and how to write solid dialogues! If he'll now just find a truly innovating premise, his next project will be a masterpiece without peer!*Note: This user comment is dedicated to the sweetest girl in the world; Cazzie.

One measly semi decent scene,"....is painful and almost not worth the effort of sitting through approximately two hours worth of utter dribble to get to. It was when Andrew had that talk with Sam about not feeling like he belonged to the hometown anymore ever since he moved out.If only the whole film worked on the tone of that lost-ness instead of focusing on how stoned out his childhood friends were. I understand the stoned out friends are there to establish how much Andrew has moved on from that place but it took up what felt like 2/3rd of the film which was precisely 2/3rd too much.Braff tried too hard to be quirky and hip. This was evident in making one of the most likable actresses (in my book anyway) into such an insufferable character. Ooohey lookit she's in to see the shrink coz she's so darn quirky too (ok she has epilepsy or something of the sort. My apologies for not paying better attention. I was too distracted by how bad Saarsgard was at this point and I have liked everything else I've seen him in).Ooohey lookit she's forcing Andrew to create such a different, special memory in her room. Oh wow she ice skates in an alligator costume. Tres original!! My apologies again for being such a positive polly. I suspect my expectations got the better of me (only because the three leads could have delivered so much more).This film is best watched either right after high school or college graduation. That **cked up period in most of our lives where we felt so lost and un-belong. I'm 26 and yet to hold a steady job after my degree and this film annoyed the crap out of me.I suggest The Graduate and Beautiful Girls or even Home For The Holidays if you're looking for similar films.

Garden State,"I personally liked the movie Garden State. The movie presents the lives of many people living in this world today. Andrew Largeman, the hero of Garden State is almost catatonic when first we see him (Roger Ebert); the movie starts with a twenty six year old man lying down on his empty room when he hears from his father that his mother has passed away after drowning in the bathtub. After this incident, Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) goes to his mother's funeral and the next day meets a really nice girl named Sam (Natalie Portman) which he falls in love with.I am not a fanatic of movies, but this movie presents a story that could be happening right now to many other people. What I like about this movie is that it has both, its comic parts and its dramatic parts. This is a nice story that many people would want to be living after this same incident, having a mother die. After the mothers death, none of Andrews friends mind on how he feels, they just tell him that they should go partying. The movie presents the girl as the hero of Andrew. When Andrew meets Natalie Portman the day after the funeral, she is the only person who treats him with any curiosity, though because of his passivity, still does a lot of hilarious projecting based on her own insecurities. (Adam Lippe) The father is really upset at Andrew for leaving his mother paralyzed from the waist down after pushing her and making her fall on the door of the dish washer. At first Andrew is presented as a kind of drug addict and lonely man. After meeting Sam, Andrew starts to change, he seems to be happier and for the first time he starts to fall in love with a girl.The thing I least liked about this movie is that it is always the same story, a guy finds a girl, the girl changes his life and they end up being falling in love. Even though the story makes it a good movie, the story was predictable. As soon as I saw Andrew and Sam meeting in the hospital, I knew she would help him overcome the tragedy and they would both end up falling in love. The ending was very predictable because as soon as we see that Andrew just gives the girl a kiss and leaves, this makes us predict that he will come back. This makes the movie a little bit imperfect because a movie is supposed to keep you thinking on what the end is going to be, this forces to keep watching the movie until you get to the end.Mark (Peter Sasgaard) is a high school buddy of Andrew, who works on burying dead people. At Andrews's mom funeral, he finds his friend Mark and they started chatting, at the end of the day they go to a party and start doing drugs and playing spin the bottle. The last day Andrew is supposed to be in town is very significant. At first, all the wondering around in the store with Mark and Sam, going to the couple that lived in a boat and the kiss on top of the machine has no sense. This makes no connection to the story at first, but ends up being very significant to Andrew after his friend Mark gives him his mom's favorite necklace.Overall, this movie had its ups and downs. The movie portrays a really nice story that many people would want to be living after having a family member pass away. Having the ending almost predicted could be named as one negative thing for this movie, but in the overall it is good entertaining movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
Garden State Rocks!!,"You truly can't get a feel for this movie unless you are actually from jersey, well at least the area where it was filmed. I have been to those parties, I've been on those random adventures thru Newark. This movie tells the perfect story of being lost in a familiar world and on your way out you find someone that you can truly love. The characters in movie are perfect examples of what kind of people you will find in North Jersey. This movie just shows you that out of real life tragedy, something can happen. This movie is just simple and beautiful, I completely recommend every person to take a trip to Jersey just so that you can truly understand what life is like in Jersey.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too Many Conversations Instead of Events,"When I saw this movie at the beginning, I thought it is another Hollywood's romantic comedy. It seems that the music and songs is just like the songs in such kind of the movies like ""There is Something About Mary."" However, I know I was wrong after seeing whole movie.I think the most obvious difference between ""Garden State"" and other Hollywood's comedies is that conversations play an important role in this movie. The plot is advanced by a chain of talks instead of a chain of events. Although some conversations are wit and interesting, I feel that this movie is lack of dramatic tension and climax. It is like a diary which records daily life. It is hard for me to connect the flat plot with dramatic opening scene (the scene in a falling airplane.)By the way, some people on message board say that Natalie Portman ruins this film because of her stiff acting, but I don't think that it is her problem. She just has to perform too many conversations without physical movements in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pure schmalz and awfulness,"Wave after wave of directionless nausea - this film wants and at first promises to be quirky and original but is in fact obvious, solipsistic and mired in cliché-driven dialogue which builds to a crecendo of awfulness and cheese by the end. Throughout the film we meet supposedly off the wall characters, who are actually very dull, and just don't quite work and who clunk through the horrific screenplay like men in armour suits, driving jeeps through mansion houses and spouting preppy existential obviousness accompanied by the whinings of Coldplay. The film has occasional funny episodes, often no funnier than a dog playing with its genitals, which happened twice (an index of the slapstick, rudimentary humour of the film in general) but by the end, the film falls into an 'infinite abyss' of complete detritus and the director's egocentric ramblings which made me want to gouge my eyes out. Watch this film at your peril.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Garden State...Gotta Watch It,"I recently watched Garden State and granted I'm not a professional critic, I think it is one of the best made movies I have seen in a while. The plot is simple enough to follow that it makes the story enjoyable since you aren't left struggling to construct events. By the end of the movie, you find yourself so engrossed in their lives that you feel as if you have grown up with all the characters and have known them for life. At then end, you will be begging for more. Sam (Portman) is such a wonderfully innocent pathological liar that you can't help but love her. I give Garden State 2 thumbs way up. Go out and rent it today!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect,"Hey guys, I'd just like to say that I just finished watching this movie. Like the title of this topic says, it was just perfect. Braff was perfect, Portman was perfect, the music was perfect, the images were perfect, the story was very original. I loved it. I am a movie person, i have seen hundreds of movies (like most of us all in IMDb), and I have never picked a ""favorite movie"", up until today. This is by far my favorite movie. This calm, yet ""non-boring"" film was amazing. Every second in this movie caught my attention. Portman's acting was great, but I think the real genius here is Braff. Written, directed and stared? How many big actors out there wish they could do this? Like I stated before, PERFECT. I highly recommend this movie. HIGHLY.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
horrible,"Garden State is by far, one of the most longest, most boring movies ever. It tries to copy life-genre films like American Beauty and tries to be weird, messed up and independent, but it just doesn't work. The characters were such cliché's of already existing character types from other drama films, and Natalie Portman's character is just so outrageous and weird that she doesn't seem real at all. Also, what was with the beginning? Seriously, it did not make any sense at all. Also, the humor was poor and not good, only getting a few chuckles out of me. This film was so long and dull, where there's only talking and talking and talking. What makes drama films like The Station Agent and American Beauty so great is that characters and the plot keep changing, and it's intense, real, different, and original-there's a sense of sincerity to the story and to the characters. But with this film, everything feels like the director was just imitating and trying to copy other drama films, and if you try to make something seem deep and dramatic, chances are it's going to turn out to be cheesy. The main character's problems are only briefly revealed, not clearly stating the reason as to why he's so messsed up in the film. And another thing, compared to a lot of my friends, the main character is not at all messed up and he just seems like a total wimp to me. So, out of ten, I give this film a 0 just because I was led on to believe it was good, and it ended up to be a total bore fest.",,Anonymous,Romance
This movie was awesome,"Maybe I am just easily entertained or maybe the movies around that time really sucked. This movie was great. Zach Braff is an awesome actor and I was glad to see him get away from Scrubs and show that. I will be buying this tomorrow for sure. I liked the lil cameo by Method Man though..Definitely a nice lil break from the seriousness of the movie at the time. 10 Stars is definitely a must with this movie. How can you not like it? Natalie Portman portrayed her character perfect, seeing as how the role was made for her anyway. I hope to see more movies like this in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Qualified success,"Garden State gets off to a great start, both funny and melancholy, it does live up to the promise of being a 'Graduate' for the new century. Overall the film is finely tuned, nicely observed and well acted but it teeters on the edge of self indulgence. Perhaps if I didn't know that Zach Braff was the director and writer as well as the actor I'd just presume that the director had a bit of a crush on him - unfortunately, that knowledge casts a whole new light on the proceedings and I found myself watching a 'look how talented and lovely I am' show reel. By no means is this a bad film but I found an element of self-consciousness in a number of the scenes and when n it tries to be kooky (stand up Ms Portman) I felt that it needed the touch that Hal Hartley bought to his early films. On the strength of this I guess that Braff is going to make a terrific film soon but I din't think this is it",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Impressive first feature,"The first half hour of Zack Braff's debut as a writer and director establishes him as a filmmaker of immense talent, and I hope he'll get to make more films soon. It's opening act high captures a youthful sense of upper-middle class depression, alienation and ennui as well as I've seen, with comedy that makes you hurt inside, and inventive visual story telling.After that the film comes down to earth somewhat, but it's still full of goodies. Peter Saarsgaurd in particular creates an unforgettable supporting character while being complexly understated.This story of an depressed actor in his late 20s returning home after 9 years has a lovely mix of quirky humor, and well-earned sadness. Braff satirizes small town America without putting it down, and pokes fun at depression and family tragedy without it feeling shallow - neither very easy feats. Great use of music as well.Where the film falters for me is in the love story, which feels bizarrely familiar and unimaginative compared to the storytelling all around it. Also, while both fine actors, I never really felt any great chemistry between Braff and Natalie Portman. In some ways Braff's relationship with Saarsguard feels more nuanced. Last, Portman's character feels so young, so unformed next to Braff that it's hard to believe she's ready for a serious relationship.The very end has received some justifiable carping from critics as a bit of a cop out, but it didn't bother me nearly as much as such things usually do.But all that said, this is a terrific debut film, and a terrific film about being young and lost.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amusing film,"This is an amusing film but exceptionally American. When I was 14 I read a book called ""pardon me, you're stepping on my eyeball"" by Paul Zindel and I have to say this film reminded me of it, a lot. I'm British and found that whole American 'needing to find out who I am' and 'deal with personal issues' stuff quite perplexing. The key difference between us and Americans is that Americans just think too much about stuff which we just accept. All that personal self awareness psycho-analysis stuff is beyond me. I mention all this because that's kind of what this film is about. Don't be put off though because it's very amusing. Some moments are laugh out loud good and the acting performances are excellent. If you're not American you may find yourself thinking ""what's the point though"" as it's a 'journey of self discovery'. Personally, my philosophy is I think therefore I am and that's enough for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just smile,"I have watched this film so many times and each time it does the same things to me. It makes me laugh, it makes me cringe from embarrassment and it makes me cry. But most importantly this film makes me smile.Garden State is the directing debut of Zach Braff and is a big hit in my books, it has witty dialogue, memorable scene and very powerful speeches and moments. The film is about Andrew Largeman, a struggling actor who goes back to his home town after the death of his mum. He sees old friends and meets Sam (played amazingly by Natalie Portman) and the story just plays out.The acting is superb, Braff doesn't play his stupid scrubs like comedy in this, instead he is somber and depressing, It is Natalie Portman who stands out though as a crazy, unique, lying and animal loving weirdo and is just kind of every guys dream.This film doesn't have a huge storyline, nor a huge budget, but it does have some amazing messages and is beautiful to watch. this is near perfect and is great for generation Y.10/10 Mr Braff, you have done yourself proud",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A chick-flick with a good soundtrack,"I don't quite understand the hype. Aside from a few good scenes, this movie has little to offer over the tons of usual feel-good chick-flicks that Hollywood churns out by the dozens. And I am twenty-something. And I did just finish my university studies. Supposedly this film speaks to me. But it doesn't. It is not sufficiently different to warrant the credit.True, the soundtrack deserves praise. It is very well put together, and it is this that makes the otherwise completely average movie worth a watch...then again, one could just listen to the soundtrack instead. That's probably a better choice.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
great film!,"This was the type of movie that needed the actors to work well together and give terrific performances. Fortunately, they did. Zach Braff stars as an aspiring actor who goes back home to attend his mother's funeral. While there, he runs into some old friends, and at a doctor's appointment, he meets Natalie Portmann, who plays a free-spirited lady who shows him around and how to have fun in his life. (kind of like Penny in The Big Bang Theory.) The main highlights of this film are Natalie Portmann's performance and the effective balance between drama and humor. I love the scene where Braff and Portmann meet and the blind lady's dog-that was terrific. This wasn't too bad a way to pass your time. You might like it! *** out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely beautiful,"This movie touched my heart. I fell in love with it within the first 15 minutes. Zach Braff did an amazing job writing it. Natalie Portman was great. The plot was brilliantly hilarious. The hidden philosophies Braff slipped into the script were brilliantly placed. I just can't express in words how much I love this movie. If you love artistic movies that make you think, you'll enjoy Garden State. Much like a musical artist gets a standing ovation after putting on a great performance, so did this movie. I think a majority of movies out there today are pure crap anyway, but seriously Garden State was a nice change. 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Down with the moral majority,"I have a feeling most people ""LOVED"" this movie because they are incapable of original thought.I personally thought it was mediocre at best and was mostly worse than mediocre. Here's why:I didn't relate to it- You probably didn't either but you probably think you did. Most of the characters (that is, what we saw of them) were bizarre and unreal.A lot of it was cliché- It's been done before. better. eg: pot smoking mom. It's not funny anymore.The script was bad. Little was connected and nothing was developed.Natalie Portman acted like she was twelve, not eccentric. Someone who did a GOOD job with that same character is Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine.Zach Braff. He's a funny guy. He shouldn't try to be serious. It was way too melodramatic. Seriously- yelling in the rock quarry??? in the rain???The last line of the movie. And how he repeated it. OVER DONE.His ""interesting"" cinematography was nothing new. I'm sure there have been a million pretentious film student projects just like it.Yeah the soundtrack is OK but just because zach braff has enough money to make a movie and put all of his favorite songs in it doesn't make it ""amazing."" Just because he likes the shins doesn't mean it really adds to the film.It's sad to me that kids my age would aspire to make a movie like this. As zach braff's directorial debut, it's OK. But i think we should want more from our peers.",,Anonymous,Romance
Why such a high rating for this movie?,"I watched this movie because of its high rating at IMDb. I don't know what the fuss is all about. Camera shots and acting are very good but I found the story not that original. It wasn't as emotional as I kind of expected.I found the music quite annoying; every two minutes or so a new song swelled on loudly and then lasted for 30 seconds or so. Reminded me of the same technique in Good Will Hunting, although there it was done more modestly and felt as part of the movie. Here the music was trying to convey emotion but it failed horribly with me.To sum up: decent movie although I think it is overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful film!,"This is a must-see for anyone who enjoys thoughtful, touching, funny and uplifting movies. I went to an advanced screening last night and was able to see Zach Braff afterward and listen to him talk about his process with this movie, both creatively and in terms of actually getting it made and in theaters. He is incredibly talented and dedicated to this film. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You will not regret it. The entire cast--Braff's dream cast come true--is phenomenal. In particular, Natalie Portman is completely charming and natural as Sam. This movie deserves serious award consideration, as well as as many people to see it as possible. It is being released only in certain markets, but you owe it to yourself to find it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A ""debut"" movie... shows as much promise as if you handed 1 million and an indie soundtrack to any film school student...","Garden State is Zach Braff's first feature length movie that was directed and written by him, and it shows. Like many directorial debuts, it is bloated with ill-fitting but ""cool"" tangents and subplots, is a semi-autobiography, and is a coming-of-age film. But the strings making the puppet dance to a cute indie soundtrack have never been so visible.Garden State is generic. Flip through it's scenes of quirky-ness, medieval knight fast food workers, and an adopted brother who is searching for the criminal who defiled his Gamecube, and you have a bunch of ideas that could've been found in any college (or for that matter, high school) kid's ""cool ideas"" notebook. Wouldn't it be cool if a doctor had a diploma on a wall? Apparently it's more important than presenting the story. The jokes never seem to follow a theme, but Braff is reluctant to cut out any of his ""cool"" ideas, thus making it an empty exercise in quirky showmanship rather than a honest attempt at using humor to make a point.It's these tangents that really hurt what has been described as the ""heartfelt"" and ""honest"" themes in the movie. It would also help if they weren't delivered in such a by-the-numbers style. Garden State's ""serious"" scenes tread no new territory, and are an exercise in the mundane. ""I feel so f*cking numb,"" says Braff to his cold father. So did I: I was watching Director/Writer Braff on his soapbox delivering The Theme of the Movie rather than unfolding it myself. The character arcs are handed to you in such a way that you realize what is going to happen as soon as the characters are introduced, and feel let down that a quirky film did not lend any of it's twists to actual character building, leaving them squandered in pointless sight gags.However, the movie has struck a resonant chord with teenage audiences, and has critics praising Braff's debut, which according to them, shows promise for a new filmmaker. If only any kid who wanted to be a filmmaker could have contacts and money at his beck and call... we could have hundreds of Garden States. One thinks that showing promise would be doing something new, not traversing the flat, empty plain of half-developed teenage idea wasteland.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Garden State best movie of the year.,"Garden State is an intimate commentary on life that will reach deep into your emotions. The film is honest and real, answering questions we all ponder. Zach Braff places amid a bizarre world the most universal of themes. With stunning performances, including surprising strength from Natalie Portman, Garden State is the best movie this year.First appearances can be deceiving as the movie takes some time to gather momentum. Yet in full force you can't help but be grabbed by the unconventional and artistic style of film-making. Many movie-going experiences will leave you feeling better about yourself, but none so powerful as Garden State.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fantastic.  A great film in a summer of dull.,"I've never done this before, but here it goes.I saw this film Thursday July 22, 2004 at the Magnolia Theatre in Dallas and it was wonderful. The story was a great envelopment of what it is to really be a 20 something year old when they come home. Braff's humor in the film and yet awkward seriousness makes the film so heart warming that you just have to fall in love with it. The 35 mm film it was shot in makes the world feel large for ""Large"" in the film and really makes you want to be with him for these 4 days the film goes through.The acting was very good for someone who is directing himself at the same time. Mr. Braff also does a wonderful job on keeping long takes on his actors when they give performances so you know it really is them acting and not the editing room making something for us. Ian holm makes some great use of his short time on screen as does the rest of the cast.The soundtrack is what really sets this film above the bar. The unknown and known artists on this film are used so well in the film's context that they enhance the film rather than just add names to the movie. This was a most though considering there was next to no budget for the music.However, when I saw the film there was a Q&A session afterwards with director/writer/actor Zach Braff and it was fantastic to hear his stories on making this film. Should this be read by Mr. Braff, thank you for coming to Texas and showing us your film.The only other film I've seen this year that I think is great has been Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and I'm glad to see there is at least one other GREAT movie this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A brilliant debut,"Zach Braff, despite the fact that he seems to love his own face, has created a fantastic film here. The first film to actually make me weep... since The Lion King! The fact that I'm an 18 year old male may reinforce the fact that this is a deep film. It seems to be aimed at late- twentysomething's, and discuss issues of family, friendship, abandonment, home, drugs, sex, music... love... death.Zach Braff has collected an excellent cast for this complicated music, including Sir Ian Holm and Natalie Portman who both give the performances of their careers.Whilst the film leaves something nagging at the back of your mind, it is as close to perfection as such a unique film can be.My number 1 film of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I laughed, I cried, it moved me...","Saw it at Sundance and I have to say it was worth the pre-festival hype. Finding a ticket was next to impossible, I actually wound up watching the movie in the projector booth....I managed to get the only chair in an otherwise standing room only projector booth.Zach Braff has made a movie that will certainly go down as one of the best romantic comedies, spoken in the same breath as When Harry Met Sally.  The characters are real, the story is true and believable, and the acting/casting is incredible.  I have never seen Scrubs, but was very impressed not only with Zach's acting, but obviously with his natural ability to put an idea on paper and follow through until final production of what I consider a masterpiece.I asked Zach at Sundance about the casting and he told me he always envisioned ""someone like Natalie Portman to play the role of Sam"".  The fact that he managed to get her can be best described as a coup, but more importantly speaks to the heart of the matter, that being that the movie is truly special.  I can't wait to see it in theaters again, and then of course to buy the DVD.Treat yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A good stab, but maybe not as good as you've been told","Although I found this to be an enjoyable film, mostly for its quirky commentary on modern pop culture, I didn't find it nearly as overwhelming as my friends and critics had built it up to be.I think this was a good first outing for Braff, but I wouldn't go as far as brilliant, as many people may lead you to believe. Because I wouldn't know if ""brilliance"" was Braff's aim, I can't fault it for falling short in that capacity.On the plus side, I found it amusing and an easy viewing. The story is simple, touching on ageless issues such as guilt, parental conflict, nostalgia, love, discovery, etc. I was a little annoyed with the constant interjection of music to help illustrate...I always feel music should accompany a film, not drive it. In other words, there were times I felt the scenes were written around the music, vs. the other way around.Still though, it was enough to provoke me to keep an eye on Zach Braff. He may have some good things, even better things, to show us yet.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie rocks,"Even if at times it got a tad slow, it completely made sense. Braff has done a great acting job and Natalie as always is very energetic. The story is great, and I am looking forward to even buying a DVD of this movie.I have watched all episodes of Scrubs and Braff does a great Job at that.All the three seasons I have seen totally make sense, as they deal with day-to-day life problems as they come. This is what drove me to garden state. I must admit I have always been a fan of slower movies, but at times this movie does get very quite spontaneous.This is one of the best debuts I have ever seen by an actor-director.

All Things Braff,"A struggling young actor returns to his home town in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral and connects with friends old and new. This is an offbeat comedy-drama that has its moments but doesn't really rise above mediocrity. Besides his starring role, Braff makes a promising debut as director and writer, although he does not excel in any of the three facets and the film comes across as somewhat of an ego trip. As an actor, he relies too much on his deadpan look for laughs. The script fails to sustain interest and shifts uneasily between comedy and drama. Portman is interesting if a bit too goofy as an unstable young woman he meets and falls in love with.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Star Wars fan disappointed at wonderful performances: Jealousy?,"Hahaha... Oh dear... Sorry, but ever since I had seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in theaters and saw the previews for Garden State, I had been waiting anxiously to see it. Zack Braff= young, realistic, artistic, intelligent. Natalie Portman did an awesome job capturing this character and bringing her to life. She was very convincing; Why? Well, for starters, my boyfriend claims I remind him of her. So it's not like this character wasn't life-like. Not every character in a film has to be exactly what you look for in a friend, wife, mother, whatever. Not everyone appeals to everyone (thank god). The whole movie was based on personal situations lived by ordinary people who have strangely fascinating traits that are sadly becoming more rare everyday. And what's even more sad about it, there are critics who looked down upon this. Closed-minded people suck. :) We have a man who ran away from his difficult past, returning home for his mother's funeral, and a passionate, young woman with problems of her own. They help each other out (whether they realized it or not) throughout the entire film. I thought it was genius---the whole process. You were convinced by the end of the film that these two young adults found what they'de been secretly searching for their entire lives-a feeling of love and completion. If you have found your true soul-mate, and you both share odd (yet awesome) experiences, this movie seemed to speak directly to you. It was a very touching movie, and anyone that disagrees, is obviously lacking that feeling you get when you share those similar experiences with a person who still gives you butterflies when you kiss. A beautiful film-- all the random scenes and very real characters made me realize people such as Zach Braff still possess artistic minds that we hardly see anymore--especially with movies in which the characters and audience are among the young adult crowd. It's so refreshing to get a break from movies like ""You Got Served"" and ""Scary Movie"". I loved this film, and so did everyone else I've talked to about it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A 7 for what could have easily have been an 8 maybe even a 9,"With pain in my heart I give this film a 7. Seven for me means I still find it worth watching and I'm sure people will like it but... The story is really about a boy and his quest to 'feel' The story takes a slow start and remains like a slow moving flow up to the end without ever giving the impression that it is pacing. The storyline is very good and I like the idea's behind it making it an interesting film. As I mentioned before BUT, the film unravels near the end and ruins the catharsis I might have had and this due to no other reason then the acting performance of the main character namely the doped-out boy. This is however not the fault of the casting director but this is what happens when the author of the script insists on taking the lead role up himself. In the end the boy has to make a decision and this is where it goes down faster a crappy version of the titanic. The film was to well thought out and to beautiful to be spoiled in such a way in the end. Maybe it is just me that got this impression but my friends that have seen the movie too came to me and expressed the same impression I struggled with as well. It is really a shame because I did not see it coming and everything was fine till the last scenes. I was setting me up for a happy ending and granted this was the general idea of the film but then the happy ending was not what I expected from it. The acting in the film is overall reasonably good and the girl really gives it all she's got. But well it seems that that wasn't enough.Conclusion: This movie would rock if not for the doubt cast as a shadow over the film by the confused acting of the main character near the ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tour de force for Zach Braff,"I think the Premiere magazine mini review said it best... ""Braff is an auteur...who knew?""Who knew indeed!I was lucky enough to catch the premiere of this movie at the LA Film Festival. To say I was impressed would be an understatement.For this to be a first-time effort is incredible. The movie has such subtle humor...the crowd was laughing out loud for most of the show.The difference between this movie and most is this one is intelligent. One line of all ""he's only a fast-food knight"" is due to be the most remembered line of 2004.I don't want to give away too much of this movie, or any of it, so you all can discover what I did. Suffice to say Braff gives a superb performance as a writer and that helps him deliver as an actor and director.Natalie Portman can act! Not since ""The Professional"" have we seen her better.The soundtrack alone is worth the ticket price.Go see this movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meh,"Not one of my favorite movies. I'm from New Jersey and recognized most of the locales in the movie, and my mother grew up in the town, South Orange, where it was filmed. Most of her mother's friends knew Zach Braff's family growing up. The quarry's behind my mother's best friend's childhood house, by the way, and not in Newark. They built luxury condominiums over it after this movie was shot. Oh well! But nothing in this movie is especially like New Jersey. Any native New Jerseyite who's actually lived there all of their life would say that. It could be anywhere. So why is it called ""Garden State""?I also think it's a typical Indie deathtrap with nothing new or unique to say about life, just the typical uplifting hooplah spelling big bucks among teenagers who think they're unique, and, more likely than not, live in New Jersey. New Jersey is a hotbed of two things-Italian ""mafioso-type"" actors and teen angst indie movies, actors, and movie makers, like Todd Solondz, Christina Ricci, Lou Pucci, and Zach Braff. Surely, some parts of the movie were excellent-Natalie Portman was luminous. But this is all so typically, disgustingly indie. At least ""Ghost World"" was an excellent movie. But now movies like that have been done to death.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Atrocious film,"My god, what a piece of crap. Did people actually buy this script? The whole film was unbearable to watch, embarrassingly bad. and completely unbelievable to boot. The acting by that girl was annoying to the extreme. She is a pretty poor actress anyway, but to be fair, the script was so bad to start with.I hate films that try to be ""deep"" but actually have no soul. If you fell for it you are a sucker I'm afraid as it is an ""intelligent"" film for stupid people.I admit though i had to switch it off at the bit when he finally revealed his big trauma, that he accidentally pushed his mother or whatever it was. Come on! As if theyd put a kid on Lithium for the rest of his life for pushing an adult one time. Please. Its absolutely ridiculous. And if my ""friend"" led me on a merry dance all over town when I could be getting jiggy with my new girlfriend on my last day, only to give me the necklace he stole from my mothers grave, I think Id batter him, not get all sentimental with him.Also how come all the people in his home town recognised him instantly even though they last saw him when he was ten? And why were they so buddy with him? The whole thing is rubbish- I know at least two people who agree with me...surely there must be more out there?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
great movie to watch on Sunday afternoon,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Natalie is so cute in this movie... at first i thought it will be boring, but as soon as Natalie(Samantha) enters the movie...in that hospital scene, an amazing chemistry starts to develop between Zach(Andrew)and her. she takes him to her home, introduces to her family members, they hang out and he says her in front of the fire-place that he likes her, and she blushes as she likes him too....that blush made me crazy....yeah really!!!! They both start to develop feelings for each other as the movie progresses, and the ending scene where he'll be going back to LA she persuades him to stay which is so heart-warming scene i mean Zach has directed this movie with a perfection, not to forget great performance from Natalie this movie is a must watch",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Life, love, and great tunes","An enjoyable, offbeat romantic comedy that isn't markedly romantic in the conventional sense until the end. In between a string of hedonistically quirky events centered around old friends who in many cases haven't quite figured out how to become fulfilled adults, twenty-something Andrew Largeman (played by Zach Braff, who some of us still immediately associate with ""Scrubs"") slowly realizes a series of fundamental truths about himself and life in general with help from an unusual girl he meets in a waiting room. Eventually he grasps a message that changes his life. Move features a Grammy-winning soundtrack that includes Coldplay, The Shins, Colin Hay, et al.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What happened to good movies.,"Like many of you, I too disliked this movie. People assure me that it's funny and poignant so I guess there's just something wrong with me. Why don't they make good films anymore?

To care for them. To feel their pain and their joy.Every so often I film comes along like Garden State and I get my hopes up.

"Contemporary, interesting and stereotypical!","This is a very good film; it's a film that will speak to a generation of people. Predominantly those in their late teens to early 20s, those that feel alienated, different and to those that feel every personal problem can only be likened to a nuclear holocaust. It is for a section of contemporary youth who believe that a late assignment, a failed relationship or an untidy bedroom are on a similar level to Andrew Largemen's (Zach Braff) issues of being prescribed mind bending/altering medication since the age of 11, crippling your own mother and the guilt trip encompassing her death. The clichés of modern youth are played out with almost every character through them having either an OCD or some kind of neurotic condition e.g. Sam (Natalie Portman) is a compulsive liar and plain strange, there's the man who's obsessed with pyramid schemes, Sam's brother who becomes so upset when somebody urinates on his console he dusts for fingerprints, the man that works in a Medieval-themed restaurant and wears his armour home and the man who became rich by inventing silent Velcro.Garden State is a good old fashioned exploitation film as it stereotypes the youth of today, it places them in a corner and tells them that even the most damaged and confused of you can find happiness in the end. Luckily in some quarters this is how people saw the film although other quarters will feel it speaks directly to them (a common attribute of exploitation films; look at Bridget Jones for a prime example). I feel that Garden State is not a parody of itself, but a parody of the audience it's trying to connect with exemplified by what I've already written and the amount of quirkiness on screen, it is almost admitting to itself that the audience might have an ADD  another stereotype of today's youth.Overall the film is quirky, prime examples being the scenes of a young couple living in a boat in a quarry, a hamster graveyard and Andrew's means of transport. It is also stylish with its cleverly filmed swimming pool scene (depicts Andrew's isolation brilliantly), its party scene and the bleak ending. Garden State is well acted (Portman is Brilliant, best role since Leon) and well directed and it deserves top marks for being the first outing by Zach Braff as a film director, writer and star but not for being a film that's so untrue to itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Almost Unbelievable!!!,"The Night I saw this was one of the most bitter sweet of my life.  Two friends and myself decided to head out to the movies to see ""Open Water"" and ""Garden State.""  After sitting through one of the most painful cinematic experiences of my life (Open Water) my night felt a little ruined.  Up next was Garden State, which I still held high hopes for.  And I must say, my night was brought back on track after the first frame of this film. I have been a fan of Zach Braff since season 1 of Scrubs started.  His character was always extremly interesting and well-acted.  The idea of him directing and acting in his own film seemed like too good of a deal to pass up.  While his character is in some ways like J.D. on Scrubs, it was excellent to see him in a role that is not constrained to the limits on television. Alas, he is by no means the only reason to see this film.  In my opinion, this is Natalie Portman's shining moment, and it is here that one can finally realize, despite what the Star Wars films may lead you to believe, she is a spectacular actress. Ian Holm, although in a short role, is as equally brilliant, and just a little heartbreaking as well. The story is superb.  The mixture of heartbreaking drama, and touches of black humor throughout, is enough to make you want to laugh and cry at the same time.  If you put together a cast of infinitely talented actors, a wonderful story, great dialogue, and throw in a stellar soundtrack, you have ""Garden State"", truly one of the most enjoyable movie going experiences of my life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not your usual rom com fayre,"This isn't what you'd expect from your usual rom com. If you like your rom coms caked in sugar with honey on top then steer clear of this. If you like an off beat film with lots of angst then you'll love it.Andrew Largeman (Braff) is a an actor who spends his life high (or low in his case) on drugs prescribed by his father (Holm). After returning home for the first time in 9 years Largeman meets back up with his old pals who are mostly equally as unhinged. He meets Sam (Portman), who suffers from epilepsy, and her optimistic outlook on life slowly starts to rub off on Largeman.This is a nicely played film and highly enjoyable. I noticed a review saying that it was equally as over rated as American Beauty and I've got to say it reminded me in feel to American Beauty and Requiem for a Dream. I'm sure it's been said in many reviews, but why can't Natalie Portman put in a performance like this in the Star War films. This is a real return to form for Portman and is nicely directed by Braff on his film debut.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like a bad student film.,"The fact that the movie made only 26 mil in 26 weeks clearly shows how poorly it was written. This, of course, is a common problem with actor ego projects. The story has many unnecessary scenes that don't connect or contribute at all to the story or characters but are thrown in for the sake of getting a cheap laugh - like the knight in the kitchen and the fast motion party scenes. The entire film is full of extra meaningless shots and scenes that could easily be and should have been cut. Why should we care about this character? The film contains virtually no conflict or drama, or emotion, or humor, or cleverness or originality. We have no reason to care one way or the other about Graff. Other than the girlfriend, who is well written, everyone else is straight out of a bad college student film, as are most of the scenes and the story in general. The movie was so concerned with trying to be anti-Hollywood that it failed to be anything else but that. There is virtually no story here, just style in place of substance, and the style isn't even new or different - rather straight from the 70s. So if you're a college student longing for the old days of the 60s & 70s, you'll really enjoy this film. For the rest of the world - well, Nepolion Dynamite made almost double the box office and that wasn't so great either, but at least it was original.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

In the business, accurately portraying real human emotions is one of the most difficult obstacles for writers, directors, and actors to overcome, and yet Garden State delivers with a realistic story we can all relate to. For a young writer like Zach Braff with only 2 million on the budget and 25 days to film, this is quite a feat. Additionally, Braff and Natalie Portman's charisma is brilliant on screen, and their relationship is beautiful to watch. Accepting the past, living in the moment, and following your heart-all valuable reminders from a little film with a bright soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The scene where Largeman and Sam are in the bathtub is one of the most moving scenes I have ever witnessed.

"Awful, terrible, earnest","I saw Garden State at the Bridge last night. Though it steals an entire playbook from Wes Anderson, the first hour is quite watchable and has some genuinely funny scenes. As Zach Braff emerges from a lifelong Prozac- and Zoloft-induced haze, he is surrounded by the same quirky characters and nodding displays of Americana that have delighted knowing hipster kids for more than a decade now.But Braff's shaking off the drugs turns out to be a metaphor for him shaking off all that hipster irony, for trying to figure out what is really important in life. Unfortunately, this is also where I shook off any interest in the film. As it entered its second, 'earnest' half, I experienced so many ""People don't talk that way""-moments that I wished Braff would get back on the drugs.You can only pity poor Natalie ""I like sand"" Portman, who gets to add some real gems to her portfolio:""I know it hurts. But it's life, and it's real. And sometimes it f***ing hurts, but it's life, and it's pretty much all we've got.""However, my favorite had to be Braff's:Braff: Have fun searching the infinite abyss. Boat guy: You too.The accompanying symbolism is just as heavy-handed as the dialog. For example, the film goes way out of it's way to let you know that this infinite abyss is scheduled to be paved over for a shopping mall. See, it's like, he's digging down through the facade of modern suburban life to get at what's really real, you know? That's deep, man.I know 4 out of 5 twenty-something disaffectoids recommend Garden State to moviegoers tying to wean themselves off irony. But please, this is not The Graduate for a new generation. It's not even as good as Lost in Translation (to which it is inexplicably compared). I'll give it an 'E' for effort, but Garden State simply underscores the fact that the post-irony school is still trying to figure out how to infuse the new earnestness with intelligence and subtlety.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet Jesus You People, it's not that Good!","first of all, let me say that I liked Zach Braff's film. It is definitely an impressive first film, and we should all pay attention to whatever he does next. It generally had good production values, and I thought the camera-work was impressive, and its simplicity helped add to the overall drearily-comic effect of the movie. Braff was good, Sarsgaard was great, and Natalie Portman was phenomenal, by far the most engaging character I saw in a film this year, and probably one of the most instantly likable ever.But good lord, it's not THAT good. An 8.4 rating out of 10? You have to be kidding me! It definitely has its problems, most of them having to do with the script, which is at points underdeveloped. A good third of the movie is spent on a quest, looking for what we don't know, and once the goal is reached, we are only left to wonder why they spent so much time searching for it. It could have been very sweet and moving, but came out as confusing and anticlimactic. And the ending was completely botched, taking the easy way out in my opinion and completely ignoring the development of their characters up to that point.It's good, but it is nowhere near the icon of indie film-making many say it is, nor is it anywhere near the cultural landmark and ballad of the depressed 20-something generation they want it to be.Around a 7 is what this film deserves, and that is what it gets from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great first indie from Zach Braff,"Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a troubled, depressed, and heavily medicated actor who once played a retarded quarterback on TV. He's now just a waiter in LA. He returns home to his mother's funeral, and his overbearing psychiatrist father (Ian Holm). He reconnects with an old friend Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), and new girl Sam (Natalie Portman).Written and directed by Zach Braff, this is a very impressive big screen debut for him. He has a good eye for interesting visuals. The story does meander as he drifts. It has an ethereal aimless feel to the movie. That is until he meets Natalie Portman. She's at her height of her IT girl phase, and there is a great reason for it. She's completely magnetic on screen. It's easy why anyone would fall head over heels for her.

Frou Frou's ""Let Go"" is one to be played on repeat. It was funny, but not like Tim Allen prepared jokes. It was all realistic, things you'd see in real life and laugh at. It was fresh, real, deep.

Zach Braff was a good fit for the lead role, playing his character just right. Natalie Portman again shines; at times innocent and at other times wise beyond her years, but always amazing. You would have to be from another planet not to fall for her character's unique personality. The supporting characters were a fun mix of oddballs and eccentrics. Besides the pace the other thing I could see giving some people a problem was the ending. An enjoyable film overall; worth the price of the video.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful, melancholy quarter-life crisis","Zach Braff. Who knew? He not only wrote and directed this well-crafted picture, but his performance is a layered, nuanced picture of pain, anger, and eventually hope. This movie is marvelous. It perfectly captures the feeling of coming home in your mid-twenties and having it both be home and not home at the same time. The angst of the twenty-something isn't anything new, but where Garden State rises above its peers is in its truthfulness. My friends and I left the theater commenting that we can't remember having seen a movie this ""real"" in quite a while. And that's saying quite a lot for a movie that introduces a character with her waving around a dead hamster. Garden State deftly balances the absurd and the comic with the melancholic and heartbreaking. The cinematography and direction were both excellent and the soundtrack was the perfect accompaniment. And yes, contrary to some opinions, you are supposed to laugh, because sometimes the ridiculousness of life really does catch up to you. No, it doesn't follow a traditional three-act structure, and no, you won't have answers to all your questions, and in the end it adds to the movie's authenticity. In the great disaffected tradition of the Graduate, Harold and Maude, and Lost in Translation, we have a romantic little story about returning home for a weekend that will stay with you long after you see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Garden State"" is an intimate cinematic experience, inviting audiences to reflect on their own journeys of self-discovery and breaking emotional chains that bind us","Zach Braff, who until then was known only for J. D., protagonist of the series ""Scrubs (2001-2010)"", and for having participated in films such as ""The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy (2000)"", began a change in his career when he debuted as director with the drama ""Garden State"", a mature and interesting project in which he also plays the main character.Braff was inspired by autobiographical facts to compose the character Andrew Lagerman, a Hollywood actor who is known for only one prominent role he had on television and who is forced to return to his hometown to attend his mother's funeral. This return to his origins will force him to analyze his life, starting from the conflicts that will be rekindled with his father (Ian Holm), with old friends (with emphasis on Peter Sarsgaard) and when he gets involved with a new girlfriend (Natalie Portman). . Past traumas will be put to the test, as well as old fears and misplaced frustrations will be faced in search of a resolution.""Garden State"" is inhabited by a gallery of eccentric figures - many of whom appear on the scene, give their message (be it a joke or a moment of pain) and disappear without a trace: there is the waiter of a thematic restaurant - played by Jim Parsons, Sheldon from ""The Big Bang Theory"", in a kind of premonition of what would happen in his career three years later - who is proud of his status as a ""medieval knight"" and of speaking Klingon; the young policeman who, a former drug user, seems not to regulate very well; and the family that lives in a boat ""docked"" on the edge of a natural canyon, to name just a few examples In fact, even the main couple escapes normality: Sam (Portman) is always carrying a helmet, although he doesn't own a motorcycle or bicycle , and when we first see Largeman, the young man is lying in his immaculately white room, then opens a cabinet filled with perfectly aligned medicine bottles.However, what is most striking about the protagonists of ""Garden State"" is their melancholy - a feeling that spreads through all the characters that surround them, like Mark (Sarsgaard) and his mother and, of course, the father. Of Largeman, a psychiatrist (Holm) who prefers to anesthetize his son emotionally through medication than to risk seeing him suffer. This inability to ""feel"" the world, by the way, is portrayed by Braff with great sensitivity. And this certainly couldn't have been easy, even more so appearing alongside Natalie Portman, completely at ease and in full control of her charismatic figure.During a good part of the narrative, Largeman views the incidents around him with an expression of surprise, as if trying to understand not only what he is seeing, but also what his reaction should be. Showing the charisma and comic timing already evident in the ""Scrubs"" series, the actor-screenwriter-director establishes a strong connection with the spectator, which proves to be fundamental to the film's success. Meanwhile, Portman delivers her second great performance of 2004 (in fact, this feature was released, in the United States, before ""Closer"") by composing a fascinating character: garrulous and impulsive, Sam is a young woman whose apparent vivacity hides a sadness whose origin we discover gradually and which gives even more complexity to the girl. Not afraid to expose herself to ridicule, Portman demonstrates her total dedication to the project in scenes in which she is surprisingly vulnerable, such as the moment she explains to Largeman what she usually does when she feels ""unoriginal"". However, the actress is not the only one to shine in two films in the same year, since Peter Sarsgaard, who here plays with intensity the frustrated Mark, also offered another great performance that year, in ""Kinsey"".Even so, the great strength of ""Garden State"" lies in the direction of Zach Braff, who conducts the narrative and the dramatic arc of his characters with absolute confidence, which should be the envy of many veteran filmmakers. The best thing about the film is the sensitivity with which its story develops, without quick or hasty solutions, avoiding the obvious cliché whenever possible. Even easier characters, like Portman's, gain a new look, believable and forceful. And the main thing, the relationships that are established between the characters convince in a true way, and never far from reality. The bitterness of the protagonists is almost palpable, and even in almost absurd contexts it can be understood and even forgiven. A smart touch - talking about what is known with propriety - that many competent professionals of the genre have difficulties in approaching, but which is perceived here with great confidence.Always concerned with transforming his creations into real figures, the young director reveals his intelligence when creating moments of simple intimacy between Largeman and Sam, such as the conversation that the couple has in an animal cemetery and another that takes place in front of a fireplace. In addition, the boy avoids several clichés that could have compromised the final result: when the protagonist mentions that he has not cried for ten years, for example, we are led to wait for a practically inevitable catharsis that brings him to tears, but, instead, the film surprises us with a sweet, funny and not at all melodramatic scene. Likewise, the long-awaited conversation between Largeman and his father adopts a discreet and intimate tone, when several other directors would have bet on a warm and impactful discussion.One of the film's main strengths is the way it tackles themes of alienation, emotional connection and the search for meaning in life, with a unique sensitivity to these themes, allowing audiences to deeply connect with Andrew's journey as he returns to his hometown after his mother's death. Braff uses visual and symbolic elements to convey his character's emotional state, such as the color blue that permeates many early scenes, reflecting Andrew's sense of lethargy and detachment. One of the film's most iconic scenes is the iconic ""scream"" scene. When Andrew finds Sam (Natalie Portman) in a graveyard chasm, she urges him to release his pent-up emotions, prompting him to let out a cathartic scream. This scene is powerful because it represents Andrew's emotional release and the beginning of his journey of self-discovery and healing. Braff's direction makes this scene intense and emotionally charged, conveying the character's inner transformation in a moving way. Another memorable scene is the party at the house of Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), a friend of Andrew's. Braff's direction in this sequence is marked by a sense of disorientation and surrealism, with the cameras moving wildly and the characters interacting in strange and cathartic ways. This scene is a reflection of Andrew's journey to break free from social conventions and allow himself to experience life more authentically.The film's conclusion is marked by a sense of renewal and potential. Throughout the narrative, the protagonist Andrew goes through a journey of healing and self-discovery after returning to his hometown for his mother's funeral. His journey back to his roots is metaphorically expressed by the title's ""Garden State"", and over the course of the film, he confronts his pent-up emotions, re-evaluates his relationships and begins to find his own voice. The final scene, where Andrew assertively confronts his father and expresses his desire to seek his own happiness, is a moment of great empowerment for the character, symbolizing the culmination of the protagonist's journey of self-discovery and overcoming the emotional ties that kept him trapped for so long.The relationship between Andrew and Sam is also central to the film, and the direction highlights the intimate and vulnerable moments between the two. The scene where they are lying on the cliff watching the clouds is an example of this. One of the film's core messages is the importance of embracing authenticity and seeking genuine connections. Through his relationship with Sam (Natalie Portman), Andrew learns to open up to life's experiences, face his own insecurities and free himself from the social conventions that have limited him. In addition, ""Garden State"" features a remarkable soundtrack that perfectly complements the scenes in the film. The musical direction contributes to the melancholy and reflective atmosphere of the film, choosing songs that echo the feelings of the characters and reinforce the themes addressed in the story.But Braff, like every budding filmmaker, makes his share of mistakes - some of them serious ones. Right at the beginning of the story, for example, the excessively extravagant tone of the narrative almost destroys the film by taking Largeman away from the ""real world"", distancing him from the spectator - the impression is that Braff is trying so hard to provoke laughter that ends up forgetting the verisimilitude that the feature should have (later, it finds the balance between farce and reality). On the other hand, the third act fails to please the public too much, becoming sweeter than recommended - which is still a betrayal of everything that came before.In the end, ""Garden State"" is a cinematic work that resonates deeply thanks to sensitive direction and honest exploration of universal themes. Andrew Largeman's emotional journey, his search for connection and authenticity, and his personal evolution come together to create a moving and memorable narrative, becoming an intimate cinematic experience, inviting audiences to reflect on their own journeys of self-discovery and the importance of break free from the emotional chains that bind us. ""Garden State"" is a celebration of life, human vulnerability and the ability to find beauty and meaning in the most unexpected situations.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Flat and dull movie similar to many others that are better,"I think I've reached the point of total boredom with indie movies about people returning to the place of their youth and dealing with unresolved issues from their past. Garden State was the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back, and I struggled to care about anything happening in this film. Even the deeper emotional moments fell surprisingly flat for me. I could sense where they wanted me to care/cry, but I simply did not. Part of that might be the acting, though. Zach Braff does nothing for me. I suppose he's fine early on when he's supposed to be numb from a lifetime of taking mood-altering drugs, but when he finally opens up and starts to feel things, his performance didn't come across much different to me. He's very deadpan in his comedic delivery too, and feels like an actor that would make a better straight man, because I never found him all that funny.The other main character in Garden State is played by Natalie Portman, and I can't imagine many young actresses who would be worse to play a manic pixie dream girl. She is so flat in her line delivery and has so little charisma I simply could not comprehend how the protagonist was connecting with her. What bothered me even more was the way they tried to make her quirky and weird. They'd just write awkward character traits that are exaggerated in a stupid fashion so that she was ""interesting."" This also led to some horribly-written dialogue in certain scenes where they would talk in a way that I can't imagine normal humans ever speak. It's clear that I'm in the minority on Garden State. It has been a good nostalgic film for others, I'm just the rare guy who gets nothing from it. If you like ""dealing with past baggage"" films, then this one might be right for you.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Zach Braff...,"Garden State has a vibe and unique feeling to it that I absolutely love. The soundtrack, the tone, the script, it all creates this slightly depressing world, but not in a bad way. This depiction of estrangement, grief and finding purpose is crafted into a beautiful story that I was drawn to.The film is extremely quirky, with moments so strange that they could be off-putting to some. That being said, those moments are what make this movie feel so real. I have always been a fan of Zach Braff's acting, but this made me love his writing and directing as well.Best Character: Sam (the manic pixie dream girl)

awesome!,"Out there exist a lot of love and funny movies, but none could ever approaches to this one.Zach Braff is an amazing actor, he can do everything, and he certainly shows that in this film. He can be angry, sad, depress, tired of everything and smile all at the same time and in the mine while, he directs this film doing a great job in both thing.The film is very impressive, i think. It really capped my attention from the beginning and let me thinking at the end.The places, the people, and the music is all so connected that you feel the moment like it is real, i really think that those factors are the very essence of this movieIf you see it, you will have 102 minutes of your life well used.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What's not to get?,"After months of watching summer drivel, ""Garden State"" finally offered a reason to shamble off to the movies again.This is a great little film. Don't let the curmudgeons convince you otherwise. It might remind moviegoers of Lost in Translation, but that's a second ratecompliment. The shots of characters who aren't doing anything dynamic isreminiscent of Sofia Coppola's affinity for showing characters being, well,human, not talking incessently or moving about like wind up toys. Braff makes us look at people long, hard and without blinking. His characters are human and flawed and attractive and ugly all at once. His movie is funny and sad and joyful and depressing by turns.Like I said, this is a great little movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just Read,"If your one that thinks about the next step in life and is afraid to move, watch this film and you'll be ready to start moving forward. Garden State makes one contemplate about if we are certain that where we are going in life is where we want to be, but more importantly who we want to be there with. The soundtrack is one of the greatest compilations ever constructed and implemented into a film. Every song struck a chord with a specific scene and to put together real emotion/depth and combine that with perfect placement equals nothing less than what Garden State is as a film in its entirety. Zach Braff puts on a performance, so genuine and pure he truly convinces an audience it's not his character, it's himself.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good.,"""Garden State"" is the directorial debut from Zach Braff, who you might recognize from the NBC television series ""Scrubs"". After seeing his film, I can really only say ONE thing for sure: Zach Braff has a good career ahead of him. He is very well versed in the art of tugging at heart-strings. In fact, almost everything about his film seems made for the sole purpose of making your insides melt. For some movie goers, the dripping emotional scenes and easy accessibility of the film will be a huge attraction. However, for others, it may prove irritating and somewhat condescending. I personally enjoyed ""Garden State"" despite its inherent shortcomings and I'm definitely anxious to see what Braff will do next, but I have to say that this movie was kind of spoiled by its last half hour. Don't get me wrong. This is a good movie; however, it could have been a great one if Zach Braff had been willing to get rid of the pieces that didn't fit. What is good about Garden State is really really good, but what doesn't fit in the movie only serves to slow it down and remove the focus from a wonderful story about love and self-discovery. The film's running time is 109 minutes and if it was trimmed down a bit, I think that this would be an excellent film. Don't let that stop you from seeing ""Garden State"" though. There's too much good in it to be undermined by a few bad scenes and a few strange plot detours. This is definitely one of the better films of this summer.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
pretentious pseudo indie,"man, what an ego trip. the guy knows how to shoot but thats about it. I've seen all the scenes in this film before, in more or less indie productions... the screaming into the abyss? Gimme a break! the quirky girl with a boy's name? oh man.. How could you? Natalie was cute in beautiful girls, but doing the same thing ten years later is just plain annoying. Being emotional by the fireplace? Zach Braff will be directing big budget romantic comedies five years from now. I had to go home and watch Les Enfants Terribles to justify having spent time and money on this pretentious garbage. The girl looking for the Sauna was cute, though. The only character that did not annoy me. And method man was good",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A rare triple whammy by Zach Braff,"Very rare do you see a movie written by, directed by, and starring one man, that has any quality at all. However, Garden State is a stunning exception. Braff plays the main character, Andrew who comes back for his mother's funeral. He runs into some people from his past, and meets a most unusual woman, Sam (Portman). This film is full of memorable scenes, and I simply can not do them justice. All I can say is that I registered on IMDb just to praise this movie. It should be seen by everyone at least once, but especially those who are, like me, at the crossroads of life like Andrew (ie people between like 16-25). I give this movie 10 out of 10, because it has comedy, heart, and several very memorable scenes that, in my opinion, are what cinema is all about.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Avoid this at all costs,"This film begs that there something be done to stop this wave of Whitesploitation films.

Case in point being all the Jersey folk who tell ""Large"" that they know someone else in the industry.

"Mildly Entertaining, Shallow and Self Ingulgent","""Garden State"" is yet another one of those so-called ""quirky slice-of-life"" comedies that is in actuality a depressing piece of misguided melodrama. What makes this type of film work is when the oddball characters ring true in some way (as they did in the far better ""Sideways"" or ""The Station Agent""). The problem with Zach Braff's film is that none of the characters seem real and all their quirks are there for no reason other than their own quirkiness (for instance, the listless druggie who makes millions off inventing silent Velcro or the moron who wears his knight costume to breakfast before going to work at a ""Midieval Times"" restaurant).The film isn't totally without its charms. Natalie Portman is delightful and adorable. This is a perfect transition role for her as she matures from precocious child actress to leading lady. She does the most with her overwritten role as an epileptic ex-ice skater with a plethora of pets and an ""adopted brother"" from one of those Sally Struther's ""save the children"" campaigns. She comes across as endearing and genuine and is the only one of this motley ""Garden State"" lot I would want to spend some time with in the real world.Writer/director Zach Braff, on the other hand, seems to be playing a pill-popping emotionless minor TV star whose mother just died for no other reason than the fact that he is an emotionless actor who can't pull off any other type of role. His performance is hollow, and only in his scenes with Portman is he acquitted of his obvious and egregious self-indulgence.There's a few mildly entertaining sidebars along the misguided coming-of-age trail (the underground ""Grand Canyon"" or the dope at the hardware store trying to sell his pals on a pyramid-scheme), and every scene Portman is in is better for it, but when you tack on an annoying folksy-alterna-emo soundtrack and a horrible and safe ""Hollywood"" style ending, I couldn't help but feel cheated.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Genius,What I wouldn't give to be a fly on the wall for the writing and filming of Garden State. Zach Braff is a creative genius who wrote and directed this masterpiece.

Overrated,"Was it really that great? I rented this movie with high expectations based on previously published reviews. Perhaps because I am not a 30-year-old male, Largeman's single expression of wide-eyed amazement did not resonate with me.A little homework on the writer's part would have turned up the fact that Largeman would have had a severe mental MELTDOWN if he stopped taking his cocktail of mood stabilizers cold turkey. And to take recreational drugs on top of that? I don't buy it.It was also difficult to sympathize with someone who severed contact with his paralyzed mother for no apparent reason. Laregeman's issue seemed to be attached to his father. Visiting one's paralyzed mother while avoiding contact with one's estranged father does present some interesting logistics, but is hardly an excuse.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Jean Smart as earns an honorable mention for making me laugh uncontrollably with her wit and dedication to her part.

Completely pointless,"It's very rare that I come away from a film feeling that it had absolutely no redeeming features. I can however say with all certainty that this is definitely one of them. It's got a horrible 'trendy' soundtrack, rubbish characters (Portman is irritating beyond belief) and I just can't understand why it even exists. I don't mind a love story; I like subtle ones as well as the cheesy stuff, but this is just useless. I'm sure some readers of the Guardian (lefty UK newspaper) will enjoy it, but that's by no means a recommendation...It started off a bit 'Grosse Point Blank' like (although that is clearly a great movie), then it descended into a poor man's 'Lost in Translation'. Two people connecting... that's about all I got from this movie. The jokes aren't funny, in fact I did wonder at one point if I was even supposed to laugh!

A Mediocre Film,"This is the first time I've written a critique on IMDb and I was motivated to do so because I was surprised by the number of glowing reviews this movie has received. Essentially, ""Garden State"" felt like a glossy film school project--written by an angst-ridden, jejune 20-something--in which, as one astute reviewer wrote, ""real problems make cameos."" The poorly structured script is just a series of contrived vignettes, which, despite displaying glimpses of Braff's talent and comic timing, ultimately ring hollow and too cute for their own good. He's trying too hard to be profound. Natalie Portman is lovely, but I felt like wringing her neck! It seems as though early fame and fortune has dampened any real emotional connection she may have to what most people her age go through - I just did not buy her as the epileptic misfit with the wacky mother, and none of her precious mannerisms and speech patterns (""oh my god, I can TOTALLY see you freakin' out right now, you so want to leave don't you?"") came across as remotely authentic. And being able to turn on the tears in one two many scenes does not make you a good actress.And the great Ian Holm? What was he doing in this movie? Did he read a different script than the one that ultimately was produced? His character had no arc, no layers, no nuthin'.Braff obviously has talent but he needs someone with a good bull*$#! detector to read his next script--someone who won't be swayed by the hyperbolic praise that has been heaped prematurely upon his shoulders.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good stuff for what it is,"""Garden State"" is all about a young man from Hollywood who returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral where he rekindles old friendships, attempts to straighten out his relationship with his father, and falls in love. A one man indie by Zack Braff, ""Garden State"" has few of the telltale indie liabilities as it develops its linear make-it-up-as-you-go story with freshness, warmth, and humor. On the upside, this film about one man's honest approach to life is a pleasing blend of quirky humor, poignant moments, and contemporary romance. On the downside, the film is skewed toward younger audiences, lacks the tinsel which the big bucks buy, and has a scene-to-scene sameness which comes from it's single-minded auteursmanship. Although one cannot expect the output of one man not even 30 years of age to result in an exceptional product, this little film received acceptable critical nods and excellent marks from the public making is a worthwhile watch for Gen-Yers and just about anyone into contemporary quirky romantic comedy fare.

Zach Braff is amazing in his acting role and genius to compose such a great scipt. Portman is quirky and sensual in a role that parallels Kate Winslet's character Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind minus the whole hair thing. If this movie doesn't leave a lump in your throat then there is something wrong with you. Again i draw the comparison to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, in the helplessness the characters feel towards their plight.

There's so much out there that I haven't seen, my god, but ""Garden State,"" is possibly one of the best films I have ever seen.I expected a lot just from the trailer, Zach Braff, and Natalie Portman. I was surprised to then reflect on the film and find that it really went above my expectations. I really did not expect it to be that funny either. I saw it opening day for us here in Chicago, and then again the next day. It unfortunately started in only 4 theaters here and we had to drive an hour to see it. It ended up being moved from the Art House side of a theater to another larger auditorium. I can tell you from working in a theater that this is because it was selling out, as it did again that Sat. night.I really love Scrubs. Zach Braff is hilarious, but I did not expect to laugh as much as I did in ""Garden State."" It's touching moments, were also, very captivating. I don't know if I can view Zach the same any more. I imagine watching Scrubs all the same this year, but I respect the man's vision and talent so much more now. Incredible!I would highly recommend ""Garden State,"" to any one.

Absurd theater in the 21st century,"Let's call this a post-nihilist film: All the young characters are already used to the Pinter-ish feeling that life makes no sense, the world cannot be understood, communication and empathy are impossible, caring for any one else or trying to do anything meaningful is utterly futile. They do not expect anything from life, they do not even try to wait for Godot any more. They see modern poverty, richness, inequality, alienation, injustice at the side of their roads, taking all of it for granted, failing to understand whether it has anything to do with their own misery. They do not even suffer; if they ever heard about Sisyphe, which seems rather unlikely, they just don't care. They simply vegetate, doing absurd things - working as a policeman, being on drugs, being rich, living on the verge of mental disorders - whatever, it simply makes no difference.Suddenly and unexpectedly, Godot arrives in their quiet city: A young man who fled his loveless father a decade ago and returns for his mother's funeral. In several ways, this guy fits perfectly into ubiquitous absurdity: He is as far from knowing anything about himself as any one else, and he is doing as little as any one else. Yet, his appearance does make a difference; in a way, it is utterly disturbing: He arouses genuine curiosity. Curiosity is what slowly makes tiny bits of empathy creep into all that ocean of indifference and absurdity. No wonder this leads to a love story - but this love story is not the whole point: Even though absurdity mostly prevails, some of the other characters slowly start acting in slightly more human ways, too. Watch out for it!Lots of other comments blame the incoherence of the film, the incredibility of its characters, the many clichés. Right, true. But maybe part of that was even done on purpose. After all, what kind of coherence, philosophical depth and fine art do you expect in a film about post-modern absurdity? Probably some of the film's jokes will seem silly to you, perhaps you will enjoy others, perhaps you will even enjoy the ironical way some of the silly ones are presented...There has been absurd theater before this film, so showing absurdity is certainly nothing new. Proposing empathy and love as a remedy to absurdity is not exactly original, either - yet, in spite of the film's many shortcomings, the way this idea is presented does not seem disgraceful or artless to me. There is some charm about it.And i feel there is at least one idea shown in this film that hadn't occurred to me before. It's in the last sentence spoken in the film. I can't tell any more about it, or I would have to mark this as a spoiler. When you heard this last sentence, re-read my previous paragraph. Taking the film alone, the conclusion you will arrive at is frightfully credible.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Our Graduate... a wonderful film.,"Sure it's a lofty comparison, but it's one that has to be made and Garden State measures up. Braff really does create what could be the quintessential coming of age film for this generation. The story of a suburban kid who returns home to find it just the way he left it, and realizes, he may have out grown the place and the people.Portman and Raff (not to mention the wonderfully vibrant supporting cast) give great heartfelt performances, and his writing will ring true with anyone who has faced that moment of having to let go of ""home."" Partially because of all the crap Hollywood puts out, I kept waiting for the melodramatic twists to happen, but they never do and the movie is better for it. The film reminds me of a more sedate Kevin Smith style, character and dialogue based must be something in the Jersey water strike that Jersey water will just kill ya. Anyway, this is a beautiful film that may seem to drag at the start, but is really just it's character waking up to life and taking the audience with him.

ever felt like uoo've been cheet-ted?,"In the family of its contemporary peers such as I heart Huckabees, Life Aquatic, Rushmore, Tenenbaums, 40 Year Virgin, Napolean Dynamite, American Beauty, etc.. Garden State is the somber uncle. A narrative, wrapped around a 26 year old Jewish actor returning home to his family and town to attend his mother's funeral, wallows in the depths of the infinite abyss on the edge of existentialism. Existentialism, in which each unique individual defines their own meaning for life, or meaning for existence in a cold uncaring world, becomes the back-drop to this yarn. Yet where The Graduate was suspenseful and culturally taboo, Garden State is, in contrast,tame and subdued. I write this review right after my first viewing of this feature. Maybe GS grows on the audience. Maybe its domesticity is an intentional mirroring of the bland and blah'se. Maybe I am getting old. Maybe I see too much of myself in the protagonist. The question I kept asking myself was, ""do I really care about these people, this character?"" I kept thinking, ""man, i heard so much goodness about this film. there's got to be something here."" I recalled advertisements of the scene in the quarry, and when they finally arrived there i thought, ""oh, another setting born within the story like recurring swear words and non-orthogonal visuals."" Yes there is some cleverness here. Yes there is a soundtrack here. Yes Natalie Portman is here and swearing and looking very cute. Do we need Soderbergh slow-mos of our crew en-route to ""the piece?"" finally the last moments of the film take us back to the beginning (from which we woke from); but now at the payphone, and ""what do we do now?"" My guess is Zach Braff has more in store for the western world. The young actor/writer/director combo is quite rare, though this film is no Citizen Kane. Joshua Miller's ""Mao Game"" comes to mind and may have been more successful. I think this film more than accomplished the inferred goal of saying, ""hey Hollywood, your films are not so great, i'm young and i'm gonna make a film, and exercise my talent, and maybe make some money, and this is what it was like growing up in new jersey, and doesn't queen amidala look so nice without all that make-up and costuming...(ellipsis)"" Yet I didn't notice where a nuance was, if there was one intended.

"A Quirky, Heartfelt Tale with an Underrated Gem of a Performance by Natalie Portman","Garden State is an emotionally rich and quirky film that explores themes of love, loss, and self-discovery. Zach Braff's directorial debut perfectly captures the millennial search for meaning through its mix of humor, vulnerability, and poignant storytelling.Natalie Portman's performance as Sam is truly the heart of the movie. Her portrayal of a quirky, free-spirited young woman is nothing short of innovative. She breathes life into her character, making her feel both deeply relatable and endlessly charming. Despite her brilliance, this role remains one of her most underrated-a true disservice to the talent of the greatest actress in history. Her ability to blend warmth, humor, and vulnerability is unmatched, and she elevates every scene she's in with her stunning and captivating presence. Beyond her acting prowess, her natural beauty radiates throughout the film, making her performance even more mesmerizing.The film's indie charm is amplified by its outstanding soundtrack, which perfectly complements the mood and narrative. Zach Braff delivers a heartfelt performance alongside Natalie, and the chemistry between the two leads feels authentic and moving.While some elements of the story might lean on indie clichés, the sincerity of the characters and the emotional resonance of the themes make Garden State an unforgettable experience.Natalie Portman's role in this film deserves far more recognition than it receives.

Everything I hoped it would be...,"After tuning into the brilliance of NBC's ""Scrubs"" for the past few seasons, I was immediately thrilled to see that ""Scrubs"" frontman, Zach Braff, was writing, directing and starring the movie Garden State.The movie is based on Andrew Largeman's (Braff) journey from his numbing life as an actor/waiter in Los Angeles to his home in New Jersey for his mother's funeral. Upon arrival, he is thrown into a surreal world full of surreal characters, both those from his childhood and also those he meets for the first time. But it his relationship with Sam (Natalie Portman) that shakes his reality and causes him to question the state of his life.A quirky mix of drama and comedy, Garden State is an unexpected indie gem of a movie. Everything about this movie--from the performances of Braff and Portman, to the cinematography, story and soundtrack--is presented in a delightfully fresh and edgy way. The meaning is outstandingly subtle, stark, and highlighted by the understated simplicity of human emotion. But perhaps Garden State's best facet is capturing all this (a kind of ""who am I?"" ambiance) without getting caught up in a formulaic plot line. The movie is not without flaws, but I was so happy with the breath of fresh air Garden State provided, in a cinematic world full of grade-C movies, that I hardly noticed.Zach Braff is truly a new rising star to watch, breaking out into cinema with the grace and talent of a true pro.

But that rub-off is no disturbance. It can't sustain the same touch all the way to the finish line, as I find it ending a bit too conventional and cute.

The main character and all his friends are the kind of people that would make you leave the room in real life - boring, self-absorbed, low self esteem, and sleazy. The hero climaxes three times - pun intended. First he tells off his father - but the set up is contrived. His father is conveniently the fall guy for the hero's own nothing life. Then he cruelly leaves the adorable girl for his nothing life in CA. Then he returns to the adorable girl. Duh, he is nothing without her. Sorry for the hackneyed phase, 'nohing without her' but his life up to that point has been a zero.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
You can go home again.  Can't you?,"Garden State is about Andrew Largeman, a young man who after many years away returns home to rediscover himself. Or maybe discover himself for the first time. On an abundance of psychiatric drugs since childhood Andrew goes through life in an almost catatonic state. He feels nothing. And his life is going nowhere. He lives in California, an actor without much work who makes ends meet by waiting tables. When his mother dies he heads back to New Jersey for her funeral. In Andrew's case home is definitely not where the heart is. We will soon see that there are very good reasons he has cut himself off from his home life, from the world he once knew and has no desire to return to. But a funny thing happens. Off his meds for the first time in ages Andrew's world begins to open up. He's feeling things again. Home begins to feel like home, but not because of his family or friends. It is a girl he has just met who changes everything, who opens Andrew up to the possibilities of finally finding out who he really is and living a life all his own.This is a coming of age story with great charm and the most credit for that of course goes to Zach Braff. This movie is his baby, he's the writer, the director, the star. As a writer he plotted out a great story. As a director he framed that story beautifully. And as a star he brings to life an incredibly compelling character. Andrew Largeman has never really had a life to speak of but when he returns home everything changes in a matter of days. And Braff wonderfully captures the feeling as Andrew takes his tentative first steps out into the world. Braff is certainly helped by the fact he has a wonderful performer to play off of in Natalie Portman. She plays Sam, the quirky girl who changes Andrew's life. Andrew falls for her immediately and why wouldn't he? She's the type of girl who once you get a hold of you never want to let her go. But will Andrew allow himself to embrace the possibilities presented by this new relationship? Or has he been scarred too much to ever really love at all?All in all Garden State is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It's fascinating to watch Andrew try to finally construct a little life for himself. It's emotional as you watch him try to come to grips with his past. And it's heartwarming as you watch him begin to love this young woman who comes out of nowhere to change his life. Braff is very good in playing Andrew but it's Portman who is really the scene-stealer. Sam is a strange young girl, a compulsive liar who somehow is still relentlessly charming. And at least she admits she's a liar and apologizes for it. Sam is vulnerable, she just chooses to protect herself in a different way than others might. Portman captures all this girl's myriad quirks beautifully and creates a truly memorable character. Braff plays off of her and the chemistry between the pair is probably more than anything else what really makes the movie work. At its heart the movie has that great coming of age story. And Braff shoots the film beautifully, a visual love letter to his home state. The collection of songs Braff chose to use in the film fit so well, the soundtrack ultimately picking up a Grammy Award and serving as the final perfectly fitted piece to a very well-constructed film. In the end Garden State is a charming, entertaining and thoroughly satisfying film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow! I loved it even more the 2nd and 3rd time!,I watched the director's commentary straight after watching this film for the first time. I immediately watched it all over again and loved it even more.Sometimes it's okay to have a film explained to you before you can really appreciate it (why do you think we all have to read Shakespeare at school?!).It's slow but that's because not much actually happens. The film spends time developing like-able characters who add to the sweet storyline about how a young man finds himself and what he want from life.The soundtrack was absolutely perfect too.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
have I missed something here....?,"After having sat through the most painful hour and whatever of my life I searched for the film on the inter-web in an effort to find out how panned it got by critics only to find, much to my dismay, that it was universally adored! Every single review was positively glowing with the odd random bemused review, from a disgruntled observer (from those people who watched the film with their eyes and ears open perhaps?) I really hope that I'm not alone in thinking that this movie was the most over-rated piece of cinema ever made and surely purely for Braff's own self anointment?! I feel so strongly about this film that I may no longer be able to watch scrubs for an overwhelming urge to smash JD's face. I really hope that this is all a big joke by Braff and that he secretly laughs to himself every time the film is given praise! In an effort to offer a fair and balanced review it is necessary to highlight the film's good points...a tough one..I suppose the shins aren't that bad...and Portman is hot...thats it though.",,Anonymous,Romance
Middling low-level relations drama which suffices more-so blows away.,"Sad to say, Garden State is one of THOSE sorts of American independent films; the kind wherein its characters perform tap-dances for their sweethearts and will suddenly make strange, random noises with movements because they're ""unique"" and ""no one has ever done that before, nor will they ever"". This, the character deduces, is the credence behind doing such a thing – a justification born out of the fact what you've just witnessed is unique in the history of humankind and it makes them stand out in history as a result. In spite of its own erratic and eccentric nature, Garden State is far from something you have neither seen nor heard before: a sweet, although often trying film; one made with the best of intentions that doesn't work all of the time but one with a regimented character study and a proper attitude towards those with special needs.The film's jarring opening, to a physical extent, in its depiction of a passenger jet full of people going nuts in the midst of what appears to be a failed on board terrorist attack put to some Arabic music does not match where the film thinks it is being equally jarring in a spiritual sense later on. Crammed into the middle of the plethora terrified people desperately trying to remedy the situation sits Andrew Largeman, played by Zach Braff. Andrew sits and does exactly that, sits and stares dead-ahead as if nothing at all were happening. When it's revealed to us that he was merely dreaming, we're aware that for such a nightmare to be accepted during its runtime suggests a seriously spaced out individual. Andrew is an actor living in Los Angeles, but he moonlights as a waiter in an oriental restaurant on account of not being in the big time. Here, he must suffer the foolhardy patrons of a place which attracts the kinds of people who believe ""ASAP"" constitutes a word and enjoy their fair share of racial slurs aimed at the place.Disconnected but not yet totally out of it, Andrew is hit with the news that his mother has died back home in New Jersey, and he takes it on himself to travel back for the formalities. Once back, we are struck by how buoyed and exuberant all of his old friends are at seeing him; Andrew, by comparison, is understated and hushed – he has been desensitised by his Hollywood escapade, and it shows. One spends the briefest of moments looking for parallels between the Studio dominated American film-making West and cheaper, less fame dominated projects such as Garden State, and how the former can have the effect that it does on Andrew when all around him are more normalised and more down to Earth people merely greeting their respective friend.It is during an unfortunate incident involving a dog in a doctor's surgery that introduces the one person who lives in his town who'll come to affect Andrew's stay here more than any fallout from a bereavement seemingly will. She is Natalie Portman's character named Sam, someone who's familiar with Andrew's work back in California and singles out his performances as a person with special needs the most. Things progress and we discover why it is that this may have touched her as much as it did, whereas Andrew man is quite enjoying the authenticity that comes with communicating with someone like Sam. Sam is scatty, perky and random – someone seemingly too autistic to feel the anxiety which comes with communicating with someone you recognise. Her core characteristic of lying compulsively is dwarfed only by the fact she still has a Christmas tree up in the corner of her house in spite of the fact it's far from being in season. Andrew does, of course, have the potential for partners at one of the many parties his old friend hosts, but these are fast and loose women - Sam is more ""O.C.D."" than she is ""L.S.D."" and this encourages Andrew all the more.The film is, of course, a love story about someone buoyant and quirky meeting someone the polar opposite but having them fall in with one another anyway. The feminine participant in this case is the talkative, energetic one and this provides the film opportunity to have its exchanges driven by the woman who's ultimately opening up the man's world to conversation; interaction and socialisation where previously there was something more meek. Everything good about the film aside, it does fall back into the sorts of gnawing clichés often synonymous with works such as these while a lot of the behaviour of the characters away from the central pairing and in regards to the supporting acts seems inconsistent with how they'd truthfully react. When Andrew encounters what might be classified as 'grave robbing', I'd expect him to react a little more forcefully and never return to those circles again. But there is enough there to enjoy in the department of key character dynamic, a film that is light and watchable despite a subject matter veering on pretending to be more hard-line and a film that worked better than it should.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good job Zach,"The only thing that is amiss with this movie is the pacing, but I guess it was part of tone and setting the movie needed.A touching romantic escapade for Portman and Braff.

"touching slice of life, but no classic","Garden State is heartfelt and amusing on a small scale. There are numerous mildly clever lines and shots. The first hour flies by and absorbs the viewer with its deadpan look at mid-20s angst. The film drags a bit in its second hour. The final half-hour of the film is disappointing - instead of trying to resolve any of its interesting plot lines, the film becomes a simple ""Will-he-or-won't-he?"" love story. Braff is solid as the bland, quiet center of the film. Portman annoys initially, coming across as forced, but settles into a groove as she stops trying to convince us her character is eccentric. The side characters provide most of the humor. The love story is well-played and believable. A good film that could have been great, and is worth seeing. Zack Braff's combined contributions to this film are impressive enough to make me curious to see his next project.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Surprisingly funny, artistic, loving, not to be missed","While I enjoyed Zach Braff in ""Brokenhearts Club"", I never realized Zach was such a versatile actor and extraordinary writer. ""Garden State"" is a beautiful mix of dramatic art with surprising comedy at every turn. You'll fall in love with Natalie Portman, and you might begin to wonder if there's more to Jersey than the ""Sopranos."" If you've ever questioned your life, whether you're in the right place or doing what you're meant to, I think you'll really enjoy this.Having grown up in jersey I may be biased towards this film, but the strangest thing about the movie is the title.

"Great concept, insufficient execution","Hmmm, I saw Garden State last night just before bed. When I went to bed I was trying to decide if I liked it...And, furthermore, if it was a good movie so, it is a good movie concept that was executed between average and well. It wasn't executed to the point that this movie is epochal, but I didn't fast forward through any parts either. The beginning was slow. The middle was intriguing as hell, and the end was hard for me to believe. It was surprisingly funny. I didn't expect that from the previews. Natalie Portman plays a character somewhat similar to that played by Kate Winslett in Eternal Sunshine, but in a different way. Portman's character seems to be more innocent as well, and I don't think she played it as well. This movie is an outstanding concept with a script that was one or two revisions from complete. I recommend it, but it is overrated on IMDb.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sam (Natalie Portman) isperfectly dazzling, reminiscent of the free-spirited yet fragile, naivegirl everyone knows.

For the Under 25 Crowd Only (or those with stunted emotional maturity),"I'm 43 years old. ""Garden State"" was excruciating for me to watch. I found the thing narcissistic, overbearingly precious, stilted, pretentious, unrealistic, and worst of all--dull. But I will concede that I would probably have viewed this ""Graduate"" rip off a bit more favorably back when I was in my twenties. That was back when I was a dumbass who thought the world revolved around me (and also back when ""screaming into the abyss"" would have seemed ""cool"" instead of just a sophomorically obvious attempt at metaphor). Writer/Director Zach Braff might--just ""might""--have been able to pull off something less cloying, obvious, immature, and vomitously faux intellectual if he had turned the directorial reigns over to someone else. The script has some good moments, but they are far outweighed by the monstrous love Braff's camera has for his own blank face and the equally blind love he has for his own often-stilted and pretentious dialogue. An experience filmmaker would have known how to trim away the self-love and nonsense and made a real movie out of this mess.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

one of the best,"this has been a really great movie.. the sound track is off the hinges. braff personally selected each song.. the way he ties in the song with the emotion of the movie is crazy. the two ways that this is best seen is when the tri are screaming ontop of the junk and simon and garufunkels the only living boy in new york was played. or at the end of the movie frou frou's delicate let got.. two words that mean so much. i believe that that song symbolizes ""large"" letting go of the pain, and the depression of his mother's passing, him letting go of the pills he thought he needed and him letting of of the threshhold his father had over him-- the next part in that song is there's beauty in the break down- the beauty in large's break down was he got to find himself, know him self and fatefully, DEAL with him self. this movie has great lines and memorable ones as well. the movie is so simple yet has a complicated complexity that is out of this world. i would definitely advise any one who likes movies to see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
ugh,"Alright, so most of you and your comments are totally perplexing me. How desperate are some of you for a decent film that you are ushering this amusing but immensely flawed picture in as the greatest film of the year? I'm sorry, but this film was nothing but a let down and inconsistent, despite best efforts.And I don't mean to seem condescending in any way. I'm simply stating my feelings, which, in a bias way, I deem truthful and right. So...The film started itself out on an interesting foot, slow and capable but engaging and endearing. It makes us care about the lead character, who, I might add, is quite the fox. Amusing scenes at his work as well as his mother's funeral and reception build the audience up for a calculated, dark, and moody film exploring the psyche of a confused young adult.But right about the time Natalie Portman hits the screen, and she's very good, the sh*t truly seems to hit the fan...hard. Plugging The Shins mindlessly and for no decent reason other than ""because"" starts the pitfall. Then the erratic chain of events that ensues merely causes the film to crumble. While I enjoyed some of the scenes at Portman's house, everything rang false and flat, deriving from a rocky script, not poor acting.The tension with the father, which is supposed to explain the troubled Braff's ways and lack of emotion, comes across WAAAAY underdeveloped and lackluster--completely dull and emotionless. How can we care about a relationship with a father that is one dimensional and boring? How can we care if things get patched up when we never really understand anything but anger and confusion between the two? It's rather ridiculous.The film tries to end with the stupid hunt for the necklace that only has some hack, sappy memory thought up from a cereal box in the 1950s, and comes across as just that. Where the film could have been more focused on the internal issues conflicting the characters, as well as more deliberate, both of which seemed most plausible at the film's beginning, instead Braff decides to take the trite road to appease the dull and simple-minded. Ending a lifetime of trouble with his father in a stupid monologue over a bed while laying his hand on his father's chest rang false and ridiculous. And the whole ""I'm leaving...OOPS, no I'm not, I love you so"" ending and the kiss out into darkness could not have been more cliché and more opposite the movie's tone and feeling set-up in the first few frames.I don't how something so promising could go wrong, other than the fact that Braff got bored and lazy. In the end, I was simply nothing short of disappointed and sit here now incredibly confused how anyone could be anything less. This film is one that will be heralded by few and then drift off into complete obscurity...boo with a capital B.",,Anonymous,Romance
Unbelievable,"When I first went into Garden State I was expecting an overrated sappy movie like ones I had seen many times before. However I can honestly say this was the best movie I have seen in a long long time. The camera work is flawless, the music choice amazing, and the acting took my breath away. How someone could actually criticize this movie is beyond me. I found Braffs directing brilliant and the way he interacted with Portman seemed so natural like they could be a real couple. This movie was heartfelt I have seen it twice and cried both times. Peter Sarsgaard's acting was pleasantly surprising and I cannot wait until he appears in more movies. I now see Zach Braff in a totally different view, with much more respect, and I have always loved him in Scrubs, but in a totally different way. I hope Braff continues creating.A 15 out of 10, and I don't think I am allowed to score that high but it was just that amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Looking for a new idea of home...,"Who would have thought that the unassuming kid from Scrubs would turn around and create such a poignant, funny, unassuming film? In the same vein as Rushmore and Napoleon Dynamite, Zach Braff's deadpan, existential Garden State is an outstanding debut. Braff (who also wrote and directed) stars as Andrew Largeman, a heavily sedated actor who returns home for the first time in a decade for his mother's funeral. Largeman's claim to fame is that he once played a retarded athlete in a MOW. While Braff's character observes life through lithium-glazed eyes and a passive attitude, Garden State is filled with energetic and unpredictable characters. Stellan Sarsgaard plays a moody grave digger who steals jewelry off the corpses he buries; and Natalie Portman brings an adorable depth and humor to Sam, an epileptic, pathological liar who slowly falls in love with Largeman. All of Braff's characters are effortlessly likable as they continuously take stock of their lives and struggle with their angst. There's a particularly hilarious scene involving a hardware store employee trying to bring Largeman in on a pyramid scheme that should make everyone wonder what happened to the people they lost touch with after high school. The film's real trick though is the way it lets a lot of exposition hang in the air without forcing the story forward, relying instead on wonderfully funny gags, a thoughtful soundtrack and smart dialogue. Nothing is made of Sam's condition, or Sarsgaard's disturbing habits. Even Largeman's relationship with his psychiatrist (who also happens to be his father) is allowed to unfold rather matter-of-factly. It's a decision that can backfire very easily. But Garden State pulls it off and leaves you anticipating Braff's next move.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

You'll feel like you know these people,"Garden State is a fun little movie where the characters are real which is what makes it funny. I grew up in New Jersey and still run into high school friends who, 18 years later, still haven't really changed. Garden State is touching and funny and cleverly written. Its is also well acted and the characters have depth beyond most characters in a comedy. The only problem I had with it is that Braff tries desperately not to make a ""hollywood"" film yet he ends up giving us an ending that is text book generic teen movie/romantic comedy. Not that the ending ruins the movie but its a bit annoying that this movie is hailed as a breakthrough change of pace but its ending is anything but. I sat there thinking ""in any other movie the ending will be this, I wonder how this one will end. Oh, the same way.""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nicely Done For Newbie,"This might be the other side of Zach that people didn't quite know about. Even though this is his debut directorial movie, he does seem to have a talent for it, maybe a little more than his acting skill.Garden State follows the life of a quietly depress young man as he return home to his mother funeral after estrange his family for 9 years, there he met up with his old friend and a girl that give the new meaning to his life.What I like about this movie is the characters in this movie are pretty rich and the storyline is quite solid though predictable. This movie might not be to everybody liking since it quite lengthy and the pace is quite slow. Sam portrait by Natalie Portman is one of my favorite characters. She does a brilliant job here. Zach does also deliver a better performance than what normally seen on Scrub. And I also got to praise him on his direction, which has been done brilliantly for the newbie. The only problem is the ending, which is not being wrap up properly.Recommendation: Natalie Portman Fan Will Love This Movie.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B) Thank you for reading.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Nice debut performance, but a recycled script","""Garden State"" is another of these ""indie""-type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama. Oddly enough, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly big-name actors as well). Where the picture is lacking is in Zach Braff's script, which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.When you're as young as Braff is, you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder. Braff's experience looks to be from watching movies, then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie. In Garden State, he plays Andrew Largeman, a semi-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to bury his mother, who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years. He appears to have no feeling about any of this; he has no relationship with his father, who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a freak accident as a six-year-old, and has no particular despondency over losing his mother (in fact, he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his, who works as a cemetery grave-digger). It all smacks heavily of ""Beautiful Girls"", also about a guy who returns to his hometown to ""find himself"" and hang with his old friends, with a little ""Ordinary People"" thrown in on the side.It's really a miracle Braff could accomplish anything at all in his life, given his father and his useless friends (I'm surprised he didn't kill himself), who are still living their ""lives"" as though they're still in high school, partying with dumb bimbos, drinking and drugging, etc. None of them even recognize him from his TV role as the ""retarded quarterback"" (Natalie Portman's character, the most aware person in the movie, does), and say things, like ""Hey, I remember you from Junior year"". These guys are such losers, for them, watching television would be a cultural leap forward. Even one friend, who made millions inventing a silent Velcro, has no real reason to live, because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying. And you don't need big money to party like a high school sophomore.Braff, it is revealed, is heavily medicated, which keeps from ""feeling"" and dealing with anything, really, like an adult would. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman) a sort-of lost girl, who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10-year-old in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size. Anyway, they fall in love, and Braff learns to ""feel"" again. The clichés come fast and furious. Braff has a long delayed heart-to-heart talk with his cold, distancing father and tells him What It Is and The Name Of The Game. In one scene, Braff and Portman are in the millionaire kid's house, playing touchy-feely is front of a giant fireplace, and the bit is so routine, so standard movie-schtick, I swear, I half-expected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire. In another, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to get his junk refilled, and Liebman tells him (in easily the worst line in the movie) ""The body can play tricks on you. I once found my ex-best-friend's cufflinks in my wife's purse, and I didn't have an erection for a year and a half."" Obviously, no licensed physician would ever say that, but it's dirtbag poetry, a nod from Braff to, I guess, his loser friends to let them know he's still thinking of them, just as the ""37"" joke in ""Clerks"", was Kevin Smith's nod to his dirtbag buddies.Anyway, Braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope; the story plays itself out predictably. But if you're going to have a movie that's wall-to-wall clichés, at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it. And Braff does. He has the right sort of vacancy, of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonked-out Andrew both real and poignant, and Natalie Portman (also of Beautiful Girls) gives the movie a big lift. With her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood, she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mother, and Peter Saarsgard (though much better in ""Shattered Glass"") is notable as the gravedigger friend. I would recommend ""Garden State"" if you can't get enough storybook romance out of movies, but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece, they're just clueless. Braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot, write in a few ""f**ks"" and ""awesomes"" and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material. It doesn't.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Waste of Time and Money,"We were two of three people in the theater, and with no one behind us and beside us we were able to stand up from time to time just to keep from screaming at the dumbest film we have ever seen.I think the script was penned by about 15 persons who were handed blank sheets of paper -- to write anything regarding these characters.  Then all these chapters were gathered, with a few rewrites to connect the stories. That's how horrid this film is.The differing speeds of the film were arbitrary -- as in, HUH, what's the purpose for that?  So many scenes were stupid, ditto the props and the costuming.  And what's with the leading male character's red, red lips?  The abyss, the sneak-peeks, the gerbil set-up -- everything was so forced.  And the dialogue -- not to mention the vulgarities -- was awful.Upon leaving, we asked the one other viewer her thoughts.  ""Heavy,"" she replied.  So I guess that's it -- we were just too dumb to appreciate so esoteric a film.At one point, the screen was dark and quiet.  We thought that was the end.

Andrew has been kept in a place for physic evaluation after his addiction to antidepressants nearly lead to his downfall. Upon returning home, he spends his days aimlessly wandering around the town, reacquainting with old friends, and just trying to come to terms with life and its many mysteries. But aren't we all.He eventually meets Sam, an offbeat woman who claims to be a pathological liar and is just all around strange and off-putting to someone with a closed-mind. I was beginning to write off Garden State as unconvincing indie-fare until I was met with Natalie Portman's character, who breeds life into a film that was desperately seeking it up until that point in time. As always, I've found her to be one of the most charming actresses, and here, she comfortably fills her character with the eccentricities and motifs she's uniformly known for.The two hit it off, and for the remainder of the film, exchange in bizarre conversations, discuss how ""screwed up"" each of their families are, and while Andrew always appears sulky and directionless, Sam seems to always be overflowing with an unidentifiable joy. This is most likely why she has been dubbed the ""manic pixie dream girl,"" a stereotype which can be applied here rather fittingly.Braff's sensitive direction works in the film's favor, and he appears to be a young prodigy when it comes to directing characters and uses a variety of exciting shots to prevent monotony. However, monotony comes into play due to the screenplay's lack of ideas. I mentioned how I was pleased to see a character like Natalie Portman's Sam walk on screen, but in the end, it was not a strong enough thing for me to recommend the entire one-hundred and three minute experience. The experience is overlong, tedious, sometimes dreadfully noneventful, and all around, vaguely uninteresting. This sort of romance was documented much more powerful in (500) Days of Summer.Somehow, I feel that if this film didn't immediately bandwagon the ""indie, hipster"" genre of film that is increasingly becoming so popular and took a more nonchalant, modest approach in terms of writing, this wouldn't have happened. I too feel that this is a setup that heads straight in the direction of humanity-driven mumblecore, and in the hands of the Duplass brothers, this would've become a very miraculous film. Put in the hands of a first time director, it comes off as a rather shaky first step, but you can still tell and feel that something bigger and more divine is likely to emerge.I find myself placing Garden State beside the three Wes Anderson pictures I don't totally adore or recommend but feel that there is something there I am just unable to grasp. I can see some people loving the film and that is perfectly acceptable, and in that case, I encourage readers to disregard my opinion. It's truly difficult to explain why I am not recommending Garden State as a whole. It is filled with whimsy and charisma, but it never does much with either, and I can only sum it up like I summed up Wes Anderson's Rushmore; it wasn't that funny and it wasn't that interesting.Starring: Zach Braff and Natalie Portman. Directed by: Zach Braff.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gets you thinking,"First, this film is the second film that really reminds me of my girlfriend Annie. Annie can you guess the other movie? Inside jokes aside.. Very few films really surprise me anymore. This film was the second film in the last few years that really got me thinking about all I have to be thankful for and all that I have to lose, if I don't recognize these people's importantance in my life and tell them what they mean to me then I could see a chance to create a lasting and meaningful relationship.I know what you guys are thinking, ""Dude its just a movie.."" but great films have the power to open your eyes to what you have, what have to lose, and these great films tell you to value everyday and your lovedones. In case anyone is wondering the other film to blow my mind in the last couple of years was the critically mixed viewed Cameron Crowe masterpiece ""Vanilla Sky"". Braff has definite talent. This film should the Oscar attention that monster got. I am calling for another rise of the independent film at the Oscars; the likes of which the film-going public hasn't seen since ""Boys Don't Cry""! Again Braff has talent that should not be over looked.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like Zach!,"'Garden State' came out in the Uk on December 10th. I had heard wonderful things about it from friends and relatives in the US - I wasn't disappointed...From start to finish, the film made me laugh and cry. I thought the opening in which we met Braff lying emotionless in bed. Listening to the answer machine message from his dad about his mother's death was disturbing and really drew me in.So many memorable moments: The funeral, touching and funny, the party scenes, the scan scene...And as for the dialogue - well, sharp and witty. I don't think I will ever forget Natalie Portman's dancing in her bedroom - just to be 'unique' or Zach Braff's touching comments about what makes a 'home' in the swimming pool.Even those touching moments were funny; the fact that he couldn't swim! As a mid twenty-something, This film really spoke to me. It's that question we all dread. We've graduated university, got jobs....then what? Fantastic...just a shame it is not on wide release here...One of the best films I have seen in ages! 9/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
best of 2004-so far,"Garden State is a film with beautiful cinematography, witty societal jabs, and lovable characters.Braff has been knocked for his film because it is ""flawed"" in some technical or story-structure way, but the truth is: the film works and it's very deep.We have the flowery love story, but at the core of the film is feeling. Braff goes back to his HS friends and they're all drowning away their pains with drugs, and then his story of doing legal drugs to numb his personal pain, anyway, the film is about how pain and love are natural and must be felt.Feeling is the meaning of life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Speaks for a specific generation?,"I think Zach Braff's work speaks for any generation...around the same age. What makes the movie work is the great use of music that tempers the lead-ins to the next thought in the script. However, it's an old way of doing things...but it's a great musical set up for each sequence.The critique that this story is the film of the 80's generation is knee jerk; it's a great film....I hope Zach can repeat this success. However, the selection of music is not unlike Simon & Garfunkel or Cat Stevens; folk music of that rolls along with each theme sequence that's about the same tempo/pace of the story line. There's no obnoxious music or obnoxious roles here....just a great little tale that Zach moved from paper to screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't like it.,"Didn't like it.  Saw it awhile ago.  Falls apart in the last act.  Like allof the sudden Zach Braff realizes he has nothing to say.  I've heardit described as ""a college film on steroids"" which I agree with100%.  Natalie Portman is a goddess.   She and Peter Sarsgaardare highlights as are some wonderfully bizarre moments whichprompt laughter.  But please... don't show me how beautiful andachingly well-shot 20-something anhedonia is.  I'm living through itand it sucks.  It hurts.  People are destroying themselves and ZachBraff wants to show off how clever and funny he is and what greattaste in music he has.  He's trying to express the malaise of ourgeneration from the point of view of a privileged upper class drugaddled college grad which is FINE but he never shows any realpain or ugliness.  Sure there are upsetting situations for thecharacters but they seem absent-mindedly tacked on.  Like NataliePortman's epilepsy or pathologically lying.  Introduced to make usfeel something for her and then DROPPED COMPLETELY.  Realproblems make cameos but are ultimately sacrificed for stylizedennui.  I DO NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE.

Whacky comedy that is strangely meaningful and relevant,"Garden State is little short of a revelation. Screwball, mindless comedy has been successfully twinned with original and intelligent script writing.Andrew Largeman has been in a lithium-induced haze since childhood. The heavy-duty antidepressants block out all emotions and leave him in a state where nothing bothers him very much. The opening sequences of the film are quite disorientating until we realise that we are seeing the world from Andrew's viewpoint. But then there is a series of events that involve Andrew travelling across states to his mother's funeral, a confrontation with his estranged father, and a chance meeting with a girl who is as zany as he is but in a totally different way. He decides to come off the lithium and experience life first hand.The basic bad-taste elements of Garden State would barely lift it above the status of an average to good goofball comedy. There's Andrew's much talked-about minor screen role where he played a retarded kid more convincingly than a kid who is really retarded; a dog that tries to hump him and another dog that can masturbate itself; Andrew's old school mate has become a cop and practices being convincing at it when screaming at motorists, and Andrew's girlfriend will invent a random noise to convince herself of her originality. But the movie's real strength is not just that these gags, which might not be to everyone's taste, are done surprisingly well. It's almost as if Garden State manages to reach us on levels we had forgotten were important. When Andrew (who doesn't like making time for his ungracious dad) goes to his mother's funeral, his father quips about how he managed to 'fit it in' and about how it's important to 'find time to say goodbye.' But the irony is that it is Andrew, screwed up as he is, who manages to really say goodbye to the past. Not only that, his sincerity reaches through the professional wall that his psychiatrist father has erected and helps the old man also come to terms with the past.Natalie Portman (as Sam) is equally dramatic in the unexpected impact her character has on us. She is a compulsive liar and not overly bright but, like Andrew, she comes to an acceptance of herself that is more truthful and revealing than the more successful characters in the film. While the visual jokes are standard off the wall - and quite good in that sort of way - the dialogue is scintillating and touches us on a much deeper level. There is a pathos in that these two characters, who have few qualities and little successes to write home about, manage to reach a harmony with life that we find not only intellectually satisfying but that most of us would perhaps want to strive to emulate. Suddenly the camel trying to pass through the eye of a needle refers not just to a material achievement that can blind us but to the mental and emotional garbage we carry around in our carefully constructed personas. Andrew, experiencing ordinary life as if from out of an emotional black hole, manages to analyse his situation simply and intelligently, unencumbered by the baggage that most of us have built up by the time we have reached his age. The effect is humbling.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is your brain off drugs,"Okay, here's the concept. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) has been on antidepressants for 16 years, ever since he was a young boy, and thus has not been able to deal with some fundamental issues in his life. Suddenly, his mother passes away, and he returns to Newark, New Jersey, to attend her funeral and face his past.Only he doesn't, really, and that's one of the problems with this film. The media hype leads you to believe Largeman must deal with some deep dark secret, and you expect a major confrontation with his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm). We get neither of these things.What we get instead is an array of characters that are each, in their way, as weird and peculiar as Largeman himself. I guess the idea is that, no matter how strange one's circumstances may be, normal is relative. (Hey, that would make a good tag line.)But that's like saying that all families are dysfunctional. It's a truism, a self-evident truth. And besides, Tolstoy said it already, and better, in the opening line of ""Anna Karenina"""" ""Happy families are all alike. Unhappy families are each unhappy in their own way.""Don't get me wrong. The cast of ""Garden State"" is wonderful. As Largeman, Zach Braff is physically reminiscent of a young John Ritter in his ""Three's Company"" glory days. As the mother of one of his friends, Jean Smart is a dead ringer for Shirley Jones in ""The Partridge Family"". Ian Holm is in fine form as always. And Natalie Portman shines as compulsive liar Sam.There are some funny gags along the way, too. You haven't lived until you've heard ""Three Times a Lady"" sung with a Jersey accent. And there is a rather unusual dog trick you've probably never seen before, and probably won't care to see again.Ultimately, however, all this weirdness becomes too much to absorb, and this critic's brain simply shut off. To put it another way, all this dysfunctionality is ... well, dysfunctional. ""Garden State"" is just too damn quirky for its own good.",,Anonymous,Romance
An impressive debut from Zach Braff,"""Garden State"" concerns Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff), a young man who returns home for his mother's funeral after a long estrangement from his family. Medicated into numbness, he soon meets the carefree Sam (Natalie Portman) who causes him to re-examine his life.Granted, the premise is pretty simplistic and the supposed profundity is somewhat tiring but Braff somehow manages to make the film palatable. Despite very little happening plotwise, the script draws us in with deft characterization.Bringing those characters to life are a cast of capable actors. Braff does a good job, as does Portman, and their chemistry together is considerable. Peter Sarsgaard stands out in support while the rest of the cast is up to snuff as well.Braff's first-time direction is impressive and features a plethora of attractive visuals. His soundtrack selections drew high praise as well, and rightly so. While one could argue that the selections reek of hipness they nevertheless attest to a discerning ear.Ultimately, I found ""Garden State"" to be a little insubstantial but I guess it's really a mood piece that harks back to character-driven films of the seventies like ""Five Easy Pieces"". It's entertaining in it's own way but certainly not as profound as Braff intended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best movie I've seen in years,"Zach did an excellent job of writing, directing and acting in a thoroughly engrossing film. My concern that Natalie Portman was in it to play the goofy young chick was completely unfounded; she was excellent in this sad and entertaining role.After about 70 minutes I had to check my watch to see what time it was, I had no idea how long I had been sitting there, it felt like I had been watching the movie for two hours and 15 minutes at the same time.

It was the smile that I couldn't wipe off my face which made me realize what a wonderful and ingenious movie Garden State is!I typically like to look up a movie I know I'm going to see and review it on IMDb. When I looked up this movie and saw that Mr. Braff not only starred in the picture, but also wrote and directed it, lets just say I had doubts about whether I would go see it or not. I went anyway. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy the story, but I was extremely moved by Mr. Braff and Ms. Portman's performances.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who only has one foot in the large pool of indie films and can't decide to jump in or not.This film will make you want to swan dive in with a splash!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
a quirky love story,"This film was about a loser wanna-be actor, Andrew, who returns home to attend his mom's funeral.

He stays for a few days and hangs out with some old friends, one who is a pothead and the other is a millionaire from an invention. He meets a girl, Sam, and they talk and soon he is going to her house. They spend every day together. She's quirky in a good way, with her pet cemetery and habitual lying, and soft helmet.So, the ending is predictable. Andrew must choose to leave or stay with his new relationship.The acting and story were OK.

Thoroughly lousy film-making; Braff needs to be less impressed with himself,"Apart from the cloying pretension of the entire script, the hamfisted metaphors, the often frighteningly amateurish acting, and the fact that Zach Braff apparently thinks gazing emptily into the camera communicates some soul-stirring information on the nature of the character he plays, this film is very poorly done even on the most basic levels of film-making. Witness the repeatedly blown eyelines (for example, where the hell is he looking when the cop pulls him over on the motorcycle?), horrid and cliché shot selection, and abysmal characterisations... Some people have been giving this film a pass, saying ""not bad for a firt effort,"" or even claiming ""Braff really knows what he's doing behind the camera."" Well, as someone who's gone through a graduate film program, I can tell you, this IS bad for a first-time effort; Braff does not seem to know much about what he's doing behind the camera; and many of the blunders in this film would not be acceptable in a student film, much less a feature.2 things really bugged me. One, how the hell did he get Ian Holm to show up? Does he have pictures of him naked with a sheep or something? Two, and this is them kind of precious garbage that enrages me in films like this, good thing there's a vintage WWII era motorcycle lying around in the garage, complete with sidecar, because, y'know, it looks really neato. While saying nothing at all about character or story.I don't know Mr. Braff, but he seems to havepoured rather too much of himself into this flick, and convinced himself that virtually every cliché of 20-something ennui constitutes blinding, revelatory insight. I am at an utter loss to explain this film's 8 out of 10 IMDb rating, except to posit that those raving over how deep this film is are the same sort of self-involved, self-pitying spoiled rich white kids from Jersey, or similar environs, who seem to share Mr. Braff's conceit that their commonplace and often trivial hardships constitute the stuff of tragic melodrama.

The whole movie makes you feel good. While it starts of rather strange you start to understand this guys life and just how strange it is. Natalie was absolutely great in it. She brought a lot of emotion to the screen and I think she did an awesome job. Zachs stoner friend also does a great job and brings a lot of laughs to the movie.

Absolutely refreshing,"I didn't really know what this movie was all about before going to it, other than I had heard pretty good things about it.It was a refreshing break for movies as a whole. It's subtle sarcasm and wit are perfectly placed throughout the film, bringing in many laugh out loud moments.What it manages to capture though is the true gift: the real life aspects of comedy, disappointment, taking chances, fear, etc., are all so flawlessly blended together that the movie's pace is extremely natural and relaxing. Very rarely can a movie go from making you laugh out loud to feeling the tears come out with the character themselves so smoothly and realistically, but this movie manages to do that. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"True to life, honesty, pain, love.","Garden State Truth in relationships, real people telling stories, and life in all its possibilities. The lead actor wrote the script so its no wonder he tells the story brilliantly and with conviction. We immediately understand all the characters or at least try to. We even care about them....not something you can say for all films. A movie about going home....what we all fear at some point....especially for those of us who have been away for a while. We have changed and don't want those people who know the old us to think of us in that way any more. We must go and face our fears......and only when we do that can we find the truth and grow. Some may find this film slow moving, but I like the stillness, the unspoken, the subtle....its real. Sometimes we realize, like the main character, that our parents created all our issues, fears, and blocks in our life. So we accept these and learn from them.....and try to not be that way with our children. I guess this film makes me get into the philosophy of life....so that is good.

Garden State: 9/10,"I have no idea how to start this review. I already know it's going to be hard to write, because other movies that have affected me in this way are always hard to write. Garden State hit home (not literally, although I do live close by in Philadelphia) in a way that's impossible for words. But, I'll try to say why it's such a great movie, and not exactly this year's Lost in Translation, but pretty close.Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a mildly successful actor in Hollywood (but not successful enough that he can quit waiting tables) who returns to the title state, his home state, when he finds out that his mom has just died. He returns for the first time in nine years and meets old friends and new ones, including Sam (Natalie Portman). He realizes how weird his family is, as he also goes on a personal journey.As I was watching Garden State, I was reminded mostly of The Royal Tenenbaums, with not only the odd occurences, but the eclectic soundtrack, which, when paired up the often beautiful images that the film creates, turns into some of the most poignant and spectacular movie scenes of recent memory. One such scene in Garden State is when Andrew, Sam, and Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) are standing the rain, screaming, as Simon and Garfunkel's ""Only Living Boy in New York"" plays. It's a beautiful song, combined with a great image, which makes it all the more memorable. The movie's full of odd moments that hit you at home, with the odd cinematography, the too-real-it-can't-be-scripted dialogue (from Braff, who also directed), and the whole plot. The quirky atmosphere obviously won't appeal to everyone, but it never does.That's why it's so hard to talk about movies like this. It's quirky but not head-scratching (so it's not something like Eraserhead), and it leaves you feeling both happy and sad, and a feeling of contentment as you connect with the characters and go through what they're going through. That's the only reason Garden State doesn't get a perfect score. As the movie winds down, the quirkiness starts to go away and the movie becomes partially normal-something I normally wouldn't have minded, but since the movie played quirky, the change isn't welcomed. But other than that, this movie excels at being odd, memorable, and touching all at the same time.Braff is great in his drugged-up role. I've never watched Scrubs, so I can't judge based on his other performances, but he did a great job, nonetheless. Portman also surprised me with her complex character. It's a tough character to accurately portray. Sarsgaard, the only good part of Shattered Glass, doesn't have enough screen time for the character he was supposed to be, but he was good nonetheless.The symbolism throughout the movie is basic irony, and irony always works for me in films. Such examples are Andrew's mother dying in the bathtub and the aforementioned ""screaming the rain"" scene, and the type of car that Andrew drives and the speed in which he drives it. It's small things like that that make Garden State such a good film, and one that I'm sure will be easily watchable for multiple times.My rating: 9/10Rated R for language, drug use and a scene of sexuality.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pre-medication with Prozac recommended.,"What a depressing movie! This is like ""Clueless"" with everybody ten years older and STILL without a hint. The question it seems to pose is, ""What kind of meaning in life can people find when they have no values and don't believe in anything at all?"" All the characters in this film, and that includes those of the parental generation, either never acquired the sense of purpose that leads individuals to make plans, take risks and engage in long-term life projects, or abandoned it long ago. So all they're left with as a motivator is sexual attraction, and even then they need drugs or alcohol to get them going. That places them on a moral and aesthetic level that is certainly sub-primate. What's going to happen when the lust fades? Fortunately the movie doesn't continue that far, else I expect we'd be even more depressed.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""What do we do""?","Tons of mixed sensations and feelings were going through my mind as I watched this film, that even if it's not great, it's something that should clearly not be missed. The feelings about my own life and things I'm willing to do, as sensations about all these other movies of this type that have seemed so great to me.It's just something that takes a lot of courage; what Zach Braff has done with this film. To write, without thinking about anything else than fulfilling his most precious illusions no matter whatI imagine what crossed his mind while he was doing it, and he might have thought it as something impossibleAn actor with the little time in the business as him, looking for a shot It's gratefully amazing there are still some brave producers out there, who look for these things. Dan Halsted, Pamela Abdy and all the others involved in this project's productionYour courage has made some dreams come true.This is the part where I get emotional and inside personal stuff, but I needed to explain because I imagine what must have been for Zach Braff, being worried if people would like what he loved. Because he could have laughed harder than anyone in his set with the scenes, and those scenes would be shown months later to millions of persons around the world. And what if it wasn't funny for them? I can't say I had a blast with the movie, but I let go because of his situation; trying to figure out what was that anything he saw that probably the rest wouldn't I felt alleviated when the images where coming through. I've always wanted to write a script; primary objectives being writing about real life situations, with no starting or ending point, creating thought-provoking words that don't seem faked or manipulativeThese things are all in this script, somehow. Beautifully written words involving characters making reflections about the moment they're living in their lives. Sometimes the characters talk too much and they seem like nonsense but you can't tell if they're stoned or drunk since they could easily be; because everybody is always in that state. They're saying words most screenwriters are afraid of writing. Yes, Braff's screenplay is a little too profound, and not very spontaneous; but it doesn't matter because you've probably never heard those things before. I think two people can fall in love in less than a week timeHe is sure that can happen too.Braff has even put his own little preferences in there, like little moments when he does crazy or metaphoric stuff that you realize it can only come from the writer and director, and not from anyone else. Little mentions of actors and movies, probably his favorites (or not), hidden in there (Robert De Niro, ""Serpico"")The freedom he took, of doing another thing I've always dreamed of, that is putting the music and songs he knew were perfect for each moment. Without problems, he put those songs in the adequate places and they all fit perfectly. Those songs and other little things that probably had a lot to do with his own life, and didn't prevent him of realizing a film that is not worried about time and structure and it's living the moment. Just as Braff's characters say constantly, and then you can get what he's saying: ""This is life, that's how it is"". ""This is the moment"". And, in the most revealing part, the question I wrote at the top and we always end asking at some point: ""What do we do?"" I always end up enjoying this type of films, because they're similar, not maybe only in plot or story, but in ways they arrived to their realization. ""Love, Liza"" is the story of a man who looses his wife because she commits suicide, and leaves him a letter. The script was written by Gordy Hoffman, and it took his brother Phillip Seymour to get involved there so the movie was made. ""Igby Goes Down"", the story of an adolescent that stays away because of the events that happen in his family. A totally unknown Burr Steers turned what he thought as a novel to a written and directed movie coming directly from his hands. ""Garden State"" involves a guy whom his mom dies and his life in his home town for a few days after the funeral. This involves encounters with old friendships, plenty of talks and some romance. How do we compare these films? The first one is the life of a grown man that continues after an event; the second one is the same, but involving an adolescent; the third one involves a man in his 20's.Pro casting director Avy Kaufman achieves another excellent ensemble, which involved some of the director's preferences too. It's said Braff wrote Sam's role thinking of Natalie Portman. He has a good eye, because Portman achieves a wonderful job, looking beautiful and going crazy periodically. Peter Sarsgaard (Mark) comes from somewhere I can't imagine, to save his natural gifts as an actor and deliver greatly. Ian Holm is mayor words in the father's role, teaching acting lessons and shining in the minority. The rest of the cast is perfect, wherever they came from, they did their job right. And Braff, well, it was his whole project as a writer and director, and he did this film with a lot of passion. But he is also an actor, and puts a lot of passion into that too.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just Plain Awful,"This film will make you cry. Not because of any real emotional content, but because this is the state of independent film-making that succeeds financially. Every move in the film is so calculated, clichéd, and self-consciously ""quirky"" that it made want to walk out of the theatre. Zach Braff adds Bad Writer and Bad Director to Bad Actor, and drags the rest of the cast down with him in this saccharine wasteland. Really, there are no new or good ideas here. Every scene seems to have been examined for any element which was not as cutesy and ""quirky"" as it could be. If the scene was found to convey anything real or meaningful, it was swiftly replaced with something to please its target crowd of would-be hipsters and late-adopters who describe themselves as fans of the independent because thats the section in Sam Goody where they find the new Modest Mouse CD. This is not cinema. This is an 11th grade short story written by the kid who complains about not fitting in, but really takes pride in it. It shows an artistic voice more influenced by appearances than by something to say or show. Not to mention it looks awful. If you want to see a real endless abyss, watch this.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Beautiful Movie,"GARDEN STATE is the perfect blend of comedy, drama, and romance in my opinion. It's a bit of a tragedy, but not. It's filled with hope and sadness.

Favourite film of the year,"This film has a great storyline with a mixture of comedy and drama.The film is about a man called Andrew Largeman who is an actor and most recently played a retard in a film, and for the past 16 years has been on antidepressants. He receives a phone call from is dad and his dad tells him his mother has died. So Andrew has to come home back to Jersey for the funeral and decides to take a holiday from the antidepressants to see what his life would be like without them.This story is genius in my opinion. And what makes film great to watch is the great characters played by Zach Braff (he also wrote and directed it)and Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard and many other great characters who dot have such as big roles.I do recommend to watch this film especially if you are a fan of Zach Braff because he wrote and directed the film and last but not least starred in it as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
too quirky and clever for its own good...,"It must take a lot of courage for Hollywood's successful, glamorous, pseudo-intellectuals to make fun of average people and their pathetic lives and values. Like Sofia Coppola's ""look at how clever we are"" Lost In Translation, Zach Braff's GARDEN STATE is another smug, superior and condescending exercise in how a disaffected man  with the help of an adorable, and incomprehensibly available, girl  can mock the hapless and hopeless and ridiculous while reconnecting with a world not worthy of him. (A suggestion: let's save these guys the trouble, tell them they are too smart and sensitive for this world and shoot them.)Excessively quirky, as these films usually are, and hopelessly episodic, the film wants to be cool and wickedly ""inside""  a diversionary piece of satirical entertainment for the tuned-out, too-cool zombies who will delight in the laughs the film scores at the expense of, restrain yourself, a truly bad singer's rendition of ""Three Times a Lady"" sung at a funeral, a horny sight seeing dog, etc. It's all here. No obvious joke has been overlooked.Every scene, every set, every moment has a distracting ""cool"" element (the motorcycle with a sidecar, the house overrun by a habitrail, the mansion devoid of furniture in which characters get around in a golf cart, the abandoned boat at the bottom of a quarry). And just to make sure that you'll stay awake: the soundtrack cranks in to signal every scene change, every emotional beat.You might be able to entertain yourself through the movie by randomly moving props around in your head: what if Zach got around town in a golf cart and the former classmate who invented silent Velcro (too, too funny  not!) moved around his empty mansion in the motorcycle. Or lived in the boat at the bottom of the quarry. Nothing has any real reason for being in the movie  and that includes the characters. And when our filmmakers can no longer trust an audience to watch even a simple drama unless it is festooned with bells and whistles, we have much bigger problems than whether or not one overly medicated man finds love and rejoins the world.",,Anonymous,Romance
So much potential,"For a first time writer/director, I was impressed with Zach Braff and am pleased to see he has written more. At times the direction felt a little forced as if trying too hard to be ""artsy"" (slow mo.'s etc.) Many of the angles and shots were an obvious attempt to be an indy film but the writing was witty, poignant, and at times downright genius. I felt that some issues should have been focused on more like his relationship with his dad and the influence of music. Those points were rather vague when they should have been a main point of interest.Of course Natalie just lights up the screen, but Zach's performance was the stand out to me. His struggle with how to act and feel was truly affective.By far the greatest aspect of the film is the soundtrack. You just can't go wrong with The Shins and Nick Drake. It really will ""change your life"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful movie who will be most appreciated by people who are going trough the same stage in life as Braff's character...,","""Garden State"" is a movie about a young guy, wonderfully played by the young and multi-talented Zach Braff, who comes home for his mother's funeral. Step by step we learn to know him and his past. He may first seem a little weird, but slowly you will realize he's just an ordinary guy like you and me (I'm 20) who has been through a lot and who just tries to find some happiness, tries to find his place in the world without getting just another face in the crowd.This movie is full of characters that are just so beautiful and so vulnerable it (almost) makes you cry. Nathalie Portman is outstanding. She's so sad and wonderful at the same time. ""We may not always be as happy as you always dreamed we'd be, but for once, let's just allow ourselves to be whatever it is we are."" This is just one of the many beautiful and heartbreaking quotes the movie contains.It's unbelievable how a young man like Zach Braff can write, direct and take the leading role all by himself. Congratulations, you made a unique film which really made me thinking. I will never forget this oneI can hardly wait to see some more of your work.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Are you ""in it?""","Quirky and self-indulgent, Garden State is about moments. The story about a socially challenged guy's discovery of life without pills has some beautiful moments. And yet, the film comes across as moody overall. This is definitely not a movie that you could pull out of your personal collection and watch anytime. However, if you are in a lazy introspective kind of a mood, you could sink into a couch and watch the moments unfold at their leisurely pace. The acting makes the film better than it is. The actors make their characters completely believable even as they impart a bit of subtle humor to the story. Some scenes would stay in your mind for a long time while some mediocre ones fade away rapidly. A film about self-discovery has to suspend fantastic plot lines to be seen as realistic. However, by making that bargain Garden State requires the viewer to be in the right sort of mindset to appreciate it. Definitely watchable once though.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Impact of emotions!,"Remember a time, when you see a movie, that really gets you watching it. A movie, that leaves such an impact on you, you stay speechless for some time. And in that moment of silent serenity, you forget about all your troubles and become happy. Well, This movie is definitely one of those extraordinary films.The story of this film is about life. About living life. It actually is, in fact, quite a simple plot, but the way it is shown is truly remarkable. It sets of on a depressed mood, and gradually reaches a beautiful climax of a really positive epiphany at the end. This life defining atmosphere goes really well with every other aspect the movie uses, like philosophical dialogs between characters, family relationships, the main character's drama, etc. The performances of all the actors are, without a doubt, amazing. Zach Braff, who plays the main character, gives a terrific performance portraying a disturbed, puzzled young man, who is searching for something in life. Such a character is probably the embodiment of a massive number of teenagers and other young people in the world, who are searching for a purpose in life. Therefore, I think that any disturbed young soul, who watches this film, will feel a deep connection between himself and this character. Natalie Portman also gives an equally, if not an even better, appearance on screen. Her acting is truly flawless in this movie, and for that matter probably every other movie she has appeared in. And another appealing thing, worth mentioning, is the absolutely outstanding soundtracks of this movie. It is amazing how well the music matches the atmosphere. Seeing some of the dramatic scenes along with this astonishing music will touch you emotionally.So, all in all, Amazing story about life, followed by terrific performance and outstanding atmosphere. Three essential elements. which, combined, will surely make an emotional impact to anyone who sees this perfect movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good,"It took me a while, but finally i got round to watching this movie. The DVD had been waiting on my shelf for quite some time and i'm not sure why it took me such a long time to actually put it in the DVD-player. I guess the fact that several people i've spoken to call it one of their favorite movies. That always raises my expectations, which is a dangerous thing. But the danger of disappointment can't keep me away forever.Zach Braff is far from one of my favorite actors. I do enjoy ""Scrubs"" somewhat, but mostly because of John C. McGinley. And mentioning ""Scrubs"" i think that's the only place i've ever seen Zach Braff before. Or well, i might have seen him in other movies too but not so much that i would remember him. And that in itself says quite a lot.While i find Braffs performance in ""Scrubs"" to be quite mediocre, he's a lot better in ""Garden State"". His almost childish looks and rather shy and meek delivery fits perfectly here. He's the man who left his hometown as a boy, who's had psychological (real or imagined) problems ever since he was a child, and who now gets the chance to make peace with his past. His cautious personality is easily explained by a life spent on mind-altering drugs. The cast surrounding Braff is solid though not spectacular. Sarsgaard and Portman perform well. The one that steals the show though is Ian Holm who dominates every scene that he's in, although those are few and quite far between.The story itself in ""Garden State"" is not spectacular either. I guess that's part of the movies charm. It's a rather unpretentious drama with quite a lot of humor thrown in. The thing that i found most disturbing (and that lowered the grade by one point) is the ending. Someone wrote that it feels like the movie takes a different turn at the end, like the ending and the movie don't fit together properly. That's a good description because that was my feeling as well. Somehow the movie leaves the unpretentious past and tries to be some sort of ""large-than-life""-drama in the last ten minutes. It doesn't go down well. Since it was entertaining until then i'm going to let it pass, but the ending was nevertheless a disappointment.I rate this 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
2nd Favourite road trip movie of all time!,"Ok so I recently reviewed a few road trip films. This one is amazing. Portman and Braff are perfect combo.

A Great Portrait of Mid-Twenties Life,"This is a sweet little movie and it captures the modern mid-twenties life perfectly. This is probably because it was written and directed by a guy who is in his mid-twenties: Zach Braff. He's the weird character J.D. ""Scrubs,"" a great television show. The movie does a lot of things right: it explores how one childhood trauma can ruin your life, how you easily can become disillusioned with your parents (or embarrassed by them), and how there is a desire to get away from everything in your life - be it with drugs, moving to another state, or ignoring what bothers you most. I can identify with most of it - but that doesn't mean that I really wanted to watch it. There are some little funny vignettes but they are far apart. Portman is at her best though here - she definitely is the highlight of the movie and without her I don't know if I could have bared to watch. It was good BUT I thought the ending was a bit cliché and it just didn't seem to fit for me - maybe because it just didn't match some of the other realism in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Twenty-something movie!!,"I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, so one day I decided to rent it. Going into the movie, I thought that this was going to be one of those typical chick flicks with tons of cheesy romance and typical clichés. Well, I was wrong. This movie was something that most twenty-something movies strive to be, but never accomplish. It was a movie with characters that most people can relate to, with a plot that is solid as well. The acting was great from both Braff, Portman, and Skarsgard. I have been a fan of Zach Braff since I started watching Scrubs, but to expect such brilliance from such a young actor/director was unexpected. Needless to say, I love this movie and am buying it immediately. I look forward to any upcoming projects from Zach Braff in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

So what I get out of a film is a sense that I know these people and Natalie Portman stole my heart -- her giddy yet sad character was so hopefull. I'm giving this one a solid 9 because it had what I needed at this point. Some romance, some regret and more than a little but of earth.This was not an alarming film and not that original in it's premise but I really felt for the characters.

Garden State,"Garden State is one of those rare treats  an independent film that is not immersed in its own ego, and doesn't feel the need to show off some great new artistic effect to show you how clever it is. It is actually a very simple film; nothing complicated, nothing too showy. The reason this film works is the same reason that all films should work  an excellent script and strong performances all round. It needs nothing else, because these two facts alone raise it above most of the independent film scene's best, let alone the limp-by-comparison Hollywood efforts.The story revolves around Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff of TV's Scrubs fame), an actor from Los Angeles who returns home after nine years to go to his mother's funeral. Andrew has been on medication since he was 10 to numb his emotions, after a childhood accident. As he leaves his medication behind, he finally begins to show some true feeling for life as he revisits old friends and meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a free-spirited woman who leads Andrew to reconsider whether his life is as bad as he thought.The three main cast members  Braff, Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard (who plays Andrew's friend Mark)  all excel in their roles, without a flaw in sight. The biggest surprise is Natalie Portman who, after her emotionally-dead acting in the Star Wars prequels, shows what a great acting talent she is. All the characters are utterly believable, and this is helped by a script (also written by Braff) that is full of little quirks, yet also heaps on clever observances on real life. It also contains some razor sharp comedy and surrealism (a knight at the breakfast table, for one), that shows Braff as a man of many talents, able to infuse a serious story of rediscovery with quick bursts of humour.Garden State also looks amazing, with great cinematography which gives the film its atmosphere, mixing colours to portray the blandness of Andrew's LA life with stronger down-to-earth tones which makes Andrew's journey seem that much more realistic to the audience. We cannot help but be carried along with him as we await to see what results will come of him meeting so many people without his medication affecting his emotions. This is coupled with easily the best soundtrack of any film in 2004; it lifts the atmosphere up even higher, as it is not relegated to the background like many scores are, but instead is always present in the audience's mind. It is almost as if the soundtrack is another character in itself.If there are complaints to be made about the film, it is that towards the end it seems that the moral of the story  that life is what you make of it  is hammered home a little too forcefully. Also Ian Holm, although excellent as Andrew's father, doesn't really have a big enough role, and we are left wanting to see more of Andrew's relationship with him.But overall, Garden State is a very accomplished debut; a heart-warming drama that captures your attention from the word go.Rated: 9/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Natalie Portman makes Garden State shine,"I fell in love with Natalie Portman as soon she appeared on screen in this movie. She blew me away. She is great, awesome, amazing, but most of all she's real. She stands out in this movie's exceptional cast.The movie itself is well paced. It doesn't rush through any of the scenes, and that allows you to take it all in. Zach Braff has made an impressive first feature with Garden State and it will be fun to see what will come next.The things that stand out in this movie, beside Natalie Portman, are the music and the cinematography. The music is used in all the right places, and the scenes with no music at all gain strength from this. The soundtrack is superior. Other movies/directors have a lot to learn from this. The cinematography is beautiful. Simple and poignant. It adds to the context of the movie. If it's done deliberately or not I can't say, but I do know that shooting a movie with limited funds sometimes forces you to compromise. No matter what, they made it look great.As a final thought I'd just like to say that Natalie Portman would have given Hilary Swank a run for the money at the Academy Awards if only she'd been nominated. She obviously was overlooked.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An excellent coming of age movie.,"Andrew Largeman (Zack)is a man that just simply exist and does not live. Ever since a rather substantial happening in his childhood he has been on medication and estranged from his family. When his mother dies he ventures home and suddenly finds himself back in the places and time frame he left. It is here that he meets Sam (Portman). She is a utterly charming and quirky character. They get drawn towards each other and start to unravel their purpose and meaning of life. Zack Braff has written a really good story, but I feel that he should not have cast himself as the lead. Fair enough that apathy is a big part of his character but he is out shown by the other actors in all regards. Especially by Natalie Portman that is truly awesome and aspiring. Watch it, and if you want to see an adult view on relationship check out the stunning ""Closer"" also featuring Ms.Portman.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meh,"A lot of people laud movies like this one for not containing tons of explosions, meaningless sex, and kindergarten-level plotting. But let's face it; if you have trouble finding intelligent, stimulating movies you're just not looking hard enough. ""Garden State"" was not good enough to justify all the praise that was heaped upon it - nor was it good enough to really keep me interested.That's not to say I thought the movie was a total bust: Some scenes were handled perfectly. Examples: Zach Braff wakes up after a night of partying to find a man in a suit of armor staring at him; that's kind of what I expect to happen when I wake up confused and exhausted after a long night. Zach Braff's oddball millionaire friend playing ""Dodge the flaming arrow,"" or driving around his mansion in a golf cart. The focus in the beginning on the New Jersey DeNiro thing. Those were all good - very good. They just weren't in a very good movie.A few things just worked against it: The meandering, non-pace of the movie's beginning really faltered once Natalie Portman showed up. It suddenly seemed like this oddball dramedy about a guy trying to get back in touch with a world he'd left behind was being shoehorned into a fairly run-of-the-mill ""Quiet loner meets outgoing girl"" love story. I really didn't feel like Zach Braff had earned the right to have his character say, ""You changed my life,"" to Natalie Portman at the end of the film. Also, absolutely too many scenes were dominated by fast-motion camera effects and super-hip indie music.If Zach Braff makes another movie - either a more focused love story or a less focused, existentialist-about-town story - he could hit gold. He's an assured director and a talented writer. The problem is that, contrary to popular opinion, he made this movie a little too in line with the mainstream - there's nothing revolutionary about a lukewarm relationship between two odd characters set to hip, contemporary music.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Zach Braff is wonderful as actor, writer and director.

Must-Watch Film,"This is an absolutely amazing and phenomenal film! If you have not seen it, buy it today and watch it; if you have seen it, watch it again. Garden State portrays Andrew Largeman, a young emotionally withdrawn man (Zach Braff), whose life is changed by his encounters with Sam (Natalie Portman). Sam serves as the perfect foil to Andrew, through her free-spirited, energetic, quirky, unrestrained nature. Whereas Andrew restrains from disclosing anything and typically complies with requests, Sam says and does whatever comes into her mind, and insists on being independent. The plot takes place over four days, when Andrew returns to his home town to attend his mother's funeral. In the process, he explores the tragedy of his current life, and for the first time in years, sees hope for the future. Combining a delicate sense of humor, shockingly real characters, a riveting soundtrack, and superb acting, Garden State leaves a viewer wanting to laugh, cry, and change their life all at the same time. It is a must-watch film for anyone who claims to be a film",,Anonymous,Romance
Worthy movie debut for Zach Braff,"(2004) Garden State
DRAMA/ ROMANCEWritten, directed and starring Zach Braff, a quietly troubled young man returns home for his mother's funeral after being estranged from his family for a decade"" The set up serves as a backdrop because I find that the bonding or rapport between Braff's other characters stands out more than his character's subtle behavior. Exceptionally familiar plot as ""The Station Agent"" just released year earlier, has Zach Braff as Andrew aimlessly meeting quirky people but his subtle behavior was enough to attract the characters of Sam (Natalie Portman) and Mark (Peter Sarsgaard)

Let's go home...,"Garden State is an unconventional Romantic/Comedy/Drama that explores the life of Andrew 'Large' Largeman (Zach Braff), a depressed, pill popping one time actor on his return home following his mothers death where he finds old friends, new love and emotion he could barely conceive.Generally, 90% of comedies all match the same studio requirements (similar to how 99% of statistics are made up on the spot) but Garden State breaks new ground. It's a surreal, yet strangely realistic reminder of how sometimes feeling pain is better than feeling nothing. The surrealism in itself should condemn the film to production Hell, what with drugs, a knight, an argument in Klingon and a leg humping dog. But Braffs script (yep, he wrote and directed it as well) offers such a refreshingly honest view of the awkwardness of relationship that in the end, the entirety of the film feels so very normal. And it's not just the characters who feel awkward around each other.The first time Large and Sam (Natalie Portman) meet, there is generally much humour in the scene. But then as some tension grows between the characters, it also grows within the audience. Braffs direction and ability to handle these moments work as an incredibly original convention throughout the film, and the feeling does happen repeatedly, never more so when Large reveals a pivotal secret within his life, one that he's held close for most of his life. Without ruining the film, I can't quite stress the importance that the secret is believable. It's nothing like Lost nowadays when secrets are usually remarkably absurd. Fear not the secrets.One of the more terrific points about the film is the juxtaposition between the two leads. Whereas Large's family and home is cold and distant, Sam's are warm and close. Whereas Large is frequently trying to distance himself from his father and the sad bluntness that is all of which remains of what once may have been a relationship Sam has no trouble talking to her mother and embracing the joyous cosiness that she has grown up with.The relationship between Large and Sam is a subtle one. It creeps up on you whilst you're captivated by the reactions of different characters to different circumstances. It's not until a specific point in the film that you're likely to think ""Oh, they're getting/have gotten a lot closer!"" and even then you'll be unsure as to what should be expected next. Just as subtle are Larges emotions. Once again, it really is a case of them creeping up on you as the film progresses.Finally, the film hits a really fantastic final scene. Natalie Portman gets to really show off her flair for acting at the end and is really freaking brilliant at it. One particular clever thing put into the end is the question that has been plaguing the film from the beginning. Large blatantly asks it twice, but thankfully we're never answered, because like in Garden State realism is sometimes surreal, but regardless, not all questions are answered either.If you're looking for an example of JD for two hours, this might not be the best thing, but if you want a clever, compelling and very funny Rom-Com, then this is probably the best you'll see around.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Please stop comparing to good films,"This film is NOT comparable to films such as ""The Graduate"" and ""Fight Club."" Characters were quirky and strange just for the sake of adding some interest to a weak plot. Weird for the sake of weirdness. What can you say about a film that highlights humping and masturbating dogs and a dead hamster (yep, you guessed it, a painfully protracted & dumb burial scene). I guess it says this film has the intellect and maturity of a cognitively challenged 15 year old.The film's only two Black characters were shameful. Titembay was as insignificant as the ""adopted"" brother from Africa. He seemed like another one of the pets in the shabby, pet-crowded house. The other character played by a Black actor was hotel staff (in ludricrous uniform) who bought an illegal substance (no stereotype here!) from the grave digger character. This entire scene was bad news. This unfortunate actor's main lines were: ""Did you see the titties? Raise your hand if you saw the titties."" Ugh.Andrew, the main character is played by the writer and director for this film, Zach Braff. Mistake! Another mistake was the zombie portrayal of the psychiatrist father by Ian Holm. What a dismal experience to see an actor of his talent in this type of role in this type of film.What saves this film from being a complete waste of time was the sound track (yet, in reality, you'd be better off just listening to the CD on your own) and the cinematography.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Honest and intelligent,"The Russian philosopher George Gurdjieff believed that most people sleepwalk through life, only aware enough to do their jobs, have children, and then die without leaving much of an impact. Coming to oneself, according to Gurdjieff, means inhabiting your body, coming out of your daydreams, desires, and anxieties, allowing yourself to be touched by the world of color, air, sound, light, and feelings. This kind of transformation is suggested in Garden State a somewhat precious but highly entertaining comedy in which the main character comes alive after a lifetime of drug-induced somnolence.While this debut film by Zach Braff who directed, authored, and starred in it, has moments where self-indulgence and cleverness run amok, it is saved by its beautiful look, the naturalness and intelligence of the dialog, and the honest performances of Natalie Portman, Ian Holm, Peter Saarsgard, and Braff himself. It is the kind of journey of self-discovery in which people can find some moment that has touched their lives.In the film, a young Hollywood actor comes back to his New Jersey hometown for his mother's funeral and finds that four days can be life changing. Like the very best of its genre, it can make you laugh one minute and come close to tears the next. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is very passive and withdrawn, his emotions dulled by years of ingesting Lithium and other psychoactive medications.Heavily sedated, he cannot even muster an emotional reaction when learning that his wheelchair-confined mother drowned in her bathtub. His psychiatrist father Gideon (Ian Holm) prescribed these to suppress his guilt resulting from a childhood incident. Unfortunately, Large avoids makes a point of avoiding his father during the film and we see very little of him except for brief interludes and a final conversation when he reaches out to him in a heartfelt and touching sequence. As one would expect, some pretty strange characters surround Andrew. Losers-in-training Mark (Peter Saarsgard), a gravedigger who robs jewelry from the dead and bilks department stores, a former cocaine addict turned policeman (Michael Weston), and a knight (Geoffrey Arend) who works at a fast food restaurant and wears his knight costume around the house.Another friend Albert (Denis O'Hare) has become wealthy by inventing noiseless Velcro but his world seems empty. Braff does not look down on his characters, however, and they have a redeeming touch of humanity that makes them likable. When Andrew meets Samantha (Natalie Portman), her energy and enthusiasm give Large the courage to get in touch with his aliveness. Their relationship develops in an emotionally honest way without them having to first jump into bed and then ask each other's name the next morning. The things they talk about are real and involve their emotions. Though it happens rather suddenly, watching Andrew open up to life is a rare satisfaction and Braff can be forgiven for an ending that is as contrived as it is derivative.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Alright for a debut, but lacking a lot.","This movie has a lot of hype surrounding it and has fast become a favourite amongst the young adults. I can see why this is. Zach Braff has used popular music from indie bands and has written a story that is very appealing to young audiences.But when it comes to actually looking at the film in terms of directing, acting, script- writing and whatever other ingredients are needed to make a good movie- the film just manages to make it over the line.Firstly, the directing is extremely mediocre, but that is understandable considering Braff's experience and this being his first film. There are some scenes (in particular one in which Braff is sitting on a couch as the night passes by him) which seem like they are only there to make it look like he can direct, as if to say ""this is a creative way of filming a scene, look at my talent!!"" Secondly, the acting is as great as it is made out to be. But as least Zach Braff can admit that about himself. When it comes to Natalie Portman she does not give her best performance. Her voice is whiny and she over acts a lot. Ian Holm is ordinary and his talent could be used in finer movies. Peter Sarsgaard is pretty good, bringing about a lively spirit to the film.Then comes the story and the script. The story basically follows the life of Andrew Largeman (Braff) as he goes back to his hometown for a funeral and he sees how his friends have changed and how the town has changed.. boy meets girl.. you know the rest. Personally, I didn't find the story that riveting, it was alright but the fact that I didn't really like the characters much brought down the film a lot. The script isn't all that wonderful either. Characters come into the film and you never see them again. Even though that is breaking the boundaries of usual script writing (which I like) it is annoying when you are introduced to someone and you never see them again.Overall, the movie is something that you see once and forget. It's not as brilliant as it's made out to be (and really does not deserve the 8 star rating it has on IMDb!). It's an average movie that might be worth seeing if you are a fan of indie bands, the actors involved, or just something to fill time.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
An empty-headed self indulgent exercise in juvenile romanticism,"This is truly where the generation gap kicks in. I have had many people furiously defend this juvenile clap-trap, even going so far as to call it a work of art. Well I'm sorry kids, but a cool soundtrack does not make up for an utter lack of authentic emotional content or a coherent idea of any kind. This sort of film will appeal to weepy teenagers who spend all their time self-medicating and bemoaning the pain of their privileged suburban existences. Mr. Braff is a poor leading man at best, he reminds me of a young Ray Romano. Natalie Portman is wasted in a role that requires her to look alternately cute or haunted. If you want to see a good film about young people trying to make sense of their lives, try watching almost anything directed by Wes Anderson. The editing in the film is desperate and the whole thing seems to have been structured around it's soundtrack. The film is an empty vessel that you can project whatever you like onto. If this is the beginning of generation y cinema,I weep for the future.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful Gem,"The troubled twenty-six years old Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns from Los Angeles, where he works as a waiter in a Korean restaurant after playing a retarded athlete in a TV show, to his hometown in New Jersey for the funeral of his mother. He meets his old friends and a compulsive liar, Samantha (Natalie Portman), for whom he falls in love. Four days later, Andrew heals his wounds with the love and attention of Sam.With a very simple storyline, but supported by an excellent team of charismatic cast and a great music score, ""Garden State"" is a delightful gem. This feel-good low-budget movie may be overrated in IMDb (top 250: #244); has many reviews written by users with only one comment in total in a very fake promotion, usual in IMDb to promote certain movie (this people will certainly give lots of negative votes to my review, isn't it Alex?). But this little movie really deserves to be watched, and in the end the viewer will certainly like the romance between the weird Zach Braff and the stunning Natalie Portman, certainly one of my favorite actresses of the young generation. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Hora de Voltar"" (""Time to Come Back"")",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Numb!,"Garden State has received rave reviews and is praised everywhere as something very close to a masterpiece. I just saw the film and I had very high expectations, only to be disappointed to have viewed a quite boring and trivial film. I am truly puzzled as to why so many people liked the film so much.The essential point of interest in this film must be the characters. I expect any evaluation of the film will be based on whether their dilemmas, personality and life styles are presented in a credible way, in a way that makes you identify with them.I guess this is exactly where the film fails for me. The characters seem to me less than credible, somehow superficial. Natalie Portman is adorable, of course, but do we even believe that such a girl truly exists? And why is she so attracted to Largeman? Largeman is weighed down by his father's decision to keep him in a state of indifference through medication. He blames him for his mother's disability when it was just a freak accident. All his life Largeman has escaped into numbness because he may be a dangerous person who is capable of hurting other people in a very concrete manner.And then what happens? Largeman meets this incredible person, who really is ""incredible"" and everything changes. He starts to talk. He tells his old friends, people he hasn't seen for 10 years about himself. They go on an odd quest to find his mother's favorite necklass, and they scream into the abyss. They fall in love, separate briefly, and then decide to give love a try. The essence of the film being: Life is now - let's live it.It's all very conventional and very mainstream. There is nothing independent about it, if independent means making it new, showing the audience something from a different perspective. It does not suffice to make quirky characters if they do not ring true. But it pretends to do so, it pretends to have something essential to say.An intelligent version of the same theme was done with credible characters in ""Beautiful Girls"" by Ted Demme. Watch that one instead!!3/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Fantazmal,"Whether you want a movie that makes you laugh, cry, challenge your brain, or just make you sit and ponder life, Garden State is the movie to get you through the day.This is unquestionably one of the best movies i've seen in years, and I have no doubt that its one of the only movies whose main plot is one of those corny love stories, common to chick flicks, that I would ever consider for my top ten favorite movies of all time.There are many movies out there that are merely made to entertain, which isn't exactly a bad thing but it is always refreshing to see a film that really makes you think. Life is a complicated process and Garden State takes us through some of the greater difficulties, things like family, where your going in life and love.The music was also an amazing highlight for this film. The music never fails to accent the moment, which of course is expected of a film but this soundtrack features some really good bands. Namely The Shins, Simon and Garfunkle, Coldplay, and Iron and Wine, all of which are amazing groups.If you haven't seen Garden State yet go out and rent it, it is absolutely amazing and is one of the best movies I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Coming of Age Movie for Generation Y,"Every generation produces its own ""coming of age"" movie. In the 1960s, there was ""The Graduate"", for example, and a few years later, ""Harold and Maude"".

One of the best movies ever!,"This movie is by far one of the best that I have ever seen! It was funny, smart, and heartfelt, and the performances were fantastic! Not to mention the absolutely fantastic writing. This movie will really get Zach Braff noticed and recognized for the comedic genius he is! He really shows his talent in this movie, which he wrote, directed, and starred in. It was filmed in only six weeks, and Braff edited it over the weekends. Braff has yet to be recognized as a serious actor or as really anything, even though he has one of the best shows on television. The quirky, sweet, smart comedy Scrubs. In Scrubs and in Garden State you will fall madly in love with ever character. They are written with such personalities that you can't not. Natalie Portman was phenomenal and she should have been nominated for something, anything! I don't particularly like Ian Holm but he was actually really good in it. It also opened my eyes to Peter Saarsgard who was hilarious without even trying! I just hope that more people will see this film because it is totally one of the best films ever. Please everyone watch this film you totally won't be disappointed. not.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Lots of appeal, but don't think about it too much.","While watching Garden State, I got the sense that Zach Braff had trouble restraining his creativity. The very beginning had lots of ""look at me"" moments, and he always jumped at the chance to mimic the super-plussed cool of Wes Anderson. Not that you can blame him for the homage.The character (or the acting, however you want to look at it) was natural and spunky. Braff's knack for character quirks made for some memorable moments, but really only Natalie's and Zach's, and to a lesser extent Peter's, characters had any depth. This only becomes a problem when, like in the scene with the Mother's locket and the storytelling by the hearth, a character is called upon to create an emotional atmosphere. In the former, it's difficult to see Peter's character as having such nostalgic or sentimental sensibilities as to create that whole set-up just to return a locket.I could go on, but it would be like analyzing a Clancey novel for its lack of character empathy. Braff created a solid narrative and told it with precision and care. It was fun...just don't think about it too much.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming little movie,"I didn't quite know what to expect of this movie..a comedy, written and directed by Zach Braff, who I previously only knew from the atrocious ""Scrubs"" sitcom, shouldn't really amount to much, right. Fortunately, I was presently surprised.""Garden State"" is at is heart a very simple boy-meets-girl story, and there really isn't much to the plot, but it's delivered in a very refreshing way.First of all, the actors all do a wonderful job. They all put in wonderfully subtle and believable performances and really make you care about them, even though some of them really have a quite limited part. It's somewhat of a shame, since most of these characters are interesting enough to want to get to know them better. Fortunately, Natalie Portman more than makes up for this in a very charming performance.Next, it's one of the most uniquely funny movies I've ever seen. It's definitely not a movie that has you constantly rolling over the floor in laughter, but it will constantly catch you by surprise with some really unexpected and surreal jokes. It might not be humour for everybody, but I definitely liked it.Finally, it's a wonderfully atmospheric movie. The excellent soundtrack and the beautiful cinematography both come together well to create a movie that's very pleasing to the eye and the ear, and basically just puts you in happy mood.""Garden State"" might not be a movie that will be remembered in half a century...it's too quirky and unassuming for that.

Somewhat tedious romance,"I don't understand why anybody would give this movie a 10/10. OK, the acting work is adequate, the script contains some good lines and ideas (I liked the miniature pet cemetery and the scene in the boat) and the music is not as bad as one would expect. And I assume that younger people will recognize more of their own life and attitude in it than I do.But when I read that people liken this movie to a classic like ""The Graduate"", I wonder how they even can start to compare. I have nothing against Zach Braff, but he's definitely no Dustin Hoffmann (yet?) and even less a Mike Nichols. The romance between Large and Sam is quite nice, but it contains far too much saccharine. The ending of the movie is so disgustingly syrupy my teeth started to ache. Compare that to Benjamin and Elaine driving away in the bus without looking to each other: now that's an image one never forgets and what makes ""The Graduate"" a classic. Two minutes after the end I had completely forgotten what music what music was used in ""Garden State""; I just remembered it hadn't disturbed me much. Forgetting ""The Sound of Silence"" or ""Mrs. Robinson"" is nearly impossible, because it's really music that can change your life.I found ""Garden State"" sometimes boring, sometimes funny, and it's probably worthwhile watching it on TV while socializing with friends. But I wouldn't advise anybody to watch it in the theater or buy the DVD. Personally I would prefer to have my money back and not have seen this movie. But as Sam was really cute I'll give it a 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"his is a lovely piece of work. Blatantly truthful, not at all artificial. The girl in the movie (Natalie Portman) will be any guy's ideal dream girlfriend.","Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com !I had a feeling from the first scene of this movie, that this would be a good one, and it actually turned out to be a delectable watch. The director and the lead character of this movie is Zach Braff, better known as the lead character from the hit sitcom ""Scrubs"". He is presently about 35 years of age, so that would make him about 28 or 29 years old when this film was made. That's very impressive, considering that the movie seems to have been directed by a much more mature and seasoned professional.The female lead character in this movie is Natalie Portman, who has done some amazing acting and appears to be the sweetest (cutest) ideal girlfriend, which any guy would dream to have. The soundtrack of the movie is enchanting and also won a Grammy award for the Best Compilation Soundtrack for a Motion Picture. I particularly like the tracks, ""Let Go"" by Frou Frou, ""Lebanese Blonde"" by Thievery Corporation and ""New Slang"" by The Shins.In a nutshell this movie put me in a great mood after watching it.

Terrific Debut,"""Garden State"" is an excellent first effort for Zach Braff: personal, textured and authentic. There are really only a couple of scenes (his reconciliation with his father and the soliloquy delivered by Denis O'Hare's character) that feel clunky and too pat. The rest of the film is notable for how realistic it feels --- the characters don't necessarily find their ways to happy endings, but they do come to better endings.Zach Braff gives a great performance here in addition to his directorial debut. Natalie Portman also shines--there's something so magnetic about her persona, she can walk into a scene and immediately make the movie about her (as she did in ""Closer""). And all of the other actors in smaller roles -- Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Hom, Jean Smart -- create memorable characters with the sometimes limited material they're given to work with.When I was watching the special features on the DVD of ""Garden State,"" the director of photography mentioned how he thought the movie's look and feel are reminiscent of the Hal Ashby movies from the '70's, and I thought this was very astute. Watching ""Garden State,"" I was reminded of ""Harold and Maude."" It's quirky and goofy like that movie, but it doesn't ever feel forced or like it's trying too hard.

Beautiful Girls------>Garden State (link?),"I have just seen 'Beautiful Girls' again, a film starring Timothy Hutton, Uma Thurman, Matt Dillon, Micheal Rapaport and of course Natalie Portman.Its interesting to note how similar these two films are. Its about a 27 year old piano player (lounge acts) who comes back to his snow laden town, for his high school reunion, thereby reconnecting with his old friends and family. Kudos for a great script, and of course the excellent direction by the late, great Ted Demme.Natalie Portman plays Marty, a 13 year old 'free spirit' and old soul that becomes something of a desire to the protagonist, not too unlike 'Leon' in terms of age and character.I wonder if Zach Braff has seen this film? I say this thinking about a specific point of reference. In Garden State, she was an ice skating enthusiast in her day, and in beautiful girls she ice skates,displaying similar moves as seen in garden state,(regardless if its her in the costume or not) Perhaps this a nice little knowing nod, or a reference to beautiful girls? if as it seems it may have influenced him.I would go as far as saying that, if one looks at Marty from Beautiful girls and 'Sam' from Garden State, that the latter could almost be the grown up version of Marty.Ah, the ramblings of a man with too much time on his hands....Peace Out.",,Anonymous,Romance

Quirky indie film that becomes more typical,"This film is a gem of 2000s indie films, containing an equally indie soundtrack. Zach Braff plays an awkward, depressed young man who returns to his hometown where nobody is really sure what to do with their lives. Natalie Portman plays an even more awkward young woman who is inexplicably attracted to the protagonist. The overall progression of the film is compelling, as Zach Braff's character lets go of the past and embraces the ""abyss"" of the future and emotions. This is mostly portrayed in a low-key, quirky way that entertains in a subtle way. However, the role of Natalie Portman's character is too typical of these movies and seems like an unnatural fantasy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

While in town he meets up with old friends and finds his soul mate in strange but lovable girl named Sam(Natalie Portman).This could be one of the greatest modern love stories of all time.

Garden State is a humorous, clever story that can appeal to our generation unlike any other love story that there has ever been. With Portman and Braff's acting in this movie, it is not difficult to understand anyone can love this movie. But there is so much more to this movie than just that. The story can be related so well to anyone over some unrealistic, epic love story such as The Notebook. Overall, this is a fine movie and can be enjoyed very easily.

Boooooooooooooooring,"'Original', 'quirky' and 'exiting'. Yeah, right. This is so much the quintessential run-of-the-mill romantic comedy that you just sit pinned to you chair waiting for Hugh 'Bad career move' Grant to rear his ugly head somewhere.How this film managed to run away with acclaim both from Sundance and LA Film Festival is a mystery to me. It's the same old story in a indie-ish wrapping: sympathetic if somewhat bewildered, confused and disorganized boy (who happens to be rather goodlooking) meets chaotic and somewhat neurotic yet highly attractive girl possessing all the vigour he lacks. A deus in machina (death of paralyzed mother) sets wheels in motion, yet some kind of problem arises (in this case the young man's dominant father, who actually seems quite irrelevant for the entire movie).However, because these two completely unique people are sooooooo right for each other, and love is soooooooo strong (yuck) they still manage to pull it off, including the mandatory desperate-last-second-dash-at-railway-station-after-tearful-goodbye scene in the end. (Well, it's actually an airport here. And I haven't given it away for you, after 20 mins. this is bleedingly obvious anyway.)This movie is all that it's pretending not to be: calculated, commercial, predictable, un-intriguing, repetitive and boring.It's probably a good career move for Zach Braff. He's made a good bid to launch a career as a teenage poster boy for the next ten years or so with this flick. Good career move? Dunno. Profitable, at least. But for those of us who actually took something of a liking to him and his somewhat offbeat 'Scrubs' series, it's a disappointment nevertheless.Actually, they should have made the movie out of Peter Skarsgaard's graveplundering-gravedigging-dope-head character instead. Now that could have an interesting movie.But then again, Zach Braff couldn't have sported his now well-worn 'oh I'm so confused/bewildered gaze'.If you insist on killing off your neurons with a movie of this kind, rent 'Four wedding and a funeral' instead.

Wake up and smell the flowers... while you can!,"I am not sure that Garden State defines a whole generation. But then I might be wrong - I am not an American, so how can I gudge that properly. What Garden State defines for me is the urge of the main character - a 26 y.o. young man - to be alive, to really feel even if that means to feel pain. He decides to feel pain as opposed to feel nothing, and this is what strikes me the most. In a world where anti-depressants are the new religion and more and more people depend on those pills to feel something at all (because they have a certain time of influence and after that you can go on being numb and safe without emotions) - choosing real life, real emotions, even if that means pain - is quite brave, and original... and sad for that matter. So, all you boys... and girls, who are scared to breathe in the pain of reality and to fill your lungs with it, it's time for you to watch this film and lose your virginity.

A review of the movie Garden State.,"Garden State is one of the most thought provoking movies I have seen in a long time. The Movie had a strong plot but simple and there was a few good laughs mixed with some sad and emotional moments the movie is a mixture of comedy, drama and romance, and with clever directing, camera angles, style over substance, and honest acting from even the actors in small roles, with real life situations and stereotypes the youth of today.The Movie Garden State was directed by Zach Braff and released in Australia on 25 November 2004; Zach Braff has made it. Both script, directing and main acting (Homecoming is the theme of Garden State). Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) Left his home town of New Jersey 9 years ago and returns to attend the funeral for his mother. While having been gone, Andrew has been on lithium and other forms of anti-depressant medication all prescribed to him by his psychiatrist father Gideon (Ian Holm). Upon his homecoming Andrew has decided to take a vacation from his medication and take some time to re-connect with himself. From with old friends and finds love with a girl named Sam (Natalie Portman).The acting in The movie Garden state was believable and not over done you could relate to the characters Sam (Natalie Portman), Andrew Largerman (Zach Braff) the characters played good parts and it was realistic acting, the acting made you feel as though that they weren't acting. The scenes in the movie are real life experiences with death, finding friends and finding love and the bond between relationships and the individuality of every person to themselves.The sounds in the movie suited the scene as the actions and placement of areas related to the sounds being played its chosen well as it makes the story go forward, realistic sounds where used to enhance the actors movements and feelings.Garden state was filmed in New Jersey, the set is a usual local town area where Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) lived and then returned for his mother's funeral. The surroundings of the town set a natural type of movie set in real places.I found the film entertaining and enjoyable to watch with the realism for the movie. I would rate this movie a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
scintillating indie comedy,"""Garden State"" is anything but a garden variety romantic comedy. Brilliantly written and directed by Zack Braff (who also plays the lead role), this quirky indie triumph is one of the most delightful and disarming little films to come our way in a long long time.The ironically named Andrew Largeman is a bit like Holden Caulfield, but without all the articulation about his alienation and angst. In fact, for Andrew, the angst is buried so deep within his psyche that he is completely unable to verbalize what it is that is bothering him. All he knows is that he isn't happy with either his life or himself as a person. Andrew confesses that for most of his time here on earth all he has been able to feel is ""numb."" As the movie begins, we meet Andrew as a struggling actor living in Los Angeles, having fled his hometown in New Jersey years earlier. Virtually estranged from his parents, Andrew receives the shocking news that his paraplegic mother has died suddenly in a drowning ""accident,"" thus precipitating Andrew's first trip home in ages. As with many literary and cinematic characters, Andrew learns a great deal about himself and about others by making that return trek back to the place of his roots.It's hard to convey in words just how charming and lovable an experience ""Garden State"" turns out to be. It is a movie filled with originality, humor, warmth, poignancy and a sly comprehension about life and how best to live it. As Andrew reconnects with his childhood buddies, he learns that not much has changed in their lives either and that they are no closer to finding true happiness than he is. So even though fleeing the town may not have been the answer, staying there certainly wasn't the answer either - or at least so he believes until he meets an idiosyncratic young woman named Sam, delightfully played by Natalie Portman. The two hit it off almost instantly, finding common ground in their peculiarities and eccentricities. What's impressive about Braff's work here is that he never overdoes the quirkiness as so many other filmmakers do. He allows it to filter through his tale in such a way that we find ourselves laughing with the people rather than at them. The folks in this town may not be the smartest or most ambitious people we will ever meet, but somehow they have managed to make life work for them and have remained generally positive and upbeat in the process.Braff, looking a little like a young Ray Romano, perfectly captures the befuddlement, fear and almost crippling self-consciousness that lay at the root of Andrew's unhappiness, while at the same time conveying the good-naturedness and capacity for loving that provide him with the hope that, against all odds, he will someday achieve fulfillment. He and Portman make such an endearing romantic couple that we just know they will wind up making it in the end. In addition, there are strong supporting performances from Ian Holm, Peter Sarsgaard, Ron Leibman and a whole host of other talented performers.""Garden State"" provides a subtle little homage to ""The Graduate"" in its closing line - a fitting tribute from a film that captures the offbeat vision and youthful spirit of that earlier classic of anarchic cinema. But ""Garden State"" is a visionary film in its own right as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Braff delivers the Jersey experience without being too Jersey-centric; Portman delivers the Girlfriend Experience,"This film is about Braff's character, Large, but it is a reflection of Portman's character, Sam. Sam is beautiful, unique, witty, funny, and fun. She is also quirky, talks a mile a minute, and wears her flaws like a fur coatLarge can't figure out whether she is openly insecure or incredibly self-confident. But he is overwhelmed by howalive she is. She excites himand she excites the viewer. Portman really brought the Girlfriend Experience (look it up at livemancave.wordpress.com) in this flick, and it really strikes a chord with me, because Sam's aforementioned characteristics are what attracted me so strongly to my current girlfriend.As I said, though, this movie is about Large. He is perpetually numb, floating through life without a defined purpose, and he doesn't even understand what happiness is. He is in a profession and in a city that reward superficiality, self-centeredness over community, and wearing a metaphorical war mask to cover one's vulnerable emotions. His sudden trip home reminds him that you don't have to make a ton of money or be in an exotic place to find happinessthe happiest moments come unexpectedly when you're in great company. Happiness lies in self acceptance and appreciating the presentmaking the most of who and where you are, and who you are with, right now. I believe that most of us have learned or re-learned this lesson the hard way, or have yet to learn the lessonthat's why I believe that most of you will relate to this film, even if you don't necessarily relate to Large.As I also said earlier, this movie is a reflection of Sam. Like her, it is unique, witty, funny, and funyou often wish you could step through the TV screen and hang out with some of these strange-but-interesting people, even if you don't do drugs (and I don't). It is also quirky, dark, and deep. Living in the moment is a constant theme of this film, as it puts a microscope on 4 days that potentially changed a young man's life. Taking control of your life is another theme, as it cautions the viewer about how something as seemingly-trivial as a quarter-inch piece of plastic can determine the majority of your life, if you let it.While the movie is titled ""Garden State,"" and it is filmed in New Jersey, it doesn't feature landmarks or many aspects that are uniquely Jersey (according to IMDb, the site of the swimming pool scene was chosen for its view of the Manhattan skyline, but fog on the day of filming obscured the view). Having grown up in Jersey, I would have liked to have seen the Garden State Parkway or Turnpike featured at least once, but I guess the flick as is makes it more relatable to people from other states. This movie is not necessarily about coming home to Jersey, it's about coming home.Honestly, though, I've always said this to people: what makes New Jersey a great place to live is not landmarks, a grand list of things to do, or a good tax situation; instead, it is the people. For the most part, the people are genuine. They speak their mind, and although they may have a rough exterior, loyalty is a common trait; they can rag on their friends mercilessly, but don't you dare or you might find yourself in a fistfight. I felt that this flick did a good job of representing that.And the movie's director seemed to really understand that, as, also according to IMDb, the film was based partly on Braff's own childhood in New Jersey (he attended Columbia High School in Maplewood), as well as his days as a struggling actor in Los Angeles before the success of Scrubs. He also hand-picked the songs for the soundtrack. In effect, Braff kind of bared his soul to the world through this flick, and I think that if you like him or Portman, you should set aside time to watch it at some point. My respect for Braff has definitely increased after seeing it (and I already liked him as a comedic actor before).For more reviews and a kick-ass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent,"I have read most of the criticisms out there and although i understand the flaws that you see,i also believe that for a movie of this nature it is all a matter of opinion. Whether or not you like the character that Zach broff portrays is really your own problem. I found him decidedly intriguing. I wanted to know what was going on in his head, and it kept me watching. When viewed, i was expecting good and was overly joyed when the movie was better than i had thought. It carried itself so well, and every time i have watched it since i have picked up on some new theme, or something that i just didn't pick up the first time through.To cap all of it off, the soundtrack was phenomenal. I bought it immediately and it has been repeating ever since. It was a supporting actor in my opinion. To those who are still up in the air on viewing Garden State, I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Emotionally Hollow Film With Some Good Qualities,"I've heard some refer to this as one of the quintessential indie films and that it even is a film for a generation. While there is plenty to admire about Garden State, much of it feels very hallow and empty.The camerawork is decent and the cinematography is also pretty good as well. Whether the characters are about to jump into a warm pool, dry off near a big fireplace, or are walking nearby a sink hole in the woods while it's raining, you can get a sense of what it feels like to be there in those moments. I think those are the best qualities of the film. The color palettes in some scenes also were quite interesting to the eye.I think for the most part, the script is good overall. But whenever there are moments that are supposed to be funny or heartfelt, I didn't laugh or really feel for the characters in those moments. I don't know if it's a lack of emotion from the characters or if it's the way the lines are delivered but it doesn't ignite the feels. Maybe the 2000s quirky awkward humor is starting to feel dated. There isn't much of a plot to Garden State but I think it would've benefited if there was more time allotted to the main character and getting more of a glimpse into their past.The cast overall is decent. However, I don't find Zach Braff's character Andrew to be that likeable or compelling. While his character is someone who is dealing with depression and seems to be in a constant state of numbness, I didn't find him to be that sympathetic or interesting. It almost seemed like he was someone who just so happened to be in the situation of that scene and the supporting characters are the ones who are in control of the scene. Natalie Portman does do a great job at playing Sam, the character who basically kickstarted the whole ""Manic-Pixie Dream Girl"" trope. But at times, I thought that the quirkiness and some of the random things that her character would spitball got a little annoying and repetitive at times. Peter Sarsgard was good but he almost seemed a little out of place to be in the role of one of Andrew's loser friends that never left his hometown. Ian Holmes is severely underused and has under 5 minutes of screen time.The coffeehouse/indie soundtrack also is really great and is something I'd listen to on my own. However, I don't think it really adds any emotional impact to the scenes. I think in a way, the use of the soundtrack can come across as a little bit manipulative.There are definitely some admirable qualities to this film, but it falls short in evoking any type of emotion and comes across as a bit hollow to me.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Under-appreciated Gem,"I must say that from the moment I saw this movie's teaser trailer I was quite intrigued. It's rare for a teaser trailer to intrigue me like this one did, but it's probably even rarer for a movie to go beyond the expectations its trailer set up for it.The story itself is deceptively simple enough being about a young man who comes back home after a long hiatus to his mother's funeral. He subsequently begins to reconcile his past while learning what it means to live and feel again.This movie has some genuinely inspired moments, but is primarily the piece it is because of the acting it contains. Zach Braff, Peter Sarsgaard, and Natalie Portman are all great in their respective roles. Natalie Portman especially so.This is one of the few movies this year that I truly connected with. All I can say is that, if you know what it's like to feel like you're always having to be someone you're not, then this movie just may be for you too.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very enjoyable,"This is a very enjoyable movie. The performances are great - not too distracting and not overdone.I was surprised how much I liked this movie. I put off seeing it for so long because I was sure I wouldn't like it. The movie really puts Natalie Portman's finesse in view - which isn't often showcased in her typical choice of movies.Don't expect too much, or you'll be disappointed. This is an average slice of an average life. If anything else, this movie shows you how quick your life can turn around - if you want it to. If you like the spirit of the movie Napoleon Dynamite, you'll like this one. Just don't expect it to be funny.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I wish Largeman was my brother...,"TV Star Zach Braff of the hit show ""Scrubs,"" writes, directs and stars in the comedic and poignant Garden State.The film tells the story of Andrew Largeman, (Braff) a twenty something man living in Los Angeles as a working actor. When he receives a call from his estranged father that his mother as passed away, Largeman must travel back to the place he left nine years ago and never looked back, New Jersey.This is the most personal and revealing work by any actor turned writer-director in the new millennium thus far. Braff doesn't shoot this film as a gimmick to his friends at home but takes on this task with high levels of respect and dignity. Braff shows how multi-talented he really is from the always engaging dialogue to the semi-pro eye catching director's skill. And if writing and directing weren't impressive enough, Braff turns in one of the best performances by any actor of 2004. Completely mind-shattering and completely awards worthy. Braff is the revelation of Garden State by far.But with all the praise going to his performance, the director sure did make sure to get top notch work out of his supporting cast. Natalie Portman as the lovable and pathological liar Sam is the beauty of any heroin to any man. Portman shows great esteem and the natural essence of a Jersey girl. Peter Sarsgaard who broke out on the scene in Shattered Glass, has such an uncomfortable scene presence but nearly knocks it out of the park every time. Ian Holm, the acting legend of the 80's and 90's, plays Largeman's father. As his tough demeanor progresses, we see how much of an icon Holm actually is. Breaking into mainstream cinema has never been his forte, unless you bring it back to Chariots of Fire, but as a fine wine that gets better with age, Holm is an acting master class.The inclusion of music in the film with great bands and Jersey-style aura has the viewer in awe. The soundtrack is one of the best film soundtracks of all time, if you dig this style of music. The ending credit song places icing on the cake of this film. Listen to Frou Frou's ""Let Go"" and try to watch this film without feeling like the whole film as been encompassed in three verses and a chorus.Garden State is the best independent picture of 2004 that every Suburban, Jersey kid should experience.Grade: ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
worth seeing,"The storyline wasn't the best. It's been done. It's a little predictable and is dangerously close to the realm of what we WISH life was like. Die hard romantics will love it and action fans will be counting down the minutes till it's over.However, most of the characters feel three-dimensional and the acting was really great, especially as someone mentioned, Peter Sarsguaard(sp?).Overall it is a decent movie and if for nothing else, the movie is worth seeing because of its excellent cinematography. Camera angles were obviously well-planned and executed, the scenes move smoothly, are visually attractive and have variety without detracting from the movie itself. I'm very impressed with Zach Braff as an actor but moreso as a director.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Garden State is Beautiful,"There was only one reason i downloaded this movie and that was Natalie Portman, and i am really glad i did because this is a BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. It tells us the story of a person who is living an uninterested and boring life after being estranged from his family for many years and how he finally comes back to his home for his mother's funeral. It takes us through the journey of he finding himself through the four days he spends at his hometown.There is one line in the movie that completely blew me away.""It's amazing how much of my life has been determined by a quarter inch piece of plastic""This line clearly epitomizes the situation of the central character in the movie and to a large extent the same in our lives. It beautifully brings out the intricate human emotions, There are some really humorous moments in the movie thanks to Natalie Portman who sparks up the screen whenever she is on it.

Best Movie of 2004!,"I saw the trailer for Garden State when I saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and instantly wanted to see it. When it came to theatres, I had to choose between Hero and Garden State, and I chose Hero. I rented Garden State THE day it came out on DVD and watched it. I was blown away, to be honest. I found myself watching it three more times before returning it. Words can not describe how much I love this movie. Garden State got a lot of mixed reviews from critics and the people. It's a movie of preferred taste. It doesn't make you an unintelligent buffoon if you didn't like Garden State, it's just not your cup of tea. I found this movie to be inspiring and flawless. Zach Braff is a very talented writer/director/actor. Natalie Portman and Peter Saarsgard never let me down. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great movie with an even better soundtrack,"Garden State is a touching, realistic story about an actor who attempts to find himself after years of mind-numbing drug use. Andrew Largeman, played by Zach Braff, has had a tough childhood where he has had to cope with a terrible accident in which he is responsible for his mother's lifetime wheelchair confinement. His father, a psychologist, played by Ian Holm, prescribes Andrew to numbers of drugs including morphine to help him cope with his problem. When Andrew, after hearing of his mother's death, comes home for the first time in nine years to New Jersey, you guessed it, ""the garden state,"" he decides not to bring his drugs with him and face his painful past in a sober state. There he meets, Sam, played wonderfully by Nathalie Portman, who unknowingly will help him not only cope with his mother but also live a life without the superficial euphoria his drugs may have allowed him to coast along with. He also meets some of his old buddies namely, Mark, played by Peter Sarsgaard, and Kenny, who his a millionaire now for inventing a Velcro that makes no sound as you rip it apart. The main conflicts in this story that must be resolved are: Largeman's or ""Large"" as his friends call him, must come to terms with the guilt he is still carrying for his mothers accident. He must find a true relationship with his father other than that of patient/psychologist. He also must get over his drug addiction and find a way to live without them.This films strong points are the writing, especially dialogue, the characters, the soundtrack, and the originality of the story. Although it does travel into trodden paths towards the end as it gets wrapped up a little too neatly. The acting is good all-around with a stellar performance from Nathalie Portman. Without her, the film could have been mediocre. Peter Sarsgaard also gives a fine performance as a blue collar, fiercely independent, mortician and friend to Largeman. Zach Braff is the only one here whose performance I thought lacked the special spark of the other two. Also, the chemistry between him and Portman is almost non-existent. As friends I can definitely see them but they had no chemistry as a couple. The soundtrack is superb and is truly worth all the hype. The one scene that could become etched in your mind as it has mine is where Andrew asks Sam what she is listening to and she tells him ""The Shins. You want to listen? This band could really change your life."" That might not be it verbatim but it is the gist of it. Then as he puts the headphones on we hear ""new slang."" As he looks at her that song is playing and it is wonderful, just wonderful. The rest of the soundtrack is also fantastic. If nothing else in this movie, Mr. Braff has proved he can choose a great soundtrack. The dialogue is also original and interesting. These are thoughts that perhaps everyone has had but no one has been able to capture them in a screenplay before. From, Sam's ""totally original movement"" to make herself feel good again to the conversations at Mark's drug party, there is a lot of great dialogue here that almost anyone can relate to. The originality of the story is another strong point. This is a film that speaks to my generation and I can relate to everything in it and I even felt like I knew some of the characters. Although the film is very good, I wouldn't go so far as to rate it a classic such as another similar sixties film, ""The Graduate."" However, it is a promising and welcomed debut from a potentially great director. I look forward to seeing another film of Braff's and I hope he can improve on this. Seven out of ten stars. I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
don't bother,"I am getting tired of faux-indie films. Films that pretend to be 'hip' and 'indie' but are, in fact, following Hollywood formula and wearing their hipness like a badge. Garden State is a perfect example of this tendency. The characters are all overtly emotional, dry characters who are just trying to understand how to fit into this cruel world. They all have unsubstantial, forgettable conversations about family and friendship and the past and growing up. And while I appreciate films that have plenty of dialogue, like some of Woody Allen's flicks, the dialogue really needs to be strong, powerful and hard-hitting. This film feels soft and tired and forgettable.Natalie Portman's character seems to be created to be the quintessential 'quirky, alternative girl', kind of like the kids who litter films like 'Empire Records', except more self-consciously 'quirky'. She is quirkier than a three dollar bill, does things that are unpredictable and cries for no reason. It is hard to see why Braff's character falls for her at all, and there seems to be zero chemistry.It all feels so contrived, and the movie itself plummets deeper and deeper into this false, smug, faux-indie, supposedly earnest dialogue and forced sentiment until the final, over-the-top, very very familiar father and son talk scene, which really takes the cake. It caps off this messy, wanna-be-alternative flick with such forced, banal sentiments...Not to mention there is no real conflict and the characters are all so sweet with each other and just a bunch of oppressed twentysomethings trying to get along and understand life. It is very very familiar and was done much much better with Reality Bites. Although RB also felt, at times, a little over the top, it seemed much more sincere and had some brilliant dialogue and brilliant scenes... it also had the romantic 'subplot' which serves the 'love conquers all' theme, but at least the film as a whole was much more believable and well-written.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Memorable scenes, Memorable characters, Memorable movie","I am guilty of often over-analyzing movies. I ruin them for myself and can get a little snobby about the content. Garden State is one of those rare films that allowed me to sit back and enjoy. The solid, interesting, likable characters and meaningful dialogue helped to bring down my defenses. This movie is a love story but it feels real and not goofy or cheesy like typical ""Romantic Comedies"". There are a variety of different scenes and shots that do not feel stale or repeated. I also have to comment on the wonderful use of music. I bought the soundtrack as soon as it was released. The clerk in the record store said it best ""It's not a movie soundtrack it's more like a mix CD made by a good friend."" Here is the part where I gush about how much I like Natalie Portman. She is acting but she does it so well and so naturally. You feel like the role was made for her (I think it was according to Braff). Best way to describe it is she plays the type of girl you just want to hug all the time. She can appeal to women and men, young and old. OK I'm finished. My recommendation: In some parts this movie appeals to a younger audience. That is not to say that it can't be enjoyed by anyone of any age. There is one scene of sex but it has nothing to do with Braff or Portman. It is quick and just there to be weird (You'll see what I mean). The theme does have some more serious points and issues but the overall feel of the movie is definitely warm and sweet. If you like classic romance stories and even those usual ""Romantic Comedies"" then you will like this. If you like clever lines and humorous characters then you will like this. If you just want to lose yourself and enjoy and nice story with no violence, fast cuts and snappy one liners, then you will like this.

An awesome pic,"This is a really great film and truly addresses many issues that 20-somethings feel on a daily basis. Mr. Braff has done a great job as the lead actor of the film and perhaps even more so as the writer and director.I am not a huge Natalie Portman fan (i'm still getting over her involvement in Starwars although as a young boy I loved her in the Professional) but I felt that she really played a great offbeat oddball in this film. I believed her performance and the performances of every other actor in this picture as Braff weaved the world of suburban NJ into a unique microcosm of anytown USA.It is obvious that Braff used his childhood, personal experience and the NJ tales he heard growing up to write a script that's almost as offbeat and entertaining as the people in it.SEE THIS FILM!!",,Anonymous,Romance

Regardless, it is a fun movie to watch on a late Saturday night spent at home.I'm sure most of the high ratings are from supposedly artsy teens. You know the type, Hawthorne Heights fans. If you go into the movie with the right expectations that you are going to see a warm quiet movie, you will be pleased with it. if you go in expecting the best artsy movie ever made you will hate it.

An enjoyable 'quirky' debut,"I've found that a lot of the hate generated at this film is in direct retaliation to the films praise it is getting. Garden State does not deserve neither the extreme hate or the extreme praise. Many people dislike the film for trying to pass itself off as deeper than it is and trying to mask its fairly unoriginal story with Wes Anderson style quirkiness. This is true to an extent, however this did not stop me from enjoying the film and getting something out of it.Essentialy the film is a typical 'lost boy finds love and changes his way' movie but it is pulled off greatly with some great scenes, funny moments, good acting and a likable love interest. The film is wrongly held as a masterpiece by Braff fan-girls/boys who really have not seen any of the films that Garden State is trying to emulate and therefore hail it as something amazingly and overwhelmingly original when it really isn't. However the film is very enjoyable and definitely worth a watch for anyone considering watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fantastic Movie,"You ever have one of those ""wow"" moments after a movie? You know, the final scene darkens, the credits roll, and you just sit there thinking. It's like a good song or a good book: you just feel satisfied when it's over. Garden State gives you one of those moments.One of the best things about it is that it's nothing like any movie you'll ever see. It's not a movie where you can coherently answer the question, ""What's it about?"" because the plot doesn't follow the average story line. I guess you could say that Garden State is about people. It's a love story of the highest sort. Not only between a man and a woman, but between a man and himself. It's the story of the most significant journey in a man's life--the journey home.What really makes this movie stand apart from others is the writing. Zach Braff, who also directed and starred in the film, brilliantly crafted a screenplay that both connects you with the characters and allows you to examine your own life in their context. However, it wasn't brooding or dark in the least. In fact, you often laugh despite yourself throughout.This is due only in part to the writing, as the acting is also superb. Braff really develops his character (Andrew) as the movie progresses. Natalie Portman shines as the quirky, lovable Samantha who absolutely transforms Andrew's life. All of the other characters are relatively minor in comparison, but they're all well played and accent the depth of Braff's character.The soundtrack also gets an honorable mention. Featuring Colin Hay, Nick Drake, Iron & Wine, Simon & Garfunkel, and the Shins (among others), the soundtrack is more than just background music. It adds to the mood and meaning of the movie. If my life had a soundtrack, and I wish it did, I'd want it to be this one.A number of characters in Garden State talk about doing something unique, something like nobody else has ever done. Zach Braff has in creating this movie.Best quote: ""Maybe that's all family really is. A group of people who miss the same imaginary place.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Interesting Failure,"""Garden State"" is one of those films that you see on a whim, and immediately recognize as something meant exactly for you. As a twenty-something disaffected youth, Zach Braff's bittersweet portrayal of a homecoming for a troubled character spoke to me probably more than it might someone older. I was genuinely surprised how good this movie was.But why is it a ""failure"", you ask? It's not that the film fails to convey its message of acceptance and angst. It's just that I'm not sure the message was the right one.Andrew Largeman returns home to attend the funeral of his mother, whose paralysis he reportedly caused while still a young child. Feared as a danger by his father, he has been on various drugs since he was ten years old. Now back in town after a brief glimpse of his unsuccessful life in LA as a struggling actor, Largeman finds himself in the midst of old friends whose lives have turned out even worse, and a new one whose life connects with his own.The movie works in spite of some very ""film student"" moments (such as the final scene between Largeman and his father, a very understated Ian Holm) because you start to care for Andrew as his fog is lifted and he finally begins a real life. The romance with Sam (Natalie Portman) is never predictable. You knew it was coming if you saw the poster for the movie, but you don't know the way in which they react to one another. A previous commentator remarked how Portman finally gets to show off the charm that she possessed in earlier roles, and I concur. You can't tell me you wouldn't fall in love with a girl like Sam if you just randomly met her.The failure is in the message of the film, which either seems to be rebelling against the funk that most of the characters find themselves in, or casually accepting it. I couldn't really tell which version Braff was trying to convey. There's a sense that he's being honest to what most twenty-somethings do when trapped in a small-town existence. I know myself people like the ones in the film, people whose lives revolve around the next party or the next opportunity to get high. In a small town, drugs are pretty much a crutch which keeps you from trying for a real life, imho. Braff manages to convey that disconnect from reality most effectively in a montage of speeded-up partying.I think most of the characters stumble around in a chemical fog much like Largeman's, a point that I missed the first time around. It doesn't hurt that he takes an interest in the very lovely Natalie Portman.Overall, the film has many faults, but it works on charm enough to make it a repeat viewing staple for disillusioned youth. I think Braff does go a little overboard in the styles he tries to incorporate, but he manages to make a good film despite it. And the soundtrack is a standalone masterpiece in and of itself. I don't know that this will attain ""The Graduate"" status, but it certainly has a good start as a cult flick worth discussing long into the night.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sorry Zach, but you make JohnHughes look like Shakespeare at certain times (especially near the end).

Top 250? Maybe ofthe last couple of years. Overrated. 6/10.",,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful movie!,"This is a beautiful movie in so many ways. The beginning made me feel for the main character, Andrew, and how utterly numb he truly was. The situation didn't seem to matter at all; he just didn't feel anything due to the medication he was on. We then get to follow him through a couple of days when he goes back home for his mother's funeral, and this turns out to be a major game changer for him. He decides to stop taking his medicine, he meet up with old friends... and he meet a girl. It's an emotional (no pun intended) journey with a lot of character growth involved. It's very well done by Zach Braff who not only played Andrew but also wrote and directed the movie.The girl, Sam, was kind of weird, though. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I didn't really get as attached to her as I would have liked to. But I have to say that Natalie Portman did an amazing job playing her. It was just the character who wasn't really ""my kind of character"". But she did add humor to the equation. I'll give her that.As a person suffering from mental health issues and taking medication for it, and also being a nurse, I did feel that the movie might give the wrong idea concerning some things. Like, yeah, for this guy to suddenly stop taking his pills turned out just fine, even though this in no way means that he's all of a sudden completely okay again. But I do think that it can give the idea that if you stop taking your pills the world will become clearer and you'll be that much closer to feeling okay, cause there's so much more to it than that.But as a whole this is a movie that I really liked. It makes me feel good and in a way it also gives me hope.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

If you don't live here you may not understand the diverse typed of people that live here. I though the movie was great it made me remember of how life was just a few years ago living here. I honestly think everyone in NJ should at least watch this movie. It runs along the lines of a Kevin Smith film, but with different characters and a bit more serious. Its a bit unfair that I'm very impartial to any film based in NJ. Some of the locations in this film brought me back to childhood with the old houses from up north, and the crappy random weather. Living in this state i have seen many messed up families and friends and this movie just hit the nail on the head from the lucky friend to end up rich, to the wasted stoner friend, and the cute innocent liar thats just to cute to resist.

Good first effort...but not great.,"This movie is definitely worth seeing. However, in its tempo and style it reminded me a lot of another flick set in New Jersey...The Station Agent. The characters have quirky and often likable flaws (except perhaps for the gravedigger, but that is o.k. too). The movie does start out slow, with the audience straining to care about the characters, but it eventually settles in. The movie sorta seems like the Big Chill for twenty or thirtysomethings, and in that sense it is somewhat cliché of all such movies (i.e. a flawed character comes home to confront a death, and magically discovers something they've been missing over the weekend). Portmann and Braff were good, but Ian Holm is completely wasted in an undeveloped father figure and is a long way from the Shire or Henry V.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Because this is a guy who has been numbed with psychotropics for years? Is that why? I know that in the past 15 years we have been numbing minds with antidepressants and ritalin, but other than that, this person's standing on the edge of the abyss of adulthood, dealing with his past, his friends who never grew up and a kooky free spirited love interest is not very original. The music, very cool, but I am sick to death already with the scoring of movies with pop songs to tell you what the script is lacking.

"Boring, Dull, Unfunny, Annoying... etc...","Unfortunately i was informed that this film was 'original' and 'thought provoking' as well as 'funny'. This did not turn out to be the case however! I was greatly let down by the plot, characters, actors, music, humour, script and especially the very whiny Natalie Portman who looks 15 which makes it slightly disturbing.This movie was absolutely crap. It is my educated suggestion that you may wish to get drunk first as it may help a little to make it vaguely amusing and move along faster. If i was able to I would have awarded this film 0 out of ten as I did not laugh once, or feel moved or 'touched emotionally' by this film. I really feel a piece of my life was wasted whilst watching and also that of my friends who i had to apologise to profusely for making them sit through it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
soundtrack's awesome,"My major reasons for seeing this movie were that I love Zach Braff in Scrubs, and I am a sucker for a movie with a great soundtrack. I love music, and I think Zach Braff put together an amazing compilation that really brings out the feelings Large is having throughout the film. I identified with this film because it's a ""homecoming"" film. After going off to school, or to a job, or to find your calling, etc., it's often awkward to come back home. It's always interesting what people end up doing- like Kenny the cop. I love it when Large begins to experience emotion again, and he remembers what it feels like to love and be loved. I definitely agree with the point Large makes about a home being people that love you- not necessarily a place. I think this is a movie you might want to watch more than once to get a better feel of it. I think Zach Braff did a great job in his first film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprised how low others rated this,"A few weeks ago i went to see Napolean Dynamite at my local Indy/Arts Theatre. One of the trailers (possibly the best trailer I've ever seen) was for this movie.Opening day was 8/20 in Indy so I'm a little late on the review but this film is superb. A sort-of comedy sort-of drama Braff really shows that he will come up with some good stuff later on. The shots in this all seem to have this rainy sort of feel like how you feel when you're heavily medicated which is austensively what the film is about. The ending is a little off kilter with the rest of the film, but overall this is one of the best films I've seen in a while. if you're going to see this to see a funny movie you'll see it. if you're going to see this to see a quirky love story you'll see it. 9.2/10",,Anonymous,Romance
sharply observed and funny,"Zach Braff's first feature is quite impressive, funny, original and surely directed. The film is especially impressive in the early scenes that establish Ancrew's distanced isolation from the rest of the world. The movie manages to shift from comedy to drama easily. And Portman gives one of her patented charming performances as one of those sweet, quirky but only mildly neurotic girls who are so much easier to find in movies than in real life.But while it is a very good movie, I felt it lost emotional resonance towards the end. This is most striking in the final scene between Andrew and his dad, which should feel like a summation of emotional themes in the movie but instead feels like something that just wasn't sufficiently set up. The problem may be that I liked Andrew but never felt that strongly invested in his life. I can't really point to anything specific and say, this should have been done different, I just should have felt more in the last 15 minutes of this movie than I did. Still, well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
endearing,"I think that the people who didn't enjoy this movie, looked way too much into it. I my self, found the movie very endearing. I thought the acting was pretty good. Natalie Portman did a great job, and Zach braff did great too. You know just enough about the characters to really feel for them and put yourself in their shoes. The movie was enjoyable. It had some corky moments and sad/happy moments, but if you were looking for a hilarious comedy this wasn't the movie for you. the movie and characters were adorable. i think that zach braff didn't want a specific plott and a lot of drama, i think the fact that his movie didn't have a great plot made it more enjoyable. you can somewhat relate, because real life tent have a plot. i loved the movie. its just a movie. its for your enjoyment and i enjoyed it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Must-see Comedy w/ meaning,"I went into this movie not really knowing what to think..I'd seen previews, but not too many considering I live in Kansas and it didn't even open in theaters here until late August. And the previews I had seen, didn't really explain much about the plot.I saw it with my mom on the 20th of August(first day of my junior yr.) And surprisingly, we BOTH loved it. I loved the fact that there were so many unexpected comedic moments, yet it still told a touching story. It was sort of a coming-of-age story and showed that sometimes you have to just change everything and LIVE. Nobody's perfect, but everyone's got a different side to them. Zach Braff did an amazing job with this film, especially for his first film. Talk about a double/triple/whatever threat!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful girls,"The plot of Zach Braff's film 'Garden State' resembles that of Jonathan Demme's 'Beautiful Girls' (and in fact, I wrote this comment without remembering that Natalie Portman features in both movies); a vaguely-artistic type returns to the town he grew up in, to find himself at a time when his life seems lost. Braff's vision of New Jersey is quirky but skilfully realised, and the acting isn't bad either. However, it's also an affluent, idealised world which seems to contain no cause for the characters' existential angst; while a back story is provided, explaining this in personal terms, there never seems to be any fundamental obstacle to an inevitable happy ending. The use of every pretty-dippy folk-pop song you've ever heard, to guide our moods through the plot, maybe hints at a certain weakness in the naked story. My other criticism with this film is that everyone looks beautiful. The use of good-looking actors is standard in movies, partly because everyone likes to see a pretty girl (or guy), but also because an actor of exceptional beauty can command the viewer's attention in the same way that someone we are really in love with does (regardless of their physical beauty) - in other words, we wouldn't necessarily fall for our own loved ones on screen (or at least, not so easily). This may be an acceptable trick, but a world where everyone is good-looking loses contact with reality. The result is a sensitive, well-acted drama with some original elements that nonetheless resembles an episode of 'Hollyoaks'. It's easy viewing, but also a tale of superficial darkness lying on an essentially bright world.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Observation of the Banality of Suburban Life,"A good start to Zach Baraff's writing and directing career. Andrew Largeman returns to his native New Jersey suburb for the first time in nine years and finds that nothing has changed.His buddies are trapped in a cycle of teenage excess and even money does not help them escape.The subplot examines why Andrew ran-off to LA, his feelings of guilt and his relationship with his parents.All goes well until the search for the trinket at which point the film veers off in the direction of sentimentality. A more interesting ending could have made this a great debut instead of just a good one.Is Natalie Portman's portrayal of a 20-ish New York area native based on personal experience, good research or good direction? I know girls just like her (and yes, some of them still have their security blankets). Even the accent was perfect.The film was obviously very personal to Zach Braff who is a very talented writer and director. It will be very difficult for him to top this. Perhaps a series on HBO beckons.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic,"I love Garden State. From start to end it's a fantastic movie ... but I can't tell you why exactly! I can say it is funny, intelligent, well written, sweet and real - but a lot of movies are like this and still fail to hit the mark. Garden State hits the mark dead on! Although it's not side-splittingly funny, it is charmingly funny and brings a smile to your face for almost the entire film.Zach Braff does an excellent job in every way, as a writer, director and the star. He manages to play the part without making you think for one second that he's simply J.D. which can be difficult for anyone (Matthew Perry seems to be Chandler in every film he's in - not that that's entirely a bad thing)I recommend to anyone that they watch this movie. It's a definite 10/10!Let's hope Zach Braff can do more like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great Film, Great Soundtrack and Just Plain Great","This was one of those movies i really didn't fancy or have any desire to watch however there was nothing on TV tonight and it was on one of the sky movie channels and i thought what the hell, and i'm glad i did.It had a number of moments that made me think ""thats so the way it is"" or ""holy crap i think like that sometimes"" It really hit a nerve with me and i found it truly wonderful.Its essentially a coming of age comedy but it has a certain originality both with the characters and the diolouge if you liked American beauty i think you'll no doubt like this.I'm not sure how well this movie will translate to the older generation if you have hit 30 it may not have as much of a profound effect but it will still be very enjoyable.At times its laugh out loud funny and often very sad, its shot beautifully and the soundtrack was just amazing. I would recommend this movie to anyone even if you don't think you'll like it give it a chance, its funny Garden State and American Beauty where both movies i really did not want to watch but they have became two of my favourite movies.",,Anonymous,Romance

"excellent, funny, heartfelt","This is an excellent film. One of the best I've witnessed in a long time. Zach Braff pulls off funny, heartfelt, relevant, moving and awakening all at once. The actors do a wonderful job. Zach Braff is completely accessible. Peter Sarsgaard is excellent and understated (as usual). Natalie Portman is endearing. Her character is one of the best characters I've seen for a woman in a long while. The character is genuine and deeply human. The film captures the mundane of everyday life and makes it seem significant.

A brilliant first effort by Braff,"I'd wanted to see this movie in the theater, but unfortunately never had a chance to get there. I was happy to pick it up on DVD, and I watched it last night.I LOVED this movie. I thought I would, and I wasn't disappointed. The visuals are arresting, Braff and Portman have amazing chemistry, and the observations about life and love are so simple and obvious -- yet deeply moving, to me, at least. The dialogue is some of the best and most natural-sounding I've heard. The music perfectly complements the story and the characters. I really can't find a complaint with this movie.Highly, highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quirky 'State' of Mind,"Garden State doomed itself with it's impressive marketing. Yes, that sounds odd. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Well, by doomed I mean it set a standard it couldn't meet. The marketing will make Garden State a modest gross for its size. The trailer that caught your eye back in February tries here to show that it can be more than just a three-minute collection of the film's best quirky moments. Of course there is something more than a surreal sounding song by Frou Frou but the emotions that emulate here are not as subtle and artfully brought out as they were there.Zack Braff makes his directorial debut here with a film that combines The Graduate with The Odyssey. Braff has obviously seen The Graduate and has let it inspire him. I don't think he's used to much of the existing material here and that Garden State has enough other original aspects that it's not something people should make a big stink about. The screenplay in question is actually far from the quality of The Graduate. It's overdone in an attempt to be simple. Each character presents a new use for their stereotype but they are still stereotypes nonetheless. The humor is honest and this film that could have a dark cloud hanging over the audience is actually surprisingly funny.As a director, Braff is too obvious. He's presence is in every scene and not the way M. Night Shyamalan has a presence in a trademark sense but more he goes over the top on director's gags such as color and scene construction. He spends so much time trying to capture reality and is almost on to something when he goes to a very director's shot and we are pulled out of the quirky reality and put back in the movie theater.It's nice to see that all the actors were top notch here despite their lack of good source material. Peter Sarsgaard, although his character isn't quite what it was in Shattered Glass, he is perfectly cast in this role of Braff's old friend who now does drugs and digs graves. Braff is not new or original with his performance but he keeps things moving and has potential to be good in the future. Natalie Portman may finally be making sense to me. Before all she has been is flat and annoying but with this and her turn in last years Cold Mountain, she's making a comeback form Star Wars.Garden State wants to be original and quirky. It's not really either. It also wants to be a sweet love story that shows the values of friends and family. Despite a mediocre script and some obvious errors in continuity with the editing, Garden State is a great story about what we leave behind and who we become because of them. ***1/2/*****",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Coming home,"Zach Braff stars in ""Garden State,"" a film he also wrote and directed -those are some accomplishments.Braff plays a heavily medicated young man, Andrew Largeman, who comes back to his home town upon the death of his mother. He's on complete disconnect from his father (Ian Holm) who also is his psychiatrist.While in a doctor's office for headaches, he meets the beautiful Sam (Natalie Portman) who claims she's at the doctor's because she's a robot who needs to get charged.It's this kind of off-the-cuff humor that makes ""Garden State"" a truly unique, touching and wonderful film. Large and Sam are as opposite as can be - she talks incessantly; he's quiet; she cries at card tricks; he claims he never cries, including at his mother's funeral.Yet they connect, and she opens up a world of feeling to him that he's never known. As he tells his father, he's been numb for years. So he takes a vacation from all those medications to find out who he is.I can't relate to this movie the way that some people on the board can - this isn't my generation - but because of the acting and the story, I can appreciate what they're going through. And it doesn't matter what generation you are - being young is tough going.The acting is uniformly excellent, with Portman being a standout as a vivacious, friendly young woman who embraces life.There are some familiar faces -Portman, Jean Smart, Ian Holm, Ron Liebman and Peter Sarsgaard as well as some young and attractive new ones. Very well done by Braff; I look forward to seeing more of his work.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Definitive Film of My Teenage Years,"Garden State came out in the summer of 2004 and I remember my excitement of seeing JD in something other than Scrubs. I soon saw the film and to my surprise, I didn't love it as much as I had hoped. I in fact I felt a little down/dirty as the tone and premise of the film caught me off guard. It wasn't until 6 months later when I saw the film on video that I truly fell in love with the film. On the second viewing, what had once seemed depressing was now beautifully melancholy. Additionally, the film is shot wonderfully. The colors in the film help convey emotion. This along with a great soundtrack makes for a very captivating movie experience. Further, I really began to enjoy the characters. Well acted by Ian Holm as a distant parent/psychiatrist and Peter Skarrsgard as towny/graverobber the supporting cast contributes to the dark somber tone of the film. I also must say that Braff and Portman are a wonderful pair in the film. They truly light up the screen in there warmer moments. Finally, what makes this movie great for me is the how genuine the interaction seems between the characters. All of the films characters have unrealistic kwirks, however the dialogue and acting feel very real, that we are really able to identify with these characters. They are seriously flawed and they aren't overly witty. The magic of the film is the authenticity of the characters relationships and how one has to reflect on the past in order to truly grow up and learn to feel.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very relevant and special movie,"'Garden State' was a refreshing movie to watch. It was unlike anything I have seen in a long time. The flow of the narrative, the profiles of the characters and of course the moment it was trying to showcase. Let me make one thing quite clear. It takes a minimum of two viewings to understand and appreciate what the movie was trying to highlight.Andrew returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral. A sad reason to finally meet with his old man after almost a decade, but a reason nonetheless. The father and son are trying to look for ways to bond. The father has his reasons while the son definitely has his for being away from each other.Andrew is struggling with his inner self since he has stopped feeling  anything  for almost a decade now. Ever since he started on the drugs that were given to him for his 'health' reasons. They have stopped him from feeling. They have stopped him from being.On his short visit he runs into Sam. An epileptic who is so emotional that crying comes so easy to her. I think the reason why he is drawn to her so quickly is she feels everything. Even if it is someone else's pain. She weeps for his mother's loss. She laughs at his joy. She feels everything.This, despite being a real patient herself. When Andrew realizes this so comes the next obvious emotion  love. He starts spending more time with Sam all the while realizing he is being drawn to her. That he is falling in love. A new feeling, finally, that is happening to him after so long. 'Garden State' is a snapshot of one brief milestone in Andrew's life that sees him becoming a different person. A real person with real emotions. Even if it is pain.I had seen Zach Braff only in 'Scrubs' so my image of him was always of the geeky doctor who always behaves like an intern. Seeing him in this much mature, almost adult, role was a refreshing change. My perception of him as an actor (and a director!) has definitely changed. I look forward to seeing more of his work in the future.The soundtracks are very well chosen to make the story go forward. A real delight to be able to associate a good track with the visuals. Well done Zach! Good call. Technically the movie is well shot with some neat camera work. I was not too crazy about the climax but hey, its all about being in the Garden state isn't it. So I will let it slide.I would definitely recommend this simple, yet very relevant feature for those who need a break from the cliché Hollywood dishes out tirelessly.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best movies of all time,"Garden State is written and directed by Zach Braff, who is obviously a super genius. It was produced in 2004 and is a comedy-drama. Garden State is based on real life events that have happened in Zach Braff's life, and Braff acts as main character Andrew Largeman. Largeman is a young man, 26 years of age, that has been on antidepressants, mood stabilizers and lithium (sounds like every single Canadian person).The movie begins with Largeman having a nightmare and being awakened by a phone call from his father saying that his mother has passed away, and so he goes to New Jersey, his hometown. While there, Largeman runs into some old friends Mark and Dave who are employed as grave diggers. He also gets reacquainted with friend Jesse, who has made a fortune from inventing silent Velcro and now lives in a mansion. In Garden State, Largeman meets Sam, a pathological liar that is honest about this, and is also an epileptic, whom he develops a deep relationship with.Garden State is about a young man coming out of a drug induced lifestyle and returning home again, not just physically but spiritually. It is about dealing with the grief of losing a mother as well as confronting his issues. The soundtrack for Garden State won a Grammy, Braff hand picked the music for the film. Garden State has also received a cult following. Cast includes Braff, Portman as Sam, Holm as father Gideon, Sarsgaard as Mark and Alex Burns as Dave. This is truly a work of art and I can watch Garden State over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie about a generation that Time Magazine referred to as 'Twixters.' (spoilers),"Garden State is another low budget, honest movie that knocks the socks off anything mainstream has had to offer in it's tired repertoire in at least the last fifteen years (if not more).Garden State is a sad and brutally honest look at not really apathetic youth, but more like disillusioned youth. You might particularly relate if you grew up in a small town and left after high school and came back to find that too many of the people you once knew never progressed beyond their high school character. That is seriously disheartening, especially if you're that static character.This is the story of Andrew Largeman (Braff), a young man living in L.A. From the beginning, he is embued in this extreme repetitive, ritualistic life that really seems to mean nothing. He is emotionless. He gets a call from his dad to come home because his mother died. And thus, sets off events that force him to rethink things about himself, about his family, and everything else. A much needed wakeup call. Andrew meets Sam (Portman), quite a genuine character as the young woman who's opposite nature of Largeman force him to kind of shake his own emotionless state and confront all those things that he consistently avoids. One of those floating angel type of characters, where they force the protagonist to change because of their differing outlook on things. Kind of like Mark Ruffalo's character's ability to change his sister in the movie 'You Can Count on Me.' Only Sam is quite lively.This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. My only problem with it was the ending at the airport, in which Braff appears to have acquiesed to the Hollywood ending (there's nothing wrong with a happy ending, it was just the sappy way it was done, which kind of deflects from a genuinely honest story and characters up to that point). Braff and Portman give excellent performances and Braff has really proved both directorial and writing capabilities. I look forward to what he has to offer in the future. But enough of that. Get off your kiester and go see the movie already!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

He managed to throw in some particularly funny dialog along the way, and in addition collected some fantastic music that seemed to fit perfectly.

"Great movie, funny and sad at the same time.","Caught this movie for first time tonight. It was excellent, being both funny, touching and the plot and characters were brilliant. Even Natalie Portman (who I ain't such a big fan of) was good in it. Maybe it's because she's a bit older, but her acting has certainly improved since V for Vendetta.Zach Braff (JD out from Scrubs on TV) directed, wrote and starred in the movie. Maybe 'starred' is the wrong word in this context, as all the actors (many of whom had familiar faces, if not names) were equally good. Thinking on it a lot of the actors I had seen before on TV comedies, Rachel's dad, from 'Friends' was in it. Again, playing a doctor (is this guy typecast or what. I could go and look up his name no problem, but would anyone care? I think not.It was very funny in parts, the relationship between the two leads doesn't feel forced or hurried and is believable. It makes some very important points about the importance of friends and family. The direction is very good, it can't be easy directing yourself, so well done Zach. You can really feel the characters dilemma and empathise with him.The people in the movie where very real people, the actors made you feel as though they weren't acting (always a good thing). I loved both the friendship between the lead and his best friend and also the relationship between the best friend and his mother.

People need to realize that most of the time when we feel alone whether physically or mentally chances are we aren't and there are at least a handful of people feeling the exact same way.When Natalie and Zach are in her room and she says ""your like totally freaked out right now and want to run out the front door"", that line is so too good/funny, everyone feels that way, or paranoid in that way, It's a perfect example of the type of insecurities that many people feel in their late teens and early 20's.I simply loved this movie and I give it nothing lower then an 11/10.I recommend it to those aware of life's imperfections and are comfortable enough to admit their faults.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Fine Balancing Act: A Couple Rises Above Their Wasted Contemporaries,"Director Zack Braff co-stars in this film.  He has a sure but still developing eye for sharp scenes, both in terms of setting and dialog.  Not yet thirty, this is a guy to watch. (He's also a writer.)Braff is sometime, mildly successful L.A. small screen actor Andrew Largeman.  Long estranged from his suburban New Jersey family, he flies back for his mom's funeral (a short but hilarious scene).  Before leaving for New Jersey we get a glimpse of his medicine chest which seems to have no room for a toothbrush-he's on very many meds, most apparently ordered by his psychiatrist dad, Gideon (Ian Holm).""Large,"" as he's known, quickly connects with many of his old friends. Director Braff is on a potential slippery slope here.  The ""Came Home-I'm Sort of Successful-Hangin' Out with the Losers"" is a familiar theme and when the setting is New Jersey the risk of unrecoverable caricaturization is virtually inevitable (as in ""Clerks"" and ""Mallrats,"" neither of which did much for boosting out-of-state applications for local colleges).  One of Large's old friends is a truly idiotic cop.  Another two make a living digging graves, one supplementing his income by checking out coffins for valuables after the mourners depart.  At a drug and alcohol immersion party, one guy - clearly out of touch with reality - sports a t-shirt with the logo, ""I Love Newark.""  It's hard to imagine anyone hitting bottom harder than that.What changes the direction of ""Garden State"" is Large's fortuitous encounter at a doctor's office with Samantha, ""Sam,"" played with real sensitivity and depth by the remarkable Natalie Portman (I previously opined on IMDb that she deserved an Oscar for her short but harrowing portrayal of a Confederate widow in ""Cold Mountain."").  Here Sam has a medical problem which doesn't really affect her developing friendship and then romance with Large but she has a different issue - an inability not to lie about matters major and minor - that gives her character a quirky and original dimension.Large uses his planned short visit home to address relationship issues with his dad. Gideon loves his son but in a very controlled, unemotional way.  He wants to be a real dad and doesn't have a clue where to start at this late point. Ian Hom is excellent.In the early part of the film Large projects a curiously flat affect, undoubtedly the sequela of the myriad pharmaceuticals that have unnaturally shaped his persona.  As inner awareness, and Sam's company, leads him to question his reliance on meds. He abandons them, a courageous act, and from his subterranean psyche a repressed and almost joyful guy begins a slow and imperfect emergence.""Garden State"" shows a less than attractive part of N.J. On my side of the Hudson there are more New Jersey than blond jokes.  What makes this story rise above well-worn satire about immature adolescents transforming themselves into immature young adults is Large's and Sam's relationship. Sam and Large are great together.The ending is both convincing and heartwarming (I know that sounds sappy but that's exactly how I felt).Seated three seats from me was a very pretty young woman with a t-shirt proclaiming ""New Jersey-Only the Strong Survive.""  In ""Garden State"" Sam and Large are strong enough to handle their past and face their future.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Brilliant,"A diamond in the rough, actor - screen writer - director, Zach Braff. That is basically all that anyone who see his name needs to know about his character. Once seeing his work, you will concur.The film Garden State is a prime example of artistry brought from the mind to the screen. I adored it.

Great movie however lets not go overboard,"To say this movie defines a generation is a total exaggeration. Sure It is a very well written and superbly casted piece, it does not define a generation. It does not define 20 something year old inner city youths or the Canadian native population or anyone but the upper middle class and over medicated population. Thats like saying Boyz in da hood defined our generation. No it did not it explained what life is like for a certain group of people... So did Garden state.That being said this movie was pretty good. Natalie Portman gave a stellar performance and totally redeemed herself for the star wars movies. I also enjoyed the many different religious and mythological references in this movie. Thee boatman at the end of the abyss returning the lost family heirloom was an interesting concept and represented Charon returning a trinket from the underworld. These characters all go through a journey and it is fundamentaly important that everyone understands that it was not made to ""define a generation"" it was made to convey a far more important question: can life be real without feeling? Think about it and stop trying to define our generation with movies... just enjoy them.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best indie movies ever,"This is one of the very few movies that related to me. It was beautifully written, directed, and acted by Zach Braff. Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Jean Smart (just to name a few) did an excellent job of making this movie more than I ever expected. This movie made all these emotions come out of me. It made me think more about what's expected of us.The best part about this entire production, however, was the soundtrack. It is now my favorite album. It's like the emo kids best friend. Includes awesome bands like The Shins; Iron and Wine,who do a marvelous acoustic cover of The Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights""; Frou Frou; and Coldplay.This movie is one to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't understand how anyone can see anything at all in this movie.,"I don't think I've ever wanted to put my fist through a TV before, but i came very damn close watching this movie.The whole damn thing is just a rip off of other concepts. The whole ""my mother died, but i don't really care"" comes straight out of ""The Stranger"". Natilie Portman's whole character is a horrible rip off of Kate Winslet from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. They even lifted some dialog almost directly from that movie.I may have been less offended at Portman's character if she could pretend to act better than George Bush could pretend to speak English, but she can't. All she does is speak in the same obnoxious, high pitched, teenie bopper voice throughout the whole movie that made my ears want to bleed, not because they hurt, but because the blood clot would muffle her voice out. And looking at her face made me want to vomit as well. It's not that she's ugly or anything, but it looks like her studying for the role consisted of looking at those pictures of facial expressions that they put in psychology textbooks.I want blood for seeing this movie. everyone associated with making it deserves to be tied down to the couch and forced to watch this movie until they die. They should then be shot into the sun along with every existing copy of it.Save yourself a lot of pain. Don't watch Garden State.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good downbeat film that's not perfect,but so what?","HYper-depressed writer/actor Andrew Largeman(ZAck Braff,writer and director here)flies home from LA to New Jersey(hence the title)for his mother's funeral after she dies accidentally from a mishap that has a longer,attached story to his life. When he returns home,he finds that much of what he left behind didn't change all that radically,except that most of who he knows is older and somewhat more pathetic. To top that off,his therapist father(Ian Homl,perfect here)is even MORE of a cold,detached professional that he remembered. The return home seems to be a mere exercise of expectations than a true healing or revelation,save for the fact that he meets by chance a slightly unhinged free-spirit named Sam(NAtalie Portman,maybe a little TOO chipper and breezy for this).This film may lack energy,or have some internal logic weaknesses(Andrew's relationship,or lack thereof,with his family,starting with his mother seems to be somewhat sloppily explained),but there seems to be an almost matter-of-fact,laid-back sense of dark comedy that makes this film refreshingly different from cookie-cutter type action/comedy/thriller/whatever. The film seems to be more interested in letting the viewer ""breathe in"" the atmosphere of loneliness and detachment of the characters,particularly Andrew,for whom it seems both appropriate yet sad that he was so alienated by his own flesh-and-blood that he left them behind for the other coast and never really looked back for a whole decade. THis may be how comedy in films really SHOULD be more like:human,relaxed and not always pretty. Most of the acting is standard,neither great nor terrible,with the exceptions being Braff,Holm and Peter Skaarsgaard as a fairly depressed and slightly off former neighborhood and childhood friend. This would be another ""Palate-cleanser"" movie for someone who';s renting or seeing a spate of large scale,intensity films(say, between viewings of a SAw movie and a POTC or LOTR film)and it's a nice debut for Scrubs' Braff.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quirky drama that hits the drama hard,"Actor Large (Braff) returns to attend his mother's funeral and when he meets Sam (Portman) he decides to stay home longer where he begins to rediscover his past.The romantic genre was dominated in 2004 by a brilliantly different Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind which showcased two renowned stars in Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet playing a troubled couple who have memory erasure of each other and the film set and ideology kept intrigue right till the finale, much the way this does in a less obvious romance but a powerful drama.Renowned funny man Zach Braff from Scrubs branched out into a starring film role and directional outing with this critic winning independent film that is finally shot and executed as a drama, combining genres well to leave the viewer feeling happy and rewarded as if stepping into a cold shower on a hot day.Beginning with a montage of Large's life as an actor we can establish his character as a quiet man with not much enthusiasm for life that leaves his existence feeling rather empty and on his return to his home town, his life starts to change when he attends parties, speaks with his father and meets Natalie Portman's Sam, a quirky girl with her own personality and agenda to match.As tackling the romance genre, this is perhaps a less obvious attempt at guy meets girl. There is plenty more going on to label it amongst the Hugh Grant brand of love stories. The screenplay tackles family drama and the struggle of the past that has hindered between the relationship of father and son. Whilst it isn't close to matching the works of a Pedro Almodovar, this is a brave attempt that isn't too complicated and isn't too far fetched. And whilst intentionally sad, doesn't generate as much sadness as perhaps it could have done.Braff himself taking a step out of the brilliant Scrubs sitcom, demonstrates that he has the potential to do more than fall over in a hospital. He dives deep within his character to reflect on the struggle of guilt and forced loyalty to others. Because the American has tackled directing, writing and starring in the same film, you wonder whether he tackled a tad too much. There are moments when you think a stronger lead would have been required, and yet thankfully nothing hinders upon his direction.The scene in the outer world as it were on top of the van screaming into the valley is great, the motorcycle sequences are done without fault and the first party he attends at home has all the right montages and shots to generate a feeling of uniqueness that reflects upon the isolation his character is feeling. Portman likewise may not be at her strongest but her character certainly has a few cool quirks, such as the concept of originality in the moment and her ability to tell lies.The climax feels a tad thin and a conformity to the romance genre but what we have here is a drama that fulfils its purpose with dramatic real life construction of family and personal problems that encodes some humour along with a reflecting and relaxing soundtrack that epitomises the mood and is definitely worth catching.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Braff looks like the real thing,"After watching Garden State, I feel privileged to be one of the earlier riders on the Zach Braff bandwagon. Make that the Zach Braff sidecar.This little gem thoroughly impressed meespecially for a directorial debut. That Braff was also the star of the film makes his work even more commendable. I definitely look forward to seeing future projects by Braff.Crew members compared Garden State's feel to a Hal Ashby film. I would agree (from what limited knowledge I have of Ashby's work) and add that he seems to have a little Lasse Hallstrom, Wes Anderson and Jean-Pierre Jeunet in him as well. Of course we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves. Obviously, Braff will have to prove himself on more than one film and will have to make the transition from indy shoestring-budget promise to major production brilliance like the aforementioned trio did before he can be mentioned in the same breath with such masters.Braff is certainly off to a flying start, though. The semi-autobiographical film has a gentle, lilting feel to itsort of like Natalie Portman's contagious, lopsided smile. Somewhat dark, and yet upbeat, the film is pleasant to look at and listen to and leaves the viewer strangely fulfilled. From the acting to the unique sets to the New Jersey countryside to the interesting wide-angle shots, the film has Braff's signature clearly inscribed on it. It is more than enough to make a film fan salivate over the work Braff may produce in the future.For now, his canon consists of one filman extremely well-make film. Braff teams with Portman to form a memorable couple. Portman is cuddly, spunky and full of vitalityin stark contrast to Braff's numb character during the movie's early stages. Peter Sarsgaard turns in good work as Braff's grave-digging high school buddy. The rest of the cast is very solid and gives the film an almost surrealistic feel to it. Almost in a daze until near the end, Andrew Largemen (Braff) sits stoically through some totally bizarre scenes until Portman's quirky warmth gradually penetrates his hardened outer shell.I would say that if one likes Anderson's work (i.e., Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums), Jeunet's (Amelie) or Hallstrom's (Gilbert Grape, Chocolat, etc.), one quite likely would be charmed and warmed by Garden State. Whatever Braff's future holds, he has already done what many directors never do: produce an original and memorable film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I loved the fact that Sam and Andrew were (fairly) normal, not overly attractive people who got together in a believable way; I loved the humour (the knight in the kitchen was brilliant); I loved the subtle observations that Braff put on screen; I just loved this film.

It's currently not on top 250 but its way better than half of the movies on that list.Writing , Direction , Music and Natalie were the best part of the movie. Ms. Portman has always been a very good actress from beginning of her career and she is pretty. Zach Braff is a very talented man directing and Acting both were fine.Anyways I wont be creating any spoilers here but I have to agree its better than 500 days of summer (though its very good as well) and few other romances because of the authentic and genuine writing.

this is a life changing movie,"I've wanted to see this movie since it was released, partially because Zack Braff is sooo funny and cute and Natile Portman is awesome; although in the end it turned out to be so much more then a silly little movie. I've have come to figure out the Zack Braff has a charm towards young people( i'm 21), i'm not sure how he did it. Natile Portman's betrayal of a free spirit girl who has somewhat of a hard time relaxing in his presence made me connect to her better as a person and a character. Zack's strength and wit calmed me down and seep the choices and chances he took in the end summed it up wonderfully. the writing of the movie was not obnoxious and whinie but more of a breath of fresh air. I believe that every young person would benefit from seeing this movie. It sounds corny but I believe that I have become stronger.I don't care if anyone reads this and hates it but I needed to get this out. SEE IT!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great debut,"Zach Braff's ""garden State"", in which he writes, directs and stars, is certainly an impressive debut. I must admit I have been anticipating this movie for a little while now, and it definitely lived up to expectations. Yet it didn't exceed them - which is probably understandable for a first effort. It loses it's way a bit towards the end, and the ending itself is a bit of a cop-out - also understandable. Many others have noted that the drama feels a bit forced - also true.So what exactly was it that made this movie so good? Why is everyone raving about it? Well, here's why.***MINOR SPOLERS***1. One morning, Andrew (Braff) receives a call from his estranged father that his mother has died and should return home to New jersey for her funeral. A few seconds later, we hear the first few chords of Coldplay's ""Don't Panic"". Later on, a drug scene is perfectly complemented by Zero 7's ""In the waiting line"", while Nick Drake calmly croons over another scene on a motorbike through the leafy suburbs.Score 1: Perfect use of music.2. Braff plays Andrew, the struggling Hollywood actor who has been away from home for 9 years. He has been on an assortment of anti-depressants since he was 10 years old, which have been prescribed for him by his psychologist father (Ian Holm). Upon receiving the call, he returns home to New Jersey - minus his assortment of prescription drugs. As you would expect, he gradually becomes less numb, and by the end of the movie he is far more openly emotional. Braff's performance reflects this perfectly.Natalie Portman turns out a brilliant performance as Sam, a quirky, compulsive liar who befriends Andrew on his journey of self-discovery. This is the role you always knew she had in her. Braff and Portman have great on-screen chemistry, turning out more than a few moments of great wit, emotion, and joy. Elsewhere, Holm, Peter Saarsgard (Andrew's childhood friend, Mark) and others turn out some great supporting roles.Score 2: Great cast, fantastic performances.3. Braff does show everyone that he is capable of both drama and very clever comedy. Some of the more dramatic moments fall a bit flat, especially later on, but they are mostly saved by the great acting and some fantastic camera work. But the best moments are when Braff uses his wonderful gift for precisely the right amount and style of comedy. Many of the moments feel so real and perfect, you'll be on the verge of tears in one moment, and laughing the next.Score 3: Great script, screenplay, and cinematography.So all the ingredients are there for a great movie. And that's exactly what Garden State is. It's not amazing, just ""great"". And for a debut movie, that certainly counts for something. Zach Braff has certainly showed off his talent for the art of film-making, and I look forward to his work in the future. As for this movie, if it doesn't make you smile, laugh and/or cry a few times, then maybe you need therapy too.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Or, The All-Consuming Importance of Zach Braff.","Even though TV actor Zach Braff writes, directs, and stars in *Garden State*, I suppose we really ought to blame Dustin Hoffman for it, for *The Graduate* hangs heavily over this movie, like a self-obsessed pall. Zach Braff's Andrew Largeman is yet another representation of the gradual declension of the American male in popular culture, starting with Hoffman's morose little Benjamin back in the Sixties. 40 years after *The Graduate*, who are the hot male stars? Effeminate wisps like Leonardo DiCaprio, puny aesthetes like Tobey Maguire, zonked mumblers like Jake Gyllenhaal -- these, and all the others like them, trace their ancestry directly back to Benjamin. Triumph of the Nerds. Post-macho, post-masculine, hell, even post-penile. Lee Marvin and John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable spin in their graves.An apt segue: *Garden State* concerns itself with graves. In one scene we watch, unconvinced, while one of Andrew's old high school buddies -- a gravedigger -- removes a trinket from a freshly dug grave. What are supposed to do with this information? What purpose does it serve, other than making us question why Andrew would be on friendly terms with such a ghoul? The fact is, it's merely one sequence in a dozen in which Braff begs for our attention by throwing up meaningless quirkiness on the screen. A dog humps Andrew's leg in a doctor's waiting room. A guy in full knight's armor -- including beaver and helmet -- eats a bowl of cereal. Indeed, these irritating mannerisms are inaugurated from the opening frames: in a dream sequence, Andrew sits emotionless while his airplane is in the process of crashing. While his fellow passengers panic, he calmly adjusts the overhead air conditioning. Then he wakes up to a sterile, blinding white bedroom, lying half-awake on white bedsheets, listening to his father on the answering machine inform him that his mother has just drowned in the bathtub. Our hero closes his eyes.Essentially, what Braff is doing is attempting to obfuscate the adolescent nature of his material with postmodern distractions. Boil this baby down, and you get your basic Guy-Comes-To-Terms-With-His-Parents-And-Gets-A-Pretty-Girlfriend-At-The-End story. Most of us tried to write this novel when we were in our late teens or early twenties; fortunately, most of us gave up when the unoriginality of it occurred to us in an embarrassing flash. Braff, however, is not cursed with such self-awareness. He apparently believes that if he out-Andersons Wes Anderson, presents an unwavering moody mien, and keeps the background noisy with the guitar strumming of maudlin pop groups like Coldplay, he'll achieve instant credibility as an ""artist"". Unfortunately, he has succeeded in this, as the reviews from the kids here at IMDb attest.Even worse, a fair amount of professional film critics have also taken him seriously, perhaps because he refrains from resorting to flatulence jokes during the film. Boy, we really have learned to settle for less, haven't we? For some of us, however, fraudulence is not necessarily an improvement on flatulence. Some of us also dare to assert that ONE Wes Anderson is more than enough. But Braff is not even honest with his indie-film borrowings: the sappy, trite ending, which I won't spoil, reveals his squishy Hollywood center, his desire for wide multiplex release, his quest for mainstream success. The big-name casting also gives the game away: many of the faces are familiar, with two heavy-hitters -- Ian Holm and Natalie Portman (the latter slumming here for indie cred) -- in prominent roles. My growing dislike of *Garden State* turned to sharp disgust when I witnessed Zach Braff, as Holm's son, lecture Holm -- who is supposed to be a psychiatrist (!) -- about the importance of communication in their relationship. Wisdom from the mouths of babes, I guess. Or perhaps arrogance from the mouths of self-centered twits who can't relinquish even one good line of dialog to one of the century's great actors. Understandably, Holm looks rather insulted throughout the proceedings.An unforgiving 1 star out of 10. Avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the most delightful films of the year,"When a good project does not come to you, you just have to write it yourself. After that you don't need a director to mess up your stuff so you might as well direct it. Something like this must have gone through Zach Braff's head before he started with 'Garden State', a delightful film that could have stepped wrong many times but basically never does. It tells the story of an actor, not very successful, named Andrew Largeman (Braff) who takes a plane back from LA to New Jersey because his mother died. He has not seen his father Gideon (Ian Holm) in nine years for reasons I will not reveal. In Jersey he spends time with old friend Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) and meets a very nice girl named Sam (Natalie Portman).May be the story sounds a little like something you have seen many times, but I can assure you that you have not. The friend Mark is not your typical friend, the way his relationship with Sam develops is not your typical romance and the problems Andrew had and has are not the typical problems. The only time the film does a feel a little familiar is near the end, but admittedly it is the only ending every viewer of this film wants. The funny moments are not forced the way we normally see that, the characters are just being themselves and sad and funny moments occur. You can actually believe the characters have a life out of the framework we call 'Garden State'.Braff gives us an Andrew who is close to the opposite of J.D. from the series ""Scrubs"". Here he is sad and quiet, in the series he is funny and feeling like a young boy all the time. I like the series and I love Braff there; making me forget about both things while watching 'Garden State' is quite an achievement. Portman as Sam is the light of this film, bringing warmth and creating most of the funny moments. Holm and Sarsgaard find the right note for their character that are more complex than they seem at first.Braff's writing is quite impressive. In the romantic scenes he does not go for clichés, and in the dramatic scenes he finds dialog that is used in real life. Especially the scenes where Andrew faces his father are so honest you forget that what's on screen is fictional. As a first-time director he does a pretty impressive job as well making me looking forward to his next project. The camera captures one beautiful image after another, the soundtrack fits the film and creates the right atmosphere. All this makes 'Garden State' one of the year's most delightful films.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Excellent Movie,"I was surprised to find out that zach braff the star of the TV show scrubs was directing a movie. Being a fan of zach braff i found myself very hopeful before watching garden state. What really made this movie great was how it develop, the first few minutes seems quite average and you begin to believe that their is not much more the film will offer but as you watch on and introduction of Natalie Portmans character you develop and interest her character introduces so many aspects and emotions into the film.Zach braff went all out on this film and i can only hope he will continue to direct and produce films. Garden state has the unique element of witnessing the director act and this is evident in the role of largemen, zach braff nows what he wants and thus acts it out to perfection. The unsung hero though of the film is not largemans character but natalie portmans characters she remains mysterious and her ability to lie in situations that do not call for it is something that i thing the audience can relate to and though she is perceived as a quite different or unique character there are qualities within her that the viewers relate to thus the audience is drawn to her character. Her outlook on life is one we all wish to have were she looks at all situations positively.The final comment to make is that this movie excels the introduction of comical moments transcending into serious moments keeps the audience on there toes and unaware of what will happen next. this is an awesome film and deserves nothing but a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
My pick for film of the year,"Auteurism is generally regarded as the theory where a director puts his personalised 'stamp' into a film. What happens though, when a film-maker has only made one film? Can you still recognise their stamp, or does it take more than one film to show this? After seeing Garden State I believe that Zach Braff is the new breed of auteur. Even though this is his directorial debut I can sense his personal presence everywhere, through the script (based on personal experience) to the soundtrack (chosen from his cd collection). Watching this film I combined the two of the lead characters into one and I believe that that is where Braff lies, collides, or maybe somewhere in between. Andrew Largeman (Braff) has been doped up on lithium since he was 11 and hasn't been home to the garden state in 9 years. That is, until his father rings him to ask him to come home for his mothers funeral. It is here that Largeman decides to get off the pills and try to experience some level of emotion, because he hasn't had the chance to feel anything since childhood. Largeman through out the film gives the sense of almost completing monologues to people, explaining what's in his head and why things have changed so much. They are not dialogue in conversation, they are speeches presented to his friends and to the audience. There is a large amount of drug taking in this film, including experimentation at parties with friends, Prescriptions given to you by your shrink father and the more bizarre sharing marijuana with your mother. Through the script Braff has created strange parental relationships and emphasis upon the drug taking experimentation of youth. What is the difference between him and his friends? They all take drugs, only the majority of his are prescribed. Through luck Largeman meets Sam (Natalie Portman) in a waiting room. She is sweet, funny, fun and lies compulsively. She is what brings Largeman and this film to life. Braff uses the character of Sam to make something left of centre in the film world. Her kookiness is something that I feel is an element in him and it is also what makes this feel different to other comedies. While it has a mainstream release on the surface it does not have a mainstream appeal- until Portman breathes in a breath of fresh air and grabs the audience. From her first scene involving talking about the band The Shins, Braff seems to place himself in her (He once described them as 'the coolest band in the world on his weblog) and the film travels from there.With a fantastic soundtrack of indie bands and with some clever visual jokes Braff has made a film that is touching, sweet and painful all at once. Also with one of the catchiest trailers and soundtracks, I look forward to Braff's next step into auteurism.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just Brilliant!!!,This is one of the movies which will amaze you. Cos there is no complex story to it or anything.Its just a simple story about a guy who comes back home after 9 years. The beauty of this movie is its simplicity which makes u realize how a story can be well told in such a simple manner.3 cheers to Zach Braff and the cast of Garden State.Natalie Portman does a n amazing job. I have always been a fan of Zach Braff as a comedian but this has put him in a totally different level.Hope to see more movies like this then the traditional romantic comedies which are nothing but a joke nowadays.This movie is a must watch for all movie fans.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pulls you in,"I watched this movie with no previous knowledge of plot or cast, and found myself being slowly then suddenly pulled into the whole story. It's rare you find such a gem, where the directing, acting, writing, cinematography and editing are so excellent that they conspire to fade into the background leaving you to believe in the characters and the situations .. you even care about the characters - imagine. And then to learn that this was written and directed by the young lead actor leaves me stunned. Everyone involved with this production should be very proud of themselves. This is the kind of movie that inspires other young directors and actors. I was definitely moved by it. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Uneven, Inactive, Dishonest, and Disingenuous","I'll throw in this disclaimer up front, so it's out of the way; I found Garden State so boring that I walked out on it after about an hour. That said, I haven't seen the ending so I can't comment on the film in its entirety.I would ask how it ended, but I don't really know when it began. I have never found a film and its characters to be so inactive and uninteresting. All they did was talk. Talk talk talk. I knew it wasn't going anywhere when a scene between Braff and his father that starts with the elder Largeman appearing behind the fridge door, showed the two characters talking about having yet another talk later on in the film. Since I haven't seen the end, I wonder if anyone ever does anything? Actually, I don't wonder because I was never given any reason to care.I found Braff's script completely uneven. He is constantly trying to quirk out a serious film by throwing extremely farcical and lame sight gags on the screen; the seeing-eye dog humping leg scene for example, being of the lamest. Equally as cringe-worthy was the Clapper bit, as Sam's ""racially-mixed for comedy's sake"" family applauds her figure skating video.What year is it? 2004? The Clapper's been out for so long now that just about every hack stand-up comic across the country has made a joke about it.Sorry Zach, gotta update the material a bit. What's next, an Edsel reference?I also thought it was incredibly dishonest. I grew up in Jersey, and know no part of Jersey where there isn't a hint of a Jersey accent. You can't throw a few gaudy gold chains, Production Designer, on Peter Sarsgaard and convince me he's from North Jersey. He felt completely out of place. For an accurate portrayal of Jersey, watch the Sopranos. That's what Jersey looks like. And grave-robbing in broad daylight, taking your sweet-ass time with it? ""Look at me- I'm in a movie!""It's clear that Harold and Maude was an influence here. Unfortunately, instead of reinventing a cult classic, Braff merely regurgitates, horribly, its quirk and tone. Had he had the courage to cast someone else in the lead role, he might have had time direct his actors so that they could have had some struggles to portray instead of just lines to memorize.This was no Lost in Translation, as it's been compared to, and it is certainly no Harold and Maude.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Garden State one of the best movies i've seen,"When I heard about this movie I thought I would hate it. I never really liked Zach Braff and I really didn't care about Natilie Portman but after seeing this movie their now my favorite actors. The first time I saw this movie I went out and bought it on DVD and watched it about three times in a row. The acting was amazing and the story line was awesome Zach Braff is a genius. He wrote, directed and starred in the movie. Also the music is great too. I loved the character Sam. She is not like any other character I've seen in anything else. I'll admit the beginning was kind of weird and at first I was like whats going on but soon the movie starts to pick up speed and becomes critics and audiences love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Good,"The honesty of the writing in Garden State is what makes this movie much more than just mediocre. Zach Braff's screenplay, although a little pretentious at times, is undeniably entertaining and warm. I feel that the movie is genuine in its intentions (i.e. lacking ""big"" studio input), which trumps any ""flaws"" that might be construed in the script. For me, the end result is a touching and grown-up film.Not since ""The Professional"" have I seen Natalie Portman give such a great performance, and Peter Sarsgaard does a fantastic job in this film as well. The choice of music is phenomenal; I can't think of many movies where the music was more tastefully chosen.Garden State is not a perfect movie, but perfection was not the intent of this film. In fact, that is the message of the movie in a way. Sit back and just enjoy. I would recommend this to almost anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect 10,"Don't be fooled by what britni44 said. Garden State has a Perfect 10. The beginning isn't slow. It shows just how bland Andrew's (Zach Braff)life really is. It would seem slow to someone who really didn't get that point. Sam (Portman) comes in and really rescues him by showing that everyone in life has problems. You just need to laugh at yourself. I found that at times I was on the verge of crying and then all of a sudden I was laughing out loud. Mr. Braff really knows how to pull on the heart strings. I also found that I enjoyed watching the DVD extras. Sometimes you see deleted scenes and you know why they took them out. This is the opposite. There are some scenes that I wish they would have left in. This is a great movie to bring home to Mom (I will be this weekend) or for a quiet evening, cuddled up with a loved one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of 2004's best movies.,"""I'm okay with being unimpressive. I sleep better.""Watching Garden State makes me seriously nostalgic, even though it's not very old at all. It reminds me of my early years in college, when I was just being exposed to movies like this, and music like the tunes on the soundtrack. But I don't think the entire reason I like this movie can be chalked up to nostalgia.Garden State is made for people who like melancholy movies about disaffected young adults. Which is not to say that it's glacial or depressing, there's actually a lot of humor. But if you enjoy more manic, lighthearted relationship movies, you'll do well to avoid this and save yourself some boredom.For the rest of us, Garden State is a breath of fresh air. I never would have guessed that Zach Braff could have pulled something like this off, but he certainly nailed the unfocused pointlessness that many people in their mid-twenties may feel. Fans of Natalie Portman will be pleased, as well, because she's great in this. Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quirkly little drama doesn't disappoint,"Zach Braff is one lucky guy. At the start of 2004, he was just the lowly star of some of that rubbish that Americans put on TV; but by the end of the year, he's the director, writer and star of a successful and critically acclaimed movie! Garden State is the latest quirky little drama to be released independently. It seems like these sorts of films will get praised whether they're good or not these days, but to Braff's credit; this one actually isn't bad. While the film feels underdone in certain places, and the story could have been fleshed out better; Braff handles his themes with care and attention, and it's obvious throughout that this is a project that the young writer/director/actor really cared about; and that translates into the vibrancy and vitality of the story. The film follows themes of maturity and responsibility and it follows a troubled young man (Braff), who returns home to his state of New Jersey after a leave of nine years. While home he reunites with his old friends and meets a new one, in the form of serial liar; Samantha (Natalie Portman).Pretty much as soon as the film starts, you can see that it's by a young, first time, director. Early in the film, Braff experiments with different shots, such as the bathroom mirror scene; which seems to be an attempt to show his character's broken state of mind. Considering he's a TV actor, Zach Braff's acting isn't at all bad; he suits the role that he's written himself like a glove, and his performance gives the whole piece an element of realism. The extraordinarily beautiful Natalie Portman stars alongside Braff as his opposite number. Portman delivers her performance with just the right amount of cuteness, while slightly hinting that her character might not quite be all smiles and sweetness. An excellent ensemble is topped off by Peter Sarsgaard and Ian Holm, who both do well with the roles Braff has given them. There isn't really anything on the technical side that makes this film stand out, but films like this are more about characters and story anyway; and this film has both of them. The film is interesting throughout, as the character are nurtured and we get to know them; and the film finally pays off when we finally get the end. All in all, I wouldn't go as far as to call this great or a masterpiece; but it's a solid movie and I'm not surprised at the positive reception it has won itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Promising but not the genius it's been heralded,"GARDEN STATE (d. Zach Braff, 2003, USA)If Zack Braff's directorial debut is to be believed many of America's twenty- somethings are aimlessly dragging their heels from adolescence to the grave - and can only manage to do so with a strong dose of pharmaceuticals, either officially prescribed or illicitly obtained (and a cool soundtrack).Not that this is the message the uplifting trailer for Garden State sells us.After a much lauded reception at last year's Sundance the now expected indie hype has been used to usher audiences to Garden State clearly positioning it as the latest generation's take on early-life crisis.Braff himself plays 26-year old Andrew 'Large' Largeman, a man kept in the state of a spaced out kid via heavy doses of lithium prescribed by his psychiatrist father.A trip back home, to New Jersey - America's Garden State, from LA for his mother's funeral serves as an excuse to leave the pills at home, while hooking up, somewhat non-committally, with old college mates starts off as a route to pills of another sort.But the 'slacker-may-care' attitude of drugs, driving and doggy-paddle can't quite ring true when presumably in a state of lithium withdrawal Large makes his declaration of love to the compulsive liar, epileptic Sam (Natalie Portman in her first real post-puberty role).Something seems to have been lost in the transatlantic translation process, as far from being a 2004 take on the Dazed and Confused mindset what comes over clearest is a set of well crafted cinematic images inside a cobweb of a plot following an indie cool agenda to tackle love, hate, relationships, ambition and the difficulty of actually feeling the events that life throws at us all.While Large's dependence on anti-depressants, his best friend's decision to take the cocaine option to small town living and the new love of his life's epilepsy, to reduce Garden State to a picture purely about managing life via drugs is admittedly a little harsh.What Braff's brave writer/director/star showpiece loses in a weak storyline he more than makes up with a keen eye for what images shine on the screen. The much reproduced picture of him wearing a shirt stood in front of matching wallpaper is just one (all too briefly mind) example. But a crane shot of a swimming pool, a swooping shot of a possibly bottomless ravine and a blazing open fire in an unfurnished ballroom give strong hope for what Braff might deliver if given the right material, and possibly if he were to drop some responsibility and take a step behind the camera.To say that the journey of Garden State's 26-year old 'hero' offers a radically different set of footsteps to another young man who's life is also playing out in cinemas at the moment (Howard Hughes in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator) would be to kick at a dangerous wasps nest of the differences between the aspirations of two very different eras. So it will go unsaidWhat seems sure though is that we do have another young talent to watch - and another debut star who may rise, or collapse, under the pressure to deliver a snazzy second feature.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
the best movie to be ever made!,"So i'm sitting at my computer listening to this beautifully written song called ""let go"" (which is in the movie) and cant stop thinking about the movie i just watched... i just watched garden state starring Zach Braff and Natalie Portman and WOW!! my god there's nothing i can say about this movie that will do it justice... the only word that comes to mind when i recall the magnificent script, alluring characters, and dare i say ""real"" setting, is simply beautiful. i have seen some awesome movies over the years.. and i mean AMAZING movies... LOTR for example...um the last samurai, stir of echos, all types of 4 star movies... but none them reach the mental and emotional capacity of this movie.. what caught my eye the most is how the characters were SO incredibly real! there was no specific plot, it was just LIFE period. there were parts i didn't understand because i'm so used to typical Hollywood so when i came across this totally different dialog i was a little confused and almost not interested.. but after awhile i started seeing the bigger picture.. this wasn't a movie with plot twists and hot babes like everyone expects, this was just people finding themselves and living life.. but the way Andrew and Sam interacted with each other, eventually falling in love... that stuff actually happens in life, i have yet to fall in love but i believe when a person does, it't something like that.. and you know right then and there that u can never go back. this movie has made a big impact on my life.. i know it's silly to say that but honestly if you saw it the way i saw it you would understand.. i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who's life need a little wake up call..",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic!,"Wow! This was an incredible movie. The acting was superb, the plot was interesting, and it was just a great movie. Natalie Portman was fantastic. Her character was so infectious. Zach Braff was also amazing. The soundtrack was superbly chosen. The way the film was shot was also well done. One of the things I liked best about it was that the main characters were great, but the whole story was also peppered with interesting, memorable smaller characters. Some of them were so random (such as Tim (I think that's his name) and the guy who worked at that store where Mark returned those knives). On one hand, it seems so random that they are in the movie, because they are only in there for a small blip of time, but on the other hand, you can see what they're purpose was. It was just a good movie. I could definitely follow Andrew's journey throughout the movie. The changes in him as the movie went on were noticeable, and that was nice. Not overly laugh-out-loud humorous, but very funny and amusing. It makes you smile (hard as that may seem, given the circumstances of the characters). This was an A+ effort and performance for Zach Braff.Definitely a worthy movie. Definitely Oscar worthy in my opinion.",,Anonymous,Romance
The Indie Film To End All Indie Films,"A quietly troubled young man (Zach Braff) returns home for his mother's funeral after being estranged from his family for a decade.This film hit a generation hard and was in no small way responsible for popularizing indie music, with the Shins in particular. Soundtracks with Shins, the Bravery and more started floating around. Thanks, Zach Braff, you single-handedly changed the music industry.Interestingly, this film features Jim Parsons before his big break. Not that his role is huge, but it is big enough that anyone watching today (2015) will recognize him as Sheldon (and probably not much else).And this was back before Natalie Portman switched from fun films to critically acclaimed work.

Garden State,"One of the best independent films i have seen yet. The message of the movie is basically ""Home is those who love you"". Zach B. directed the movie and it turned out a lot better than i expected. He also wrote the story/ script and it was magnificent. It's not ""Disneyfied"" or sugar coated. It is what would happen if it were a real life situation and that brought a humbleness to the film that i haven't seen in a film for a while. There was no special effects or crazy plot, it was simply great on pure talent. I also like the music picked for the movie. The Shins...excellent.

Gets better upon reflection...,"Right after I saw this movie, I didn't really understand it.

It wasn't until after I had slept on it, and really thought about that the lightbulb went off above my head. Upon reflection, I realized that what made this movie so great, was that it really emphasized the importance of just BEING and really feeling. I think there are a lot of people who are like Andrew, who think that because life hurts, being numb must be better, but as Andrew comes to discover, when you're numb, you can't feel ANYTHING, not just the bad things. This movie is absolutely wonderful, and if you don't get it right away...you probably will get it once you think about it. A key element is the music which captures an incredibly mellow feel that I felt on so many different levels.

And Braff definitely did so, and then some.The way that the soundtrack fits in with the movie is astounding. Natalie Portman is priceless. The emotions are raw, the scenes are vibrant, and the characters are real. For the first time in a long time, I finished a movie and thought ""Wow, what happens to them now?""

Overly Praised,"I'll give Zach Braff his kibble where his kibble is due. He has created some breath taking shots (along with nabbing one from Danny Boyle's Trainspotting) in Garden State. That's all the kibble I could ever give Zach for this movie. Garden State has been compared as this generations ""The Graduate"" which it very may well be, but further pushes my point on how much I hate this generation. Garden State's plot is full of cliché's aplenty. Strange parents, prescription problems, drugs, and the ever so wonderful message that the desire of the dream doesn't matter when you fall in love. This is what made me turn around in the last 15 minutes and hump the seat, for I had nothing better to do. I knew everything that was going to happen, it was typical. Zach tried writing this movie and reached a lot of people through this film, but not me.",,Anonymous,Romance
"What a great ""non chick flick""","I have to admit, when I first heard about this movie, I figured it was just another girly film or a romantic comedy. Fortunately, I was mistaken, as this was a very warm, touching movie. I guess this is the directoral debut for Zack Braff, and he did a wonderful job on and off the screen. His character is actually rather reserved, considering he's playing a Hollywood actor, yet he speaks volumes by saying so little. Natalie Portman's character at first seems like a complete moron, but her character actually turns out to be fearless and full of life. There was a great chemistry between the two of them throughout the movie that I found very pleasant.Not a fast paced or particularly exciting movie, as it moves at a steady pace. Simple enough plot, as a young man who's had minor success in Hollywood comes home after his mother's passing, and he has to see his father from whom he's been estranged for a decade. He runs into old friends along the way, and though you'd think an actor would want to rub his success in everyone's face, he is never showy to anyone. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman) and changes his perspective on things. Very subtle movie, kind of a coming of age film, it would be good on a date for sure, but an enjoyable flick for anyone that likes atmospheric movies based around strong characters.

State of Greatness!,"Put on your guard because ""Garden State"" is in the premier echelon of endearing films for the year 2004. Writer-Director Zach Braff, star of the TV hit show ""Scrubs"", shows he is no scrub when it comes to character-driven film-making. Braff also stars in the film. He plays Andrew Largeman, a middling L.A. actor who heads back to his Jersey hometown to attend his mother's funeral. In his 4 day Jersey visit, Largeman experiences a ""larger than life"" life-awakening eureka effect which will alter his life forever. He confronts issues which he had avoided in numerous years and gets into an authentic Jersey ""Garden State"" of mind. Natalie Portman co-stars as Samantha, the garrulous Jersey chic who plants the love seeds of ""Largeman's Garden"". Peter Sarsgaard plays Mark, the jocuse gravedigger who indirectly plays a grave part in Largerman's psychological discoveries. Can you ""dig"" that? To round out the top acting guards of ""Garden State"", we also have Ian Holm who plays Largeman's despondent father. All execute phenomenal performances! However, it was the ""Jersey Girl"" that really did it for me; and I am not referring to Ben Affleck's box office blunder flick. I am talking about Ms. Portman. Her performance as Samantha is Oscar-worthy. Lately, Portman has been in the ""acting zone"" with stellar works in ""Cold Mountain"", ""Closer"", and now ""Garden State"". Hopefully, she will be fighting another type of ""Star Wars"" with fellow thespians in competing for some acting awards. Nevertheless, ""Garden State"" is Zach Braff's garden of eden brainchild. His heartfelt screenplay & intuitive direction was quite impressive for a rookie filmmaker who some thought was just good enough to ""scrub"" floors! Sorry, Zach! Just joking! Do not have a ""Zach Attack""! The music of the film was quite compelling and was a key attribute in its storytelling component. For those numerous reasons just mentioned, it will be a worthwhile ride if you visit the ""Garden State"". It is one of the best films of the year! ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good movie.,I didn't know what to expect when my girlfriend rented this. But I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. The plot is solid as a rock. The dialog was terrificly written. Zach Braff is a great actor. And Natalie Portman is always a delight to watch. I feel that a lot of people will identify with at least one character in the movie if not a bunch of them. It is a story that tugs very deeply at the emotional strings that are attached to ones feelings of what a family and a home are and should be. I think it teaches us a few things that everyone should know inherently. Mostly that life is what it is and we shouldn't try to hard to make it something we cant.

I had longed to see that movie but so many people told me so much about it I now refuse. he just would not stop talking even when i would interrupt him with a smack on the head and a loud, ""SHUT UP!"" so after a few days of that I knew I had to rent it before he killed it for me. Zach Braff was wonderful as an emotional disconnected member of society. This movie brought tears to my eyes at the end, made me long for a boy, did all the things I love in a movie.

Brilliant Cinematic Masterpiece,"Zach Braff's writing and directorial debut, Garden State, is a smart piece of cinema that is as touching as it is original. His character, Andrew Largeman, is a twenty-something actor who is in a very heavy anti-psychotic and depressant haze. Sam, played by Natalie Portman, contrasts Braff's absolutely neutral character with her bubbly, but fibbing nature. Peter Scarsgaard gives an excellent performance as Mark, Largeman's friend from high school.Surprisingly, the most interesting character, at least in this reviewer's opinion, was Diego the porter, played by Method Man. He is only in the movie for two scenes, but his character was very curious, and Method Man milks his lines for all they were worth, without being over-the-top. His performance was top-notch and he deserves more interesting roles than How High and Soul Plane.Overall, the movie was excellent. The script brilliantly shows the desperation and hope that comes with going home again, and does so with great humor, drama and heart. The cinematography was excellent, and the visual effects and camera tricks only enhanced the awesome performances in this gem of an indie flick.I give it 5 SSRIs out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's nothing here to like,"It's been a long time since I've seriously thought about walking out in the middle of a movie, but with this film I can mighty close. Instead, I dozed off for a while. There is nothing interesting, novel, imaginative or deep about this movie. It tries very, very hard to be lovable, but succeeds only in being annoying. The plot, such as it is, seems like it was made up by a bunch of college kids sitting around stoned, and the dialogue sounds like it was written on the back of an envelope. Zach Braff looks like he's on a heavy dose of Quaaludes for the entire movie, and pretty much everyone else looks like they forgot to take their Prozac. Worst of all, there was nothing funny about this movie--it's mostly sappy and boring.

Not as great as most say but good enough.,"Garden State became a darling of the festival circuit but it is not a lot better than most of the films of this kind. This film is one of those movies that fails to stay with the viewer for an extended period of time. It's a forgettable film featuring a throw-away story with unmemorable characters and unremarkable performances. That's not to say it's bad, because that would be an unfair description. But it's hard to figure out why this movie caused such a stir at Sundance. It's a generic story about how a 20-something loser returns to his roots, makes peace with his inner demons, and finds himself and love at the same time.

Beautiful,"Garden State is a sweet, sometimes somber tale of Andrew (Zach Braff), a struggling actor who returns to his childhood home in New Jersey to attend the funeral of his mother. Andrew is numb to everything, least of all his mother's death, owing in no small part to the constant stream of medication he's been on most of his life. While at home, he hooks up with some old friends, including Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), and finds a new friend, Sam (Natalie Portman).Andrew's struggle to find himself, to find out where he is, where he's going, and how to deal with what may come, is at the nexus of the story; his mother's funeral is simply a gateway to strong introspection. At 26 years old, Andrew is past the point in his life where he can count on the future to solve his problems - he has to decide in the here and now how he will handle the problems he'll encounter.A major catalyst in Andrew's journey is Sam, a young lady who appears to have at least as many psychological problems as Andrew does. Can Andrew depend on Sam to be his rock of sanity? Or is she more unstable and therefore unreliable? This is also a movie about relationships: Andrew's with Sam, Andrew's with Mark and other old friends, and Andrew's with his dad (Ian Holm). For each of his relationships, Andrew must decide to some degree whether he wishes to remain a reactor or to become a actor.There's also unfinished business between Andrew and his father, especially regarding Andrew's mother. He has not been home since being sent to boarding school nine years prior, and understandably communication between the two has been rather strained for many years. The death of Andrew's mother serves as an impetus for them to find a way to reconcile.The film has generated a lot of praise among critics, and it was nominated for a Grand Jury prize at the 2004 Sundance festival. In my opinion, the hype matches the product. Garden State is understated and powerful at the same time, a very tough trick to pull off for anyone, least of all a rookie director; Braff wrote and directed the movie as well as starred in it, and all accolades are well deserved. His Andrew is archetypal for the prodigal son, as well as for the young adult who hasn't yet grown up.Sarsgaard is aces as the dreaming and scheming, hedonistic Mark. And you have to admire someone who refuses to take money - even as a loan - instead opting for somewhat-illegal means. But through and through, he's a strong friend to Andrew.Portman still looks too young for grownup roles, even though she's now 23 years old. Still, despite her small stature, she ably pulls off what's really a complex role in Sam. Portman manages somehow to look adorable and serious at the same time; if one squints, one can see the sincerity behind her eyes.Clever, complex, and utterly charming, Garden State is a real treat, thanks to a tight script and spot-on performances. The excellent soundtrack, produced by Braff, is icing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Garden needs a little Miracle Grow,"While I don't feel as though the $9 to see this film was a complete waste, I was disappointed. Braff was very close to a memorable script but something was lacking. The acting was mediocre at best. The only stand-out performance, in my humble opinion, was Braff's and even that only came close to convincing. I've read IMDb member reviews on Portman's ""amazing"" portrayal of Sam, a free spirited epileptic; not in my opinion. While I loved her in The Professional and Anywhere But Here this was not one of her more memorable roles. The soundtrack was good: Nick Drake, Cold Play and Simon & Garfunkel. If you have time to kill and money to burn, I'd recommend this film ... just don't go expecting anything monumental",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable Mediocrity,"I'll be honest. I did not want to like Garden State. I held it at arms length because it seemed, from the previews and gushing reviews by scenesters, like it was trying a little too hard to be cool. I don't like movies that try to be cool (Pi, for instance); I like movies that are cool.Anyway, I went to see it anyway, hadn't seen anything in a while and figured it was my best bet at the local theaters. Did I dislike it? Not really, Garden State is enjoyable, even if it drags in parts. Did I like it? Not really. The movie simply left me ambivalent. The experience of watching Zach Braff and Natalie Portman fight their personal demons and find true love was not painful, nor was it revelatory. It was a nice enough way to spend a couple hours, but I could devise both better and worse ways to spend that time. So, yes, Garden State is an enjoyable flick that really had no staying power in my mind. This films differs from, say, Kill Bill or A Home at the End of the World, to use two new examples, in that respect; those movies remained in my brain for days as I picked them apart. I left the theater after seeing them and I felt that I had experienced something. They affected me bodily. Garden State did not. It is enjoyable mediocrity.Why? The quirks in this film give it appeal that most romantic comedies lack; they make the story interesting (had they been left out Garden State would have been a very bad movie). I find that interesting inasmuch as I dreaded the quirks. I thought quirks meant the story was trying to hard to be ""different"" and ""hip."" Turns out, the more surreal moments are woven organically into the film; they do not sit out like sore thumbs. They make sense in the context of the movie.Natalie Portman also makes the movie more enjoyable that it would have been without her. She is an angel and, in a quasi-reprise of her role in Beautiful Girls, she won my heart again. I'd given up hope on her and Garden State showed me again why I loved her in the first place.That said, the rest of the movie is less compelling. Zach Braff is rather un-interesting in the lead, but I have to give him credit for getting Portman to play his love interest. If it worked for him, there's hope for the rest of us. The story, on the whole, is also lack-luster.It's un-original and, for my tastes, strangely derivative of Rick Moody's completely un-related novel. (It's interesting that the movie and book have nothing to do with one another, yet they both have the same name and are about 20-somethings with mental health problems. Either young head cases are common to New Jersey or Braff decided to write his own narratively dissimilar but tonally similar version of Moody's novel). The movie also under-uses Ian Holm, a terrific actor who should be allowed more range than is given him here.Again, Garden State is not terrible, nor is it good. It is so middle of the road, it might as well be a set of parallel yellow lines.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Emotional, deep movie.","And they pulled it off! This movie is absolutely wonderful... Actually, it became the reason I decided to go to Film school...Natalie Portman did an absolutely stunning job portraying her absolutely random character... The setting of the movie is perfect...

Something you truly have to sit down and watch, and become involved in, so it seems... This might just be the movie you're looking for!Overall, this has to be in my top 3 favorite movies of all time... It's one of those movies that leaves you feeling different at the end...

In the tradition of Harold And Maude this film is a subtle euphoria.,"In the tradition of Harold and Maude this film is a subtle euphoria. The film is reminiscent of Mr. Deeds Goes To Town and P.T. Anderson staging and photography. The script is amazingly original wording and captures the imagination before the prerequisite of falling in love with the characters, which is really quite trusting of Mr. Braff for his audience. A winding portrayal of ""quirky/real"" characters in transformative states, with emblematic circumstances, references and symbols, this film carries it's message thoroughly and beautifully. An excellent soundtrack, (which is currently unavailable on Rhapsody), streams emotional continuance without telling the viewer what to think of a scene, and is addictive. Easily, Garden State has achieved the coveted status of being treasured for future generations and will retain the timelessness of cult black comedies and off beat coming of age, romantic films. I await the next project of Mr. Braff's with anticipation.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

When I left the theater, I felt totally impressed that Mr. Braff could write, star, and direct this film, and I thought that it had awesome scenes, funny moments, and one off beat sense of humor. The thing I loved most about this whole film, was the music was totally intuned to every scene, and I loved it from beginning to end (although it was hollywoody and unrealistic.) The title to is very trippy, because Garden State what Jersey's called, but it's also a state of regrowth, and thats what this movie is about, rebirth and growth.

"In a New Jersey State of Mind: Zach Braff makes an audacious debut as a filmmaker; best film of '04; funny, touching and ultimately poignant: You can go home again!","GARDEN STATE (2004) **** Zach Braff, Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm, Jean Smart, Ron Leibman, Ann Dowd, Ato Essandoh, Method Man, Denis O' Hare, Debbon Ayer, Alex Burns, Michael Weston, Armando Riesco, Jim Parsons. Actor Zach Braff makes an audacious debut as a filmmaker in this funny, poignant portrayal of a young actor named Andrew Largeman (Braff) whose return from L.A. to New Jersey for a family funeral winds up as a few days of self-discovery thru the haze of his lifelong dependency on anti-depressives administered by his estranged psychiatrist father (Holm) and falling in love with the quirky, epileptic chronic liar Sam (Portman, light years away from Princess Amidala, in arguably her best role to date) while re-connecting with stoner buddy Mark (Sarsgaard, low-key sublimely perfect), a larcenous gravedigger. Witty, heartfelt mix of angst, anomie and  finally  acceptance  of the joys of life amidst death and depression. Has the feel of a novella and echoes of Linklater, Crowe and Nichols (i.e. 'The Graduate') yet its originality is in its comic dryness and self-depreciative protagonist (Braff, who resembles a pastiche of Ray Romano, Jerry Seinfeld and Garry Shandling, manages to balance the melancholia with barely restrained misplaced anger beautifully) that also dares to reflect authors such as Salinger and Cheever. Braff has a clever eye with camera angles (thanks to the skillful Lawrence Sher) underscoring moments of subtle nuance in capturing absurdity and beauty all at the same time and lets his co-stars shine with moments of both (Portman's scene at her backyard pet cemetery will leave you with a lump in your throat and Braff's embrace with her mom, a tear in your eye). Filmed in Braff's home state  a true metaphor (i.e. the out-of-nowhere abyss sequence)  with familiar touches (the folding chair wedged in the front of Mark's house) and sprinkled with wonderful music (including the ethereal 'Let Go' by Frou Frou (featured in the trailer and my pick for Trailer of '04); exquisite and my vote (so far) for the best film of the year.",,Anonymous,Romance
Best movie I've seen in a very long time,"I loved this movie! I thought it had a deep, meaningful story line, and yet it still managed to remain lighthearted and funny at the same time. Garden State had a romantic plot also, but it didn't get clogged up with sex scenes and wasn't hokey. I wish that more movies could be this fulfilling. I really think Zach Braff did a wonderful job with his direction in this movie. It's artsy and mysterious in film style, but you aren't overwhelmed by it. This film is great for teenagers and adults to enjoy together because it's still ""cool"" enough for the kids, and meaningful enough for the adults. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I liked it so much I went out and bought it the next day, along with the soundtrack, which is also amazing. WATCH THIS MOVIE!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent movie captures life as it truly exists,"This movie does a great job of straying from the ""cookie cutter"" film which increasingly seems to flood Hollywood Box Offices. The characters truly seem real and truly seem to have an additional dimension above and beyond most films of today. The protagonist's plight is one in which his realness is consistently exhibited, and his soon-counterpart (Portman) has quirks just as people truly do. Their suffering also portrays a true side of reality, and by the end of the movie viewers will find themselves reluctant to see the film end as well as sad and truly touched by the content of this film.

This movie was a very good start for writer/director Zach. I can really relate to the screaming scene. It's nice to see a movie that isn't full of the typical Hollywood outline. It's different. It was a perfect mixture of love, comedy, drama, and true to life story. I also think that this is one of Natlie Portman's best movies yet. She did an excellent job of acting in this movie, all the actors did. I give them all two thumbs up. I also love the soundtrack to this movie.

Awful,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. Generally I wouldn't bother bad-mouthing a movie like this to others, but this movie is that bad and is getting praise it does not come close to deserving. I also don't want anyone else to waste 109 minutes of their life like I did watching this. I admit my expectations were a bit high, because there is oddly some good word-of-mouth on this film, but the more I think about this movie the less I think of its quality. I had no sympathy for the main character whatsoever. I haven't seen Zach Braff in anything else but his acting was absolutely terrible in this and the number of isolation shots he chose of himself as director hints at self-obsession. I don't know where to start with the script, but I'll just say the dialogue made me shudder at times it was so bad. The only thing that saved it from being a ""1"" was Natalie Portman's performance, which wasn't bad.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

It looked like a strange movie for me.But as the films goes, you realize that it can be a true story about the youth of today.One of the best points is the love affair of the main characters. You don't know when or where love is coming and how the person is going to be. They both are not common people but they love each other as they are.

A wonderful film,"I saw this in the cinema recently.I have to say that ""Garden State"" is the first film in which the adult Natalie Portman fulfils the promise that she showed in ""Beautiful Girls"" way back in 1996.The film is a little slow to start (and perhaps self-indulgently weird) but it moves on to explore undiscovered territory for romantic comedies.Though it's not as amazingly comic as, for example, Kevin Smith's early work (note, Kevin's later work seems to suck more than I can account for) it would appeal to the same people who loved ""Clerks"".I _will_ be buying the DVD, but make sure you buy ""Beautfiul Girls"" first!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm not saying there will be a chasm of 'Lost in Translation' proportions, but nonetheless, the many nuances and subtleties of characters and script may be lost to some (Hank Hill/Homer Simpson). Natalie Portman will surely win (at the least)an Independent Film Award Nomination for her wonderful performance. Ian Holm and Ron Leibman were right on target, as were the rest of the cast. Oh, and Zach Braff?, triple kudos...as writer, director, and co-star.

"""The Graduate"" for a Whole New Generation","I've seen this movie a few times (in theaters, alone, with friends) and I can't escape the fact that, while Zack Braff's directorial debut isn't perfect, it offers a fairly perfect viewing experience for a certain kind of person. Witty, moving, urbane and clearly conceived as a labor of love, this film reminds me of nothing so much as Mike Nichols' 1967 ""The Graduate"", which also offered a protagonist floundering around in adult life against the backdrop of a great soundtrack. People of a certain age or disposition (those in their early-to-mid twenties with a degree or two under their belt with no career in sight, or perhaps those who adore Natalie Portman's indie-girl charm) will probably find that this film resonates deeply, while others may reject it as too odd or exacting in its portrayal of post-adolescent malaise.

Silver Bells and Cockle Shells,"This is one of those feelgood movies like, say 'Amelie' that you see and find fresh and energetic and then go back to months later and wonder what you saw in it the first time. On the other hand it's only just been released and I've only seen it once so yes, I DID, find it fresh and energetic despite being a tad formulaic. This is the second movie in a year (or just over) to portray New Jersey as Mississippi-lite, sort of WHAT IF Carson McCullers had been born in Trenton, would she still have found it chock-full of dysfunctional eccentrics. Maybe we'll never know but we sure can speculate. This time around obligatory kook Natalie Portman is Geena Davis once-removed from the Accidental Tourist (Maryland, of course, is the northernmost Southern State, so there may be a Term Paper to be written on the Migration of Southern Gothic to Northern Ga Ga). Zack Graff has, no question, written and directed a very competent and sure-footed movie which involves the viewer from Frame One - at least on a first viewing - despite that same viewer's ability to second-guess both the turns in the plot and the ending - in this case it's not the arriving it's the journey. Several posters have beefed about the ending and possibly with good reason yet nevertheless there are honorable precedents; on at least two occasions (Sabrina Fair and Love In The Afternoon, both, coincidentally starring Audrey Hepburn) no less a maestro than Billy Wilder threw in a closing scene where the hero, once it came down to the wire, couldn't bear to leave the girl (okay, who COULD bear to leave Audrey Hepburn, who, indeed, in his right mind, would even CONSIDER it for a nano-second) so the writer-helmer is in excellent company. It might have been a tad more honest if it hadn't taken so long for the penny to drop but it's a minor cavil. For a first viewing 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Yes, you may compare it to a Wes Anderson movie!","Last year (yes, in 2005) I watched, _The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou_. Being an addict of http://IMDb.com, of course I discussed it some on the movie's discussion board. A kind soul emailed me and said if I love Wes Anderson movies (i do.) that I would be sure to love, _Garden State_.Being that I enjoy watching movies with my sons, we go to the video store often and usually pick movies based upon consensus. Each time we'd go browsing through movies, I'd say, ""Let's rent this!"", with this being Garden State. Younger son would always say, ""I saw part of that. It sucks."" Older son, not having seen it, would make no comment. Being a consensus situation, and being that I've been so busy with other things that going to the video store on my own hasn't happened in awhile, it was just a few days ago that I finally said enough is enough I'm going to make a trip alone to the video store and rent it!I'm soooooo happy I took the emailer's advice, albeit several months later. The emailer was correct: if you love Wes Anderson movies, you WILL love this movie as well. What freaks me out is that I did my IMDb.com research on the movie after watching it and discovered that Zach Braff wrote the screenplay, directed, and stars in the movie. This totally blows me away. The guy is a genius.Garden State is laugh out loud funny again and again. It's the kind of laughter that spontaneously bursts out of you with childlike abandon. There's something cathartic about it.The film is not only funny but it is also heartachingly poignant. Family connections -- or lack of -- drive the plot. There is a realness to the small town atmosphere that anyone who lives in a small town can relate to. Anyone who has seen Breaking Away will have an idea of the type of atmosphere I'm talking about.There is a brilliance to this movie, the characters, and the plot that only comes about through sheer genius and an uncanny ability to manifest that genius into a form that others can experience. For that I thank Zach and his crew for what they have manifested for viewers to enjoy. I look forward to Zach's future as a writer, director, actor, and as a human being.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

To be honest, I don't like her as Amidala/Padme in the Star Wars movies. Incongruous is the word, I believe. The movie is just amazing; always startling, always endearing and funny.

Yes here comes another cliché, I guess you either ""get it"" or not.I'm 21 and this movie spoke to me more clearly than most movies i've seen recently and it definitely has been made for a certain generation and a certain way of thinking.Its hard to classify into a particular genre because it doesn't seem to fit anything well. It's a sort of comedy love story about a 20 something guy who is feeling that sense of being lost and un-attached that most people go through in their lives. The way its made though is definitely for the 20-somethings of today, through the music, the references and numerous touches.It definitely touched on the malaise i've felt as a university graduate who is currently feeling slightly lost and unsure about where to go in life.A lot of people seem to have slated this movie quite badly in their comments.

"A very good film by Zach Braff, Zach Braff, and Zach Braff","I saw Garden State last night when my older brother rented it and after viewing this remarkable film, I thought the Garden State was a great pleasure seeing. I've wanted to see this movie all year since I saw on previews months ago and it just looked interesting to me and guess what, I got done watching it with the same feeling. The film was good on all levels. Zach Braff played a great role and also directing and writing the film were done excellent by him. The script writing was perfect and the dialouge was sharp. He was practically the whole movie along with the great soundtrack and Natalie Portman's good performance. The only negative is that it got quite bizarre at some times and maybe a little boring but a very good movie with great scenes, such as the yelling scene from the junk yard.

buzzed,"This movie left me in such a buzz. It made me feel so much better about my problems. The music was so insanely awesome that i would watch the movie just to hear the last song(let go, by frou frou). The depressing aspects of the movie are what make it so interesting and likable to me. I mean the fact that Sam had epilepsy didn't have the normal affect that terminal disease would have on me. I felt sorry but it wasn;t much of a big deal in the movie. I also wanted to have a love like Sam's and Zach Braff's character.. it was so beautiful and it was really .....something different.I've never experienced something like that and i wish that if i feel love that it feels like that.

Feel good about nothing,"I liked this film a lot, mainly because it's one of those that are so difficult to categorise, explain, or capture in a few sentences; however it is definitely memorable for many reasons.. the slow pace shows a director mature beyond his years, the humour is refreshingly subtle, the performances are all excellent. Nothing much really happens in this film, and what does happen is understated, so that we take much more notice of each detail. These details are a mixture of film homage and glimpses of tremendous imagination, all woven into a nonchalantly meandering story. Through this rich detail the film becomes extremely curious, effortlessly funny, touching but unsentimental, and in a strange way pretty real. All good stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Formation of Characters,"I can usually judge a movie by how long I sit and watch the credits at the end. After watching ""Garden State"", I sat and listened to the music, and thought about how great the movie was all the way til the screen turned blank. The writers and directors of this movie accomplished a rare task: They created a movie based on characters; characters who the viewer attaches themself to all the way to the end. If you like movies where real characters are developed within a real world, then go watch ""Garden State.""

One of a kind!,"I'm going to be honest right off the bat! Garden State shocked the hell out of me! I wasn't expecting much, although it did look better than most. I'm a film major and I just had to see it. Garden State is unlike any other movie you will ever see. It has passion, romance, adventure, and yes drugs. I'm not much of a party kind of person being that I keep pretty quiet and don't hang with that kind of crowd, and yet I still found that these drugs scenes not only added to the movie, but made it much better than it would have been without them. Zach Braff shines along with the rest of the cast. Natalie Portman possibly gives her best performance to date.

"Amazing , Fantastic,MindBlowing","Garden State is truly a fantastic movie!! Okay I am only 13 years old and I love this movie! It is a masterpiece! The movie touched me... and I know a lot of 20-something men and women can relate to Large's story. This moving was done in such a beautifully way....the language might be a little strong at some points and one short scene that was little adult related but hey, it was all worth it in the end. Garden State made me want to cry and laugh at the same time. I think a lot of older people will come to see this move and will love it automatically! When I first saw the trailer the music sung by Frou Frou immediately caught my attention. The soundtrack for this movie is pure genius! They should make more movies like this more often!

Benumbed...from the inside out,"""Garden State, written and directed by its star, Zach Braff, is the perfect movie for older teenagers who haven't seen a lot of movies. When a struggling twentysomething actor from Los Angeles returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral, he finds a vintage motorcycle out in his parents' garage (it was willed to him by his deceased uncle, but left forgotten under a tarp for no specific reason). Racing the bike up and down the street, the protagonist is immediately pulled over by a police car...driven by an old friend from high school! Braff's sensibilities all stem from a TV mentality. It turns out the actor is suffering from momentary migraines, which no doubt come from being medicated his entire young adult life. This guy is aching to FEEL something! It's quite possible the scene with the bike, or a following bit with a seeing-eye dog humping Braff's leg in the doctor's waiting room, will strike some viewers as fresh and funny, but the fake-cynicism bubbling underneath the movie's lo-fi tone is intolerable. Quirky conversations are struck up simply to reveal another layer of our hero's personality and makeup (his inner-struggle, his independence, etc.). Braff may indeed have some talent, but first he needs to acquire a sense of himself as an actor and a filmmaker, and stop channeling personalities (and situations) gleaned from the tube. This feels like a set of steak knives in need of being returned--it just isn't sharp enough. * from ****",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Natalie Portman is great, her character is cute and funny. I really enjoyed the film the first time, but i think the more you watch it, the more it grows on you. The begging of the film starts off exciting, and as you get into it, you experience all these different emotions like - happiness, sadness, pity, joy, etc. Zach did a great job directing this film, i hope i see more of his work in the near future.

Zack Braff played his part very very well, and i liked him very much. However, since i am a girl, i related very much to the character played by Natalie Portman, and besides, i think she is a doll, she is a great actress. There was chemistry between them, and i for one, waited that kiss for a very long time, and i thought it was very very touching, as well as the scene when she is crying in the phone booth....i guess i would have done the same....it was the only thing that i saw in this particular film: feeling, real feeling, something with which you can relate.

Legit...,"Like everyone else invading these forums, I found the trailers superb. I caught the movie this last Sunday at The Grove in L.A. I walk into the theatre expecting to find it at most half full. To my surprise, the theatre was packed...at an 11 am show....11 am?! Hopefully this movie earns the right to run nationwide, because after watching the film, it sure deserves it. Well written, well directed, and well acted by all of the cast. Though I'de say quite different from the trailers, the film still was up to par. The film covers a spectrum of emotions, and I found myself laughing at some pretty random things. Braff has a big future if he continues in the directing/writing department. Portman puts up quite a performance, finally breaking away from her Queen Amadala role. (thank god) Music...awesome. The images...one can really relate to. so many times in this movie I found myself recalling a time when I was in Zach's shoes, facing the same issues he was dealing with. I can't wait to pick this one up on DVD, make a great one for the collection.

BEST FILM EVER,"OMG. Possibly the best film ever! I saw it this evening, and loved it. Cinematography, acting, lines, great film. Although some of the dialog was strange, and the swearing mostly gratuitous, I thought that the film had a great message. Zach Braff did a great job acting/directing/writing, although it seemed to be mostly a vent for him to say all the things he never could before, and say it to a large audience. But whatever it's motive was, I thought that it was a terrific film, pretty much from beginning to end. Braff made good use of repetition, alliteration, and other amusing techniques to make the film a terrific experience. I recommend it to anyone who an interest in film, nay anyone who ever felt that they were just another dot in the world. I rated it as 10/10. See it. You will not regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Classy? Subtle? Poignant?,"I credit Natalie Portman for being extremely talented but unfortunately, she has given two good performances this year in uneven movies.Garden State is not a 'bad' movie, please do not get me wrong. Natalie Portman absolutely shines in it, but it is also an empty, narcassistic film not worthy of comments like ""defines a generation"" and ""beautifully crafted."" It does not fail to entertain and it is nice and fluffy. Although I do not know if that is necessarily complementary.This movie is a great outlet for Zach Braff to show how much of an ego he has. He is NOT a very good actor nor is he a writer. He borrows a lot from ""The Graduate"" and in return produces a very similar film for the typical ""misunderstood"" indie teen crowd.The film has been called ""quirky"" far too often. Okay, ill give it that. But a lot of style and no substance do not make a movie. It appears that Braff has taken directing lessons from Wes Anderson, PT Anderson, Alexander Payne and Todd Schlondz but fell asleep during their screen writing seminar. The scene in the end where Largeman gives his speech to his father about ""this being life"" is so badly written and tries so hard to be down to earth that it has the ability to destroy the movie, had it been good up to this point.There are things about the film I did enjoy. I liked the scene in Sams bedroom where she talks about doing something no one has ever done before. I liked the scene where Peter Sarrsgard takes Sam and Largeman to get his mothers necklace back. If only the entire thing had been that well-written.So see this movie for good performances from Peter Sarrsgard and Natalie Portman. Don't see it thinking its going to ""define your generation"" or you are ""totally going to relate with it."" And if your looking for quirky film-making, stick with Wes Anderson, someone who actually does have talent.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty lame movie,"I'm not sure why everyone is hyping this movie such as they are. It's funny, one of the reviews said it defined the generation of people in their teens and early 20s. Wasn't XXX supposed to do that? Actually if this movie applied to any age group, it would be late 20s, maybe early 30s.The dialogue was terrible. Like fingernails against the chalkboard bad. Plus there wasn't much of a storyline.It's funny, if an unknown writer tried to pitch this script, the reaction would be ""Who cares. Why would anyone want to watch some slice of life movie about your home town?""But because this guy is on some TV show, and conned Portman and Holm into doing this, we have Garden State.The only good thing about this is that you get to watch that little hottie Natalie Portman. But your time would be better spent watching ""Closer"", where you get to see more of Portman (and I'm talking' skin here), you get better dialogue, and a movie that is a Mike Nichols film, not one that wants to be.",,Anonymous,Romance

The film that we've always wanted.,"Nobody knew ""Garden State"" was coming. But it did, and it is a true gift to cinema. It is rare to see such a complete personal story come to the screen with such aesthetic mastery. Zach Braff has managed to maintain a balance between intense drama and natural humor. The result is the crazy feeling of love. Natalie Portman's overwhelming performance is a testament of that vision. The film had a quality that ran deep with ideas a young audience relates to. Carefully written, the core situations of the film are placed amidst specific settings that communicate his feelings and philosophies about his identity and the places that have shaped his life. This is the movie that filmmakers work their whole lives to make and it's amazing to see young Braff's first film succeed so wholeheartedly. This is the kind of work that was as fresh as real life, milking the medium of film for all its good worth. It is full of wonderful acheivements that will need to be remembered as long as home is where the heart is.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Braffs screenplay deserves merit..,"In 2004, Zach Braff emerged as one of the year's best success stories. Braff, a star on NBC's TV sitcom Scrubs, found distribution for his pet project Garden State, which he wrote, directed and starred in.In Garden State, Andrew Largeman (Braff) returns home to bury his mother in New Jersey after 10 years of living on the west coast as a struggling actor. He has been held down his entire life by anti-depression medications. On this trip back to his roots, he leaves behind the medication and his reservations. With the help of a few friends and a girl named Samantha, played by Natalie Portman, Andrew embarks on a journey to rediscover happiness and himself.The screenplay for Garden State might not satisfy those who are looking for action and excitement. But, like Lost in Translation in 2003, Garden State is certainly a solid movie. No, nothing explodes, but if you're looking for engaging dialogue about self-discovery and an appealing story about a young man returning to his roots, this is the movie for you. Braff's screenplay is clever and witty and his characters have many layers.The best thing about Garden State, as I've said before, is its intelligent look at life. One scene in particular illustrates this notion the best. When Andrew downs an ecstasy tablet at a party, he begins to observe the things going on around him. Things move quickly, then slowly, and back and forth, in and out as people go about their business. In his heightened state, Andrew begins to see things in perspective. As he sits on the couch, partygoers pass him by at lightning-speed; much like life passes us by as we sit and watch, oblivious to the fact.It's these kinds of indirect metaphors that make Braff's script so incredible. Watch the pool scene, figure it out and you'll see why.The acting is also high-level. Braff brings the perfect pitch to the character of Andrew, someone just recently freed of the medications that bound him for so many years. And although she'll dive back into Star Wars this spring, Portman helps to shed her ""Queen Amidala"" image with a quirky performance as Samantha. With mature and complex roles in 2004 films like Garden State and Closer, she shouldn't be in danger of being typecast.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful acting and soundtrack make up for slightly shaky direction.,"'Garden State' is a simple movie about a young, mentally and emotionally unstable man returning to his home in New Jersey for his mother's funeral, and finds love during his visit.Garden State is quite a good movie. On the surface it is a simple story, but as most movies like this are, it is deeper then that.One of the problems it has is it's direction. The plots and sub plots are shaky. The movie is short, and I was not exactly sure where the plot was going until the end, where most of the material seemed to quickly explained. Then again, maybe that is intentional sense it left me thinking when it was over.However, that is made up for by the wonderful acting, particularly by Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard.The soundtrack is also awesome. Simple, great music that help to illustrate the emotions at hand perfectly.If you are looking for a simple, relatively light movie and are open to some directional flaws by first timer Zach Braff, looking for some great acting, and maybe even some songs to add to your MP3 player or ipod, then Garden State is your match.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"too many characters, speaking too flat a dialogue","Although admirably done on a tiny (these days) budget, writer/producer/star/driver/ coffeeserver Braff tries to jam too much into this story of (eventually) a search for love, and the movie as a whole suffers for it.Braff complains (commentary from deleted scenes) of having to remove important scenes for time, but the ones he leaves in are pointlessly flakey -- it's as if he couldn't decide if he wanted a quirky movie (and that's all), or a story of love lost and found, and so he got half of each. He also spends far too much time with useless characters, apparently believing that the audience won't sit still without a goofy scene moment every so often -- it's the only reason I can see for any of the scenes in the walmart-clone, for instance.It's a shame, really. Hidden inside scenes with Largeman's endlessly goofy (to no real purpose) friends is a great story of him, his father, his mother, and Sam. I wish above all that Braff had had enough confidence in that central story to just tell that -- it might be that he didn't think his writing skills were up to the task (because the dialogue is pretty flat), and so put in goofy-character distractions (and occasional unnecessary camera tricks) in hopes that we wouldn't notice.Braff's got real potential as a storyteller, but this is really a training film. I think his future work will be of great value. . .",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
The dullest numbest indie movie ever,"It is an achievement... I don't know Braff. I don't watch Scrubs.What I can say about him is that he is a a bad director, a bad actor, and a worse writer but he is brave. Brave enough to get Natalie Portman and Ian Holm in scenes with him when it takes them a flicker of the eyes, a ghost of a smile or a frown to get where he's not after 1 hour of dialog!I've seen other people comment this movie was overrated... It's one word for it. The direction is unambitious (if you don't count the motion effect... slow... fast... slow and the alternative bands music clips... well even if you count them). The writing is awful. The dialogs are meaningless.I love Natalie Portman but it's one movie I wouldn't recommend. She could make the yellow pages sound emotional and she came close to it in that movie. She has no character but she is so natural in it, it's like watching real TV without the hystrionics.In fact, it's like watching real TV. When I say it's the numbest indie I've seen... it's exactly that. It falls into all the pits and traps of indie movies... It's slow, inconsistent, tries to jump from comedy to drama and back every two seconds and fails every time, there's a subject but no story... a pity!It's nothing more than a teen flick that pretends to be deep at times and never even get to the level of the worse romantic comedy... Don't worry though... there's the happy end sealed with the ending kiss.Watching it makes you feel like the main character... zombified.

Anyone can relate to this movie,"Garden State is a movie that I have to watch again. Not because I like it so much, it's just that I can relate to this film. Zach Braff is great in this film.

There, he trys to talk to his dad, get to know his friends all over again and as a bonus, he meets a girl. That's the pin-point of the movie. When he meets Sam(Natile Portman), he first thinks this girl is out of her mind. But, as the film progresses, he starts to love her, and they become the best of friends.

So natural, so real, you feel like you could know all these people. The thing about it i loved best was that every time you expected something to happen, it didn't, not cos the movies all full of twists and turns and crap like that, but because you realise, the only reason you expect it to happen is cos it does in other movies, but never does in real life. life is not full of one liners and neither is this film. the other best part of the film is the awesome soundtrack. a bit of trivia, Colin hay, who sings ""just don't think i'll ever get over you"" is the lead singer of men at work, the Aussie band that does ""i come from a land down under"". i think that rocks. Zach Braff deserves an award for his acting and his directing (i don't know if he's got one for the film, but he ought to!) because this film makes you feel all the emotions of real life, cos it is real life. in a time when most people are thinking about how crap reality is, we should all watch this movie so that we can remember that reality really is wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
a very heartwarming movie that should make anyone smile,"Garden State is Zach Braff's (J.D. on the NBC show ""Scrubs"") directorial debut, and I must say, he did a wonderful job of creating what we think is a silly pointless comedy, but then blossoms into a great romance story with the quirkiest of characters.Braff plays Andrew Largeman, who takes more medication than I thought legally possible, and due to this, Andrew is ultimately incapable of emotion. In fact, in one part, he says that he hasn't cried in 9 years. After his mother's death, Andrew returns to his New Jersey hometown (hence ""Garden State"") for her funeral. His father, Gideon, (Ian Holm) is also his psychiatrist, meaning his father is the reason Andrew has been on umpteen million meds since he was 9 years old. He reunites with his old high school buddy Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), who is ironically a gravedigger/graverobber who is burying Andrew's mother. The day after the funeral (the scene about the night before is funny as hell), Andrew heads to another doctor, and decides to get his recent series of headaches checked out. While waiting, he meets a young girl named Sam (Natalie Portman), who is by far the quirkiest girl I've ever seen. They begin to talk, and then after the appointment, (another hilarious scene in which the supporting character owns) Andrew gives her a lift home (in one of the funniest looking motorbikes ever). As the movie goes on, Andrew and Sam become friends, and Mark is involved in making sure Andrew doesn't lose his bad side. The ending, in which Andrew cries for the first time in a while, is very sweet that should make anyone's heart melt. This is definitely a movie to see with your girlfriend or boyfriend, or husband or wife. The acting is great. Zach Braff portrays his character to the highest level, making him numb, funny, and sweet (three very opposite words). Natalie Portman is at her best playing the quirky, yet well intentioned Sam, and Peter Sarsgaard is very likable as comic relief. Easily a classic.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
When Is Natalie Portman Going To Find a Man Her Own Age?,"GARDEN STATE (2+ outta 5 stars) I had high expectations for this movie... but, after finally seeing it, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. It's well-done... the acting is fine and the directing and writing are decent... but over-all the movie just seems to be missing the final spark to set the whole thing aflame. Zach Braff (of TV's best sitcom, Scrubs) stars as a severely depressed actor, hooked on medication, who returns to his old hometown for his mother's funeral. He faces some childhood issues and, with the help of a funny, spunky (and underage???) girl he meets in a hospital waiting room, he gets off his pills and starts to enjoy life once again. How many movies has Natalie Portman been in now where she plays the funny, spunky (underage?) girl who is the catalyst for the renewal of an older man's appreciation of life? (Leon The Professional, Beautiful Girls, Closer... can we work Star Wars in there somehow?) Maybe the problem with the movie is just that it starts out so slow and ponderous as it sets up the bleak, depressive state of its main character? Maybe if it had started with him meeting Natalie Portman and then working backwards to explain his condition it might have been easier to sit through? Anyway, a nice try from director/writer Braff... but it just didn't work for me.",,Anonymous,Romance

It was still off-beat but it wasn't so much so that I had to rack my brain to figure it out. Basically, it's simple . . . sometimes you have to let people in to figure out who you are. You have to be able to laugh at yourself and be able to cry. Most of all, you need to find your ""home"",no matter where, who, or what that word means to you.

Quirky love story with panache,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This is a triumph for Zach Braff who directed, wrote, and also stars as Andrew Largeman who finds that love beats the holy heck out of lithium and assorted drugs bizarrely prescribed by his unfeeling father who just happens to be a shrink. Ladies and gentleman never let your father be your shrink.I was quite taken with Natalie Portman who plays Sam who turns out to be Large's true love, and such a kinky, quirky, beautiful true love she is. Portman eschews beauty in every scene but manages to be cute and sweet and very emotionally evolved, which I liked. She is of course beautiful and brilliant as everybody knows, but here she tries something different. She strives to be ordinary and slight but with great emotive power. Nice performance.The sound track which reminded this old guy of something from Simon and Garfunkel, and in fact there is a Simon and Garfunkel tune on it, was the sort of sweet, nostalgia-producing, alternative rock kind of sweet angst sound that lets you know that this is what youth is all about.Largeman, wanna-be and somewhat successful/somewhat failed actor out on loan, comes home from the big city to rural New Jersey because his mother has died, unaccountable in a bathtub--which can happen if you are a paraplegic. He deals with a childhood tragedy and acquired guilt, meets his old buds, including Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) who is a full time slacker and part time dreamer and consummate doper. Largeman unveils his sidecar mobile--the only thing willed from his grandfather's estate--with its white star on combat green, and tools around town, parties a little and meets quirky Samantha who likes to tell lies as a kind of way to deal with the world. I knew a girl like that, only she only knew when she was lying--if somebody caught her. Sam figures it's a tick like Tourette's, and anyway her lies are harmless.The movie is sweet and mildly comedic with some original shtick, and at times a bit of a tear-jerker. More than anything it's a touching love story, which I can never resist. And, yes, it's very New Jersey like Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, although no songs by them on the track. Oh, and Elizabeth Shue classmate of Braff's in high school.See this for Zach Braff who put a lot of his emotional life into the film and deserves the accolades he's received.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Breath-taking, beautiful mind of Zach Braff.","At first when I heard about this movie, I thought to myself, ""How good can a movie be if the goofy guy from Scrubs made it AND it's about New Jersey?"" But after I saw it, I was completely dumbfounded. What an amazing production. First, the story is great as it's about an emotional and mental journey of a guy who knows he needs to move forward but can't. Second, Natalie Portman never makes a mistake when she's choosing a movie, except for Star Wars, but I'll overlook that. She was incredible in this movie. Third, the random scenes and dialogue in this movie was so off-beat and wonderful. Finally, the music in this film is incredible, from Coldplay to the Shins to Simon and Garfunkle. And Frou Frou's 'Let Go' is amazing.This is by far the best movie that I've seen this summer. Forget Hollywood blockbusters. Indie films are better than anything right now. The cinematography of this movie is amazing. Zach Braff has an eye for detail and outstanding talent for drawing the audience into the movie. The script is easy to immerse yourself in and empathize with the characters. 'Garden State' keeps you laughing and contemplating at the same time. It relates to your life, if you're young, and touches the heart, if you're anyone.

not a comic book movie,"American cinema is over run with stupid movies, they are everywhere, comic book movies, computer game movies, Disney ride movies and terrible teen comedies. All of these are aimed at the younger market, some of them make money and some are forgotten two weeks after opening. Then there are the cheaply made gems that no one wants to make, they some how sneak through the filter of Hollywood and make it to our screens. Last year was a golden year because there were two brilliant ones, Napoleon Dynamite and Garden state. Both of them had exceptional un-orthodox scripts, brilliant comedy and unforgettable scenes. Movies I could watch over and over again. Garden state is a movie any self respecting 20 something person should see, and for the rest of you, if you like irony and sarcasm with no comic book characters this is the place to go. It's so refreshing to see a young film maker use his own un orthodox script.

"A great movie that tells us - ""it's just life - just live it.""","I definitely enjoyed this movie. To me, it felt somewhat like a grown up ""breakfast club"" - angst and people drawn to each other because of emotional pain. The first time I watched it,I was truly a little freaked out and didn't know what to think of it. The second time around, however, I could really relate to the characters, and ended up being really emotional and loving the movie. One of the things I loved about this movie was the theme of just living your life and realizing that it might not always go as you plan but that's okay. It's quite realistic and doesn't sugar-coat the pain that normal people experience, without overemphasizing it. The soundtrack is also wonderful; I bought it right after I watched the movie and it's barely been shut off since. I am captivated by Zach Braff, Natalie Portman, and the entire cast.

Time to review one of the best films ever!!,"In Summer 2017,unexpectedly,I watched one of the best films ever,Garden State,I also discovered that The Perks Of Being A Walflower was one too! The film follows a failed small TV actor,who usually bottles up his feelings,for instance,never having cried for years,goes back to his hometown for his mother's funeral to discover a bunch of great people who never even knew existed. The film is directed by Zach Braff who also stars as the main role. Garden State is a brilliant film,I've loved it since the day I watched it and I try to watch it,once every year,so,next year,possibly in Summer,I'll watch it. The film had absolutely no flaws and I loved the guest performances by Peter Sarsgard and Natalie Porter,I thought they were brilliant as well as Ian Holm and the small appearance by Jim Parsons. The film had brilliant acting,as just said,and a great story that was brilliantly put into a movie,I heard it was based on Braff's true life experiences. The film has a excellent soundtrack featuring a song that would end up being in my best songs ever list which was Let Go - Frou,Frou. Garden State is a brilliant movie,I really advise you to see",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Hilarious, dark, touching, and ultimately uplifting!","Wow!!! This movie really spoke to me. I absolutely loved it!!! I saw it twice on opening weekend, and I haven't seen a movie twice in the theaters in over 6 years. I know this has all been said before... but Zach Braff is a real talent. What a REAL screenplay. People say that some lines felt ""scripted""... well, I disagree, cause I couldn't help but think of the way my friends and I communicate with one another, and there were so many lines or moments where I laughed and thought, ""Yep, been there!"" It truly felt like this movie was really speaking to me personally, and that's clearly why I love this movie. I just thought the characters were so real... and aside from all that, it was one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen. I would take this over ANY comedy that's come out in the past 10 years... because the jokes in ""Garden State"" were subtle, and they were funny because they were REAL and not forced on you. So, in summation, I tip my hat to Zach Braff... for the past 10 years I've gone to the movies hundreds (if not thousands) of times, each time asking myself the same question: ""Will this be my new FAVORITE movie of all time?"" And each time, I've come out of the theater answering: ""Nope... not even close."" Well... on Friday, August 20th, it might have just happened!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

a coming of age rom com with character as well as quirk,"The first feature from writer, director and actor Zach Braff is a quirky but sincere film that transcends its traditional romantic comedy structure.Braff stars as Andrew Largeman, a 26-year-old washed up actor who's been zoned on lithium for 16 years, courtesy of an over-zealous shrink father (Sir Ian Holm). When Andrew returns home for his mother's funeral, he quits the pills and reunites with school pal Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), a gravedigger who collects Desert Storm trading cards, and meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a fearless, expressive inspiration of a girl.It's Andrew's gradual thawing from his numbed existence into a full and participatory life that's so beautiful in this film. His interaction with Sam is natural and revelatory, and the humour is both spontaneous and believable.Where Garden State is least successful is in Andrew re-negotiating his relationship with his father, but this sentiment doesn't overshadow the resonance of the rest of this film.Garden State is a rare cinematic experience  a commercially successful independent film that's heart-warming, but not irritating, memorable but not a guilty pleasure, significant, but about insignificant people, and humorous without being (too) derivative.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Different, and very good because of it.","For starters, let's just admit that this film will not be everyone's cup of tea. True, there has yet to be a film made that appeals to every demographic, and Garden State itself does not tick every box. For example, if you are the type of person who rates a film by 1) the number of explosions, 2) the death count and 3) just how many witticisms Big Arnie can crack off in between, this film is not for you. If however, you can take to a film that has an unarmed protagonist then you may just be in for a very enjoyable couple of hours. Garden State is one of those fantastic films that, by blockbuster standards, seem to be driven by a whole lot of nothing. There is no comet hurtling toward earth, no serial killer on the loose, and no super villains in underground lairs. What there is is a story about real people. Garden State is the type of film that I wish was the rule toward American film production, rather than the exception. It is telling that this film was unable to find financial backing among the big studios despite the star leverage of writer/ director/star Zach Braff and Danny DeVito (picking up Executive Producer credit). Thank God then for Gary Gilbert who saved the picture with $2.5 million of his own cash. Thank God indeed that he did then, or probably one of the best films of 2004 would not have been made. The storyline is a standard boy meets girl romance, altered by the imaginative supporting cast into more of an ensemble comedy with a romantic heart. This supporting cast, both animal and human and encompassing such varied beings as a masturbating dog and rap loving, beat - boxing cop lifts this movie out of being a standard (and probably forgettable) coming home/falling in love story. It is to Braffs credit that he is able to weave all of this co - existence into one straight story. Garden State is an excellent film, not suffering for it's tiny budget but rather made charming by it. It is obvious that this is a work of love by not only Braff but also the entire production crew. See this film to remind yourself that film can still be a medium of magic, should it ever be released from the cold grip of pure commercialism a'la mainstream Hollywood. Oh, and not to forget Natalie Portman, the only reason I watched this film originally. And yes, she retains her crown as the world's cutest (and most talented) actress. Peace. And for God's sake - WATCH THIS FILM!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A breath of fresh air - Best after the 2nd viewing.,"I've seen this film 4 times now and with each viewing it has gotten significantly better and better. The first viewing was jolting -- the movie is built in such a way that one sitting just doesn't quite satisfy one's ability to fully comprehend what's going on (or appreciate it). Two screenings is key if you're looking to fully enjoy this movie, three or four if you're looking to add it to your list of ""Top 20"". It's *that* good.The casting and music are impeccable. There are moments of cinematic brilliance in the film as well as nearly-student-film-esque pieces that combine for a unique tinge of filmic glory. Really, there aren't many films anywhere near it in the grand library of film itself, but prepare for plenty of films to come out inspired-by Braff's ""Garden State"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Garden State Writer, director, and star Zach Braff puts a unique and","Garden State Writer, director, and star Zach Braff puts a unique and compelling spin on the often retold tale of self-discovery in ""Garden State."" The movie starts with Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returning to his New Jersey home to pay his respects at his mother's funeral. He has been estranged from his family, friends, and New Jersey for nine years. The return to the Garden State sparks Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) to take a vacation from sleepwalking through life in a numbness caused by lithium. The reason why Andrew Largeman was prescribed lithium and disappeared for nine years was because of a tragic accident that happened between his mother and him when he was a young boy. On the second day of being in New Jersey, Andrew meets Sam (Natalie Portman) over an unfortunate incident with a German Sheppard and they become fast friends. Throughout the rest of the movie bizarre incidences occur with old friends and Sam as Andrew rediscovers himself and the world without lithium.The beginning of ""Garden State"" seems slow, because the plot and characters take a prolonged time to develop. For the first couple of minutes of the movie the main character, Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff), seems to be uncaringly going throughout his day and his character seems one dimensional. However, later on the viewer realizes that the development of Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is postponed until he is lithium free and returns to New Jersey. The character of Sam (Natalie Portman) is one of the most distinctive and exceptional characters I have seen in a movie recently. Sam's sense of unique adventure and lack of inhibitions presents her to seem as if she is a ten year old girl trapped in a twenty-some year old body. There is a great deal of chemistry between Sam and Andrew. The awkwardness of Sam and Andrew getting to know each other is extremely realistic, and shows how self-conscious people can be when they let a new person into their life. For example, when Andrew visits Sam's house for the first time, Sam keeps saying, ""Wow you are like totally freaked out right now. You are like just running for the door. It's okay you can leave,"" because Sam thinks that her living situation is so bizarre. Additionally, the character of Andrew's dad is very underdeveloped and boring, and he only shows up to talk about Andrew's health. Nevertheless, the rest of the characters are oddly fascinating, spending their days digging graves, being a fast food knight, and inventing silent Velcro. Overall, the characters of ""Garden State"" bring humor to the movie with their quirkiness and unpredictability.""Garden State"" is often being praised for the wonderful compilation of songs that comprise its soundtrack. These songs are not only intrinsically excellent; additionally they fit the mood of the movie perfectly. For instance, at the beginning of the movie when Andrew Largeman is still sleepwalking miserably through life ""Don't Panic"" by Coldplay is playing. The overall sound of the music is fitting and the lyrics coupled with the events in the movie create a sense of irony. Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, is singing, ""We live in a beautiful world"" as Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is stuck in L.A. traffic, drives away from the gas pump with the handle still in his car, all while under lithium in a state of numbness that matches the melodic aspect of the song. The soundtrack is intrinsically fabulous, but when combined with the scenes of the movie it is a perfect match.The characters and the plot of ""Garden State"" are extremely unique, and the music flows with the movie perfectly. ""Garden State"" puts a different twist on the traditional self-discovery tale for the age when many people are highly medicated on prescriptions like Zoloft, and Paxal, and lack their self-defining characteristics. However, through its different twist on the self-discovery tale ""Garden State"" still has mass relate ability, even for those non-medicated, because it is still simply a story of finding one's self. ""Garden State"" is worth the money and time it takes to watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What on earth is wrong with these reviewers?,"There is a very strange fascination with this movie that I really don't understand, and in fact, I cannot even comprehend it so I won't even try. But somehow, the general consensus on this movie has been positive, which is bewildering to me because I don't think I've ever seen such a pretentious, worthless, work of a wannabe auteur gain such praise.Zach Braff is a bad student moviemaker. It is a fact because he shares the exact same characteristics as other bad student moviemakers. So much so that I expected him to possess one of the NYU film school's certifications to make music videos. He aimed ""Garden State"" at people my age and believed that he could explain our twenty-something angst with his laundry list of blatant hypocrisies.He blames prescription drugs, he blames his parents, he blames the broken latch on a dishwasher. Braff spends so much time analyzing what's wrong with life and family that he doesn't recognize that he depends on those same things to survive. The fact is, there isn't anything really wrong with his life. He's only trying to make us feel like there's something wrong with our lives, that maybe we're the ones that have spent most of our years in a drug-induced haze. Braff is wrong, and it demonstrates how bad moviemakers are the ones preaching an agenda rather than portraying honest characters.And that's not to say his preaching is any good either. His scenes of calmly experiencing a plane crash, the sterile bedroom, and blending in against a wall pattern are obvious suggestions of his mental state, and so obvious that it takes away from the narrative of the movie. He spends all his time feeling sorry for himself and hanging-out with his shadow puppet friends, who seem so incapable of expressing any realistic emotions that they have to exhibit an array of absurdities in order to pretend to be plausible human beings.""Garden State"" is a demonstration of a young moviemaker trying to make an important statement by contriving meaning out of something that was a bad idea to begin with. Ian Holm plays an emotionless father in this movie, and I somehow believe that he was not acting in his role. I believe he was so bored by the quack pseudo-intelligence behind the script that he felt it unnecessary to put a mature adult in his scenes.After all, does anyone on this planet know what the ""infinite abyss"" is? Does even Zach Braff know what the ""infinite abyss"" is, or is it just another spit bubble that looks like something that has substance but is really just the foaming hot air coming out of his mouth? One thing I do admire about Braff. He was able to convince so many people that he actually knows what he's talking about.Out of the 1200 movies I've seen, this is one of the truly awful ones that scrapes the bottom with ""Autumn in New York,"" ""40 Days and 40 Nights,"" and Demi Moore's ""The Scarlet Letter."" This is one of those movies that I paid to see and felt so cheated by the end, that I snuck into another movie. Happily, that movie was ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" which was like a pleasant breeze that cleared the stink that ""Garden State"" left in its wake.People who like this movie need to grow up.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Down To Earth And Genuine,"Garden State is excellent. It's funny in a mature kind of way. The scene with the dog in the doctor's office is classic. It's not distasteful, just very funny because it could happen to anybody.

Clever, for instance Sam ""swears"" she thought Andrew was retarded... She's great!Genuinely a very well written story, script along with an excellent cast for today's likings. Kudos Zach, you have a lot of talent that I hope takes you far in the film industry. Andrew Largeman is just a normal guy but isn't too sure about himself, as he's pretty aware of his surroundings.

The Movie I Hate To Love,"For awhile I resented this movie for most of the reasons people have posted.Of course, it glancingly addresses subjects that could have been examined much more in-depth. It poses (not much, but a little) as being generation defining. What disappointed me most on my first viewing was how glibly it treated the whole psychopharmacutical issue; it kind of taught this weird lesson, like, Go off your drugs and within about two days Natalie Portman will fall for you and everything will be okay! So much of the young generation today is medicated by shrinks, both wrongfully and rightfully, that I was actually annoyed that such a smart movie would take such a dumb, simplistic approach.Then I watched it again and I realized: Oh, it's a Comedy.This movie is just damn funny - Consistently funny from beginning to end.

Third, unbelievable Actors. There is nothing that I could say to express how unbelievable these actors are, so I will Just leave it at that.

Great debut,"Thanks to his debut Zach Braff becomes part of that group of directors, such as Wes Anderson or Tiodd Solondz, that are more interested in the characters than in the story; more interested in reflections and deep messages than in pyrotechnics. In ""Garden State"" Zach plays himself the main role, a young whose life is all messed up and that comes back to his hometown to assist to his mother's funeral. That trip will be his catharsis.The movie walks between the existencialist drama and the romantic comedy. Simple story, ordinary people... great movie.*My rate: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Possibly the most heart-warming picture since Forrest Gump,"Garden State goes above and beyond my expectations. Truly, this film cannot get any better. Led by the exceptional acting by Natalie Portman and followed by Zach Braff, Peter Sarsgard, and Ian Holm, this film should be in any viewers top ten list. I cannot stress how uplifting this movie is; it possibly could be the most ""hopeful"" movie since Shawshank. Zach Braff does have the magic eye of a director and should be praised for this crowning achievement. The movie takes on a blend of Lost in Translation and Eternal Sunshine. The realization of one overcoming their ""numbness"" from drugs is portrayed perfectly by Zach Braff in both the direction and the writing.

Peter Sarsgaard is excellent as always, giving depth and meaning to a character even when the script is weak.On the negative side, the dialog is embarrassingly bad, and some of the scenes (the one involving the hotel comes to mind) seem like they belong in another film. Natalie Portman, whom I usually love, is annoying, although I'm not sure if the script might be more to blame than her. The great Ian Holm is completely wasted.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

It was great to see a quality love/life story in the blockbuster summer.,"Garden State was a great time capsule of the transition that young adults face when redefining themselves. I felt that the acting was superb, especially by Portman, Braft, and Sarsgaard. For a debut film I felt it had great continuity and possessed a genuine quality that most films lack and push for. Natalie Portman really does a fantastic job in this film, her ability to capture the simultaneous tearful laughter is reminiscent of of Checkov and his brilliant narrative. One of the great qualities of this movie was the acting, for only good acting can produce those moments when we know what the character is feeling with out obvious gesticulation and without the aid of lines to convey them. Overall the movie was toughing and entertaining, It was great to see a quality love/life story in the blockbuster summer.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

She touched me greatly in ""Anywhere But Here"" with a subtle, emotional performance; and in ""Garden State"", she displayed a totally different (but just as intriguing) personality---the vibrant, quirky yet adorable Sam.Peter Sarsgaard never disappoints me. Ian Holm is quite decent as well. Zach isn't all that brilliant as an actor, but he's still convincing.To those who said ""people who like this movie need to grow up"": Don't be so silly and arrogant. Keep in mind there's such thing as ""opinions"". You have every right to dislike, hate, bash this movie, but AT LEAST LEARN TO RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS. Insulting those who like ""Garden State"" is a very immature behavior. Now who needs to grow up?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
