A trip into the mind,"If the director of this independent film tried to make us feel really confused, like the main character, he did it wonderfully. There are only a few movies like this one, the kind of movies that makes you pay attention to every minute of it. Obviously that doesn't work all the time, but this case is the exception. Really well directed with a wonderful photography and excellent cast. The main actors' performances are great. We really root for the guy as we hate the ones who try to take advantage of him.Original films like this one always stand out. Perhaps it didn't caught much attention at first but now it is in an important position at the IMDb top 250 and that means that most the people recognize great movies when they see them.As I said before, this movie is a little confusing because it runs backwards while the black and white scenes run in chronological order. But that wasn't a cheap trick to make the movie more ""intelectual"", it was its strength. A rare film that shouldn't be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolutely No Spoilers Here--READ THIS REVIEW INSTEAD!!!!,"Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Some memories are best forgotten. You have to appreciate how original a movie Memento' really is!,"Losing your memory would have to go close to one of the worst experience anyone could ever suffer from. In the movie Memento', we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of Pulp Fiction', Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world.Leonard Shelby wears expensive, tailored suits, drives a late model Jaguar sedan, but lives in cheap, anonymous motels, paying his way with thick wads of cash. Although he looks like a successful businessman, his only work is the pursuit of vengeance: tracking and punishing the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that Leonard suffers from a rare, untreatable form of amnesia'. Although he can recall details of life before his accident' Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he is, where he is going, or why.Christopher Nolan has made one great (but confusing) movie. His style in directing and editing Memento' is quite unique, as no movie has ever been made quite like it before. The story being told in a backward kind of motion makes the audience have to think hard about what they are watching. It also makes the audience feel for a guy like Leonard, whose condition only gets worse and worse as the movie goes on. I am almost 100% sure that Nolan and his brother Jonathan, made up this story in the realisation that it was meant to be confusing. What is also cleverly done by Nolan is the use of black and white and then colour shots. In my opinion, the variations in these shots are used so it confuses the audience even more.Guy Pearce's role in Memento' shows me why he is so successful in Hollywood today. Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on the hunt for his wife's killer. The only problem is that Shelby is suffering from anterior-grade amnesia', a disease that cannot be treated. With Lenny', I feel the audience suffers partly the same condition as he does, and partly does not, as we can remember what has happened in the present.Memento's other main stars include corrupt cop Teddy' (Joe Pantoliano). A friend said of Pantoliano's performance in Memento, he was perfect for the role of Teddy', as he comes across as the mysterious bad guy'. I could not agree more. There is also the character of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is a lot like Teddy in her own way. What is similar about these characters is the way they use Leonard's condition to advantage their own situations.Other characters include Sammy Jenkis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is a victim we learn about from an old case when Leonard Shelby was an insurance investigator. There is Leonard's wife, Catherine (C.S.I.'s Jorja Fox) who is another fascinating character. Although we do not hear her say much, she is a vital part of this most confusing story. Add in the funny role of Burt (Mark Boone Jnr.), the motel clerk, who openly admits to Lenny that he is ripping him off, by giving him two rooms, but that he will not remember it happening anyway.Yet in no way do any of the characters in Memento' realise they are in a time reversed movie. I am sure that many of the performers would have had to read their scripts many times to understand what was happening from a cinematic point of view. But from an acting prospective, this would have been an easy experience to be part of. Memento also has some interesting devices to tell the story. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. Without them, our hero would not be able to remember anything.Nonetheless, memory is the most vital element in this movie, because without it, people are confused, isolated and abused, which is what happens to our hero', Leonard.  As Lenny mentions early on in the film, ""Memory's unreliable ... Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the colour of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.""  But it has to be ironic that Leonard is the one who narrates Memento', when his recollections and memories of events are inaccurate and jaded. There are also some powerful scenes in Memento'. The one which sticks in my mind the most' has to be where Natalie abuses Leonard, calling his dead wife a whore', snorting smartly that you won't be even able to remember what I have said'.So, if you watch this movie and it confuses you the first or even the second time, I can assure you that is how you are meant to feel, confused. If you hated watching Memento' the way Christopher Nolan intended, then I can only recommend that you get a hold of the DVD and watch it in chronological order, as it will really help you. Memento also shows how bad mental disease' patients can be abused by healthy people and what lengths sick patients will go to try and keep sane'. Also, if a movie makes you think, then in some way it has been successful in doing something that many movies do not do  making you think. Those sorts of cinematic experiences are the ones that we need to cherish for life, as they are few and far between. Memento is one such experience.CMRS gives Memento': 5 (Brilliant Movie)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
can't believe how much I'm still thinking the day after,"So the ""innovative"" concept of filming out of sequence has been cliche for at least a few years now, but here's a film that makes it work far better than its been shown in a while.Having read the reviews and talked to others who saw it, I thought that I'd go into the movie figuring everything out right away and declaring the concept unworkable.  I couldn't be further from the truth.  This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries.  Portrayed (for all intents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that our lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than usual) does.  Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife.  Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.Overall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I'm still not sure.  This film noir concept shouldn't work, but it does so wonderfully.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Memento,"Memento is a one of a kind film that to me felt like it didn't quite live up to the hype and reviews. The cinematography itself was superior and the way it filmed was extremely unique and had never been done before which I appreciate. But for how unique and different it was, it was equally confusing and just all over the place. I felt the movie lost your attention and just lacked an overall synergy. The story line was cool and there was a lot of mind bending moments that made you think but I just think this movie could've been redone and been better than it ended up being. Worth the watch regardless still.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
watch it early so you can see something else afterward.,"I saw ""Memento"" in the early afternoon, a fact for which I am thankful. Why?  Because it then proceeded to dominate the majority of my thoughts for the rest of the day.  That night I lay in bed, tossing and turning, my mind trying to wrap itself around the story, and I absolutely could not GO TO SLEEP!I finally just gave up on sleep, got up around midnight, and watched ""Election"" to cleanse my palate.  Then I went back to bed and starting contemplating ""Memento"" AGAIN.  Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, I went to sleep.This is a movie that gets in your head and will not get out until you figure it all out.  And that can only be done with extensive internet research. Reading ""Memento Mori"", the short story upon which the movie is ""based"" helped, too.""Memento"" is nothing short of a phenomenon.  And a brilliant one at that.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Snazzy editing doesn't make an amazing film,"The majority of people on this comments board attribute this film's success to its very original editing style. The film is built upon this style, showing you a present-time snippet of the main character which leaves you wondering about why he got there and what he's doing. The film then continues showing you a snippet of the immediate preceding past of the main character, and so on backwards in time helping you understand the beginning of the film. That's where the movie's originality stops. The plot itself is filled with huge holes. While the premise is interesting, it is hardly plausible that someone with no short-term memory would not be 'assisted' by society in any way, nor that he could not have a notebook handcuffed to him or something rather than all the tattoos. I found the movie rather predictable and did not really care about the movie after about halfway through.Still, an interesting and innovative movie-making style with a neat, if unplausible, situation for the main character. This coupled with sometimes very unconvincing acting by the main actor (although it is a hard role, he never really pulls it off) and a wholly boring plot earns this movie a 7 in my book.If you want to see a real whodunnit type movie that will haunt you for a long time to come, try Thesis by Spanish director Almenabar which I saw last night and save Memento for a day you want to study film rather than enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
how exhausting watching this !,"I just don't understand what it is that makes this movie so popular, especially with male viewers, I mean 8.6? Come on, what is that?! ...Leonard suffers from short-term memory loss and tracks back using notes and body parts to find the man who killed his wife. On his journey he encounters a number of people who he has to be able to assess at first sight because of his deficiency.The acting by Guy Pearce is very convincing and even appealing but the story however is most of the time way too irritating because you constantly have to backtrack yourself in order to completely understand what's going on. I like flashbacks in movies but a film that turns out to be one big flashback by itself may be a little too demanding for me. I guess this is just not my kind of entertainment ...",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Addictive and fun to figure out,"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is truly a rare and exceptional achievement in modern filmmaking in that it manages to be new, fresh, hip, and exciting without ever tiring its audience out - unless you're walking into this film without the desire to participate and actively analyze the mysterious details.If that's the case, then this is DEFINITELY not a movie you should see. If, on the other hand, you are open-minded, creative, and alert, you'll definitely appreciate and get a kick out of this one. ""Memento"" is an old-fashioned ""film noir""-type mystery thriller with an intriguing, ingenious twist: outfitting the entire film with a style that mirrors the protagonist's own mental condition while giving the poor viewer(s) his own perspective as well. It is masterfully filmed and edited in such a way that it is chronologically presented backwards (with two initially separate, parallel storylines - the main one, shot in colour, is the chronologically-backwards story with scenes that intercut with those of the other story, which is filmed more like a documentary, shot in black & white, and mostly takes place inside a motel room with the main character narrating, talking about the effects of his condition, etc.) While the average viewer may already be put off by such a complicated, confusing format, it is a very original premise that is well worth the struggle to figure out.Acting is solid across the board, as is the writing, directing, etc., but special kudos must be extended to the very talented editor Dody Dorn, who successfully managed to put all of these fragments together and help them flow in a smooth, healthy manner that is not easy to pull off.One of the most ""memorable"" (sorry, couldn't help slipping in the bad joke) films you're likely to ever see, ""Memento"" is an instant classic due to its groundbreaking narrative style and impressive dramatic undertones. For those jaded moviegoers who seek something to keep them awake, interested, and constantly thinking, there couldn't be a better choice than this film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Its not a gimmick, its something new","Yes, it's true.  The entire movie is based on a gimmick.  However, I honestly feel that this does not cheapen the picture in the slightest bit. I loved every scene; discovering information as our lead character discovered it. It demands a second and third viewing, as there are many subtleties and quick flashes that may not be picked up on the first time around.  Its one of the most original films ever made, and for people who scoff at the concept of not having a short-term memory, it actually is a real condition. Watch this movie. And, please pay attention. The performances are wonderful, and its structured magnificently.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A very strong contender for Christopher Nolan's best film,"Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'Memento' was not his first film, having directed 1998's 'Following', but has been considered by many the film that rose him to fame and brought the world's attention to him. Cannot disagree with this, and also that not only is 'Memento' his first great success but seventeen years later it gets my vote as his best film. It really makes one think hard about what is happening, crucial in a film where a lot of concentration is needed, without being treated like you are an idiot or dumber than you are. It is also one of the few Nolan films where it was difficult to find anything to fault.As always with Nolan, 'Memento' is a wonderfully made film. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious , with some scenes strongly reminiscent of film noir (as a fan of film noir that was great to see). David Julyan's synthesised (something that could have sounded tacky but actually adds a lot to the atmosphere) score makes very clever and dynamic use of distinct sounds, oppression, yearning, loneliness and loss having a haunting but also affecting vibe, the feeling of being lost adrift being perfectly captured.Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and the length, after seeing some later efforts that have suffered from over-length and over-ambition ('Interstellar'), was ideal.It is the story that makes 'Memento' Nolan's most fascinating film, with a unique non-linear, time-reversed structure with two converged time-lines. That sounds on paper confusing but with Nolan telling the story in an intricate, tense and atmospheric way (meaning that he takes his time telling the story) it makes perfect sense, with beautifully interwoven use of thematic motifs of memory, guilt, perception, self-deception and grief and a stunningly moving ending that one does not expect.Guy Pearce is astonishing and give one of his career's best performances, don't think from personal view that he's been as good as this since. He gets excellent support from particularly Joe Pantoliano and even Carrie-Ann Moss.Overall, a brilliant film and a contender (my personal vote certainly) for Nolan's best film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best Movie of 2001 (Thus Far),"Incredible, riveting and powerful.  What else could I say?  This movie has all of the qualities of classic film noir as well as the magnitude of an original, unique concept that has been tried and tired before but works here.Guy Pearce has been underrated for years (just think back now to Priscilla and can you believe this is the same guy) and finally might get the recognition here that was at least well-deserved of him back for LA Confidential.  Powerful perfomances, well developed story with suspensful buildup of what our main character pieces together little by little makes this a must see.Easily in my top 100 of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hip? Cool? Different? Maybe, But Also Frustrating","This was ""okay,"" but frankly overrated by the national critics. Because the story ran backwards, I guess that was supposed to be cool or hip or something. If you make things too hard on the audience and most get confused on what's happening, it makes the elitist critics feel good because they ""understand it"" and thus feel superior. It's so much hogwash.Having said, I didn't say I didn't find the movie interesting. I did, and enjoyed the performances of Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss. A man with no short- term memory goes back, scene-by-scene, trying to find the killer of his wife. It's a film I saw back in 2001 on VHS and I'd like to see it again, now that six years have passed since then. I understand one of the special-edition DVDs of this showed the movie in the correct time sequence without all the flashbacks. That might have been less-creative, but better.However, be warned: this is a frustrating film to watch for first-time viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not to be missed if you are looking for something clever and original. ***1/2 (out of four),"MEMENTO / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:How is this for a scenario? A man breaks into your house in the middle of the night. He kills your wife and leaves you with brain injuries. Furious, you pledge your life to track down and kill whoever is responsible. There is just one problem: after the head injury, you are no longer capable of creating new memories; everything before the accident is crystal clear, but now you cannot remember anything past several minutes.Now chew on this: what happens to guilt if you cannot remember what you did? How can a person have emotions if he does not know where they came from? How can we learn from our experiences if we cannot remember them. What is the purpose of revenge if someone cannot recollect or prosper from it?""Memento"" wins this year's prize for inducing the most audience participation. Not only is the film thought-provoking and unusually absorbing, but it also places us in the main character's shoes. How can we be in the same mental status with the main character when he cannot remember anything? Writer/director Christopher Nolan has that answer: he tells the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. However, each individual scene plays running forward, often overlapping, providing us with clear, constructive transitions. The main character, Leonard, is confused in prospects of time and experience, and so are we.Other characters include Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, from ""The Matrix""), who also lost someone close and can help Leonard, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano, also from ""The Matrix""), whose identity often shifts mysteriously. Then there is the series of flashbacks of Leonard's experiences while working as an insurance agent. The situation involves an individual named Sammy, who has a memory disorder similar to Leonard's. His diabetic spouse is not sure whether her husband is faking his condition or not. To prove it to herself she arranges a test I dare not reveal. Leonard is more intricately involved in this story than he even believes.""Memento"" is smart and imaginative. It doesn't pass up little details of the characters. Leonard is constantly jotting himself notes and taking Polaroid pictures so his life can make some sense. He even gets permanent tattoos all over his body so he does not lose or forget some of the most important information.In a movie like this, it would be almost impossible to make without leaving some information out; even some of the film's actors were confused and requested a script told in sequence order. But these filmmakers have constructed a movie with a plot hole big enough to drive a semi through: If Leonard cannot remember anything after the accident, then how can he remember that he has a memory condition? There are no tattoos or notes to remind him, and whenever he meets someone he explains his condition thoroughly. This is necessary information he reveals, but there are better ways to do so. We could be there when his doctor explains the condition to him, or see his friends talking about it. The sky is the limit in a movie like this. It was not essential to leave such a massive, obvious hole in the plot.""Memento"" is still a unique mystery thriller. It is a tantalizing experience we do not often come across at the movies. For audiences who like to sit back and relax, this film is a waste of time. It requires us to follow along, participate, fit puzzle pieces together-""Memento"" doesn't provide any easy or obvious answers. All but the most intelligent and thoughtful kids will not be able to follow this film; it is intended for adult audiences. ""Memento"" is one of the year's most challenging movies, not to be missed if you are looking for something clever and original.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Clever I guess, but not that enjoyable to watch","Another cleverly done example of backwards story telling, from the Pulp Fiction school..  Unlike Pulp Fiction, the backwards element got annoying and tiresome fast in this film.  It certainly was a creepy film, maybe even affecting (time will tell, since I just watched it), but I didn't find it all that enjoyable.  The ending was unsatisfying for me, after sitting through the previous hour and fifty minutes (yes, I found myself watching the clock to count down when it would wrap up).  I suppose I could get a bit more out of it with repeated watchings, but I don't really care enough to bother with that.

Original movie-making at its very best.,"Every now and then, an original concepts gets turned into an highly original movie. ""Memento"" is a fine example of original movie-making at its very best.It's impossible to fully describe what this movie is about. Best thing is to watch this movie with a clear head in order to follow the movie. But even then some parts of the movie remain confusing. Because of this ""Memento"" is a perfect movie to watch multiple times, every time you will discover a new fact or things like that. The story is told beautifully and highly original with flashbacks and jumps in time. Basically the whole same story is told over and over again but every time you get to know a little bit of more information. Sounds confusing doesn't it? Well, don't say I didn't warned you...Christopher Nolan provides this movie with a brilliantly suiting visual style and directs the movie with lots of flair and pace. Truly a good young director of which we will hear way more in the near future. He also already made real fame by the 'casual' movie viewer by directing the stylish blockbuster hit ""Batman Begins"". Not only is he a great director, he also is a great writer.The acting in the movie is really solid. Guy Pearce is a great leading man and he is supported by some wonderful actors in the supporting cast: Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano.Because that the movie and its story are so original you never know what is going to happen next. It's a typical independent movie, without any clichés or other distracting elements. Yet the movie is more accessible then it sounds.

Finally saw this gem of an enigmatic film!,"Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a terrible problem. After his wife was murdered and presumably he was beaten, he has no short term memory. His last recollection is the moments before his wife's demise. Now, he is determined to track down the killer the police couldn't find. Yet, everyday he must read his notes and gaze at the many tattooed phrases on his body so that he can continue. Two people appear to be helping him in his quest. One is a man named Teddy, who pops around all the time but seems rather shady. Equally so is a Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss) who is sleeping with Leonard but may have ulterior motives. Meanwhile, Leonard stays at a cheap Los Angeles Hotel where the manager introduces himself every day and, underhandedly, adds to Leonard's bill. As he crisscrosses the city looking for the murderer, the film also flashes back to his time as an insurance investigator to give us more clues. For you see, this film is designed to force the viewer to piece together the plot, bit by bit! Are you game? I finally saw this fantastic Nolan film that everyone raves about incessantly. Its worthy of the highest praise as the plot travels backwards, forwards, and sideways. Pearce is wonderful as the main character, but, one quibble, I'm not fond of him as a blonde. The supporting cast is also superb with few big names except Moss. The setting in Los Angeles has its splendors and its dives. Memento is a huge cut above most other film experiences.

Then, he has to use the little bit of memory that he has left to...no, I can't tell you; it would give the whole movie away. My point is that ""Memento"" is a most incredible movie.

Smart but nothing else,"I like to start my review by saying that I don't think this is an enjoyable movie which doesn't mean it is at all bad, I thought it was very good actually. The story is what stands out, it's very unique and the way it is presented is great although it is rather slow throughout. For me it was a bit boring as it was straight dialogue for two hours, but it did all lead to a dramatic ending which was quite satisfying yet a bit confusing. Most Christopher Nolan movies are quite confusing though so I did expect this when coming into it and I did understand what happened I don't feel like I was truly able to take in so much knowledge in at once and it left me a bit baffled. The acting was pretty good, nothing stood out to me neither did the music used and it wasn't that tense but the idea as a whole was great and that is pretty much the only reason I give this higher than a five, the story.

Christopher Nolan is a magician,"Christopher Nolan is a magician. No other way to put it.This movie ended up on my top ten list when I saw it a few years ago. It is one of the most original thrillers to have come from America and it supposedly became popular solely on the basis of word of mouth.Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce in an excellent performance) is a man who has short term memory loss. He is a man on a mission. He is determined to find out who killed his wife. He has various ways to remind himself of small facts - writing them on notes and sticking them on the wall, tattooing facts on his body and so on. The story also involves two other characters - Natalie and a man named Teddy who seems to have a shady past. There is also the story of Sammy Jenkis which is told in bits and pieces by Leonard in disjointed scenes. Sammy also had the same problem which led to Sammy being placed in a mental institution.The main feature of this movie is that it goes backwards. Which means that the scene that follows is actually the incident which happens prior to the current situation. This is quite demanding for the viewer and people with short attention spans may not appreciate this movie so much. Repeated viewings may be required to actually understand what is going on in the movie.What I liked about the movie was the fact that despite the complex and confusing style, it is ultimately a movie which is not inaccessible. It is no art film which might bore viewers to tears. It is a fast moving thriller which can keep a viewer hooked and this is what separates Memento from other such complex thrillers. Most importantly, it is the little facts and clues that are the most interesting. The loose ends are tied up expertly at the end with such brilliance that I am still at awe at the execution even several years after watching this movie.Overall, it is in fact quite depressing. There is not one likable character in this movie, except for Leonard, and we see how his medical condition is used by people to serve their own interests. It presents a bleak view of human nature, in many ways.As far as the performances are concerned, Guy Pearce is fabulous as the determined but confused Leonard Shelby. Carrie Anne moss is brilliant as the mysterious Natalie who may have other motives in helping Leonard. She has the right kind of mix of beauty and mysteriousness which make her perfect for the role. Joe Pantaliano as Teddy makes a big impact in this movie. His dry humour and screen presence make this role one of my favourite performances on film.Altogether, it is one of the best films of recent years and it is exactly the kind of movie I like.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Come on people, it wasn't THAT good","Before I rant on the absurdity of Memento being currently ranked #14 on the Top 250 list, I'll say what I liked about it. Yes, it was an extremely entertaining, original and well-done all around film. The acting was first rate, the story decent, and the film makers did a great job putting it all together.However, I may be crazy, and I'm sure the ""film snobs"" will grit their teeth at this, but at the end of the day, isn't Memento just a gimmick? A water cooler novelty? I mean, basically they took a slightly above average plot and did something new, and granted inventive, by editing the film structure in reverse. For the most part, the movie is pretty much shown from end to beginning. Yes, they did enough to make things make sense in between, but essentially it was an exercise in ""hey, let's make a movie, and then edit it so everyone will talk about that reverse movie"".I don't care what anyone says. That's the bottom line, period. I've talked with plenty of fellow movie buffs who I consider to be reasonably intelligent, and some are even the snob-types mentioned above. And none of us can figure out what all the fuss is about. Maybe we ain't that smart.I hate to get into comparisons, because it's difficult to compare different types of movies. But be honest, if you can tell me with a straight face that Memento is an overall better film than ""Apocalypse Now"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Fight Club"", ""Jaws"", ""Chinatown"", ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", ""American Beauty"", ""Silence of the Lambs"" and a large chunk of the other 230 films ranked below it, than you just need to sit back, take a deep breath, reel in that massive ""I'm a nonconformist art-house movie aficionado"" thing and get a reality check.

An example of Nolan's early spirit in movie making. A rare gem with a fantastic climax,"Excellent movie. This movie shows Nolan's early spirit in movie making, as this is his second feature film. However this is not for everyone. Even if you're a die-hard Nolan fan, you still might not like it. It was in my cup of tea, so I loved it. The movie is a complete mind bender. It doesn't play in order. It jumps from the past to present a TON of times, so it can be a hell lot of confusing. It's a slow movie, but fantastic. It grabs your attention from the start till the end. The suspense builds stronger as every second ticks by. If you haven't seen it go see it now, because in the second part of my review I'm going to talk about the ending. The ending is something to talk about. There is a plot twist at the end, rather twistS. It is one of the most unpredictable twists ever.Spoiler Alert!As many of you have seen the movie, you will know the ending is completely mind blowing. I never expected that Leo had killed the attacker over a year ago, and that now he kept forgetting and believed that the killer is still alive. Also another crazy twist was when Teddy told Leo that Leo's wife survived the attack, and that Leo himself killed her by accident with an insulin overdose. The real shocker was when it was revealed that Leo was mixing Sammy's life with his life. Everything that was said about Sammy, indeed revealed Leo's life. Totally mind blowing. There were like 3-4 twists at the end, which blew me away. To be honest, I didn't even expect one of the twists. I was blown away because there were many twists at the end, and none of them were predictable. From all the movies I've seen this movie had the second biggest twist ending, right after ""The Prestige"", also by Nolan.This movie is very suspenseful and interesting. It doesn't let your interest leave until the very end. In short, fantastic movie and it deserves at least one watch. For me many more watches. Nolan never disappoints. Not one of his movies disappointed me, and I've seen all his movies, including his short films.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Go out and rent it. Go and watch it. Go out and buy it. you will not be disappointed. This movie is about a guy who loses his short term memory and tries to hunt down his wife's rapist and killer. I won't say anything else. It is a masterpiece, thought not perfect it probably should be about a 9.8 on the IMDb but I'll give it a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An exciting story told in an extraordinary way,"Memento is about a man named Leonard (Guy Pearce) who suffers from short-term memory loss. He relies on writing and taking pictures to track down the man he believes is his wife's murderer. Watching the film brings to life the feeling of memory loss and not knowing how you ended up somewhere. The story is told reverse. One scene will happen and the next scene will explain how you got to where the previous scene started and so on. So the thrilling mystery is unraveling for you just as it is for Leonard. Memento is intriguing and psychologically thrilling until the very end, or really the beginning. The film breaks all the rules of storytelling in such a perfect way that you can't look away. Memento is a must-see for anyone who wants a film like no others.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A unique experience,"This is by far the greatest work by Chris Nolan. Everything about this particular film is simply astonishing and you could see it from a mile away. The superb writing is out of this world. There is no other movie like Memento, no other movie that could take the audience through such a unique experience. So many emotions are felt throughout this film and still, by the time you've finished it, it will leave you wanting more because that's how great this film is. Not only the writing was perfect, but also the direction part. Nolan did an amazing job in introducing us to this fictional world, that everything felt almost real. The way he combined the black&white scenes with the ""colored"" ones was simply unique. There is nothing like it. Then, the acting was impeccable as well. Although this film might be a bit too difficult to understand for some viewers, there are still a lot of things to enjoy from this experience even if you don't understand the movie completely! As a conclusion, I simply adore and recommend this film with all my heart, because it is without a question one of the greatest and most unique films of all time and this is all thanks to the great Chris Nolan!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No interest,"I've heard good things around this movie. So I was really excited to watch it. In the end, I honestly didn't enjoy it.

Since the viewer has seen the scenes that are the results of the next scenes. It didn't keep me interested.Maybe if the charactets were interesting and I felt something for them maybe I could overlook it. But no. The main character is very uninteresting, and throughout the film I just don't care for his revenge story.If you want to watch a good mystery thriller, I recommend Seven.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Confusion, uncertainty, and paranoia as an art form: possibly.","If I told you the entire plot of this film it really wouldn't matter as it is an exquisite paean to the subjectivity of memory and therefore is in itself ambiguous; the truth' of it is up to you. You come out of the cinema questioning yourself, your memories, your truths. Nothing in this film is as it seems, and yet paradoxically everything is as it seems. We see everything through Guy Pearce's characters' (Lenny) eyes, unfortunately he has no short-term memory so cannot form new memories. He would have already forgotten the first sentence of this review. He lives in snapshots of life; his only form of memory is his Polaroid camera, just like in the excellent German film Wintersleepers; also (partly) about a short-term memory disorder.In this film Lenny takes snapshots to remember who people are, where he now lives, his car, everything. As you can imagine this is perfect for paranoia, suspicion, uncertainty, confusion, and betrayal. And that's exactly what you get in extreme doses. The difference between this film and Wintersleepers however is that Memento is entirely from Lenny's perspective. This therefore creates an imaginative, creatively unsurpassable film. The film begins where it should end, so far so trite, but here's the beauty, we, like Guy Pearce, learn in fragments what's going on. It is therefore perfect for those who love to second guess what's going to happen, who did what, who's doing what and why. The beauty of this film though is that my interpretation could be so different from yours, and neither of us could be sure whose interpretation is the right one; if there is a right one at all. Nothing is certain, nothing is clear. Another beauty of this film is the way it is filmed and edited. Pieces are shown a number of times with no real linear link between them, just like it would be if we ourselves had a memory disorder, and then they are cut up and edited next to things that happen either before or after it. It's just like holding ten different and linearly distinct Polaroids in your hand and having a short-term memory disorder. Excellent.I'm not even sure if watching it again will make things any less ambiguous, but then who cares? The ambiguity is what makes this a great film, if it wasn't so cut up, or from Lenny's perspective it would be both very short and trite; and lacking in tension, suspense and interest. But as it stands it has all three, isn't trite and says so much about humanity. Oh, and the plot? It really doesn't matter, all you need to know is that everything about this film is indicative of the subjectivity of memory, of our experiences and interpretations of all that happens to us. Nothing will seem as black and white as it did beforehand. It will make you question every memory you have, almost as much as possessing a psychology degree, as I do! So, go and see it: be confused, acknowledge the frailty of all you know to be true, and then imagine the freedom of actually being Lenny, and then the horror of having nothing, nothing but the reliance of a pen and a Polaroid camera to know who you are.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A very entertaining - and confusing - ride,"Memento is probably one of the most unique - and confusing - movies I have ever watched.
Memento does something that few other movies have done before: it is shown backward. There are scenes shown backward, along with scenes shown forward, and the two eventually converge during the climax. And while showing a movie backward may seem like a horrible way to craft a movie, it is everything but. It shows us something that will happen, and shows us how we got there. Whether we like it or not, the ending is inevitable. The movie opens with a murder, and at first, it seems justified; the man raped and murdered the wife of our protagonist, Leonard (Guy Pierce). However, as the movie progresses, or rather digresses, we learn that the man was, in fact innocent. Leonard has a strange case of anterograde amnesia that prevents him from making new memories. Every 5 minutes, he forgets who he is, where he is, and why he is there. As a result,
he uses a complex (but heavily flawed) system of notes and photographs to understand his
everyday life. He relies on these notes to survive, and track down John Doe, the man who raped and murdered his wife. Memento has so many plot twists that it is often hard to keep up with, but in fear of spoiling for you, I will end this review here.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Have I seen you before?,"If you have watched the very first movie done by Mr. Nolan, than yes you have seen this before. Not exactly like this and with quite a few flaws, but if you consider that it was more or less a student film and seeing this, probably nothing more than an exercise on how to do it on a grand scale, than it was more than decent.Nolan is one my new favorite directors and as the rating does show you here, I am not alone. Not that that will convince you he is better than you think he is. Actually you might even not like Memento, for one reason or another. There is people out there who just want to be entertained, when they go watch a movie. And that's not a bad thing. Nor does that mean that if someone likes, say Transformers 2 better than this movie, that he/she has no clue.

Pretentious dreck,"The novelty of this movie is supposed to be the shuffled time-line and slowly revealed plot elements. But, neither improve the mildly lackluster story.

It seems to me merely an exercise in hipper-than-thou pretentiousness.

the most important  English language film of the 21st century,"I write this after having to write a bad review of Nolan's ""batman Begins."" ""Memento"". after more than seven years, remains the most important English language film of the 21st century. Into it, Nolan pours all the fundamental problems of film, and the fundamental problems of memory that gave rise to film in the first place.It takes about four viewings to get any grip on this film - yet none of these viewings feel wasted in any way, as though the director has played tricks on us - on the contrary, it is the film's bald-face honesty which leaves us in despair of ever getting just the right handle on all the details and the characters.Its hard to understand how Nolan could have betrayed himself and his vision after this film, by selling out to Hollywood's highest bidders - hopefully, he'll recover and give us the Christopher Nolan film we should expect after seeing this one.But in any event, this remains one of the most important films ever made - brilliantly written, filmed, acted, edited - a necessary companion piece to Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" or Eisenstein's ""Potemkin"" - hopefully, Christopher Nolan will actually direct another film some day....",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterpiece,"Memento is careful, almost always sneaky when delivering necessary information to the viewer, because it is a film told in a non-linear way, which can be confusing, and it is made for that, and also because he wants you to put on Leonard Shelby's shoes .
The ambition to convey what it means to have a recent memory loss to those who watch it is executed perfectly, making all fear, anguish and care grow every time the film takes a step forward.The more you think about it, the more you notice striking details and the size of the film's depth.I don't remember a film so smart, it affects and touches its viewer and manages to be subtly funny at the same time.Memento is, in a way, revolutionary and confirms that Christopher Nolan is one of the best at what he does.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Memento,"Christopher Nolan took his brother's short story Memento Mori, and turned it into a serious cinematic masterpiece! No disrespect to Nolan's first piece in The Following, but this is the film that truly jumpstarted his marvelous career. Nolan created this original & nifty narrative, with a creative structure that was so mysterious & witty; with every layer that got peeled back, it got more and more intriguing. Chris Nolan has this knack of always keeping his movies entertaining, with great pacing. One of the best thing's he does is create such a mysterious story, that it has such tremendous rewatch value, that only makes you appreciate the movie that much more. The film is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed throughout; a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse.I'm not the biggest fan of Guy Pearce to begin with, maybe because I never really gave him a fair chance, with watching his movies like, Iron Man 3 & Bedtime Stories, but he really changed my mind here. He puts on a fantastic performance! To back up his performance, was a beautiful script written by Chris Nolan himself. With such an intelligent, and memorable script, Nolan was up for an Academy Award in 2002 for Best Original Screenplay, but came up short to Julian Fellowes who wrote Gosford Park. There was not one boring piece of dialogue within the film, while having it's fair share of powerful quotes.Overall, I'm definitely going to have to rewatch this again to pick up some missing pieces, but this is an absolute must watch!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mediocre story saved by cinematographic contrivance,"Perhaps because this movie was rated SO HIGHLY, my viewing was tainted by unrealistically bolstered expectations. Maybe...There was a strange twist of irony at work here: the more I watched this film the less I liked it. What began as a wonderfully, refreshing look at (reverse) story-telling, became less entertaining and more tedious with each passing (and re-passing) flash-back (or is that flash-forward?)Part of this film played like an old Twilight Zone episode I recall seeing many years ago. And that's not a bad thing. I enjoyed piecing together the ""why"" of the plot, since we already knew the ""what."" However, generally uninteresting and unappealing characters mar the performances, and while our hero may be unaware of time, as a viewer I was painfully aware of how his film seemed to drag, lacking a good sense of timing. As for the ending, it too could have been given the same delicious touches as the beginning sequence, but alas, it does nothing to reward the viewer for having endured the bulk of the film.One reviewer commented how well this HIGHLY RATED film will hold up in another few years when compared to the classics. Others have asked how on earth it could have rated so high to begin with. The former will be answered on its own, and I believe time will not be too kind. The answer to the latter is akin to the McDonald's Syndrome: Those who grew up eating Big Macs on a regular basis erroneously come to believe it's actually good food. Perhaps compared to what Hollywood is offering these days, Memento is indeed gourmet fare. To me, it's still just a hamburger. (6 out of 10).",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So I asked my sister every day if I could see it again and now, I bought it from her. I watch it at least one time every week and it never gets boring.

"""Memories can be distorted""","Memento is a very unique thriller. It's very imaginative, original, and absorbing, and I'm guessing you wouldn't have seen anything quite like it.It demonstrates a very powerful and thought-provoking message that 'we all tell lies to ourselves.The film's structure is told in a non-linear fashion involving two timelines. Ultimately we begin at the end of the story and work our way back to the beginning.It's filmed in both color and black-and-white sequences, with the latter showing the events of Leonard's story in an easier-to-understand, chronological order.At first, it might seem quite difficult to follow and, while as a viewer you are puzzled from the outset, we start to realize that we are meant to feel confused, and disoriented as if were are the one in Leonards's shoes.We have the same feelings, thoughts, and ideas as our main protagonist. This means most of the film is also a mystery to us and left scrambling to put together the scattered pieces of Leonard's past.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is unable to create new memories. He has short-term memory loss and received this 'condition' after he was hit over the head by a break-in at his home, which led to the rape and murder of his wife.He recalls a case from his Insurance industry days regarding another person with the same 'condition' named Sammy Jankis who he initially believed was faking his condition as Sammy could not learn new things through repetition. And so he recollects techniques such as sticky notes, polaroid photographs, and tattoos to help form his lost memory.Leonard is manipulated, and taken advantage of by many people throughout the film, which gives him little choice but to trust only himself.You develop sympathy for his condition, and what he has to go through each day for the rest of his life.There are so many twists and turns that Memento keeps you guessing, and your mind constantly racing for answers. I think you will be stunned by the ending when all the secrets are finally revealed.Guy Pearce was phenomenal, and this was easily his most memorable role to date. He was assisted by having such a diverse, and powerful role but he makes it his own. You believe him to be the real Leonard Shelby.This is a film that you need to be switched on, and keenly focused on to understand all the little details that make the film bind together. Very similar to 'The Machinist' starring Christian Bale.Take away all background noise, and fully immerse yourself in the story, and I guarantee that you will have an unforgettable experience.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fascinating,"Memento's unique narrative structure is its most striking feature, using a non-linear storytelling technique that mirrors the protagonist's condition of short-term memory loss. By telling the story in two alternating sequences-one moving backward in time and the other forward-the film immerses the audience in a disorienting and fragmented experience, much like the lead character's struggle to make sense of his reality.The approach to storytelling is masterful, as the backward progression of the color sequences pulls viewers deeper into the mystery and emotional tension, while the forward-moving black-and-white scenes provide crucial context and a sense of balance. This structure creates a cinematic puzzle that keeps the audience guessing and engaged from start to finish, revealing pieces of the story in a way that feels both fresh and exhilarating.The protagonist's journey-his desperate search for his wife's killer while grappling with the limitations of his memory-forms the emotional core of the film. The vulnerability and confusion he faces are palpable, and the narrative perfectly conveys the isolation that comes with losing control over one's own memory and perception.Visually, the film excels with its sharp cinematography and atmosphere, which further deepens the sense of tension and unease. The haunting score complements the narrative's somber and mysterious tone, adding a further layer of psychological depth.At its core, Memento is a profound exploration of memory, identity, and the concept of truth. It challenges the audience to consider how our understanding of reality is shaped not only by what we remember but also by the stories we construct around our experiences. Every twist and turn in the plot invites a reevaluation of what we think we know, ensuring that the film remains engaging and mentally stimulating long after it ends.In short, Memento is a perfect example of how a film can transcend traditional storytelling conventions to deliver an experience that is both intellectually enriching and emotionally impactful. It is an intricately crafted, multi-layered thriller that deserves a 10/10, as it leaves a lasting impression and rewards repeated viewings with new discoveries and insights.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Its rating gets some other movies lose their meaning,"You know that IMDb Top 250 is always discussed, the overrated movies, the underrated movies, the movies which should be in the list, the movies which should not be in the list etc. I believe that movies like Memento causes a problem. The ratings of some other movies lose their meaning. They cause some other movies lose their worth. Memento has one of the most smart, brilliant and complicated scripts of all time and also the story editing of the film is the same, it must be very hard to make, as known, the story begins from the end and retrogresses, in terms of direction, it is well, but no more than that, so a good movie, a good crime thriller. The tone of the movie is 'independentish'. I don't say this in a good way or in a bad way, but it just looked me interesting. Even if I could not understand it exactly, there is also a twist at the end. I recently saw The Machinist which I can call Christian Bale's Memento, it was a pretty good movie, but there were plot holes, but there is not in Memento, so I appreciate the effort, but it is neither one of my favorite movies nor a great movie.

Decent movie that fools the audience to believe it's deeper then it actually is!,"This is a decent movie, it's in no way a masterpiece/classic!

When you first watch the movie you aren't sure what's going on (confusion is the intent to kind of give the viewer Leonard's perspective), you believe it's a mystery and are trying to piece things together, but in all actuality, it's not a mystery and there is nothing to really piece together, which is fine, just don't kid yourself that it's some type of mind bender that you as a viewer must figure out. Spoilers At the end of the day, Leonard is constructing these endeavors to give his life meaning...that's the big ahhah moment! So the whole time you're trying to figure out what's going on, the answer is; Leonard is just giving himself something to do. Not that big of a deal.

A monumentally over-rated wankfest.,"After all this time, I am still not sure why I hate this movie so much. Perhaps it is because so much undeserved praise was heaped on this pretentious and presumptuous MTV video with aspirations to being a ""serious"" movie. It meanders, sometimes careens, from one gratuitous plot twist to the next, yet in reality very little actually happens. In the end, this is not a bad approach if we are going to get character development instead. Alas, none is here. The characters might as well have had their profiles tattooed on them, like the main character does, because they are no less obvious and devoid of subtlety.Memento confuses plot intricacy for story, of which there is precious little here. Granted the story had to be sparse to further the self-conscious conceit that ties up this formulaic and trite little package with a bow. Now don't get me wrong. Any film that causes us to reconsider what we think we know and to see things in ways to which we are not accustomed is great. But that must not be confused with clumsy subterfuges designed to suggest one thing and mean another. That's just plain silly and cheap, a mindless maze that wanders aimlessly until the author runs out of gas. That's what we have here.Guy Pearce, the Other Australian Actor, is good, reminding me at times of Brad Pitt before he demonstrated so convincingly time and again his epic lack of talent. Unlike Brad, though, Guy is talented. Perhaps too talented for such a claustrophobic little film. And what's up with Joe Pantoliano? Let's see, maybe we can give just him a sandwich board to carry around announcing his ulterior motive in every scene.

Out-Standing!,"Memento is one of the most original, and stunning movies I have ever seen. Memento is close to an epic masterpiece. They take a simple plot, and mix it up with all these different chronologically strategies. (This time using several chronologically mixed scenes). One man wanting revenge for those who killed and raped his wife, his memory the only thing stopping him. But Memento takes you through a journey of strategy, notes, pictures, black-mail and surprises. It certainly lives up to the hype, and remains as Nolan's best movie. A guarantee I can almost give to all viewers is that: they'll be things that seem a little mixed up after your first viewing, that's normal. I have watched Memento two times, closely and yet, still they're a few unanswered questions. Memento delivers in all aspects, a intriguingly thriller with an opinionated ending.",,Anonymous,Mystery

The GREATEST murder mystery I've ever seen! 🏆,"Memento stands as a towering achievement in the realm of murder mysteries, delivering a mind-bending narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats until the very end. I was blown away by the suspense of this movie and how masterfully the story was woven together. 🕸Christopher Nolan's directorial prowess shines through in every frame, as he skillfully navigates the intricate layers of memory loss and deception. The film's unique structure, with scenes presented in reverse chronological order, adds an extra layer of complexity to the already gripping storyline. 🎬Guy Pearce delivers a mesmerizing performance as Leonard Shelby, a man with short-term memory loss on a quest for revenge. Pearce's portrayal is riveting, capturing the desperation and confusion of a man trapped in a fractured reality. 😵The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, delivers solid performances that complement Pearce's lead. The chemistry between the characters adds depth to the narrative, as alliances shift and motives are called into question. 🤔While this cinematic achievement is undeniably a masterpiece of storytelling, it does have one significant drawback: its lack of rewatchability. I would have gladly awarded it a 9/10 or even a perfect 10/10 if not for this factor. Once you know the twists and turns of the plot, the element of surprise is lost, and subsequent viewings don't hold the same impact. Despite this minor flaw, Memento remains a MUST-WATCH for any fan of mystery and suspense. Its innovative narrative structure and compelling performances make it a standout in the genre, cementing its status as one of the greatest murder mysteries of all time! 😮",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I respect the fact that it is original, and it takes a lot to write a script of this magnitude, but it's just not an enjoyable watch. I don't like watching movies not knowing what's going on or being confused. Interstellar was a perfect example of a movie that has depth, a big reveal, and requires you to think without being a mess like this. The plot is already deep enough but then you add the reverse chronological order of the story that just makes it a big circle in my opinion. In addition I'm not a fan of movies that are dependent and reliant on a big reveal such as the movie S7even because to me it makes the entire movie a waste, and it's like the whole movie is dependent on the reveal.

Some people take advantage of it, some use it to define who they are, while some totally disregard regard it and try to stick with the facts/written word. The  main character incorporates all these facets into his life at one point or the other, and the movie shows that no one facet defines who you truly are.What IS complicated in the movie is determining what is fact and what the main character thinks has happened or what he has conditioned himself to think occured in the past. Therein lies the complexity of the movie, and there are several clues thrown in throughout the movie, very subtle but indicative clues.The movie does require at least a second viewing to capture the points the director is trying to make.",,Anonymous,Mystery
State of the Art,"I first saw Memento 20 years ago, not long after its release, and watched it again last year. This film is a genuine experience when first viewed. It's the reason why I watch movies, hoping for experiences like this, but they are rare.Memento is unique because the story is revealed to viewers in reverse (backwards) order. The beginning of the movie shows the end of the story, then proceeds towards the beginning. This might not sound appealing but in fact it engages the viewer in the story - or more specifically. It puts you in the head of the lead character, who suffers from amnesia.And while you might wonder how there's suspense and intrigue in a story told backwards, you'll have to watch it yourself to see. In fact there's plenty there in terms of plot twists and surprise. It's a one of a kind and well worth your time. The casting and acting performances are spot on.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fragments of Memory,"Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is a masterclass in non-linear storytelling, inviting viewers on a labyrinthine journey through the fragmented mind of Leonard Shelby, played with compelling intensity by Guy Pearce. The film's reverse chronological order is not just a gimmick but the very essence of its narrative structure. It mirrors Leonard's condition of anterograde amnesia, effectively immersing the audience in his disorienting quest for truth and vengeance.From a thematic standpoint, 'Memento' delves deeply into the concepts of memory, identity, and the subjective nature of truth. Nolan expertly weaves these themes into a tight script that challenges the viewer to piece together the puzzle along with Leonard. The film prompts introspection about the reliability of our own memories and how they shape our sense of self.Technically, 'Memento' is a triumph. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is stark and gritty, complementing the film's tone. The editing is particularly noteworthy, as it seamlessly intertwines the color and black-and-white sequences, enhancing the narrative's disorienting effect. The score by David Julyan subtly underscores the film's moody atmosphere.On a personal note, 'Memento' struck a chord with its portrayal of a man desperately trying to make sense of a world that slips away from him every few minutes. It's a film that stays with you, not just for its innovative storytelling, but for the emotional resonance of a character striving to find a foothold in an ever-shifting reality.In conclusion, 'Memento' is a brilliant exercise in unconventional storytelling. It may not cater to all tastes, given its complex structure, but for those who appreciate cinema that challenges and engages, it's a deeply rewarding experience. The film not only entertains but also invites viewers to ponder the fragility of memory and the constructs of our own identities. Nolan's work here is not just a narrative twist but a profound exploration of the human psyche.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Very boring movie,"It eludes me how this movie has gotten such high ratings and even two Oscar nominations.This movie is for the most part mind-boggling boring, with endless repetitive sequences of how our main character writes notes, tries to remember certain events or persons. This goes on for about 80% of the movie in an desperate attempt to create ""suspense""...but it gets tiresome. The end admittedly had a moderate surprising twist...however, from a certain point of view, the end was also predictable and, somehow, disappointing. The only positive thing about the movie is a good performance by Carrie Ann Moss, however the main character did not convince me, neither did the plot. (If there was one, besides of a repetitive line-up of the character's confusion and attempts by him to puzzle together memories.)

A modern-day masterpiece,"From the literal beginnings of the 21st century comes what will probably go down as one of the top 10 films of the period.Leonard, who seeks revenge for the killing of his wife, suffers from short-term memory loss, not being able to remember anything from about 10 minutes ago. His quest is presented in a, as far as I know, unique structure, assembling the scenes in reverse chronological order and sandwiching them with black & white scenes from an unknown time period (relative to the body of the film).What is so great about this premise? Well, besides being a astounding experiment in montage, it is an incredibly effective way of putting in Lenny's shoes. Every colored scene begins with no context whatsoever, putting the viewer and the main character in the same situation. You can only guess by knowing what will happen next, which is masterfully countered by Nolan with a script that never ceases to amaze, either by smartly including just the needed amount of context for the previous scene (or the next, in the movie's internal chronology), or by changing our perspective of what we just watched (scene at Natalie's house).This is an incredibly technical premise for a film, but it also manages to reach an emotional level. After all, isn't all that hard to imagine the horror of having a condition such as Lenny's. This takes me to the main complain I've seen for this film, which is how surface-level characters may seem, with the film trying to uselessly get a sensitive response from the viewer. While this holds true (for me) for Nolan's future films, such as Inception or Interstellar, I don't think it applies to Memento. As happens with Lenny in his daily living, the viewers don't have the time to know someone in a deeper way than a now-you-make-this-thing-to-get-your-revenge level. Also, his condition makes his quest turn completely trivial and we, as the viewers, can experience this very clearly.Nolan just crafted a film that left me wondering how someone could possibly make such an original thriller, keeping it so complex and, at the same time, so comprehensible. My only reservation. Watching Teddy´s reveal to Lenny, you can see traces that show Nolan as a director which later would heavily depend on exposition, and not the good kind. Otherwise, this is as close to a totally monumental film as you can be. Watching the relationship between the colored and B&W scenes at the ending of the film constitutes one of my favorite moments in cinema, showing the power the medium is capable of achieve as an art form. Together with its heartbreaking ending, this amounts of one of my favorite movies ever.99/100.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nolan's best movie.,"I really like Memento, it's my favorite Nolan's movie. And even thought this is the second movie of his career, it's possible to notice his marks. Short scenes, quick dialogues (but all of them important for the story) and a big plot-twist (or many of them).The movie is about Leonard, and he is looking for the man who killed his wife. But there's a problem. On the night of the murder, he had an accident and now he can't make new memoirs. Because of it, he uses notes and tattoos to remember the clues. There are also people he thinks he can trust to get information, but these actually take advantage of his condition.It's a big puzzle and you keep your attention on the screen to try to put the pieces together and solve it. One thing that force you to pay attention is the movie's structure. The plot happens like ""from back to front"" (I personally only realized this some time after the movie had started), what makes you anxious for the next scene and anxious for the next scene of the next scene.In parallel with the main plot, there's flashbacks (in chronological order) in black and white in the transition of scenes that contributes to the viewer's understanding of some aspects of the story.At first, the editing of this film seems to be confusing and unnecessary, but throughout the movie you understand the reason why of this and when you finish to watch it you notice it could not be made in another way.When you least expect it, you are not only trying to connect the informations, but also thinking about who to really trust and what Leonard really is looking for.Everything is relevant in this movie and you must be attentive to details. I like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great film for directors or film editors,"Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is hunting the man who killed his wife. He has to do this while struggling with short term memory loss meaning he relies on photos of important things and tattooing important facts on his body.As everyone in the world knows the film runs backwards from the end for the majority - meaning that we, like Leonard see events without any knowledge of what has gone before. Like him we only have photos etc to help us. Unlike him we know what will happen and this makes it easier to follow the story. The film follows two streams - one where Leonard is telling someone over the phone about Sammy Jankis - a man who has the same memory condition. The second stream is the main narrative backwards.This film is amazing. If the story was told forwards then there would be very little here but the devil is in the editing. This is a director's film - the key lies in the editing of scenes and the many visual tricks that provide clues to the conclusion of the film. The main compliant everyone has is that the ending leaves too many questions unanswered - however on the first viewing this is not true. The first time you see it the ending is simply and devastating - the twist is not as breath taking as Usual Suspects or Se7en but it will profoundly move you. When you get over this you begin to pick back over the plot and the ""Sammy Jankis"" section and you will find it difficult to come up with a water-tight solution. But to me that's one of the things to enjoy - the discussion with friends about the film and the fact that it stays with you for weeks after you've watched it.Pearce is excellent in the lead, I cannot believe this guy once was in Neighbours! He is a totally believable character and makes the audience feel so many different things throughout. Joe Pantoliano is excellent - but then he always is. Even Carrie Anne Moss is good. The strength of Moss and Pantoliano is that we don't know who they are - are they Leonard's friends, enemies, good, bad? - and they play on this ignorance wonderfully.The film is not in the top 250 because of the story but because of the editing. This is so different from anything else recently that it blows you away. It takes 15 minutes to get going but once you're in then you're in. This is worth watching as it shows how even a simple story can have a huge impact.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Problematic.,"This is just...I don't even know. I watched this years ago and was really blown away by its odd structure, but really it's rather simple once you get a grip on it - heinously simple, even. It's told backwards in a linear line and interspersed with black and white shots of the lead actor telling us the back story, so what? This movie is given a lot of credit for being complex, but it's not that mind boggling when you think about it. And the ending just feels like a huge slap in the face, especially after all that build up and guessing...it's deceitful!And a lot of the first half of this is just too dull at times - especially the bits where the lead character is telling you about his client in the past who had a similar condition. It just feels too forced; they could have done it in a better and more interesting way.But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a good movie anyway. The deceit of the ending has its purpose and everything is fulfilled in the end; I just can't help feeling a little odd about it anyway. The strength of this movie just lies in the suspense that comes with it. Deceitful or not, it keeps you watching and guessing until the end. Sigh, this is a really dividing movie, as you can tell. You just don't know what to think about it, and I guess that's another good thing about it. Memento is a perplexing case and I would recommend it if you like thrillers - although you could always do better, this one definitely stands out.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
unique,"I have to tell my opinion about Memento in two ways, cinematically and my own personal preference.Cinematically, this is a work of art by Christopher Nolan. The way the movie is structured is very unique. You watch the movie in the perspective of the protagonist, and how he is viewing his life. I felt anxious, tense and confused with him. I felt manipulated, really wanted him to cure his condition so he can realize all he is going through! I was sad about him, wanting him to get revenge, yet i know something is not right which makes me as a viewer very anxious. Not from not knowing what going to happen, but generally from the idea that ""his memory is very short"" People lied to him, manipulated and used him to their own benefit, he looked naive and weak because of his memory loss yet very smart... He is so devastated that in the end even though for a minute he acknowledged that he might have really got revenge and something was wrong, yet he was willing to follow false clues and continue down this path of him seeking for revenge. The never ending loop he is in.The idea of the story is very simple, yet Nolan and his brother portrayed it in a unique way .However, Personally, I don't like to watch a movie where i'm confused and the plot is all over the place. That's just my point of view and preference. Doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie. I like straightforward movies. This is far from it. You're all around the place, present, future, past.

"Smart, tragic and twisty","Memento is a very smart thriller that's constantly shifting and piecing together all the answers with the film, at its own pace, makes you feel smart. It's definitely Christopher Nolan's darkest film with a bleak ending that eschews the hope that would permeate most of his later work for a world where neither people, pen & paper or memory can be trusted.Guy Pearce has a convincingly excessive level of kindness to over compensate for Leonard's inability to remember others which hides a real darkness, making him a lot less clear cut than he initially seems. Carrie-Anne Moss does terrific work with one of Nolan's better female characters and Joe Pantoliano plays to his strengths whilst getting to be more subtle.Christopher Nolan going from Following to this is insane. It's a huge leap in ambition and technical craft and he pulls it off flawlessly, restructuring an already twisty narrative in a way that's easy to follow and constantly transitions between colour and black & white with ease. Composer David Julyan crafts a fittingly repetitive score that's rife with tragedy.A weaker version of this could've been incoherent but Dody Dorns's editing ensures that never happens. Effect happens before cause here and it's constantly engaging to witness the film working its way backwards, showing big events out of context and then gradually revealing more information until it all clicks into place in immensely satisfying fashion.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fanboys and hardened movie buffs agree - this is something special!,"Every few years a movie comes along that internet nerd fanboys and hardened movie buffs alike agree is something special. 'Memento' is one of those movies. The first time I watched it in a cinema I was blown away. Subsequent viewings (I'm probably up to my fourth) take a little bit of the shine off it and the essential gimmickiness of it become more obvious. It also becomes apparent that Shelby's memory disorder is a bit too contrived and only seems to kick in (or not) at the most dramatically convenient moments. Some closer scrutiny will see the whole thing quickly fall apart. Still, there's no real point in being too picky with this movie. If you accept the premise at face value you are guaranteed a fascinating and involving film experience. Australian soap actor Guy Pearce ('Ravenous') is brilliant as Shelby, easily the best role of his career to date. The ""backwards"" story telling of the movie (nicked most likely off Harold Pinter) was much talked about but it is Pearce's performance which really sells it. Joe Pantoliano ('The Sopranos') has too often been stuck in b-grade movies, so it's really good to see him given a more rewarding part. He seems to relish it and his chemistry with Pearce is really enjoyable. Likewise with Pantoliano's co-star in 'The Matrix' Carrie-Ann Moss. Moss can really act, and I hope this leads on to some substantial work for her in the future.  The underrated character actor Steven Tobolowsky ('Thelma And Louise') is also excellent in the important supporting role of Sammy Jankis, and a couple of actors I really like Mark Boone, Jr ('Trees Lounge') and Callum Keith Rennie ('Hard Core Logo') are both worth keeping an eye out for along the way. The hype surrounding 'Memento' may put many people off, but that would be a real shame as it just about lives up to it, and it's a very, very good movie. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Mind-bogglingly, breath-takingly brilliant - insanely original and intelligent","Mind-bogglingly, breath-takingly brilliant - insanely original and intelligent.A man, Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) has just shot and killed another man. Why did he do it? Through scenes shown in reverse order (with individual scenes separated by another set of scenes shown in forward order), we unravel the mystery.Christopher Nolan's second movie. His first, Following, was great and showed his penchant for clever, original plots. Here he exceeded himself - Memento is probably the cleverest, most original movie you'll ever see.The reverse order thing is a brilliant concept in itself, and as far as I know the only other movie to try it was Irreversible by Gaspar Noe (released after Memento, so Memento did it first). Irreversible was much more simple in its method - just play the scenes in reverse order.However, with Memento, Nolan goes one step further. By having intermittent forward-moving scenes he helps add backstory. These eventually meet the backward-moving scenes, closing the continuity loop and making for a seamless, continuous story.Furthermore, it is not the reverse order of the scenes alone that make this movie brilliant. Reverse order scenes without a solid plot behind them would just be a gimmick, and this is certainly no gimmicky movie. The plot itself is brilliant, and ultimately explains why we have to see the scenes backwards.Moreover, despite the enormous complexity of writing and staging such a concept, in the end everything fits and makes sense. Nolan also leaves just enough ambiguity and mystery behind so you can fill in your own theories and backstories.This movie deserves every superlative a movie can get.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

We all lie to ourselves to be happy.,"It's not until a film like Memento comes along, or that you personally have to deal with someone close who suffers a form of this subject to hand, that you get jolted to remember just how your memory is such a prized and treasured thing - and crucially that it's one of your key safety devices.Christopher and Jonathan Nolan crafted one of the best films of 2000 based on those facets of the human condition. Their protagonist is Leonard Shelby, played with stupendous believability by Guy Pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. He can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can't form a memory. So who can he trust? Does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? He tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life.Christopher Nolan plants the audience right into Leonard's world. By using a reverse story telling structure it's deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! It has been argued that it's trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it's all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. Mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in Leonard's life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. And the Nolan's know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself!The reverse structure wasn't new in 2000, but Christopher Nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as David Julyan's musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it's a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway.

Lenny doesn't have the condition,"Alright, I may not be an expert but my knowledge of this movie surpasses that of the common viewer.First off i recommend you all, if you haven't already, read the short story it was based on titled ""Memento Mori"" written by Christopher's brother Jonathon Nolan.Now for starters i do not believe that Lenny has the ""condition."" I believe that it is mental not physical. My reasoning behind this is that there were many instances where he DID remember things. Throughout the whole movie he would catch glances of his tattoos and have no idea what they were, he would roll up his sleeve, or take off his shirt to investigate, but as he was taking down Teddy's license plate number not only did he remember that he normally gets tattoos but he also remembered what number fact he was on. ALso in the same instance he writes down the 1 and the i exactly the same way, he gets it tattooed exactly the same way, but whenever he read it out loud he differentiated between the two. How could he do this without memory?Most of the movie will drive you insane to try to figure out, i speak from experience, but the director himself said that there was a logical explanation, unfortunately i don't think we can ever be sure whether we are right or not.This is my all time favorite movie, so if you have not seen it please do.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Memento Much Better Than Anticipated,"Memento was a much better film than anticipated from acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan the man behind films like The Prestige, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and last years blockbuster hit The Dark Knight which was my favorite movie of 2008. In Memento Nolan really establishes himself as an extremely talented filmmaker. Memento has an intricate but not too complicated story and the way the movie plays out with the ending in the beginning and the beginning at the end makes it feel different (in a good way) and original. Its one of those films to watch a couple times to fully understand what it was all about and so that you can pick up on little things you didn't notice the first time around. The surprises in store for anyone who hasn't seen it I wasn't quite expecting myself which made the film very enjoyable to watch at least to me. The three leads in the movie are admirable in their roles including Guy Pearce as Leonard a man with a rare brain disorder after an accident who can't form new memories. Pearce's Leonard is after the one who raped and killed his wife a man's identity he can never know for sure. Pearce is believable in the role and does a great job as the main character. Carrie Anne-Moss does a decent job as Natalie an ally to Leonard who helps in his quest to find his wife's killer but may not be who she appears. Moss is quite good at playing a character you're not sure is trying to help Leonard or just using him. The same can go for Joe Pantoliano whose equally impressive as Teddy a man Leonard isn't sure whether he can fully trust. The rest of the relatively unknown cast also turn in solid performances. The ending is fitting which reveals some secrets while keeping other questions unanswered but that doesn't hurt the movie. Overall Memento was much better than expected because of it's interesting revenge story, complex characters played by talented actors, and surprising plot twists that make for an above average entertaining thriller to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the most innovative works I've ever seen!!!,"This is my 1st review on the site and I have chosen this masterpiece of a movie to review.I have seen movies in my life with an innovation factor whether its the characters, the plot, the directing or even the soundtrack, but this movie deserves to be a great, clear contender in the innovation land.Since the 80s, we are tired as viewers of clichés regarding protagonists or antagonists and this movie serves the cause of surprising the viewer not necessarily plot-wise, but character-wise. I mean all of the characters in this movie have their ups and downs within the build up.Guy Pearce is certainly one of my favorite actors of all time, so it isn't new to me that I got owned by his acting and for Carrie-Anne Moss, she is an actress of natural, God-given ability. So, where did the pleasant surprise came from?... It came from Joe Pantoliano who added THE flavor to the movie.If you still haven't watched this movie and I doubt it, then go and see it today for it is a masterpiece not necessarily in its epic, rich, novely aspect, but for its innovation.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good,"End the from begins that thriller dark a. If you have problems with understanding the previous sentence, you are going to have even more trouble with understanding the film. Its basic idea is turning the action around. Not in a mechanical way, fortunately. ""Memento"" is a pack of scenes that end in the moment the previous scenes started in.The main character is an ex-detective from an insurance company (Guy Pearce). His wife, as everything seems so, has been brutally raped and murdered while he himself was hit in his head. The effect of damage is the so-called short memory loss. Our hero remembers exactly who he was before that tragical incident, but he doesn't remember who he talked to and what about five minutes ago. That is why he has to write everything down. He collects Polaroid pictures of the people he meets. He fills his pockets with some quick notes. He even treats his own body as a big organizer and he tattoos his chest with the main memorized clue: ""John G. murdered your wife"".This film has its own style and class. The idea itself about a guy who doesn't remember his experiences from a second ago is great. The ""reverse gear"" narration used here seems to be both logical and functional solution. Sometimes it is quite funny. For example, when the character doesn't know whether he chases someone or he is being chased.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Gripping, absorbing film-noir","I haven't seen a film for a long time that has kept my attention so absolutely as Memento did.  It is a superbly crafted film-noir thriller that is rivetting from beginning to end.  Or should that be from end to beginning?You see, that is what makes Memento so interesting.  It is told backwards. Guy Pearce plays a guy who suffers from short term memory loss - he can't form any lasting new memories ever since his wife was raped and killed by the mysterious Jimmy G.He keeps his life stable by writing notes on polaroids so he knows where he is staying, notes on the crime are kept in a rubber bound foldre provided by a contact within the police department.He is looking for the guy that killed his wife, Jimmy G.The structure of Memento is clever in that we share the amnesiacs fate throughout the course of the film - we see the results of actions and are as bemused as he is - it is only later we see the cause.Guy Pearce puts in a stellar performance as the afflicted avenger.  He is totally convincing and fully immersed in his role.He is ably supported by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss who may or may not be what they seem - are they using him to their own ends or not?Get out and see it.  A film guaranteed to please if there ever was one. It'll have you talking post-movie with your mates in such a way you haven't experienced since seeing The Usual Suspects.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better Watch from the End,"This movie is great not because of wonderful stories but how they are told. I could not figure out what this movie is trying to say for the first time I watched it. However, I knew these stories were narrated from the end for the second time and could narrowly understand the whole structure. After watching many masterpieces of Christopher Nolan, I gradually developed a particular sense to know how the plots would go on because his technique is basically playing with clips. This movie tells a very simple story that the leading role's wife was 'murdered' somehow, and he tried his best to find and kill the 'murderer'. Monochrome scenes were narrated from the beginning while colorized ones from the end. Only at last could we know that it had always been him that created puzzles and solved them himself.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Breakout Film of Christopher Nolan,"A man (Guy Pearce), suffering from short-term memory loss, uses notes and tattoos to hunt for the man he thinks killed his wife.Although Christopher Nolan had previously made ""Following"" and a short film, this was easily the film that catapulted him to worldwide success, landed him the Batman franchise, and made him one of the greatest directors working today. Although it may not be a fair assessment, the fact almost every one of his films has been in the Top 100 on IMDb suggests he has a magic touch not seen since the days of Kubrick or Hitchcock.This was also a great role for Pearce. He has been known for ""The Time Machine"", ""LA Confidential"", and more recently ""Iron Man 3"", but I think he will always be remembered for ""Memento"". He was, after all, the driving force behind the film in the acting department, appearing in basically every scene and conveying a wide range of emotions... the fact Pearce is not one of the highest-paid actors in the world is a bit unfortunate, because he can hold his own with the likes of Christian Bale and Daniel Day-Lewis.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Guy Pearce is unbelievable and this was the first time I saw what an incredible actor he is. Also, Carrie Anne Moss is ubelievabley gorgeous and Joe Pantoliano (also another favorite) is hilarioius and inscrutable. I can watch this movie time and again and never get tired of it.

Pearce sets about find the killer of his wife, a difficult task for a normal investigator much less one with his ""condition"". The film's story is simple, the characters few, and there's no sex and little action or emoting going on.

*A Masterclass in Narrative Structure*,"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is a riveting exploration of memory and identity that challenges viewers to piece together a fragmented story. Released in 2000, this psychological thriller unravels the tale of Leonard Shelby, a man afflicted with short-term memory loss, who embarks on a quest to find his wife's killer.What sets ""Memento"" apart is its unique narrative structure, unfolding in reverse chronological order. This inventive storytelling technique immerses viewers in Leonard's disorienting experience, making us feel the weight of his condition as we attempt to piece together clues alongside him. The film's meticulous editing and thought-provoking screenplay compel audiences to remain actively engaged, as every detail may hold significant weight in the broader narrative.Guy Pearce delivers a powerful performance as Leonard, capturing the character's desperation and determination with authenticity. The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, adds depth and complexity to the unfolding mystery, each character shrouded in ambiguity and intrigue.Visually, ""Memento"" is striking, with its stark cinematography reflecting the themes of confusion and loss. The haunting score further enhances the film's tone, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.Ultimately, ""Memento"" transcends the typical thriller genre, inviting viewers to reflect on the nature of memory and the subjective nature of truth. It's a film that rewards careful watching and contemplation, solidifying its place as a timeless classic in modern cinema. Whether you're a fan of psychological thrillers or simply appreciate innovative storytelling, ""Memento"" is a captivating ride that will keep you guessing until the very end.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Puzzle That Becomes More Engaging as It Unfolds,"I recently watched ""Memento,"" and I thought it was a pretty good movie. At first, I wasn't sure what to expect because the story seemed a bit confusing. The movie starts backward, and that took some time to get used to. But as the movie went on, I found myself getting more and more into it.The main character, Leonard, has short-term memory loss and is trying to find his wife's killer. The way the story is told, with scenes shown in reverse order, really made me feel what Leonard was going through. I felt his frustration and confusion, and it made me root for him even more.I liked how the director, Christopher Nolan, used black-and-white scenes to show the past and color scenes for the present. It helped me keep track of what was happening, which was important since the timeline was all over the place.Guy Pearce did a great job as Leonard. He made me believe in his struggle and his determination. The supporting characters, like Teddy and Natalie, added to the mystery and kept me guessing about their true intentions.By the time the movie ended, I realized how clever the plot was. The twists and turns kept me engaged, and I appreciated the film more as it went on. It's not the kind of movie you can just watch casually; you really have to pay attention. But that's what made it satisfying. It felt like I was piecing together a puzzle along with Leonard.Overall, ""Memento"" is a movie that grows on you. It starts off a bit slow and confusing, but as the pieces come together, it becomes a gripping and thought-provoking experience. I'm glad I stuck with it because, in the end, it was definitely worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not so much a movie as an intellectual display...Films should be made for audiences, not for filmmakers","Sigh.Let me first point out the tremendous amount of good in this film.First, Christopher Nolan and young filmmakers like him are to be commended and supported for stretching cinematic conventions and taking chances with the medium. Memento is certainly an important film, a very innovative move from the older flashback structure that has gotten to be somewhat overused. What a refreshing directorial debut, to the point that I think it rivals Orson Welles's famous directorial debut. Kudos to Chris Nolan!Also, there is Guy Pearce. He is outstanding in what must have been an extremely challenging role, and I cannot praise him enough. He succeeds in making us feel sympathetic for a character we never really understand, and that is indeed difficult. To me, this performance is head and shoulders above most if not all lead male performances of the same year.Skip the bad, onto the ugly.Some have tried to give the rest of this film the benefit of the doubt. I cannot. This is another one of those annoying intellectual-exercises-disguised-as-motion-picture a la American Beauty whose popularity I can only ascribe to their sheer complexity. The latter tried to use a complex theme to pass for worth; this one tries a complex structure.Unfortunately, the foundation of a good movie will always be a good, cogent story with strong, well-developed characters (at least in my opinion). Memento has neither. Told forwards, the plot (or non-plot) would be mediocre, even boring. As it is, told backwards, it just makes no sense. I'm not sure it would make sense told regularly. Inventiveness is great, but it is not enough to make a film one of the greatest films of all time (ahem, Citizen Kane). I would put Memento up there with Kane as one of the greatest DIRECTORIAL EFFORTS of all time. But simply put, great direction alone does not equal great film. There are also such things as writing and character, which have been lost in the age of the auteur.I cannot be the first to have noticed the plot's crucial non-sequitor. If the main character couldn't remember anything after the incident, he wouldn't be able to remember that he has a memory problem. However, he constantly tells people this, and it proves to be of central importance to the plot (which is full of other holes). He also has nothing that he would see every morning to remind him. I understand that in real life, this condition does allow you to remember some things, but the film makes it clear that the main character remembers nothing. I'm not merely picking at the film, for this plot hole actually is the plot. And I'm not quite sure how Chris Nolan or anybody involved with the film managed to miss it. Maybe they didn't care? That's likely, because this film does center more around slick direction than great writing.There is a saying that applies: to break the rules, you need to know them. This movie could have been brilliant if Christopher Nolan had taken the time to write a wonderful movie in real time. THEN, had he decided to tell it backwards, the effect, if done right, would have been awesome. However, I left this film just as confused as I was throughout. Even the endless speech at the end that was (I think?) supposed to tie everything up did not help, not to mention the fact that the ""long explanation by an authority"" is a trite, amateur denouement to begin with. It hasn't really worked since Psycho -- which, lord have mercy, is apparently a lesser film than Memento according to IMDB voters -- since the Psycho ending speech was merely tying up loose ends that the audience already knew rather than rewriting the film in seconds like this one does.Frankly, I'm sick of movies that cater either to the box office (Titanic, Gladiator), or critics (American Beauty & now Memento), and somehow end up being branded as great. Movies should be watchable and entertaining, not simply there to win awards so that film nerds can pat each other on the back congratulating their brilliance.If you want writing, character, plot, direction AND complexity, see The Shawshank Redemption or All About Eve. Memento is not the movie for you, and so far its the most overrated movie of the century.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Truly, utterly brilliant","I had grave doubts going into this one. Its fans seemed to me to be the same people who like a lot of the movies I really hated over the past five years or so, movies like The Matrix, Run Lola Run, Fight Club, and many others. I avoided it for a long time, though I always thought I had to see it no matter what. And when the chance to see it for free came along, I jumped at it.Fortunately, Memento lives up to the hype. It's one of the few movies that can. Seriously, I wouldn't doubt that this movie will one day be counted as one of the best ever made. Perhaps not the ninth best ever, its current position on the imdb top 250, but it will certainly have its place in the history books.The main reason for this is its unique narrative structure. Add this one to the ranks of Citizen Kane for its high level of narrative innovation. What it does is it tells its story backwards. It will give us one large chunk of narrative information, stop, and then rewind to the last place Leonard (Guy Pearce) began his small chunk of memory. You see, Leonard has this condition where he has little short-term memory. After a few minutes, he forgets everything that has happened to him since a serious injury. He reminds himself of his purpose every time he wakes up in a new chunk of memory through hosts of photos and notes that he has written to himself. His purpose: to avenge his dead wife. She was raped, and her rapist knocked poor Lenny on his head. This condition, which is the foundation of the narrative structure, is clearly false. You just have to suspend your disbelief as you watch, and, I promise you, you'll see something very unique.The best thing about this film is that it gives you some real mental exercise. It asks you to remember a large amount of information. Add to that the fact that not everything is trustworthy, and that truth and memory and facts and everything that we take for granted are constantly being questioned and warped, and you've got yourself an enjoyable uphill battle.The rest of the film is equally commendable, which ought to be remembered as long as you can retain it. The acting is quite good, especially Joe Pantoliano, so good in Bound, and Carrie-Anne Moss, with whom I was quite unimpressed in The Matrix. Here, she shows that she can play a complex character and that her main assets aren't her T&A. Guy Pearce is also quite good, though he was perhaps better in L.A. Confidential. I think someone else might have brought a bit more depth to the part, but perhaps not. One of the most difficult things about his role is the fact that he really has no complexities - he's a blank slate. One could honestly call him simply a tool of the plot. However, someone who would say that would be missing the fact that he is often being used as a tool by other characters. Christopher Nolan is not just a master scenarist, he's also an excellent director. Also great is the cinematography, sharp color with some spatterings of black and white.Perhaps there are some plot holes, but I didn't notice them. This is truly a masterpiece, a film to remember. 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Exhausting but fascinating thriller,"A man (Guy Pearce) searches for the man who raped and killed his wife.  One problem--he has no long-term memory and forgets things a few minutes after he hears them.  Another thing--the whole story is shown backwards so you have to pay strict attention to what's going on.  It's difficult (most movies don't want you to think) and exhausting but absolutely fascinating. The acting is simply superb, direction assured and the story full of unexpected twists and turns.  Also there were revelations at the end (or beginning) that totally caught me by surprise.  It's not a perfect film--I still can't figure out what Moss' character was doing in this--but how many films can you name that challenge you and don't treat you like an idiot.

Very intelligent and perfectly directed,"--- more detailed review coming soon ---This is one of my favorite movies.Well what can I say about it ... It's fresh, original and highly intelligent. Christopher Nolan (who has not made any bad movie so far) also wrote the screenplay for this with his brother Jonathan and the way he directed it and put the scenes together is what makes this film work so well... There are some people reviewing this film as ""manipulation of the audience"" and that the style of storytelling is all just a gimmick ... That's simply not true! It is NOT just a gimmick! The way it is directed is not to confuse us (though it obviously does) but it just makes really! much! sense! concerning the plot and the main characters situation. In this way we really getting into the same trouble that Guy Pearce is going through. This will also be the reason for everyone to watch this movie at least twice. It will blow you away the first time, will reveal itself at a second viewing (well most of it) and will still be enjoyable for another run. I have to underline again I've probably never seen a movie as clever and intriguing as this one.Besides that we have great performances by all actors especially Guy Pearce who is really likable throughout with a slightly dry humour ...And the best thing is that the movie - once you got the mind challenge done and puzzled most of it together - still leaves room for interpretation! It's a real pleasure to discuss this movie.It's NOT a movie for popcorn or a Friday night with lots of friends and alcohol :) ...It's a movie for smart people that you must pay highest attention to cause if you miss anything you'll be completely lost!So go rent it right now and have fun!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So What?!? The Characters are Pure Cardboard,"I saw this film after hearing all the hype while on my last trip back to the States. It turns out that it's much ado about nothing.I was not impressed. In fact, I was almost depressed that something so evidently sub-par was being touted as nothing short of a revelation.So what if the film has an unusual non-linear narrative structure??? So what if it's stylish, hip and has great cinematography? I don't care for the characters one bit! They're pure cardboard, impossible to relate to, sketchy at best - even Guy Pearce's character. They exist solely as pegs for a context which is not all that interesting in and of itself - in fact, it's downright pedestrian. A guy's wife is raped and killed and he goes after the killer when he wakes up - how many times has that one been used? The whole thing is contrived and stinks of an exercise - it's just soulless mental masturbation, and anyone getting off on it is really selling themselves short!Even the much-talked about backwards narrative structure isn't all that new. It's been done before in a film by David Hugh Jones called BETRAYAL, with Jeremy Irons, Patricia Hodge and Ben Kingsley. Even though the story is quite different from this film, BETRAYAL has everything this film lacks - strong characterizations and people that you actually care about. In BETRAYAL, you anxiously await the next flashback because you are genuinely concerned about the characters' fate. MEMENTO, with each flashback, just gets more and more annoying.It WAS slightly intriguing to see Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss (refugees from THE MATRIX) in this together, as it is another play on ""What is really real?"" but this is hardly a benefit. However, I don't blame the actors one bit - they were just not given much to work with.Incidentally, Guy Pearce IS someone to watch. It'd be interesting to see him and Brad Pitt together in a film - they'd be very believable as brothers.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Ingenious film-making,"Its most likely many viewers will think that filming a motion picture in reverse order makes it either ridiculous or over-the-top, but taking one look at Memento makes you realise that it actually works so well. I, for one, thought this cannot work in any shape or form. Upon viewing this movie, I believed I would be able to read through the plot and have everything (and anything) worked out in a flash, thus strengthening my notion that this 'back-to-front' concept is nonsense. How wrong was I? Memento is a film that makes you to go into the difficult and turbulent mind of a man trying his damnedest to seek revenge upon his wife's killer, but because of a condition which prevents him for remembering very recent events, finds it extremely difficult to do so; Guy Pearce is nothing short of brilliant as Lenoard, and certainly proves how versatile an actor he is. The perception of Memento is such, after only a few minutes of watching a particular scene, we are forced to reevaluate events witnessed. Its this strong aspect of the film that makes it so groundbreaking and legendary.The final scene in Memento will leave the viewer trying hard to think what situation was what and how a certain situation occurred. Personally, I'm not sure why a certain event happened, but then again that is the whole point. Recording a film in reverse would normally be a complete waste of time, but watching Memento certainly discourages that thought. Excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

While he is receiving help from his companions; Teddy (Pantoliano) and Natalie (Moss) he begins to believe that one of them is using his mental disability to manipulate and work against him. The film brings up questions in Leonard's personal mind; who can be trusted? Who cannot be? He dearly loves and misses his wife and time heals all wounds, but how is one supposed to heal if they can't feel time?""Memento"" sends the viewer on an emotional but dark journey through one man's adoration for a woman and its striking originality with a different plot setting than ever seen before make it without a doubt the greatest Indie Film of all time.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Who are we without memory?,"MEMENTO is a film about a brain-damaged man who cannot retain short-term memories and whose sense of self is limited to whatever longterm memories he'd formed before his injury. Most folk either love it or hate it or are indifferent to it (have I covered all the bases?) but only because they either love or hate or are indifferent ... to GIMMICKY movies. A friend once asked, ""How do you spell GIMMICK backwards? OTNEMEM. But they miss the point -- ""Memento"" is not a mere novelty nor an exercise in backwards narrative. This is an exploration of what it is to be human. What generates a mind, or how does a brain store a mind? How can a person function or an identity be formed if they cannot REMEMBER? In fact, if our brain is creating our mind then what happens to it when we fall into the oblivion of sleep? Perhaps each night we die. And each morning are recreated through the power of regenerative memory. Do concepts like ""soul"" even apply anymore, in this age of neuroscience where we've gained insights into the physiologic and microscopic energies of what makes up a ""thought""? The backwards-chronology narrative is a brilliant device to put the viewer into the protagonist's confusion. But like any mystery, ultimately we are asking ... ""what happens next? and what will the final answer be?"" Returning to my harangue about neuroscience, on one level *any* film or TV show is creating a reality within your mind. At least to the extent that you let yourself get immersed in it. For what is the difference between the true external world about us and some artificial world we tune into? For all that we hear and see is filtered through our senses. The true and the false are all just impressions that we experience, whatever is ""out there"" is separate from us and must be interpreted by us. This is why I think mysteries are such an intriguing genre for most of us. For life itself is a mystery. Our physiologic make-up is constantly probing the world about us and asking, asking, asking ""what's going on out there?"" Therefore it's only natural that a book or movie is going to hook us if we get caught up in the questions, ""what has happened here? Who dunnit? How will it turn out?"" Because subconsciously we are constantly being presented with riddles by our own senses. And in Leonard Shelby we have a character whose senses still create a world about him, except he doesn't possess the means to correctly interpret this reality.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Good but a bit repetitive,"I like the way it is filmed, quite new at the time.I like the concept but it is used too much, too much exploited. We see the same scenes again and again. It is a good thriller though, we have a different portrait of the character since we go backwards.The actors Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano do a great performance.Most of my friends really enjoyed the movie, so did I. We try to figure out the movie during the whole time, thanks to the concept. It makes us think and the story is not predictable, which is nice. Of course it can be confusing, and some people don't like these kind of movies. For me the ambiguity is what makes the film great.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
OH.MY.GOD. Clever but confusing!,"WOW!!Wel i have seen this film twice and the first time i watched it i thought 'very clever, but whet the hell is the truth?!'I watched it the second time VERY closely and after a while of thinking my and my friend thought we had worked it all out!But now i'm not sure, after reading some of the reviews for this i'm not sure if what I thought is really what happened, so i'm left thinking i need 2 c it again!When i first watched it i was intrigued from the word go! i couldnt stop watching it and my eyes were glued to the T.V. I couldnt wait to find out what happened next (or before depending on how u look at it!!) It is a very clever storyline and i enjoyed it but u definatly cant relax while watching it, its almost as thought u need a pad of paper to write down everything that happened! which is just what lenard needs to do with his condition, which i suppose is the whole point to the movie to make u feel like u r him!But i am still confused on to what actually happened and i would love to ask the writers, directers etc what is the truth and what is the audience meant to think!! Is there a right answer ?? I dont know, but i determind to work out the truth so i need watch it again!I think it was a brilliant film because of how it was edited and it has such an different storyline and it is very weird but interesting to watch a film 'backwards' from the truth!I'm sum what confused but it is good :)If someone knows wot the actual truth is please please write a comment on here for me 2 read so i can compare what other people think happened to what i think! thanx!Definatly worth seeing but buy the video dont rent it because you will definatly need to watch it more than once!

Memento - Challenges the notion of certainty,"I also have frantically started writing. I want to make note of the movie lest I forget it. The movie has ingrained a sense of condition in me as well. Leonard says the memory can change, the color of the car can change. True?? One of the puzzling pieces was the presence of a picture of Lenny bare chested and happy. It doesn't have a caption and he doesn't question why. He is conditioned you see, he is confident. Leonard believes he can lead the life as the police conducts investigation, taking notes, relying on facts. Well, the problem is what are facts? All in all, a puzzling movie and it drives the viewer also into the whirlwind of thinking. It challenges your notions of being, notions of certainty. It's not just a movie, it's more than that. ""Memento"" is an episode in your life which presses you hard.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Genius writing and directing, as to be expected from C. Nolan.","This movie is absolutely genius and although I love it, there are some negatives that I will quickly run through.First off, the cinematography and visuals are very boring and not at all memorable (apart from the photographs and the parts in black and white). I understand that this is partly because of the budget but also because it fits the narrative of the film really well, but this doesn't take away from the fact that they are uninspiring and frankly quite boring. The score and sound design were not particularily great either, I can't even seem to remember if there was any music at all. My third and final complaint is about the acting. While the actors sometimes shined and truly showed the pain and tragedy of memory loss, most often the performances were quite bland and not something I will remember about this film.The story, writing, and directing, however, was absolutely brilliant. In true Nolan fashion, he has created a wonderfully complex, interesting and truly unique story that is told in a very original and captivating way. It gives you something to think about, and the way it is all connected as well as how it gives us information and reveals, is extremely rewarding. Thank you, Cristopher Nolan, for this fantastic movie. I will not forget it for a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I'm not going to come down too hard on this, but this is one of those films which is so concerned with how cleverly it tricks the audience (6TH SENSE, USUAL SUSPECTS) that it inevitably will be a let down when all the plot mechanics are revealed as a giant ruse. Not to say that clever plotting is bad, but the final results have to be a revelation - or carry a deeper resonance (i.e. THE CONVERSATION, Godard's LA CHINOISE or Bunuel's masterpiece BELLE DE JOUR) not just a cheap cinematic trick. Check out Nolan's FOLLOWING for a better, less cynical, treatment of a similar theme.",,Anonymous,Mystery

It's a gimmick but who cares !?,"The story changes track every 5 minutes, and is a torture to watch. I can appreciate if short term continuity is not an issue to come up with novel plot that you want to cram into one movie as much as possible, the whole movie would turn into something like - this !But honestly, you have to ask yourself, are the characters in this movie worth that much attention ? To me, they weren't. There're nothing likable about any of the characters that spurred me to find out the ""truth"" about their situations. So overall, it became like who cares after about the first 20 minutes, and no, I don't want to see this movie three or four times just to understand what's going on.So the movie is just a novelty, and I doubt that it will be remembered as any kind of a ground breaking masterpiece even if the ratings are high. How many people can honestly say that they went to see this movie four or five times at a theater ? I bet none. If I paid $10, I expect to be entertained in the first viewing, not shown some self indulgence of the screen writer that I have to sift through the mess to understand what's going on.

Unforgettable,"In the realm of cinematic storytelling, there are few films as brilliantly bewildering as Christopher Nolan's Memento (2000). A spellbinding cocktail of inventive narrative structure, razor-sharp script, and outstanding performances, Memento is a dizzying journey into the mind of a man with a condition as tragic as it is fascinating.Nolan's directorial skill truly shines in his handling of the film's unique, non-linear structure. Told through two sequences - one in color and moving forward in time, the other in black and white and moving backwards - Memento challenges conventional storytelling, as it gradually unspools a narrative that is as engaging as it is puzzling.In the heart of this narrative labyrinth is Guy Pearce, delivering a performance of raw intensity and remarkable vulnerability as Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from short-term memory loss. Pearce's Leonard is a complex character, whose quest to avenge his wife's murder, despite his condition, forms the crux of the story. His painstakingly scribbled notes, Polaroid photos, and tattooed reminders are as heartbreaking as they are intriguing.The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, excel in their roles, adding layers of uncertainty and intrigue to the narrative. Moss, in particular, delivers a hauntingly mercurial performance that keeps you guessing about her character's motivations till the very end.The film's screenplay is another feather in its cap. Rich in suspense and spiced with dry wit, it weaves a web of ambiguity that keeps you glued to the screen, compelling you to piece together the jigsaw puzzle that is Leonard's memory. The dialogue is sharp and memorable, contributing to the film's overall atmospheric intensity.Memento (2000) is a testament to the art of cerebral cinema. It's a film that forces you to question, to reason, and to remember. As each piece of the puzzle falls into place, you find yourself drawn deeper into the story, appreciating the beauty of its construction and the mastery of its execution. It's not just a film; it's an experience, one that leaves you pondering long after the credits roll.In a cinematic landscape often saturated with predictable plots and safe storytelling, Memento stands out as a boldly inventive and deeply engrossing masterpiece, confirming Christopher Nolan's place among the great directors of our time. This film is, without a doubt, a must-watch for any cinephile.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Our memory is fragile and uncertain, yet powerful.","""Where am I?"" The first line blows away my mind each time I watch this movie. I had to watch Memento several times to understand what was going on in the movie. The story plot is intriguing and complicated. Yet, there is a pattern to it once you get a hold of it. I personally think that it adds immense depth to the movie. The greatest thing about this movie is that each time you watch it, you always get a different meaning out of it. Ever since I have seen this movie, I have shown it to my friends, and all of them enjoyed seeing this. I often find myself watching this movie when I am sad or caught up with stressful things that happened recently.The premise of this movie is that main character, otherwise seeming ordinary, has this ""condition"" where he cannot make a new memory since his accident. But the movie is about more than that. It's hard not to reflect ourselves while watching the character struggles to grasp the truth and to find who killed his wife. Memento is also about moving on from the painful past and letting things go, which are two of hardest tasks we ordinarily go through each day. The wall between our memory and imagination is, in fact, very thin. Director Nolan does an excellent job in portraying that small wall, and suggesting that we all have this power and will when it comes to our own memory. Our memory is fragile and uncertain, yet it still exists in a certain form. Memento shows how we have this beautiful ability to recall and recreate the past events. Such creative power defines us as human, and as a result of that, a sequence of events turn into a journey of ultimate truth. What he finds at the end of this movie might be something that we are all seeking for in life.When you are uncertain about your life, Memento is a great movie to watch and remind yourself about the complexity of your own memory and mind. The movie often leaves me with the high appreciation for memory. What our mind can do is quite remarkable. Although Nolan's Inception was bigger scale and had more actions in it, Memento remains to be my favorite Nolan movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The direction which was made by Christopher Nolan was simply amazing and he did an excellent job creating the feeling of unknown and terror to the audience. Regarding the interpretation of Guy Pearce who played as Leonard I have to admit that he was outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joe Pantoliano's who played as Teddy and Carrie-Anne Moss' who played as Natalie.

kudos to the 2/3rds of a script they call a movie,"It's a pretty cool idea. The last thing Leonard (Guy Pearce) remembers is someone killing his wife - since then he's had a head injury and has not been able to form new memories (a little like the start to Dark City). He takes pictures, makes notes, tattoos himself to try to order his life - but ultimately he does not know what he's doing. All that drives him is the desperate desire to track down the elusive 'John G.', who raped and murdered his wife. The film starts at the end of the story and works backwards (yes Raquel - backwards).  The only problem is, the scriptwriters seem to have suffered the same defect as their protagonist and forgot to wrap up all the questions actually posed at the start of their script.Just when you're thinking ""This is a really clever piece of film!   I have no idea what the real answer is."" the screen goes blank and the credits start to roll. The story doesn't go back to who actually killed his wife, and dodges with some philosophy about 'who are we if we don't have our memories' - which is nice, but not strong or original enough to justify the weak script. Plus, this philosophical point is not exactly proven by the sudden ending - it would have been just as strong with some answers to the plot.Like: Who is Teddy? Why is he really involved? Was Leonard actually caught up with the other characters before his wife died? Why does he have two, apparently contradictory, sets of memories? Just a couple of big holes that lower the quality of what had the potential to be a really brilliant film. Still kudos to the acting, directing, and the 2/3rds of the script that they call a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perfect!,"THE ART OF STORYTELLING! Yes many writers have issues with this, but not Christopher Nolan. The way the timeline is introduced gets you fully in the story and it makes you try to understand and guess what's going on. But every time you think you figured it out, you end up wrong. Each scene has a very powerfull way of making this intire story a puzzle that you feel the need to solve, but you wont suceed. And this is why the ending leeves you really speechless. The execution of the black and white scenes is really great. The story dives so much in everyday activity that you don't feel like you are watching a movie, you feel like its happening!

"A brilliant, unique, frustrating film.","Memento concerns Leonard Shelby, (a great performance by Guy Pearce) a man who suffers from short term memory loss. This leaves him unable to form new memories. Director Christopher Nolan puts us inside the mind of Leonard by giving the film a non-linear structure. This brilliant choice is at times a double edged sword. The non- linear time-line makes the viewer as clueless as Leonard Shelby. We don't know what has happened, when it happened, etc. I give Nolan chops for making that choice. I think it gives Memento its unique quality. On the other hand, the jumping back and forth does not allow Leonard Shelby to develop as a character. As I think more about this, it is actually brilliant. As a character who cannot form new memories, there is no reason for Leonard to have a character arc. The audience member is deprived of the same things as Leonard: closure, understanding, relief. This is definitely a film to see more than once. I bet that I will appreciate it more after viewing it another time. Meanwhile, watch, enjoy, and go along for the ride.

A modern-day masterpiece...,"Distinguished director Christopher Nolan comes out with his second directorial venture 'Memento', and this one surpasses every movie of its genre. The first fifteen minutes of the movie are completely undecipherable to the viewer, as it takes time for the audience to figure out the unique style of multiple narratives and reverse story-telling used by the director. After that, though, the movie grips your senses and takes you on a suspense-filled ride, and the suspense does not end until the credits start rolling down. The climax of the movie takes you off-guard and you keep on thinking about the movie for days. You have to watch it at least twice to understand each and every scene and dialogue. The movie has a great concept, and an excitingly taut storyline. Guy Pearce acts marvelously well, especially in scenes when he forgets his whereabouts and the identities of people he meets. Carrie-Anne Moss does full justice to her character, though her dialogue delivery is somewhat sloppy. Joe Pantoliano acts wonderfully, as usual. This one is my personal favorite in the genre of psychological thriller. The movie is refreshingly innovative, and I'm sure that viewers looking for an intelligent plot and a lightning-fast narrative. would revere this as the best piece of cinema of all time. The gritty direction also allows each and every character develop deeply, engrossing the viewers even more. Nolan is a master film-maker, and steers the movie through the mind of the protagonist, delivering a gripping thriller. He focuses more on the mentality of the characters, rather than the physical elements of the story. It somewhat reminds me of the short story 'The Sphinx without a Secret' by Oscar Wilde. All in all, this one is a must-watch, and your Hollywood viewing is incomplete without watching 'Memento'.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wholly original and surprisingly clever!,"Christopher Nolan has made some incredible films in his career, my two favourites being The Dark Knight and Inception. Now, Memento has joined that league.Memento follows Leonard, a man with short-term memory loss, who attempts to find his wife's killer.It's best going into Memento without knowing much about the plot and that's why I've refrained from revealing anything else in my brief summary. This is all I knew before watching and so I'm going to do the same with everyone else. Just knowing this brief plot summary made the experience of watching this film SO MUCH FUN! Seriously, this film took me completely by surprise.What Nolan was able to do with a story like Memento is incredibly clever. The whole narrative structure of this film is what most people will discuss. The film unravels the story in two ways. The colourized scenes play in reverse chronological order and the black and white scenes play the story in forward chronological order. The thing is, this could be done with many movies but it has the MOST purpose in Memento. Knowing that the protagonist suffers from short term memory loss, telling this story through this direction puts us in the shoes of Leonard as we're trying to figure out what happened before. To make a film like this isn't easy but Nolan's excellent screenplay keeps us engaged throughout. Nolan leaves us with many questions as the film plays backwards and it's these questions that keep us guessing and wanting to find out what happened before.If the story wasn't enough, the performances are also terrific. Guy Pearce is absolutely fantastic as Leonard. His way of delivering dialogues, especially the monologues, was excellent. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano also do a great job with their characters.Memento blew my mind. What Christopher Nolan achieved with this film in terms of filmmaking and storytelling is nothing short of astounding. This film just shows how you don't need a large budget to make a good film. It's definitely in my Top 2 of Nolan's movies and one that has to be seen by everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bold. To say the least,"It is very tempting, and it is also fair, to compare Memento with Nolan's Prestige. Both require multiple viewing to fully grasp and enjoy the scenes.18 years later, Memento still puzzles. And when you finally think that you've understood it, the truth makes you shiver. Yes, this movie will make you discuss and argue its meaning.While I believe it could have been better in terms of sequencing, when I look at the progress that Mr. Nolan has made following this film, I can only applaud at his bold approach to Memento as stepping stone.

originality lives in a director who challenges himself and succeeds,"How pleasing to find that mediocrity has not entirely destroyed the movie industry.  Let's be honest, the powers that be are aware that it is not necessary to make an intelligent, engaging film with an original plot to make money, in fact such a film could possibly loose money.  However; take a proven crowd pleaser, change enough details to appease copyright laws, cast a hunk and a honey, and frame it all with a few over-planed and well shot explosions...  ""Now dis a film to bust box-office r'cords, I gar'ntee...""Shining through the cookie-cutter productions offered up as entertainment this year is this gem of a film Memento.  Warning, if you enjoyed any of the following films DO NOT watch Memento:Mission: Impossible IIWhat Women WantAny Segal movieAny Die HardAny movie with the phrase ""I love this job"" in the trailerThat should eliminate most of those movie goers who have been conditioned to turn off their brains as they take their seats.  Because Memento will force the viewer to think, something which should NOT be a chore -- or am I the only one left who actually enjoys a plot which wraps itself around the mind and entices the viewer into constructing a mental maze of plot-lines and ever so cleverly brings us to safely through the twisting and winding walls. This is what story-telling is all about, to take us on a journey which our lives would not allow in reality and thereby escape that reality.I won't bother to rehash the plot events, for that read another contributor's comments.  Instead let's acknowledge the accomplishments of this film and its cast/crew.First, the movie begins with the end.  The hero avenges his wife and kills the bad guy.  This is where we would usually go home but with expert ability Nolan keeps us riveted to the screen until the movie's end.Second, the film has originality.  Enough Said.Third, each actor and actress does one hell of a job, my hats off to each and every one you, even the small parts, like the hotel clerk, are skillfully played.  I also must make mention of an impressive editing job, which allows the viewers to understand the perspective of our main character.  Ah, like real literature, I thank all those involved for this for I love literature, don't you?Fou... O who's counting anyway...? The writing is superb with poignant irony and insight into the most interesting side of the human condition -- the dark side.  Lines like;""I can't remember to forget you.""""What the last thing you do remember?""  Lenny replies, ""My wife, (pause) dying.""""Let's see what am I doing. Ah, I'm chasing this guy.""  The guy shoots at Lenny.  ""No, No he is chasing me.""I could go on and on but I'll wrap things up with the most important component of any film, and it seems the one nobody seems to address; the theme.  What is this film about?  Remember Lit 101?  The central theme defines the message of the story.  (So what the hell is the theme of die hard anyway?)  Memento, delves into the dark black side of the soul brining us face to face with the part of man which no one talks about; our delusions.  The lies we tell ourselves, although never out loud, which allow us to go on with the daily routine.  Leaving us to wonder, is it our own manipulation which silently drives our motives pulling us towards the eventual outcome like a strong undertow in waist deep water.  In the end this film is about the person you believe yourself to be and how that relates to the person others perceive you to be as defined by your actions. Think about that for a bit and then, as honestly as you can, visualize the differences between these two people.  Which one is really you?See Memento, this is a movie worth your precious time -- which is the true cost of all movies, money you can get more of, but your time here is truly limited -- remember that the next time you buy tickets to that over-hyped summer block-buster release of Die Lethal Mission Rocky Commando Part XIV.I give Memento a perfect 10 -- a score I have only given twice in a long career as a devout media-slave.  (I was programmed early so I rebel with words and I am hard to please).Thank you for your time ---   Tymelord",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I loved it not because it's in a reverse order but because it's an incredibly well made film,"I am not a fan of Nolan. And I think majority of his films are overrated. But that can't stop me from admiring the brilliance of Memento.So much has been written about it over the years, and I have nothing to add. I just want to talk about some reviewers which are calling this overrated.Type 1 are those who say youngsters love stylish films and that's why it's rately highly. It's kind of true but I didn't see anything cool or stylish in it. Just because it's in the reverse order, you can not say it is stylish. Do you love Pulp Fiction because it's stylish or because it's in a different structure. No. Similarly, I love memento not because it's different or cool but because it's an incredibly well made film.Type 2 are those calling it pretentious. It's wierd because this is the least pretentious Nolan film. His most pretentious will the The Prestige. The director doesn't call it intelligent, thought provoking or anything, it's the people. Also each and every scene makes some contribution to the story. Nothing is uselessly put there.Type 3 actually have a point. They are those calling it tiring. That's what I thought when I watched it three years ago. But after a second watch yesterday, I did not feel so. I just loved it even when it seems to be just a copy paste type film.

In its own realm,"Just for all of you who seem to have a problem with this movie, I need you to wake up and smell the coffee. I even saw some person complaining that some people see its better than The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and other instant classics. The problem with these people is that their mind is too closed to see the difference between these movies and a movie like Memento. Memento was shot on a low budget. This means actors like Pacino, etc etc... can not be cast easily. For Pearce, this is one of his best performances, hands down. Also, Pantoliano and Moss deliver a completely unique perspective on characters in any film. The best part about the two is the constant flip flopping of good and evil within them. You never truly get a grasp on whether one is trying to help or hurt Pearce on his ""mission."" And if its realism that people are complaining about (Lenny's condition mainly), go back and check your own favorites for realism, I'm sure not every part is factual and actually possible. With films in the independent genre of film, it is important to keep an open mind, and see what the director and writer(s) have to offer you. The reason they are independent in the first place is to stray from traditional Hollywood production values. Everything the directing, writing, and editing throw into this film has a purpose to the storyline. The performances may not be the best all around (except Pearce), but the story makes up for it. It truly keeps you on your toes and (so cliché in saying this) ""makes you think"" but on a different realm. Not only are you trying to piece together what is happening, but why the person in charge of a certain aspect did it that way. That's all I have to say... if you'd like to have an intelligent conversation about movies, I'm game. Drop me an e-mail. What I can't take is the ignorant bashing movies with low production values (like this one) just because they aren't loaded with millions of dollars worth of actors and special effects.

What's so great about THIS?,"I had heard all the raves. A reviewer said ""you'll want to watch this movie several times because it's so complex"". I really wanted to see it... Then I did. My wife gave up after less than half of it. I forced myself to see it through, because I hoped there was something to redeem it. Well, there wasn't. Complex? Nothing worthwile is revealed after the first half, actually, the thing is pretty much clear after the first scene - never mind the sordid detail revealed later, doen't add anything for me. An uninteresting, unbelievable, unappealing story acted out by characters one cannot get oneself to care for. So it's told backwards, big deal. I've seen similar things before, done much better.

"Unquestionably, the Best Film of 2001","It's unfortunate that MEMENTO is not receiving the attention of the Academy, or other awards for that matter. In twenty or so years, I believe this movie will finally be given its due rewards. The innovation of the storytelling and the directing of this movie will reshape the art of cinema as we know it. Some movies have employed non-linear structures to tell their stories. Although MEMENTO does indeed have a linear structure (merely inverted), the unique storytelling has never been so integral to the characters and plot of the movie as this one.Even though 2001 ended on a particularly strong note for movies, none surpassed this one in creativity and ambition. While the simpler movies collect all the awards this winter, MEMENTO will be the movie with the most impact upon the medium of filmmaking. I think that that speaks for itself.As far as the movie itself, even if it was played forward, it would be compelling. The fact that it doesn't stick to convention makes it riveting. Guy Pearce proves that he is a great actor, even though he doesn't appear to want stardom. Good for him. Good for us.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A complex thriller that is sometimes difficult to follow with continuous twists and turns.,"Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) lost his short-term memory after the attack and forgets all current events every 15 minutes, or so. He remembers his life prior to the incident, such as being an insurance claims investigator. Problem solved as Shelby tatoos the most vital info all over his body and leaves less permanent clues for himself on Post-its and Polarods of the usual suspects. He has learned to cope with his memory loss through dealing with a man named Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky) , a person he investigated professionally who also had short term memory issues. The action thereafter plays forwards as usual - with Leonard out to track down and take revenge on whoever raped and killed his wife. Shelby meets Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who may want to help him, but like his own memory , definitely can't be trusted. Some memories are best forgotten !.Twisty and and engaging thriller of a man searching for his wife's killer in Los Angeles. Ingeniously constructed flick is told backwards, from Guy Pearce's shooting of the killer to his puzzle-like construction of happenings and renders the audience as clueless as the impaired hero. There's grade A work from all concerned , especially main star, Guy Pearce. Clever use of flashbacks and black and white segments help define events in time. More than usually required mental exercice is more than worth the effort. This taut and ingenious thriller displays interest in how perception and memory shape identity , action and, of course, filmic storytelling. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan adapted the movie from short story: ¨Memento Mori¨ by brother Jonathan Nolan. Interpretations are pretty good, such as Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby who has short term memory loss resulting from an injury he sustained which was associated with the murder of his wife, along with Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Jorja Fox and Stephen Tobolowsky.It contains a mysterious and unusual score by David Julyan. As well as a colorful and adequate cinematography by Wally Pfister, Nolan's regular. The motion picture was decently written and directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, though inferior than other own films . Nolan was recognized by his peers with D. G. A. And P. G. A. Award nominations, as well as a W. G. A. Award for his works . Among its many honors, Nollan has received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Christopher Nolan is a prestigious author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia¨ , ¨The Prestige¨ , ¨Batman begins¨, ¨The Dark Knight¨ , ¨The Dark Knight Rises¨, ¨Dunkirk¨, ¨Tenet¨, among others . Rating : Above average 6.5/10 , it was throughly entertaining and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think . The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work , it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final .",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Memento review,Memento was a very good film about a man called Lenny with anterograde amnesia and in order to progress with his journey he takes photographs and write on them to remember. The storyline uses a technique called fabula and ceujet which is Russian and means the story line from the black and white to the colour crosses over after building from different points.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unique and intriguing story thanks to the original editing,"""Memento"" is a very interesting movie, that I suggest watching. The plot is centred around a man who is seeking vengeance for his dead wife but there's a problem: he is unable to form new memories and he forgets everything he discovers. The premise is original but the plot itself is not that complicated if considering in chronological order. However the aspect that makes ""Memento"" a must-watch is the editing and how the narration is constructed. Indeed the sequence in which the events are shown to the viewer creates a sense of intrigue and suspense but, most importantly, it brings the viewer to the same level of the protagonist because for all the duration you feel some sort of confusion and anxiety since you can't understand what is going on. You feel like you are missing something and you are not sure about anything and this is precisely how the protagonist feels due to his unfortunate condition. In addition there are some twists that land pretty well and add up to the merits of the movie. Finally, another great aspect is that you are left with ambiguity and it forces you to rethink to everything you thought up to that point and give your interpretation.In conclusion I think ""Memento"" is a very solid movie and a must-watch due to its peculiar editing and narration that makes it unique.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"complicated , but awesome movie","This is one the most complicated movies i have ever seen. I need it to watch ""memento"" 3 times to puzzle out all the small things in this movie. Main character of the movie is fashionably looking Leonard. He is chasing the guy that killed his wife. The only thing that really gets in his way of looking the murderer, is that he's having short term memory loss. It means that Leonard is forgetting everything he done in a last couple of hours. So he uses all sorts of pictures, notes and tattoos to help himself. Offcourse its much easier to manipulate that kind of guy... The main thing that makes this movie epic is that it has 2 story lines. One of them ( that is in black and white) is telling normally, but the another is telling backwards. It means that things u will see later in the movie have happened before the thing u saw in the beginning. Director Christopher Nolan have tried to do something like that in the movie ""The prestige"". So in the end of the movie two story lines are combining into one event that explains all the movie. In my opinion Memento is a great movie whit good acting and directing. If u are watching this movie first time it may get a little confusing at the beginning, but then u will figure it all out.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Buckle Up!!,"Alright, strap in for this wild ride of a movie analysis! We're diving into the world of a guy who wakes up with a bad case of amnesia and decides to turn his body into a walking, talking puzzle book. The premise is as intriguing as it is ridiculous, but hey, that's half the fun, right?Our protagonist, let's call him Leonard, starts off as your typical blank slate. He wakes up in a dingy motel room, no memory of who he is or how he got there. Classic amnesia setup, right? But here's the twist: instead of relying on traditional methods to piece together his past, Leonard decides to get creative. He starts tattooing cryptic clues all over his body, each one leading him closer to unraveling the mystery of his identity.Now, let's talk about the execution. The filmmakers really went all out with the visuals here. Leonard's tattoos are like a work of art, each one a masterpiece of intricate design and hidden meaning. From symbols to snippets of cryptic text, every inch of his body tells a story. And as Leonard follows the clues, we're treated to some truly mind-bending twists and turns that keep us guessing until the very end.But of course, no movie is without its flaws, and this one is no exception. For starters, the pacing can be a bit wonky at times. We'll be cruising along at a nice clip, following Leonard on his tattooed treasure hunt, and then suddenly, we hit a speed bump. The action slows to a crawl, and we're left twiddling our thumbs until something interesting happens again.Speaking of which, let's talk about the characters. While Leonard is a compelling enough protagonist, the supporting cast leaves something to be desired. We've got the obligatory love interest who's about as interesting as a soggy cardboard box, and the villain who's so one-dimensional he might as well be twirling his mustache and cackling maniacally. It's a shame, really, because with a bit more depth and development, these characters could have added some real emotional weight to the story.But despite its flaws, ""Inked"" is still a rollicking good time from start to finish. It's a high-concept thriller with a unique twist, and even if it doesn't always stick the landing, you can't help but admire the sheer audacity of it all. So grab some popcorn, settle in, and get ready to go on a wild ride with Leonard and his tattooed trail of breadcrumbs. Who knows? You might just uncover a mystery or two along the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Great film, but the DVD is hurting.","Enough reasonable (and a few truly dismal) reviews of Mememto already exist on the IMDB, so I can only add my vote that Memento is a film worth seeing. Whether or not it deserves to be called one the ""greatest films of all time"" is irrelevant, since that is a subjective honor anyway. It's high ranking is almost certainly due to a rapid flood of votes following its recent release (I mean, come on--Lord of the Rings ranks even higher than Casablanca, Star Wars and Citizen Kane!). The point is that, objectively speaking, Memento is a truly original, unique, and well made film, and there is some truly fascinating and thoughtful dialogue and narrative here. For that reason alone any film lover should check it out.I must add, however, that the DVD features an Independent Film Channel interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan that is one of the most visually irritating pieces I have ever seen. The interview randomly skips frames, causing subtle but silly jumps that remind me of the lousy black & white film the castaways on Gilligan's Island once made (""I'd walk out on that picture even on an airplane!""). Presumably, someone thought this was an artistic touch, but the end result is that it just looks dumb, and I had to *turn the video off on a DVD* in order to enjoy or get anything positive out of the interview!

A Masterpiece of Nonlinear Storytelling,"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is a film that defies conventional narrative structure and challenges the viewer to piece together a fragmented story. Released in 2000, this neo-noir psychological thriller has become a landmark in modern cinema, revered for its innovative storytelling and deep psychological themes.The film centers on Leonard (played by Guy Pearce), a man suffering from anterograde amnesia, a condition that prevents him from forming new memories. Leonard is on a quest to find his wife's killer, but his inability to remember recent events forces him to rely on an intricate system of notes, Polaroid photographs, and tattoos.What sets ""Memento"" apart is its ingenious nonlinear narrative structure. The film is divided into two alternating sequences: one in color, moving backward in time, and one in black and white, moving forward. This dual structure converges in the climax, revealing the truth behind Leonard's quest and the extent of his manipulation. The backward sequences mirror Leonard's disoriented state, placing the audience in his shoes, experiencing events with the same uncertainty and confusion.Guy Pearce delivers a compelling performance as Leonard. His portrayal of a man driven by vengeance yet crippled by his condition is both poignant and haunting. Pearce captures the desperation and vulnerability of a character caught in an endless cycle of grief and revenge. The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy, add layers of ambiguity and tension, each character's motives and alliances becoming clearer only as the film progresses.""Memento"" delves into themes of memory, identity, and the subjective nature of truth. Leonard's condition serves as a metaphor for the human tendency to reconstruct memories to fit personal narratives. The film raises philosophical questions about the reliability of memory and the lengths to which individuals will go to impose meaning on their experiences.Nolan's direction is masterful, using the film's structure to build suspense and engage the audience in a mental puzzle. The cinematography by Wally Pfister complements the narrative, with the stark contrast between the black-and-white and color sequences enhancing the disorientation and fragmented nature of the story. The editing is precise, ensuring that despite the nonlinear format, the plot remains coherent and gripping.""Memento"" is not just a film; it's an experience that demands active engagement from its viewers. It's a testament to Christopher Nolan's ingenuity and willingness to push the boundaries of conventional storytelling. With its complex narrative, strong performances, and thought-provoking themes, ""Memento"" is a cinematic tour de force that leaves a lasting impression. It's a film that merits multiple viewings, each revealing new layers and insights, and solidifying its place as a modern classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Revealing polaroid,"Unique now and then. Memento is an ever revealing polaroid. Be ready to stare at the screen for two immersing hours. This is one of the bests movies i have ever seen. Too intelligent. What could be just another noir with a surprising end became better: a unique film. First, because the end is the beginning and the beginning is the end. You are going to watch a movie invertedly, and it is not enough: the script complicates it much more, but through a way which exacts from you more than mere perception. The history works deeply with the strange amnesia that confuses the poor avenger (Guy Pearce). You and him just don't know who to trust. Initially,  you know the result of investigations (shown in the beginning), that is a scene where Guy Pearce appears killing a man, but... is he the true killer who he's looking for? you will have the answer at the end, or better, at the beginning.Memento already became an atemporal film, of course no one would try to edit a film like it is. And everything is carefully thought: the black & white scenes along the film allow we differ in memory the chronology; the mementos in Pearce's body are an inteligent method and characterize the protagonist; the polaroid is another great idea, just like the sensation we have watching the film, but in the film it appears losing focus, back to front.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Still A Classic After 11 Years,"Have you ever read a book in a non linear fashion or backwards for fun? What if a movie did it in the same way? Memento succeeds in this department and everything else.Even after 11 years, Memento is still a classic and holds up amazingly. Everything from the acting to the writing and precise filming makes this movie a masterpiece. The story told backwards device is not some sort of stupid scheme to be different. This movie NEEDS to be told backwards as it just wouldn't be as good if it was told in order. It fits in with the story and is no gimmick. Like Leonard, the protagonist, we have no idea what is going on and we slowly put the clues together. When you first watch the movie, it may start a bit slow, but once you see what the movie is aiming for, you'll fall in love with it.Memento is a film made for lovers of film! It has to be one of my favorite movies and Christopher Nolan never fails to impress. The Batman movies, Inception, Memento, and there will probably be more classics to come!

Nolans best?,"I feel almost guilty not giving this a 10. I did give it 10 when I worked as a movie journalist, but I guess I have become more prickier over age. First; Chris Nolan likes to give audience a challenge. I think he toppled it with Tenet, which just ent all out confusing. Memento on the other hand, is a different animal than anything he has done. Based on bro Jonathans script Momento Mori, we are told the story about Leonard who can remember the past, but can't remember what happened 1 minute ago, due to an injury. He is hunting the guy who raped and killed his wife. What's so special is that we are just as confused as Leonhard, because everything is played in reverse. But like a jigsaw, the pieces comes slowly together. This is pure mastery in film noir, and a big wink to Hitchcock. It demands the viewer to never, ever lose focus. And the payoff is awesome. This is one of the greatest endings I've seen, both tragic and you feel for just mutter:, ""Oh no, Leonard. Why? "".

Memento,"I reckon what makes this work from Christopher Nolan is the creation of a cerebral maelstrom that is every bit as confusingly frustrating for us watching as it is for his protagonist ""Leonard"" (Guy Pearce). Now we don't know how he has developed his menacing ninja skills, but we do know that he is trying to get to the bottom of his wife's murder, and that he has virtually no short-term memory to help him. As he pieces things together, he has to leave himself notes, or polaroids augmented with scribbles so he can recall just how far he has got and whom he can (or cannot) trust. The facts that he considers crucial are tattooed across his body as his search narrows - or does it? Along the way he meets some characters that he has some documentation on - some, not. Some he advises himself to trust, some not. Some of the photos depict dead bodies. On those fronts, we do have just a little more information on the cause tan he does - but it doesn't really help anyone deduce who did kill his wife? Maybe he did it himself? Its a maze of a film this. It's littered with twists and complications - but they are not annoying nor gratuitous. It's the ultimate in cinematic one step forward two steps back, and those muddled scenarios are only emphasised by ""Natalie"" (Carrie-Anne Moss) and an on-form Joe Pantoliano as ""Teddy"" - a man who features increasingly as his quest proceeds. I also did enjoy the ending. It avoids the concrete and the simplistic, and offers a fitting end to a potently effective effort from a Pearce at the top of his game.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"I agree with Maltin's verdict...""pretentious pap adds up to zero""...","I can scarcely believe the cult status this film seems to be getting here at the IMDb board. It's a totally enigmatic mess of a nightmare ""from end to beginning"", to coin a phrase based on the fact that the story is told backwards.If it made even one iota of sense to me, it was only toward the end when I had a clue as to what I suspected all along. But even then, nothing was clear and much of the story is unresolved so that you, the viewer, can fill in all the gaps depending on how brilliant and imaginative your mind is.The storytelling technique used here is a tricky one and altogether unsuccessful, in my opinion. As far as I'm concerned, short term memory would be a blessing if only to forget this one entirely. The payoff is zero, as Leonard Maltin has already suggested, and makes watching a film like this a total waste of time.GUY PEARCE does an okay job in the central role but his talent is totally wasted in a script that is as ungrounded in reality as his character is supposed to be. The film itself is all style and no substance, as pretentious and manipulating as any film can be that does not respect its audience.JOE PANTOLIANO and CARRIE-ANNE MOSS are competent but their characters are given coarse language full of expletives that should have been directed at the script they were forced to recite rather than inflicted upon a viewer patiently trying to follow a deliberately incomprehensible storyline. What hurts here, is there is no real solution to the puzzle, leaving the audience just as confused as the central character.What should have been a taut film noir turns out to be nothing more than a cheap shot at manipulation.Apparently, audiences these days are willing to swallow anything that seems unusual or offbeat in its appeal but--even so--there is no way I can account for the sort of comments I see here.

Intellectually Challenging,"Memento is a thought-provoking and potentially uncomfortable discovery into people through the main character Leonard.SideNote: The biggest complaint my friends had about the film is that they couldn't grasp the multitude of time shifts that occur in the movie. These are key to understanding the plot and the motivations and mind-set of Leonard. I didn't have any difficulty in this area, perhaps because I am described as observant and attentive. By the time the third shift happened, I was ready for it, and by the end of the movie, was relishing each shift. In case its not obvious, if you can't handle these shifts, you will not do well in understanding the movie. :End SideNoteLeonard can't fix his life. He asserts that he is seeking revenge for his wife's murder, but that is a smokescreen to him dealing with the person he's become, and the life he's living. He can't let go of the notion that his wife is just around the corner, 'just gone to the bathroom'. This haunts him. If he could just wake up one day knowing that his wife was gone, he could let go. He destroys evidence and kills people, but when he wakes up, his purpose in life will still be to find John G., as tatooed on his body.The uncomfortable truth uncovered through Leonard is the limitations, frailties, and desperation we all contain. Leonard's memory problem sets the backdrop, and his dealing with it is where you will start questioning things. While you can mentally seperate yourself from the character in the beginning because you don't share his particular ailment, in relection you will see the connections to all people.My reaction to Leonard's character changed with my changing perception of his motivations, as well as how conscious he was of his actions. Victim? Murderer? Confused and desperate? Its all there.I enjoyed Memento, and I intend to watch this movie again. There are many levels here, and I want to pick up on more. I saw the DVD on the small screen. Included is an interview with the director, which carried some interest. Unfortunately, the interviewer didn't seem to fully understand the movie, which weakened it somewhat.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the most original movies ever!,"For people who love to see movies with excellent scripts, psychologic effects and complicated plots, this movie is a must see one! The movie is about Lenny, who suffers from Anterograde Amnesia. This is a memory disease which enables the sufferer to make new memories. So, every day, he experience everything totally new. For example, every human being he has met after his disease onset is seen by him as a totally new person to meet. With this disease, he hunts the people who murdered his wife. The most brilliant thing about this movie is that it is played totally backwards: when the movie starts, you see the final scene. After that, the movie takes you back, scene by scene, to the beginning. In this way, the movie makes you experience it a bit like Lenny. You have to orientate everytime the movie goes one scene back, which makes this movie a bit complicated to follow. But, I can tell you, you will get rewarded with an absolute brilliant ending (or beginning!). Last but not least, Guy Pierce, who´s playing Lenny, gives away his best actors performance of his career so far. After having actors like de Niro and Pacino, we finally get a couple of new great actors in Hollywood.I would say that we have waited long for new great actors, but after Kevin Spacey and Russel Crowe, we´ve got two coming men: Edward Norton and the leading man of this movie: Guy Pierce. To movielovers I dare to say: don´t miss Memento and keep a close watch to Guy Pierce, he really is a coming man.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Passable Mystery - Momento,"There have been several Hollywood films about loss of memory and patients suffering from amnesia. It was actually an overworked device for several years in order to develop a character with some type of motivation we do not know about. For the most part, it worked in several films , and failed in a few. In this one, it succeeds because of the sequence of events we are shown in flashback. Ask anyone over 75, and they will all tell you the same thing; where did I put my keys? Where did I put my credit card? Where was that pen I had yesterday? Short-term memory loss is not a big deal for them (or me), but it is a big deal when there are capital crimes involved. That is what makes the film interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The remarkable narrative of 'Memento' is unfortunately framed around unremarkable characters.,"I've always had a problem with Christopher Nolan's films: I struggle to appreciate his characters. The incredible experiences in which Matthew McConaughey's Cooper ('Interstellar'), Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb ('Inception') and Guy Pearce's Leonard ('Memento') find themselves often accentuate their inability to appear convincing, real, and therefore human. I understand that when a protagonist is designed with no short-term memory (as 'Memento''s is), painting a vivid narrative portrait of him is no easy task; knowing this didn't improve my experience of the film, though. Although I didn't relate to or care for Leonard or indeed any of the other characters of 'Memento', I still gave it a favourable rating, and this is why: The narrative style employed by Nolan in this film truly is something to behold, and it is imposed in a manner which prevents it from being arbitrary or superficial. I'll say no more, as interpreting and coming to terms with the storytelling of 'Memento' was quite rewarding, and I implore you not to check any synopses prior to viewing the film. Whilst the technical aspects of the title are great (I'm chiefly thinking of the editing), I repeat my point about not really being able to invest in the content of Nolan's world. Perhaps I'm a philistine for preferring other ""lost identity"" titles such as Denis Villeneuve's 'Enemy' and Brad Anderson's 'The Machinist', but Nolan certainly makes 'Memento' a unique experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Memento,"One of Christopher Nolan's earlier works is a film that manages to amaze to this day. From the moment this film starts, the attention of the viewer will be grabbed through the imaginative storytelling of the director. Having the film take place backward is a brilliant technique that allows the viewer to become engaged in the mental illness of the main character. Predictability is constantly being subverted making each moment of the film feel surprising for each turn that is introduced to the plot. The main character is portrayed brilliantly by Guy Pearce who adds an emotional weight to the role, through the ever-present confusion his character goes through. It makes his journey invoke feelings of sympathy that make the audience desperately want his story to have a happy ending. In the average film, exposition may be used in an eye-rolling and unnecessary way. However, this film's use of exposition is completely justifiable to further illustrate the short-term memory of the protagonist. One aspect of the film that proved to be a minor negative was the lack of Nolan's visual stylized storytelling. It makes the film overall feel bland through its use of colors. Despite this though, this film is a brilliant thrill ride of a character study that, through its imaginative storytelling, attachable characters, and its originality, will have any viewer on the edge of their seat throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Memorable for its audacity,"Back in 2000, Christopher Nolan's name meant little to the average moviegoer. Long before blockbusters like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"", Nolan made his first big splash with an independent feature by the name of ""Memento"". Its inventive storytelling techniques breathed new life into the mystery genre, particularly the tired trope of a character suffering from amnesia.In Nolan's film, the protagonist, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), is sort of an amnesiac in reverse. Injured while preventing a robbery that left his wife dead, Leonard's short-term memory has been seriously impaired but his long-term memory is intact. Intent on revenge, he must deal with this considerable handicap while hunting down his wife's murderer.The twist on the oft-used amnesia theme is only the beginning of the film's inventiveness, though. The narrative structure audaciously puts the viewer in the shoes of the protagonist by alternating between scenes proceeding both backward and forward in time. The forward-progressing scenes are mostly expository in nature while the backward-progressing scenes are more plot-oriented. The trick is that as the plot unfolds (in reverse) we're no more aware of the preceding events than the protagonist. While somewhat disorienting at first (which is partly the point), before long piecing together the mystery becomes second nature.The cast is uniformly capable but I don't know if I'd necessarily single anyone out. Guy Pearce perhaps deserves the most credit for convincingly playing Leonard, which is easily the most challenging part in the picture.As far as the film's technical aspects go, I feel that they are also ably handled but not truly exceptional on their own. I find it unsurprising that the film's two Oscar nominations came for editing and original screenplay since these are the two elements most responsible for the film's uniqueness.Regardless of the film's perceived strengths, I can say for certain that ""Memento"" isn't for everyone. You definitely need to pay attention in order to make sense of the plot and, even then, you may find the narrative structure a little too disorienting. Add to that the fact that the ending is subject to interpretation and you have elements that some viewers are liable to regard in an unfavourable light. Thus, those who count on a linear narrative with a pat resolution should avoid this movie at all costs but for anyone else it ought to provide a unique viewing experience. Personally, I think that Nolan and company did a remarkable job of delivering on this ambitious concept, particularly given the low budget.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
...Whoa.,"Until the middle of this year, I have never even heard of the movie. I had never seen any TV Spots for it, and I haven't seen any trailers. Then, I find out about a movie called Memento... A movie that achieved its success simply through word of mouth. I had to see a movie that could do that.This movie progresses backward and forward at the same time. It actually takes a little time to understand what order these events are occurring, but after a while, we get the hang of it.The story kept me at the edge of my seat. It was original. What amazed me most was the fact that there were no consistency errors. It was a little fun piecing the story together.I had just seen Guy Pearce's performance in the Count of Monte Cristo, so I had no doubts about his acting, as he could act, and act well. Carrie-Anne Moss surprised me in this role. The other movie I saw her in was the Matrix, where she was this cool, calm, action hero. In Memento, she was the opposite... Almost trailer trash (if NOT trailer trash)! Then there was Joe Pantoliano, also in the Matrix, did have a deceitful role here (just like Cypher). He DID play with the main character's head a little bit.Christopher Nolan did very well writing this film. He made a story that will keep the viewer's interest 100%, he made a few plot twists, and in all, a great movie.If you have not seen Memento yet, you are missing out on an incredible movie. This movie will mess with your head. It sure messed with mine.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Prepare yourself for nothing like you've ever seen before,"Memento is an estranged trip through the experiences of a man incapable of retaining short term memories, & desperate to attain justice in the form of murder, though dependent on the honesty of those around him, & his own personal systematic chronicling of people, places & events, though photos, journal entries, tattoos & data collecting.The film's distinctive format is masterful, & moves in the only way possible, such that the audience will identify with the main character, who's disjointed perception of reality would make it impossible otherwise. Each scene, with the exception of the chronologically running black & white flashbacks, is followed by a scene containing preceding events, that essentially force the viewer to witness the course of events backwards. This technique keeps the audience as clueless to the truth of the elusively mysterious events, as the main character, Leonard Shelby, himself, thus giving the viewer a common bond with him.There is not one thing about this film I did not find excellent, to the point of perfection. The direction is meticulous, the acting is exemplary, the story is powerful, & the dialog is captivating. Not being a film maker, myself, the editing of this piece left me in awe, as to how someone could retain this vision in their mind throughout the production. It is obvious that the exercise of memory is something which the director, Chris Nolan (Batman Returns, Insomnia) has mastered.The performance from Guy Pearce, which I believe to be his best, manages to be paranoid, vulnerable, frigidly logical, uncomfortably emotional at times, & explosively dangerous, all at once, while he deals with the conspicuous characters around him. Joe Pantoliano successfully exudes sarcasm, empathy, humor, & untrustworthiness, as Lenny's bizarrely ongoing acquaintance, & Carrie-Ann Moss turns in a well fit performance as a woman involved in this disturbing scenario, with motives of her own, & who is searching for answers herself, in this entangled affair.The ending of this film is predictable in one way, as was intended, but wholly unpredictable in others, as the mystery unravels, & leaves the viewer questioning everything & everyone that they have been watching. This film is not for everyone, as it requires a great deal of concentration, abstract thinking, & possibly repeated viewings, to grasp every detail. I've seen it countless times, & even went to the extreme of watching the scenes in reverse order on my DVD player, in order to have even another take on the events.Each time I watch it, it has been rewarding. I rate it at a 9.5 out of 10",,Anonymous,Mystery
Intriguing but not mind-blowing.,"Memento is one of the most intriguing films I've seen in recent years, but it hardly deserves the current ranking it has in the top 250 films of all time.We begin the film with the murder of the man whom our hero believes raped and killed his wife, and move backwards throughout the entire plot. Each segment moves forward narratively, but comes after the scene which follows it. Meanwhile, in black and white, we follow a short space of time somewhere in past in which Leonard talks about his life as an insurance investigator before his wife's murder.The main character suffers from a brain injury, acquired at the time of his wife's murder, which has destroyed his short-term memory. He can't remember what has just happened to him, but remembers everything up to the ""incident"" - his name, his wife, his job. He deals with life in 15-minute snatches, as if he was continually waking up in a strange room. In one especially clever sequence, he is running through a trailer park with the thought, ""Okay, what am I doing? Ah. I'm chasing this guy. Wait. He's chasing me!"". He tattoos his body with important information relating to his pursuit of the man who killed his wife and destroyed his memory. He writes copious notes and takes Polaroids of people and writes crucial information about them on the back.All this is simply a device, a device which sometimes transcends the relatively standard plot which accompanies it, but not always. It does make the film worth watching. One of the hallmarks of a great director is being able to take a familiar story and tell it in a way that suprises us. It succeeds. The backwards storytelling puts us in the same predicament as Leonard; we don't know what just happened before this scene. We're confused, working off what he's written on pieces of paper and Polaroid photographs, with no knowledge of what has happened before (which will be displayed to us subsequently).Good system. The story, unfortunately, isn't entirely worthy of such a cool storytelling method, but it's still quite good, despite falling into some film noir cliches.The directing is crisp and the innovative editing style is enjoyable. The score is unnotable. The acting from all four of the major roles is outstanding. Leonard's character is incredibly sympathetic, which is crucial to such a film, although nobody is who we think they are by the time we've rewound through time far enough to understand what has come before (after).The DVD features an ability to watch the story in forward rather than reverse order, a perspective on the film I'm very much looking forward to experiencing.Totally worth watching, but don't expect the greatest film you've ever seen, despite the state of the votes at the moment (11th of all time). My rating: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not as good as I'd hoped.,"I'd heard a lot of great things about this film before going out to rent it.  But once I did, I must say I was not extremely thrilled with it as the rest of the world seems to be.It is a brilliant and creative idea of how to make a movie (backward revealing of pieces of the story with every new scene) but unless I missed something, I believe that this is all this film had to offer. The acting was good, the story was good, the movie was good... but I do not believe it should be rated the number 1 best indie film and number 10 best film of all time.  (As it is on IMDB while I write this review)I think it simply receives a lot of praise because it is a movie made in a way that no one has ever seen before.  A friend even told me that he thought it was an amazing movie--though he didn't quite totally understand it.  Maybe it is appealing because it is confusing and people view it as a ""smart"" film because they can't quite follow totally what it going on and they have to watch it over and over again.  Either way, I believe it has received much more acclaim than it deserves.  It has certainly won many awards for great editing and original screenplays, etc--which it has.  But a movie of the year--or of all time as some IMDB users are rating it--I totally disagree.Finally, It is indeed totally original in the way a story is told and presented, but it is certainly not the greatest movie of all time.  I was disappointed overall with this film.  I do not believe it is a must-see.I could film an entire movie by attaching a camera to a dogs back and having him film the action, then playing it on the big screen mirrored and upside-down during some scenes.  That would certainly be an original idea never seen by movie-goers before, but that doesn't mean it should be voted into a group with The Godfather or Citizen Kane.I'm not saying Memento is like watching an upside-down film from a dog's point of view... But I'm saying it's up there with the Godfather for reasons that it should NOT be.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If you watch the dvd there's an interview with the director and he points out that his goal was to put the viewer in Leonard's shoes.  A very big part of being in Leonard's shoes is being confused, lost, and not having control of what's going on.At the conclusion of the movie you'll feel confused and lost as well; don't take that personally, just consider how effectively the director did the job of making you feel that way.

Simple as that. You do not need to know more.The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put on the skin of Leonard Shelby, wonderfully played by Guy Pierce.

Memento: Psychological Brillance,"Who can honestly say how good their memory is? I know I can't, which is what I loved about Memento.Premise: A young, former insurance investigator is searching for the men who raped and murdered his wife.Here's the snag though. He has no short term memory and thus can't make new memories. People he's met and places he been vanish in a blink after 20 or so minutes. He has to constantly remind people of who he is, tells the same story of Sammy Jenkis over and over again, doesn't like to talk on the phone (he likes to look people in the face when he talks to them), takes photos and jots down who or what they are, has tattoo's all over his body as clues to finding his wife's rapist and killer. I could go on, but you get the point. It's a remarkably interesting structure to be taken through.Remember I said I couldn't rely on my memory a great deal and how that's what I loved about Memento? That's what made the film so incredible was the premise that memory is not 100% reliable. I loved being taken on a ride during this movie where I was confused as hell, lol. It was so much fun to have to force my brain to work harder at thinking about what was going on in this film. I left the theatre baffled as to what and how things had happened, but at the same time I couldn't stop thinking about the film.The acting in this film is beyond superb. The editing and photography is even better. The best part: the film starts at the end and works it way to a middle point. Noticed I didn't say beginning? That's because when the film comes to it's end you really don't know if it's the beginning since you don't know what Leonard (Guy Pierce) did before arriving at an isolated place. This film can really be seen as remniscent of the film style of Film Noir. It uses black and white scenes to give that off as well as the characters in the film constantly sucking Leonard further down into this world where he has no idea who and what to believe, including himself and the things he's done. Not only that but all the characters, yes even Leonard who is our protagonist, has a dark side of human nature to them. And that's what Film Noir is, exposing the dark side of human nature. The film has such a great Psychological deepness and by all means breaks the conventional art that goes into filmmaking. It really was a shame this film wasn't nominated for best picture.

It was fun to watch, but the story was not that worthy.The story is mediocre, which is about manipulation of a man that lost his short-term memory. Actually this seems a little unfair, because the writer decides when the protagonist starts forgetting things. So I won't say this movie has a good writing. Good writing shows consistency, which means the concept that makes up the movie should be taken through invariably. The Nolans did very well in The Prestige and Inception, but just no this one.However, the narration is innovative in a certain way: the confusion was just enough to drive me watching instead of forbidding me to undertand the plot.In recent years, they did Tenet which was not so well-received. That movie has a learning curve in its narration to make sure people following, but it tells a boring time-tralvel story, while the time-travel part is quite fancy. I think Tenet made the same mistake in this movie: they try to catch people's eyes with narration instead of solid plot.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You Have GOT to Be Kidding Me!,"I use these ratings all the time and have found them to be pretty much spot-on how I end up regarding different films...but THIS...I'm not wondering about the movie as so many have commented, I'm wondering about the other reviews. THAT'S what just doesn't add up.You know how Quentin Tarantino creates all those scenes that gen X think are awesome, but are just physics challenged? You know the world doesn't work like that, and there's no plot reason to violate the laws of physics, but Quentin thought it would be neat and his sheep think so too? This is the social relationship version of that kind of...being reality challenged.The temporal order in which events are presented is absolute nonsense. He doesn't remember things that way, so why would you present it that way just to...look cool? Is that what it's supposed to be? I'm a neurologist and can tell you that the portrayal of his condition is also quite reality challenged. Where are the police? It's the kind of totally self indulgent gen X rubbish where ""nothing exists outside my head"" and ""I dream that I am a..., so I am"" that drives Boomers insane. THAT'S the real plot reason, I think, for his condition. It allows for the a priori decision to do this from a POV view that is, well quite frankly, produced by managing to insert one's head far up one's rectum.The jokes aren't even funny. This movie scares me. It scares me that there is a whole population of people that can identify with what the screen writer and director were trying to do. A lot of the glowing reviews are the only one written by the author, so there could be a good deal of ""paid buzz"" generation going on here as well. Bottom line, if you actually liked Kill Bill or Blair Witch, you will probably find this awesome. If Pulp Fiction made you want to go out and take a cattle prod to the first gen X you could grab, then you'll hate this.Very sad that I will no longer be able to trust IMDb ratings any more, but when complete and utter rubbish gets an 8.5...

It's a very satisfying movie come the conclusion,"Phenomenal.What a movie! I had heard plenty about 'Memento' prior to watching in regards to how high-quality it supposedly was, though didn't actually (thankfully) get spoiled on anything that occurs onscreen - I did know of the note-taking, though for some reason thought it was via post-it notes rather than polaroids - no idea why!It's a very satisfying movie come the conclusion, concentration is very much the order of the day but the film does connect enough dots rather sharpish. I thoroughly appreciated the ending itself, Guy Pearce delivers the final moments supremely. Speaking of he, I've not seen much of him before but this is a terrific lead performance!Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss are excellent in their respective roles too, even Stephen Tobolowsky and Harriet Sansom Harris manage to leave an imprint on my mind despite much less screen time; first time I've seen Harris in anything properly since I was in my teens a decade or so ago, always remember her great showing in 'Desperate Housewives' (interestingly the first television show I ever got into, it's quality, don't @ me 😎).Anyway, back on track... Christopher Nolan - some director, eh?! I'd put this right in my top three ranking of his work, behind 'Inception' and 'Interstellar'. Such a fulfilling movie! I hope for similar-ish with his other pictures in 'Insomnia' and 'The Prestige', two flicks I know absolutely zilch about. I don't anticipate that Mr. Nolan will let me down at this point.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It shows the struggle of a guy named ""Leonard"" who has a condition in which he is unable to make new memories, but he remembers the memories up until the time his wife is killed. I'm still confused about what did I just witness?This movie must be a nightmare for the editor. I believe the editor should've been the first credit in the movie. Editing peculiar movie like this must've fried his brain good (hope he got paid good).Christopher Nolan never disappoints with his movies and this one ain't nothing new. Very intriguing story, always makes you question what's happening throughout the movie. Not a single boring scene. We need more type of movies like this which leaves you shocked at the end.It puts you in the shoes of the person who feels short term memory loss and cannot recall the thing even from 10 minutes ago. Definitely worth a watch. I would say this movie need at least 2-3 watches to fully mature in your mind because this is not an ordinary movie. I have personally never seen anything like this.

"The screenplay is brilliant, and the acting is incredible.","I rented Memento not knowing what to expect.  After viewing it, I was speechless.  The plot of the movie is impossible to describe in a few sentences - it is so much more than simply a murder mystery.  It is a movie unlike any I have ever seen; for instance, chronologically Memento begins at the end, and ends in the middle, while during the movie the plot jumps back and forth between the present and the past.  The central character of the movie, Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce), is in every scene.  It is Pearce's depiction of a man uncapable of forming new memories ever since his wife's death that carries the whole movie.  By the end, we see that a lack of memory is perhaps the worst handicap anyone can have.  I highly recommend this movie to all viewers, but be warned - in order to truly appreciate this movie you have to be paying attention to every detail.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Watch with friends, then go down the pub to discuss it","How do I say how great this film is without giving away too much? Gladiator may be the best film out this year for sheer enjoyment, but this is the best film to watch with friends. There is so much to think about in this film that you need a few people to watch it with you so that you can all swap ideas afterwards.Basically, Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man who suffered brain damage in an incident. This has left him with the inability to create new memories so everything he experiences will be forgotten within minutes unless he records it somehow. This ranges from photographs with hand-written notes on them through to tattoos on his body.The style of the movie is very unusual. The story starts at the beginning and the end, and works its way to the middle from both sides. Now this may sound stupid, but trust me, it works. The first few minutes are confusing, but once you get the idea of what is happening, then you can settle back and enjoy.The only film I can think of that compares to this is The Usual Suspects, but only in the way that you never know if you are being told the truth or not. This one will keep you guessing all the way through and still leave plenty to argue about with your friends.I don't know about other countries, but this film appears to have got zero publicity in the UK. I knew nothing about it until a friend from work phoned me this afternoon asking if I wanted to see it. I'm glad he did as I hate to think I might have missed out on this absolute gem of a film.You should definitely watch this film, but like I say in the subject line, go with some friends.

He is one of the directors that I'd like to see more of.  I don't see how someone can have such a negative response on a movie that is clearly a terrific movie.  It was confusing, but still entertaining.  It kept you on the edge of your seat wondering why guy pearce was where he was, doing what he was doing.  It's the kind of film I could watch over and over again, and pick up something else every time I watch it.  The movie made it's own genre of thriller which makes it a classic.

Muddled,"A man is determined to avenge the murder of his wife, but his mission is complicated by the fact that he suffers from short-term memory loss. The film is unique in that it tells the story backwards, starting at the end and moving to the beginning scene by scene. The purpose of this narrative device is to let the viewer experience what the protagonist is going through. It may have seemed like a clever idea on paper, but it makes for a muddled and unsatisfying film. The plot is preposterous and there are too many loose ends.

Definitely masterpiece,"Memento directed by Christopher Nolan is definitely one of the best suspense film in my view. This is true not only because of the special editing technique, but due to the perfect combination between the editing technique and the plot of the film. The editing technique could be divided into two timeline. One of timeline goes in the direction of time, and the other timeline is the exact opposite, from the end of the story to the beginning. At last, the two timeline meets in the resolution of the film. Some people claim that Memento used this edit technique just to impress the public, and isn't really a fine suspense film. However, if one could keep track of the way the story is told, he/she can see that the structure of the story is actually very rigor and well developed.The plot of the story itself isn't such an impressive story, because it doesn't have any twist, all plans and truth of the events in the story are told at the beginning. However, Nolan used editing and placed the twist of the story in the second timeline of the story, which makes the twist of the story placed at the end of the film. For other films, twists are always at the end of the story, so audience would wonder ""what would happen after due to the action of the characters before?"". Instead, in Memento, audience should wonder ""what happened before in the film that made the characters do this?"". Audience watching Memento would be wondering questions like ""who's this character"" ""what's their relationship"" ""why does he want to kill him"" ""what on earth is going on"", and as film moves on, audience will see the motivation of the characters and the reason for them to do a thing. At the end of the film, audience would have the feeling of ""Oh, so that's why xxx did this"" and the plot of the story gradually shows what it really is, which is exactly what's so brilliant about Nolan. Everything is explained at the start of the story. The special effect of the combination of editing and plot plays a significant role in the success of Memento.Moreover, this special sequence of arranging story scenes also fit the condition of the main character. The protagonist of the story of Memento has a problem to store memories. He can only remember the things that happened before he's hit heavily by a man on the back of his head (which is when he got his condition) and things that happened about 15minutes ago. Or in another word, his memory is refreshed every 15 seconds. To him, life is like many pieces of memory, and is very hard to put together. This way of storing memories connects with the way audience felt about the film. Both the audience and the protagonist is always wondering what's going on and having only few pieces of information. Therefore, the audience can somehow feel the way the pro is feeling.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nolan's Magnum Opus,"This is probably one of the most subtly effective cathartic movies ever made. Memento manages to completely swallow you into its protagonist's world whilst just straight up impressing you with how intelligently crafted it is. Memento throws you in straight away, giving you little information that you gradually get spoon fed through the 'hairpin structure' of the film (how Christopher Nolan describes the structure of this film). This approach just forces you to pay absolute attention which you aren't regressive about because there's nothing you want more than to just know.
This film is definitely more than a well executed high concept piece, its genuinely a brilliant mystery thriller riddled with suspense, that sends you down a path that you just can't turn back from. I feel weary writing this review because all I went into this film knowing was that it had some sort of brilliant twist and I feel like the less you know about Memento the better so do yourself a pleasure and avoid spoilers or in fact any information if you fancy giving this a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

That's why this little film that received almost no marketing stayed in theaters for months and was in the top 10 money makers for several weeks. The main character has short term memory loss, can remember things before the accident, but everything after, he can only remember for a few minutes. He tries everything he can to remember things, from taking Polaroid pictures of where his apartment is to tattooing messages to himself on his body. The story was a very intriguing one all by itself, but the way the film was presented was even better. I don't think I have ever seen a movie do such a good job of making the audience feel like they couldn't remember anything either.

No Time...,"Director Christopher Nolan's MEMENTO is one of the best neo-noir films ever made.

Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man in search of his wife's killer. The problem is, Leonard has complete short-term memory loss, only remembering events for a few minutes, before losing them forever.Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) are apparently helping Leonard with his quest for justice. However, nothing in this movie is quite as it appears to be, and every word in every scene is important.Mr. Nolan has really created a mind-bender here, and the use of two aspects of the film weaving their way through each other, while running in opposite directions, is ingenious. There's a definite sense of paranoia throughout, as well as a building dread at what might be in store at the end (beginning?).A true classic worth several repeat viewings...",,Anonymous,Mystery

It's nothing more and nothing less. Yes, the plot and the way it's told (backwards) is clever, but hey, so was 'the butler did it' once. Face it: ALL plots in thrillers are clever in some way or another. That's no reason to call the movie brilliant. It takes more than that. A brilliant movie is a movie that tells you something about the world, about people, about yourself. This movie just tells you a nice story. It's well-made, well-acted, and well-thought-out. Although some stuff is really too hard to believe. But it doesn't matter as long as you're just expecting a solid ride, not a life-changing experience. By the way, there have been many movies and books which are told backwards. This movie is nothing new in this respect.OT: For example, read the book 'Time's Arrow' by Martin Amis.

The thing about the film is that when you finish it, you will want to watch it again to put the pieces of the puzzle together, but once you do that is pretty much it. A second viewing of the film does not enrich the experience, the characters don't get better like in better Nolan films like The Dark Knight and really all you do is understand the plot better.

One of the best of all time,"One of my favorite movies, I watched it several times and enjoyed it every time. I like that the film requires a certain attention and concentration from the viewer, but again the film is not so complicated that one cannot follow and connect the plot. Since the film goes backwards, we get a slightly different perspective because we wonder how it ends, but we don't know how we got to the end. Given that it does not belong to the category of high-budget films, the emphasis is on the story and acting, which is something most important in films, at least for me. As a rule, these are my favorite movies. In principle, we only have three roles in the film and each one is at a high level and they complement each other. I believe most of you have seen this movie (at least once), but I don't want to give away anything about the plot anyway. Here I see a great synergy between the director, actors and screenwriters (Nolan and his brother), but also the editing of the film precisely because of the unusual format of telling the story. Although most things are explained and related, I like how a small part is left up to the viewer's interpretation, just the right amount.

Are we helpless before the tyranny of circumstance?,"Lenard Shelby is in a hopeless fight against the unalterable past: time runs backwards and counts down, and every moment we see is a moment in the past that Lenard can never escape, the consequences already known to us and the cost already paid, but each scene rises up from the ashes of the previous one, revealing our own flawed perception of what has really happened.Memento is a murder mystery where the whodunit question is answered in the first scene. But did the victim deserve it? Or did someone trick Lenard Shelby into killing the wrong man? And if so, why?Because of his 'condition,' Lenard knows he has to watch out for people who want to take advantage of him. Condition is a euphemism for severe brain damage, which left him unable to make new memories. The last thing he does remember is his wife dying in front of him. When he closes his eyes, he sees her dying, and since he can't make new memories, the horror of her death and the pain of his loss is always there, fresh and never fading.Memento at its heart is a quest for freedom from the prison of personal limitation. Lenard desperately wants to regain control over his reality. He follows clues, writes notes, takes photos, hypothesizes solutions. These things, however, can never compensate for the terrible loss of both the continuity of the present and the connectedness of time itself; he knows neither what year it is now nor how long ago his wife died. But he believes if he can somehow avenge his wife, even with his tremendous limitations, he will regain some part of the self-worth that he lost when his brain became damaged.Profound, unique, and beautiful in its achievement -- Memento isn't a gimmick; it's an elusive puzzle with a clear answer.

Early Lessons in Controlled Perception from the Nolan Brothers,"After stretching his legs in the arthouse scene with 1998's Following, Christopher Nolan gets a little more mainstream in this swervy, concept-rich tale of amnestic vengeance. Guy Pearce plays a man with short-term memory loss, constantly overwriting the VHS tape of his near-past as he tracks a nameless, faceless killer. He employs some blunt methods for retaining important information - hand-written notes and Polaroids for loose facts, tattoos for solid truths - but when you're operating on such a short timer (the dreaded memory wipe seems to occur every ten minutes), I suppose you've got to take what you can get, even if it makes you a target for manipulation.The whole fable unfolds in a sort of stuttered reverse, immediately revealing the plot's ending before slowly walking back to its beginning, which leaves the viewer feeling almost as handicapped as Pearce. It's an early example of Nolan's experimental nature, his interest in tinkering with traditional storytelling formats to bend viewers' perceptions, and it works just as well here as we might expect from his later works. At each intersection, we're forced to second-guess everything we thought we knew, which continually changes the context of that first ten minute chunk. Our trust is earned, betrayed, diverted and rehabilitated.Sure, sometimes it feels like this is more about the experiment than the plot (for all its ambition, the actual story is very small-scale), but conceptual risks carry a lot of weight with me and Memento is a verifiable playground for such things. It's as effective a ""walk a mile in my shoes"" experience as any I've seen on the big screen, and a large part of that can be credited to the Nolan brothers' peculiar knack for outside-the-box cinematic creativity.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

They might as well watch another movie based on an American tragedy with lovers in the mix of things (you know what movies I'm talkin about).  Memento, on the other hand, is like no movie you have ever seen before.  It's one of the greatest (perhaps even thee greatest) thiller ever put together.

My mind HURTS,"Watch this movie (and shutter island/fight club)Personal/Plot: (What film was about/enjoyability?)
I truly enjoyed this film and even had some anger towards one of the characters at the end. This film draws you in from the very beginning, and then you get confused as flashbacks occur and more details come to you. Nolan's use of flashbacks (in black and white) vs present shots (in color) allows the audience to feel as Leonard does. Which can be summed up as confused, and even more confused (as he actually ran at someone shooting at him thinking he was chasing them). 2.5/2Aesthetic/Cinematography: (How film was made?)
Nolan doesn't miss, but fs not better than Interstellar. Still solid 2/2Spiritual/Ending: (Beauty of film/inspire towards the transcendent) Instead of spoiling, the idea of coping with grief is expressed. The idea of a lack of support for those with mental handicaps. Even the idea of manipulating someone who hurt you is expressed. All of these ideas arise and can be interpreted in a variety of ways once the fim concludes and you're left lost for words. 1.5/2Acting: (Can I do it better?) 0.5/1 Nothing stood out to me.

What A Rush...,"When I first heard about this film, I was curious. Playing with time, while not a completely original concept, could make a film feel gimmicky and artsy. I am happy to say that this is not the case with ""Memento"", a clever and twisted thriller that makes the audience sympathize with the lead character by giving them, in essence, the same lack of info that the protagonist has. By telling the story in the fashion that the writer and director have chosen, if you don't pay keen attention to every line and every character, the film will definitely lose it's impact. The final twist is a whopper that I never saw coming and yet I didn't feel at all cheated.

Probably the most overrated movie of recent memory.,"First of all, this is not a horrible movie.  It does keep you mildly interested.  But it has several, fatal flaws.One reviewer mentioned that the film was too clever by half.  I totally concur.  The film went out of its way to create something unique, and in the process lost the entire narrative structure.  So when it ends, you barely even know if it happened.  In fact, you don't know that it happened.  If Leonard was delusional about Sammy, then perhaps he was delusional about all the characters in the movie.  The fact is, you will never know.The problem is, this doesn't make for a good film.  Good films are those where the narrative art is enhanced by the photography.  By this measure, the movie fails, as the photography does almost nothing to tell the story, and Guy Pearce is as milquetoast a leading man as there is.  The fact is, the film is about trying to put you in his shoes, to show you what Leonard must have felt like living with no memory, but you end up feeling nothing at all because he is such a bland character actor.I would compare this film in some ways to Se7en--except that Se7en does a much better job telling the story (even if the ending wasn't at all surprising).  The major difference is that you care about what happens to the characters in Se7en.  There is no empathy with Leonard, partly because the film never gives you the chance because it's too busy being clever.Perhaps people will rate it highly, but it is definitely not a Citizen Kane or Casablanca, a movie where you can take it out and watch it over and over again.  It's far too dismal for that.  It's more a movie like Resevoir Dogs, where you like the idea (and perhaps the execution), but the way the story is put together keeps it from being a classic.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A very original plot and screenplay, even groundbreaking","This film is for those who like mysteries, or are in school to learn how to make a good film script, or who are at least of average intelligence.  The lower life forms, such as NASCAR/Wrestling fans and bowlers need not apply --- go see The Flintstones, Part 8 in 3D.I have never had the pleasure of watching a film which progressed completely backwards in time & frame sequence.  You could literally watch this film from the last scene to the first and it would make sense, maybe even more sense, except of course that you would watch the true ending first and spoil it for yourself.  What's really cool is that there's a slight narrative story within the story that is moving forward --- it's really ingenious.This is a classic in the making; completely original in all aspects.  This is something that I'm sure Hitchcock would have liked to do if he or anybody had thought of it before.  There are plot holes, but incredibly, you don't notice them badly and they don't have to be resolved to enjoy the film.  The script even mentions at least one, and you have to stop and think for a moment to find the others --- if Leonard can make no new memories, what good is a revenge killing if he won't remember the satisfaction of it, or even if he has even exacted revenge already --- in fact, what good is doing anything other than just existing and waiting for a cure, but then you wouldn't have a movie, eh?  These questions were posed by the story which inspired the film and of course were omitted for sake of argument and they do not spoil the continuity one bit.The introduction of certain elements of the plot are not mentioned and left up to the viewer to decipher, and another big hole --- if Leonard can't remember anything, how does he remember how to drive a car, how does he even know that the Polaroids he takes are in his pocket, and how does he know about anything he has done more than 30 minutes ago which are essential to functioning in life in general?  There are also elements of certain characters that fail to resolve themselves, but you can live with them as well --- what you get in return is a heckuva neo-Noir flick that deserves your attention.If you will suspend belief as you should when you see any film and manage to hold on for the first 30 minutes until the plot thickens, you will get an incredible payoff.  In fact, this will be a film that you will want to watch again the very moment it ends to take stock of what just happened and the time frames and appreciate the mastery of the plot & screenplay fully and even discuss what you just saw with someone, as you may have a time figuring out what you just saw!  The filmmakers left a little of the story in your hands to allow you to decide what you just saw, but not so much (like ""K-PAX"") that you feel like you were left with an incomplete storyline.Thumbs straight up on this one, and you MUST get the DVD version to really appreciate this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Review of Memento,"This is a movie that I originally saw in college. I didn't know who Christopher Nolan was. I had seen Insomnia first when I was seeing out movies with Al Pacino as well as Batman Begins, The Prestige and The Dark Knight. It would have been around that time that I saw this movie. This blew me away after that first viewing if I'm honest. It had been over a decade since that first watch, so was curious as to how this would hold up.Something else I should add in before moving on was that this movie appeared on the Internet Movie Database Top 100 poster that my wife, Jaime, got me. It was on our list to see (so thank you Duncan).Since I've not seen Following yet, this feels like Nolan taking his hand at telling a story in a non-linear way. We get a great performance here from Guy Pearce as Leonard. What makes this interesting is that we see something, then the movie will go back into the past to show us the event that leads to that. It continues to do this until the whole story is told. Intercut is Leonard talking on the phone to someone. I will also point out that he is unable to make new short-term memories. He tattoos himself with notes and must continually refresh. He also relies on his ability to read people. That makes him avoid taking phone calls.All that makes for an interesting neo-noir story here. With the information we get in the beginning, we don't trust Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who Leonard thinks is the guy he's looking for. Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) helps him with this information, but the more we go on, the more things aren't as they seem. In the vein of film noir, we have Leonard as our 'detective' looking into what happened to his wife. He is a bit of a victim with his memory issue, but by the end he is a complicated character like most everyone else. Natalie ends up as our femme fatale and Teddy is interesting when we learn more about him.Upon this rewatch, it didn't hold the impact for me as much. It wasn't until just past the mid-way point that I was sucked in. I'll be honest, I only remembered who was in this movie and the concept. I would say there was material that could be trimmed, but looking back, these things need to get set up for the payoff. This has a good mystery. The acting is solid across the board. It can get a bit confusing and the only way I think I could prove there are no cheats with timeline is a linear cut. I have heard that is out there. I'm not sure it has the same pull though with how this story is told. The beginning and set-up is more important than where we end up. We need those motivations.This is good movie though and I'm glad that I rewatched it for sure.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.","Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating. But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie. This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards. The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby: a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered; now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap. Simple as that. You don't need to know anymore.The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance. This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days. Four Stars!This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.

When you watch this movie, you might end up having to do the same thing in order to keep track of what's going on.

Not very fulfilling,"Memento was the film that really got Christopher Nolan noticed and it is my personal favorite of his films, just because it is so unique. It uses a non-linear structure that Nolan has used in a lot of his films and gives it a very dark, tense theme. The structure is reverse-chronological and, therefore, means that the film starts at the end of the story and end at the beginning. But what makes this particular use of it so spectacular is that, for the whole film, you know that the film is going to end with the beginning but, as you reach it, Nolan pulls all certainty away from you; leaving you craving for more. This film is not very fulfilling due to the structure - the viewer still wants to see more - and that's what makes it such a memorable film. Nolan's directing skills aren't the only great feature of this film. His script is also stunning. It involves the main character, Guy Pearse, talking to himself but, almost, addressing us; allowing us into his head. Guy Pearse's acting is superb, portraying all the emotions that his character would have. The rest of the (rather small) cast are also great and help to give the viewer the uncertainty that makes this film so great.Christopher Nolan took on a tricky idea to make a good film of and executed it in a very clever way. A film that should be seen by any Nolan fan or wannabe-director. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Hitchcock wannabe,"Strange movie with some twists - ala Hitchcock.  But it was a bit  wierd. Story would go forwards and backwards.  The ""mementos"" were just not that realistic to be believed.  It seemed the guy lost his short term memory for most things but not where he put his little memos.  He always managed to find those - even the new ones.  An amazing feat for someone with zero short term memory.  And throughout the film he would constantly make notes and read the notes - but he never seemed to be bothered with the thousands of tatoos he had.  He belonged in a lunatic asylum.  I never would have guessed a film about some chowderhead writing and reading sticky notes would've been so popular.  Should've been called the sticky note boy. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the most thought provoking movies of all time,"I came into this movie, expecting a pretty normal thriller, I had heard the premise, I knew that he tattooed words on his body to remember things about his wife's murder. And that idea alone is fascinating, but I could never have imagined how deep is the movie goes into the psychosis of the main character and the surrounding world, from the first couple minutes of the movie, we are presented a main suspect, in our mind. It can't be anyone else, but him, and within the first couple minutes of the movie he is killed by the main character. This threw me off big time when I first started watching the movie, I thought it was weird. They would kill off the most integral character to the plot in the beginning of the movie. That being said this movie slowly unravels itself, and scene after scene goes further back in time, and slowly opens up many more suspects, maybe even the main character himself killed his wife, the layers of this movie blow my mind. So much deception, false promises, lying, ulterior motives, people pretending to be people they aren't.and this movie, and it's confusing antics never stop at any point in this movie, for some, it is overwhelming, and frankly it is, but another thing about this movie is it reward you for paying attention, if you pay attention there will be hundreds of references to earlier sequences in the movie, personally I could go on forever about the theories of this movie, because this movie ends with no definitive answer or conclusion. Personally, my interpretation of the ending is that he was a crazy person who drove his wife away and because of this he formed this story in his mind that someone killed his wife, and he dedicated his entire life to solving this mystery that he put in his head, I could go on forever by this movie, because simply thinking about this movie after seeing it is tripping me out, there are well over 30 theories that I have about the ending of this movie and ultimately the vagueness and mystery makes this movie what it is......",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very good...,"This is actually my favorite movie of all time.

The beginning is John G's murder being played backward (and this doesn't look funny like when u rewind something on a VCR, it looks really cool) and then you see the main character narrating in black and white (which is during a different time).  Of course, you have to watch the movie a few times, and it is not flawed in any way!  Some say that his memory loss should've made him forget he had memory loss, but then they don't bother to think about it.

Incredible,I give this movie 10 out of 10. wow!! I watched it on DVD and i could never take my eyes off the TV. The story is told in the reverse and each scene in the movie is so well scripted.I just imagined what life is without memory. It is pathetic.Think of a situation where you do not know who your friends are and you do not know if the person you speak to is a friend or a foe. Its a chilling feeling and i would term the guy with no memory as ''the loneliest person on this earth'' Coming to the story;Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man with no short-term memory and the last thing he remembers is his wife's murder. He is on a death hunt but he has no memory of the murderer or any details by which he could get to him. He tattoes himself with mementos of his daily life. Imagine that!! The best part of the story is that it is told in the reverse. You live with the character who himself does not know what the story is. Hats off to Christopher Nolan!! He takes you on a LSD trip.

A Well Executed Concept Film - Scrub Gently,"Memento strikes me as the kind of film that could have been inspired by a writing challenge: What kind of story could be told when the chronological order of each scene is reversed? How could you build tension, and what setting and plot makes sense to be told this way?The way it is so often described, it comes across as exactly this kind of concept film, but it is so much more. The execution is spectacular. Guy Pearce's performance is nuanced, precise, and compelling. The way the various components of the plot are woven together scene by scene really draws you in and makes you excited to see where it will go next.The film has very few weaknesses, but I do feel it does ask the audience to be generous with its suspension of disbelief. Sticklers for plausibility and consistency might have a lot to challenge.In way though, that is part of the fun of the film. Like many other Nolan films, it leaves you with a lot of questions, implied possibilities, and potential speculations ripe for discussion.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A classic movie, with a totally original concept","When I first heard about this movie I hired it on DVD not really knowing quite what to expect. The first scene (or is that last?!) shows a man being killed by a gun but filmed in reverse. Thankfully the rest of the film is not people walking around in reverse etc but carefully layered scenes, each new one set chronologically before the previous.This opens up endless possibilities of twists, turns and humour, which Christopher Nolan takes full advantage of. Guy Pearce is at his absolute best playing Leonard Shelby, the man who cannot make new memories due to an injury sustained whilst himself and his wife were attacked. He therefore has an uphill task finding the true murderer of his dead wife which he has now set as his only goal in life.Matrix stars Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano give excellent support in this gripping and original tale which may take at least a couple of viewings to completely get your head round.The great concept, acting, score and of course editing make this an unmissable thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Film You NEED to Watch Twice,"Memento is a film starring Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential, Iron Man 3, Hurt Locker), Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix, Chocolat, Disturbia) and Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, The Fugitive, Bad Boys II). It is written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar) and it is based off his brother Jonathon Nolan's (Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Interstellar) short story, Memento Mori.Memento is a psychological mystery/thriller about a Leonard (Guy Pearce) who cannot make new memories on the hunt for the person who raped and murdered his wife. He leaves himself notes all over himself and has tattoos that all have information on the man he is after. Along the way, he befriends Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) but are they really his friends?What ultimately makes this film so good is the writing. It is told in a way I have never seen before and it is so creative and smart I wish I thought of it first. Since Leonard cannot make new memories and we are seeing the story told through his eyes the only way to give us the information Leonard has is to tell the story backward. This doesn't mean it is like a tape being rewound and you can't make out what the characters are saying. It is told scene by scene by scene so the first scene is really the last scene and the last scene is really the first scene. So when a scene begins and Leonard is in a place he does not know with people he does not know, the viewer has no idea where he is and who he is with either. It is wildly creative.With such an innovative way to tell a story like you would need to edit it in such a way where while it doesn't make sense, it does make sense. The editing does this perfectly where things don't make sense deliberately, unlike sometimes where the editing is so sloppy you can't tell what is going on even in a linear story.This film is a great one if you really want to challenge your mind and try to guess the ending (or the beginning) before you make it there. This film is great the first time since you are trying to figure it all out, the second time it is also interesting because you are trying to pick up all the things you missed. However, after that the film can never get better than the first time you saw it. In summary this is a film everyone should watch mainly because of Christopher Nolan's brilliant writing.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One big gimmick,"As I write this, Memento is listed as number 10 on IMDb's top 250. It is ahead of Apocalypse Now, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Dr. Strangelove, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Lawrence of Arabia, The Graduate, Raging Bull, The Sting, The Empire Strikes Back, The Wizard of Oz, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Deer Hunter, Gone With the Wind, every Hitchcock movie, every Woody Allen movie, and every Kurosawa movie, except Seven Samurai, just to name a few.To hear the people on this board tell it, Memento is the 21st century's Godfather or Citizen Kane. I rented this film because of all the high praise it received. What I was treated to was an average film with only one outstanding performance (Joe Pantoliano), enough plot holes to drive a Jaguar through, and a gigantic gimmick that is as essential to the film as the shark is to Jaws.The movie is chopped into a number of scenes and shown in reverse. If one were to re-edit the film and show it front to back, it would be devoid of suspense. All the ""cerebral puzzles"" etc. would be gone. Even in its weird order, it's not all that deep. The director uses the sequencing and the protagonists's disorder to keep the viewer guessing. It's all a big trick, and by the end, the viewer is just relieved that it is over.There may be real people who suffer from this inability to create new memories, but I highly doubt they are able to function effectively as Pearce's character did. Nor do they have a network of friends who help them function and fail to get them professional help, especially when they are on a homicidal vendetta.Do not waste your time here. This movie has been rated highly by a bunch of people who mistake directorial sleight of hand for real movie magic. Rent any of the films I mentioned in the first paragraph. They actually deserve their praise.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A brilliantly twisted puzzle,"Memento is an intense, mind-bending thriller that pulls you into its fragmented story and never lets go. The way it unravels in reverse isn't just a cool trick-it puts you right in Leonard's shoes, making every moment feel disorienting yet gripping.The tension is constant, and Guy Pearce delivers an incredible performance, making Leonard's struggle feel raw and real. The film keeps you guessing, twisting your perception of what's true, who to trust, and whether you're even seeing things the right way. Every detail matters, and the more you pay attention, the more rewarding it gets.What really makes Memento stand out is how it sticks with you. Even after the credits roll, you'll keep thinking about it, questioning the pieces, and maybe even wanting to rewatch it to catch things you missed. It's complex but never confusing, making it one of those rare thrillers that feels just as smart as it is entertaining.If you like psychological stories that challenge the way you think, this one's a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Do not trust his lies,"This movie is incredible and very unique in how it's story is told; backwards. It shows something then it explains it while the things at the start start to unravel for the viewer, until finally the kicker. It's a film that needs to be payed full attention to for sure, as there's so many little details. The backwards folding mystery. And throughout it make you question the entire film. The acting is solid for most of the actors, and I feel it has no s lister syndrome and doesn't have any improper casting decisions. This kind of story telling is replicated in Nolans newer movies like interstellar and Dunkirk though it's not the exact same, and not a literal backwards story like this. The filmography in this movie works effectively, but has not much of note, the zoomed out shots for most of it and it's very few close ups shows the bigger pictures, and the whole environment, black and white scenes for the very far back ones though, which eventually collide as we roll back the tape. It definitely isn't using the highest quality camera though even for the 2000s, but this is a fairly low budget movie. The effects are done well for that as well, and the makeup. The set design is also good, with it's world of just being a mid sized city like any other. This film does the feeling of mystery to engage the viewer incredibly well. And is able to flesh out the character and his feelings while him forgetting all of them by the next day. His rapid analysis of all the areas fit his monologues and explaining of his pasts life, and there are no inconsistencies of his character. As for all the other characters which are played very well, for most the movie you know about as much as he does which I feel is intentional. Until it unfolds. The music in this movie is very efficient while being quite simple and quiet. Not the best soundtrack, or even notable, but it is done well in here. This film is hard to review without spoilers which I try not to do, but it is a must see if you like Nolan movies, or mystery movies. Or both. And over all I'd say it's a 8.8.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Review for Memento,"Just recently, I have started to get into mind bending movies that take the traditional way of telling stories and putting them through a fascinating layout. My first movie I had chosen to watch was made by a very well known director, Christopher Nolan, which is Memento. The movie follows a man with short term memory loss on a journey to find his wife's murderer, but that is sure to be the least interesting thing about the film. What struck me the most when watching the film was it's non-linear narrative. The film is laid out going back and forth in a sequences of the present and past. Doing this allows for the creation of suspense and feeling of unknowingness within the reader. The movie constantly has twists and turns that come unexpected because of its narrative and always keep us on our toes throughout the duration of the film. The writing and performances of the film were perfectly executed and set for the tone and feel of the movie. The performances allows us to actually dive into the world of the movie and most importantly believe that the story is real. Guy Pearce's performance is quite indistinguishable from real life, he gives such a believable performance that makes the watcher actually believe he has short term memory. The writing did a phenomenal job in keeping with the tone of the film, with making no out of place comments or words said by the characters to be acted out. It correctly orientated the characters to what they would say and/or do. I highly recommend watching this movie because of how intriguing and interesting it is which is displayed through the structure, writing, and performances. If you are like me and want to be thrown into a movie that calls for your brain to work and trying to understand the movie even after it is done with the credits, then this movie is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
MEMENTO' STRETCHES BEYOND THE USUAL SUSPENSE THRILLER,"""Memento"" is a thriller for people who are sick of thrillers, a puzzle movie in which the puzzle is actually worth the time and effort to solve. In Memento, Christopher Nolan tells his story backward!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing in every way shape and form,"The Movie Memento is a masterpiece that contains great script structure, acting and especially great direction on the part of movie newcomer Christopher Nolan.  Guy Pearce, who I saw and loved in L.A. Confidential, Carrie Ann-Moss, who I was surprised with (because I did not particularly love her performance in the Matrix), and Joe Pantoliano, who I've always loved in his numerous versatile roles, all show audiences how much of an art acting truly can be.  Chirsopher Nolan is an amazing new writer-director, who after his work on Memento, will surely light up the silver screen in many years to come.  Memento is a brilliant movie, that leaves audiences reconsidering their whole beliefs about what makes a person good or evil.",,Anonymous,Mystery
average movie with a good finale,"Memento has an extremely artificial feel to it. Given the way the story is told, this was probably unavoidable, but I find that it hinders true immersion into the film.The other problem is that it takes absolutely ages to build up even a hint of suspense. After the initial surprise at the storytelling has faded away, one finds oneself sitting there, just waiting for something - anything - to happen.Still - eventually the film does start and from that point until the end it leaves a very good impression. The storyline, even though it's extremely artificial, has been carefully plotted out and I certainly appreciate that it wasn't an easy task in this film.In the end thus, it's a film worth seeing once... but it's nothing you'd want to watch over and over again.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Like An Ipod on Shuffle But only containing 6 songs playing for 2 hours,I really hate to discredit art when credit is due. But in the case of memento if you like to watch a barrage of continuously replayed and ominously boring clips and a truly not so thrilling movie with a has been leading actor who would sadly do better on a lifetime movie rather than this. This is sad to see what is becoming of America or rather the world when this kind of a movie gets such a good rating. This movie was a blundering piece of reverse psychology that a 6 month old child could have guessed from the beginning. However if you feel like watching an almost 2 hour movie with only 45 minutes of film love going from color to black and white with no intentional purpose and like to feel like your mind is stuck in an ipod shuffle with bad 80s music for what feels like hours be my guest and watch this boring pile of garbage just remember i told you so.,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Powerfully dark and beautiful film. Looks into the void of a life only half lived.,"Memento is a spectral masterpiece of relentless and poignant visual story telling. It unwinds a fascinating story, walking a fine line between crime-noir and psychological drama, yet with a self-awareness that somewhat reminds me of Bergman's sincerity. That might sound a bit gratuitous to some, but making a film like this, where the script is so strong, requires a solid director who not only facilitates the story correctly, but preserves the presence of the mood and not sanitizing it. Guy Pearce's delivery of the first person narrative is spot-on in tone and with a strangely fascinating pragmatic determinism as we start to understand Leonard's strange existence. I think this story is told perfectly through Nolan's lens, and with a premise that is compelling from its first dark note. I have to give Nolan credit for not making this film something that wraps up a comfortably resolved climax with a bow on top. There are questions that cannot and should not be answered, and this is partially why it leaves the viewer with such a strong and eerie impact. There are only portions of the mystery that can be resolved due to Leonard's condition. Leonard is a character the viewer feels compelled to immediately sympathize with, and integrity that is unquestionable. You cannot help but to empathize with the excellent narrative and put yourself in Leonard's shoes. But the card that Leonard has been dealt is such a dark echo of functional existence. No matter how bad you want clean cut answers, the bigger picture has too many holes, and the extent of the criminal deeds of every character in this film is suspect. We cannot help but to empathize with Leonard because we know just by his running narrative as we hear his thoughts that his sincerity and resoluteness is unshakeable, but it is never quite clear how far he has been willing to go see justice incurred. Memento doesn't leave us hanging, but the unanswered questions make for a beautifully dark movie that it pulls you into a sea of uncertain reality. It's not that often that you come across movies with a grip that is as alluring as it is spooky.
I have to mention that it is perfectly acted by Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne Moss. And Joe Pantoliano could not have been a better choice.

A Mind-Bending and Gripping Puzzle of Memory and Identity,"The story revolves around Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce, a man suffering from anterograde amnesia, a condition that prevents him from forming new memories. Determined to find and avenge his wife's killer, Leonard uses photographs, tattoos, and handwritten notes to navigate his fragmented reality. The film effortlessly weaves two timelines together, one in black and white moving forward chronologically, and the other in color moving backward, creating a unique viewing experience.Christopher Nolan's direction is masterful, immersing the audience in Leonard's disorienting perspective. The film's fragmented structure mirrors the protagonist's fractured memory, inviting viewers to piece together the puzzle alongside him. Nolan's attention to detail, meticulous plotting, and precise editing contribute to the film's suspenseful atmosphere.Guy Pearce delivers a powerhouse performance as Leonard Shelby. He perfectly captures the character's desperation, confusion, and determination, infusing Leonard with depth and vulnerability. Supporting performances by Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano add layers of intrigue and ambiguity to the narrative.The film's exploration of memory and identity is thought-provoking. It raises questions about the reliability of our own recollections and challenges the notion of a fixed and coherent sense of self. As the layers of the story unfold, the audience is constantly challenged to reevaluate their assumptions and piece together the truth alongside Leonard.Visually, ""Memento"" is striking, with the black-and-white sequences emphasizing the gritty and unforgiving nature of Leonard's world, while the color sequences add a sense of disorientation and mystery. The film's use of visual cues and recurring motifs, such as the Polaroid photographs and the tattoos on Leonard's body, adds to the film's thematic depth and enhances the viewing experience.Thematically, ""Memento"" explores the nature of obsession, revenge, and the human desire for closure. It delves into questions of morality and the consequences of our actions, as well as the manipulation of memory and the power of subjective perception. The film's exploration of these themes lingers long after the credits roll.""Memento"" is a mind-bending and gripping cinematic experience that challenges traditional storytelling conventions. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, Guy Pearce's exceptional performance, and the film's exploration of memory and identity make it a standout piece of filmmaking. ""Memento"" is a must-see for fans of psychological thrillers and anyone seeking a thought-provoking and immersive cinematic journey.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""...I have this condition where I can't make new memories...""","Leonard Shelby cannot remember anything. He can't remember what he just did, what he just said. He can't remember that he can't remember. He's looking for someone. He doesn't know who. But he knows he must find them, to avenge the murder of his wife and the bash in the head that caused his memory loss. But is he sure his wife is dead? He can't remember. How does he know the cops haven't already caught the guy? He can't remember. Can he trust anyone? Maybe, he can scribble things on polaroids and little notes. But can he trust himself to be responsible for what he does and doesn't write down? He can't remember. Somehow, director Nolan produced the brilliant idea of playing the scenes in reverse order, so that the audience also has a memory loss, adding to the entertainment quality. The scenes aren't backwards they just follow each other end to beginning, in this form: minutes 7,8,9,5,6,7,4,5,6,3,4,5,1,2,3...etc. Hopefully you get the idea.

I don't think I have ever seen a movie do such a good job of making the audience feel like they couldn't remember anything either.

How could he be functional on his own, driving, etc in this state? How does he even remember that he has a memory problem?

At the beginning of the movie the viewer feels much like Guy Pearce's character in that they know as much about what happened and why as he does.

A compelling mystery that maps unknown territory with a terrifying feeling of absolute certainty,"Tightly acted and directed, and brilliantly adapted from a short story that used an unusual idea for a mystery thriller: supposing the central figure can only remember things that happened a long time ago or within the last 15 minutes? The psychological condition where someone, after a trauma, cannot create new memories, is vividly recreated as we are introduced to 15 minute segments one at a time, in reverse chronological order.To pull this off and maintain smooth continuity is quite a feat, which is why this movie is such a remarkable accomplishment. We are as bewildered as Leonard (played by Guy Pearce) as he searches for the man who brutally raped and killed his wife.

The facts that Leonard is tattooing in forward order in black and white cut scenes are the last facts that he needs to draw his conclusions.  So he has been collecting information for awhile.  The conclusions Leonard draws at the end of the film will set up the whole reverse story. It was interesting to start the film at 'Fact 5: Access to drugs' and have him derive 'Fact 5: Drug Dealer'.  What is displayed is the manipulation of Leonard's handicap.  Even though the main characters could be innocent they are all pawns to use him to their ends.

"Unorthodox, creative but sometimes disappointing.","This was undoubtedly one of the most original and creative films I've ever seen. It's not a perfect movie, it's not great, but it's good. The whole story revolves around a man who has suffered a brain injury that makes impossible for him to keep long-term memory from that moment on. He is, however, committed to discovering and punishing a murderer, resorting to post-it notes, tattoos and Polaroid photographs, where he notes what he has discovered. Its an interesting concept, later revisited in ""Before I go to Sleep"", film that approaches a similar story. The way the narrative is constructed, with multiple linearity twists, helps to thicken the mystery and hold our attention but it can have the opposite effect on people who don't understand the film right from the start. And this happens because, from the middle, the movie loses rhythm and interest. The ending works well but it can really disappoint, just as it disappointed me. I did not want the ending to be the way it was.

"Revisiting ""Memento"" after 20+ years","As ""Memento"" (2000 release; 113 min) opens, we are at the tail end of a violent confrontation between 2 guys, and someone is holding a Polaroid photo of the scene in his hand. We then go back in time a bit...Couple of comments: this was my first time seeing it again in over 20 years (more on that later). I must admit that I picked up a lot more this time around than I did back then. For example, while of course the story of Leonard, revenging the rape and murder of his wife while dealing with a sever case of short term memory loss (as in: he cannot build new memories), is set in color and in reverse chronological order, I had completely forgotten about the parallel story of Sammy, set in B&W and in regular chronological order. The other magical thing about this movie remains the fact that while we see the end of Leonard's story in the very beginning, it's really about the journey to get to that point that makes the film so compelling. The vision and ambition and talent that Christopher Nolan displays in ""memento"" is frankly astounding, even more so when you realize he wasn't even 30 years old when he made this film. (One of the best scenes in the movie for me is when Leonard is in the middle of a chase, and he can't remember whether he is the hunter or the hunted, no, really!)I saw ""Memento"" during the opening weekend of the 2001 Portland International Film Festival in early February, 2001 (about a month before the movie was released in US theaters, and remember walking away completely overwhelmed (in the best possible way). Of course nobody had ever heard of Christopher Nolan at that time. Now with more than 20 years in hindsight, we can state without a doubt that ""Memento"" is a classic, period, and that Nolan is one of the, if not THE, greatest Hollywood director of this era.

Confused? you soon will be,An Excellent film. I will watch it again (backwards as intended) My third viewing was IN THE CORRECT ORDER a feature only available to those watching the DVD. This is a hidden extra & can be accessed in the special features menu by clicking after the last Polaroid has spiralled round the screen. This makes the story a lot clearer but still leaves holes that you must fathom out yourself. I watched it again weeks later & still didn't quite get the gist of the segments of the film being shown in reverse order but knowing what happens does help slightly! Like a lot of people watching Memento for the first time I found it a confusing & unfulfilling experience leaving me feeling that I had missed something!,,Anonymous,Mystery
The Most Thouhgt Provoking FIlm of all time is also the best.,"Memento is a movie that would be difficult to make because the whole thing is played backwards and the more that we know the less Leo knows. While watching you really have to pay attention because how each scene begins is how the next one ends, but often it will be difficult to remember how it began because you will be pulled into the conflict of the story.Leonard Shelby is wonderfully played by Guy Pearce who earlier acted in the cop drama L.A Confedential, which in both of these movies he shows what kinds of talents he has on the screen. Christopher Nolan, the Writer/Director of Memento is one of Hollywood's greatest directors, he has done Insomnia(not based on the Stephen King book) with Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hillary Swank. Just Recently he has directed the thrilling Batman Begins which has an a list cast including Christian Bale, Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes. In Memento Nolan shows us how the character thinks because Leo will know something and then the next minute he would have completely forgotten the whole thing.To help himself remember things Leo will take pictures of people and places such as the hotel he is staying and Natalie(Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy Gammel(Joe Pantoliano), without these pictures th movie would be a total mess and would not be nearly and good. Nolans brother Johnathon wrote the short story of Memento which is supposed to be a really good story. If you have not yet seen it you should try to as soon as you can because after you will not be able to forget about it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Yet another positive review (feel free to skip),"Well I liked it. It was very good... errr.... that's it!I mean this movie has been reviewed so many times already, I doubt that anything I say is going to have much impact on you. It was intelligent, compelling and well acted. So what are you waiting for, go rent it!Still here? Well since you're so nosey, let me just add a few more thoughts. This is one of those films that people will tell you is very confusing and difficult to follow. Remember the Usual Suspects? People will go on and on about that film. Heck, there are people out there who found Dune and Mission Impossible confusing.When they finally ""Get"" an intelligent film, these people start evangelising. ""I'm so smart, I got this film, my friend didn't, therefore it must be brilliant!"" And by extension, they must be oh so clever too!Well, I liked the film, I paid attention and got it first time. I haven't rewatched it. Am I some kind of wunderkind? Not by the longest shot. Have I missed some hidden depths? Its about the nature of memory and how we construct ourselves, right? Even in the shallow end of the gene pool we spotted that one.Memento is a wonderful film that rewards attention. The film unfolds its mysteries as you watch. However the real mystery of this film is that the IMDb currently has it rated the 9th all-time greatest film. Its good, but if its in the top 100 I'll eat my hat. To the people who say it took them repeated viewings... PAY A LITTLE MORE FREAKIN' ATTENTION, WHY DON'T YOU? This is not a curate's egg, its an above-average thriller that explores a few interesting themes. Get over yourselves.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Innovative gem, top notch, must-watch, mystery thriller!","I recently watched Christopher Nolan's 2000 mystery thriller, ""Memento,"" and rate it as exceptional. Rated a 9, and if the scale allowed, would increase it to 9 ½; it's that close to perfection.Before you dive in and press start, my advice is to be well-rested and heavily caffeinated. This film demands your full attention. It's flawlessly edited, and the narrative flows seamlessly, keeping you engaged as you piece together the clues.What sets ""Memento"" apart is its dual narrative structure. The story unfolds in two timelines, with one in black and white moving forward, and the other in color moving backward. This narrative innovation is a stroke of brilliance.The two timelines converge at a pivotal and mind-bending plot revealing event, delivering one of the finest plot twists in cinematic history, in my humble opinion. The execution is done brilliantly
""Memento"" is not just a thriller; it's a philosophical journey. It raises profound questions about time, the purpose of life, and the value of memory, leaving you with plenty to ponder. This movie is a must-see for anyone who appreciates clever storytelling and deep, thought-provoking cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In the mystery genre it stands out.,"Memento is one of those movies I can enjoy watching more than once. If you give it ten years between you will forget most about it and can fully enjoy this rather complicated story. It's not an easy movie to watch, you have to stay alert, to not miss anything, as the story is mysterious and certainly not obvious. Memento got nominated at the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and Best Editing. A nice and deserved nomination for Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. Guy Pearce plays the main character and he did a great job, probably one of his better movies. Memento isn't a movie you watch without being extremely concetrated, it's needed to understand the plot. A great plot by the way, ideal for people that like the mystery/thriller genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of My favorite Movies of All Time,"Love this movie with its's everything,the scenes the gimmick and its's advanced storytelling by Christopher Nolan. The movie is like a puzzle that cannot be solved !! I love this (you need to watch it more than 2 times because of its details and head mixing scenes ) In conclusion this is one of the best movies in history and recommend this for all but not for children because they wont understand it that well. Last but not least a very important tip to everyone who wants to watch it don't watch it while your doing something (eating,reading etc)
You need to watch it fully concentrated and always stop for the parts that come hard.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Look Forward To Seeing This Story Told Backwards.,"Nolan does not insult the viewer's intelligence, instead he challenges it, and as a result he creates a unique masterpiece. For those who tire of remakes, reboots, and sequels, and seek a powerful example of creativity, Memento is not to be missed.Memento is, in my view, Christopher Nolan's best work and one of the best movies I have ever seen. I say this a lot, but I do not mean it lightly when I do. Memento is more than a movie, a way to kill 113 minutes. It is an experience.Due to it's complex nature, I do not recommend seeing it after a stressful day or while being tired. Memento requires(and earns) your undivided attention. Luckily, the story is so compelling that it sucks you into Leonard's world anyways.I have nothing but praise for Memento. I needed subtitles to understand the dialogue(a common complaint I have), but reading the dialogue was also a huge help for me to comprehend the plot more, so that is more of an additional plus rather than a flaw.In fact, some scenes were so impressive and some clever lines were so funny that I found myself repeating many parts over again. Even early in his career, Nolan proved to be a master of cinematic storytelling, both as a writer and director.Memento was one of Nolan's first movies, and it pre-dates his classics like The Dark Knight and Inception. Even then, 20 years ago, he proved that he had skill- with phenomenal storytelling, great film-making, sympathetic characters, and a compelling plot. The movie runs for 113 minutes, and not a single one made me lose interest.Apart from the fascinating plot, Memento also has great acting- from Guy Pearce, who plays Leonard, and the 2 main people who help him with his mystery, who are played by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss.Memento is a cinematic puzzle, and we are the ones putting it together. It may not all make sense when you are done, but you get what you need and repeated viewings will clear it up.We also see clips in black and white. They are told in order, however they don't make sense until we get the ""end"", and they are key events for the plot to wrap up with a bow.For example, Leonard in one scene finds an empty alcohol bottle. He questions if it is his- but he has no hangover. We then find out in the next scene that it belongs to another man who will lead him closer to solving the case.If that sounds really complex, then prepare yourself for this- it's told backwards. Since Leonard's memory is backwards, Nolan tells the story in reverse order. One moment something seems odd to Leonard, and therefore to us, but then it is explained to the audience in the next scene.Who can he trust? What did he learn from them? He doesn't know. And as such, we don't either. All we, Leonard and the audience, can do, is take it one scene at a time and gather the clues. Sometimes that really messes with your head, but that is part of the aforementioned genius.Memento follows a man named Leonard, who lost his memory after his wife was raped and killed. He wants to kill the murderer as revenge, but every few minutes, and every time he wakes up, his memory is lost. To help him recall key information on his case, he either tattoos them all over himself, or he writes it down in a notepad.If you were to ask me who some of my favorite directors are, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, John Hughes, Rob Reiner, and such would be named. Christopher Nolan is another name I would add now. While I am no stranger to his work, Memento is the hallmark of his career, and a testament to his genius.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nolan at his best!! It's like solving a puzzle along with the main character,"Nolan's second movie about a man seeking revenge for the murder of his wife, truly put the director on the map as an exciting prospect for the future and he has lived up to it. Obviously, the biggest selling point of the movie was the unique storytelling in the sense that the story revealed itself backward. This allowed us to truly be in the mind of Lenard (Guy Pearce) who is an amnesiac who can't form new memories apparently since the death of his wife. We are along with him in the search of what happened in the past. In the process we see all the people taking advantage of him in his pursuit.
There are a lot of things I liked in the movie. Guy Pearce is excellent embodying an amnesiac man who has absolutely no idea what is going on. The rest of the cast doesn't have a lot to do but are serviceable enough. The best thing was the editing. Even though there are two narratives, one told forward and one in reverse, you understand it clearly. Although at the start you feel confused about what's going on, you will get used to it. The flashbacks establish what happened without being distracting. The greatest strength of the movie is the ability in keeping you intrigued and interested. Due to the premise, it feels more of a puzzle that we are solving along with the main character.
Even then, there are stuff which I didn't like. I think the story doesn't allow the main character to be something more than just a tool to move it forward. Nolan and Guy Pearce don't add anything to make the lead more interesting for us to care about. The side characters are forgettable as well. They don't have definitive traits to make them full rounded characters.
Still, I do think it is a wonderful movie which is entertaining and tells us about revenge and violence and how it blinds people to the mistakes they are making. We distort our memory to suit us coming on the right side of things. We try to twist a fact in our favor so that we can do certain things that we want to do.
Watching Nolan's older movies (i.e pre The Dark Knight/Inception) really makes me wish he does those more regularly. Following the success of The Dark Knight and Inception he has chosen to do more of his big Blockbusters with more spectacle and complex plots but falling short on character and humanistic themes. Memento is a true reminder that Nolan isn't someone who can't make good movies about humanistic themes. It is actually his funniest movie (TDK is darkly funny) and has complex relationships between characters.
Highly recommend even for someone who isn't a Nolan fan. A true masterpiece and Nolan's second best film (after TDK). A 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Vastly overrated,"Well, I fell for the hype after noticing that Memento had been voted into the All Time Top Ten and rented the DVD. What a waste of time.

I suspect few movie devotees would have been nearly as interested if the film has been in normal linear mode.  After straining to notice each hidden clue, I was dumbfounded when this ""classic"" ended.  The star - Guy Pierce - gave a wooden ""Keanu"" performance, although in all fairness, he was given little to work with.  I couldn't give a damn about any of the characters.

Don't Answer the Phone!,"If I had to choose one word to sum up this movie it'd be 'ingenious.'Leonard Shelby has a rare memory disorder - he can't remember anything since he had a blow on the head after fighting with his wife's killer. He knows everything about himself up to that point, but new memories gradually fade and are quickly lost. He'll be talking to someone but will forget how the conversation started. He'll wake up in a hotel room completely ignorant of how he got there. Since his last memory is of his dying wife, he lives in grief and his only goal in life is to catch and kill John G - his wife's murderer.The film opens with the final scene in the plot and gradually takes you back through the story so that you only know why events take place after they've occurred.This means that you instantly empathize with Leonard - there's no way you couldn't as like him, you don't 'remember' what's gone before. It's a rare breed - a movie that manages to transfer you into the mind of the main character using the film making technique rather than the plot. Like it or not, while watching it YOU TOO have a memory disorder and are forced to see the world through Leonard's eyes - truly ingenious.As it goes on, you gradually realise that all isn't it seems and nobody is as they appear. I'm not going to give anything else away as it'll spoil it, but suffice it to say that it has a great twisting story, excellent acting and is shot beautifully in a minimalist noirish kind of way.It's a film that needs multiple viewings - I certainly had to watch it two or three times before I understood exactly what's going on, but when all the pieces finally fit together it's a great feeling. The region 2 DVD has a hidden feature that allows one to watch the film rearranged in the correct order (it even has the credits running backwards at the beginning etc) which means that when you've finally worked it all out, you can check that your deductions are correct and that you properly understood. This is a brilliant feature and certainly adds to the film's longevity.There are very few films that offer an experience as engrossing as this, although it's not for everyone. If you're the kind of person that likes to work things out for yourself using the available evidence (just like Leonard) then this is for you. If you like your movies to be clear cut and easy to understand on the original viewing, this may not be to your taste.For me, it's one of the greatest films of recent years and comes wholeheartedly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unforgettable,"A clever and well written mystery, Memento is great due to its fantastic performance from Pearce- direction from Nolan, and the mesmerising editing of Dody Dorn. This is a film truly like no other. Not only is it unique, twist-filled, and timeless- but it is also a story told in a way that has never been told before. It's a truly brilliant filmmaking achievement, with Nolan's screenplay and direction truly transcending the medium to become a true work of art. The film can be rather complex, and in result, a bit tough to follow, especially in the first viewing- but given time and focus throughout- Memento is incredibly worth your time and an experience you will never forget. It's greatest flaws are its dullest moments, as its pacing can drag a bit from time to time. However, it makes up for this in the way it tells its tale, as well as the fabulous performances throughout. I love Guy Pearce in this role, and I honestly believe it is the best I have ever seen from him. His performance does not only go unrecognized, but also that of Joe Pantoliano who always shines, and actress Carrie-Anne Moss who is also quite underrated in this film. In the end, Memento shines in a way I never expected it to. It's an original take on a classic mystery tale, and a viewing experience that will not only gain your attention but will make you awe as it begins to unfold.

One of the most incredible films ever made,"This film is honestly one of the greatest ever to come out of a film studio . The film Memento is mind-bending, keeping the viewer on the edge of their seats until the credits and another star quality that Memento has is that it can lead the viewer through plot twist after plot twist and still keep the viewer entertained until the last moments. Memento is about Leonard Shelby and thats pretty much all you'll ever know for definite about it. Yes that's how confusing it is until the very last, dying moments of the film. The script is great ( again the genius of Christopher and Jonathan Nolan ), the cast delivers on every aspect , Guy Pearce was brilliant as Leonard , Carrie Ann Moss also was very good as Trinity but the best performance of the film and one of the greatest performances in film history, Joe Pantoliano as Teddy Gammell. I was surprised that Memento was only nominated for two academy awards because I can tell you it was worth more. Overall, Memento is like a complex jigsaw puzzle that you can try to solve but just can't and it just leads up to an incredible twist ending that no one ( not even me ) could figure out . So if you haven't seen Memento you really don't know what your missing!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fascinating puzzle,"This film is a sequence of vignettes, shown in reverse chronological order, through which a murder mystery begins to unfold.   The end of each newly witnessed scene takes us to where the prior one ends.  Since the edges of the scenes overlap by a few seconds, we are able to piece them together to form a continuum.Brilliant in concept, well executed and well acted, this film is a spellbinding puzzle that is engrossing from beginning to end.Some critics of the film complain that the film's story would be simple-minded and uninteresting if viewed in normal time.  I don't agree. In any case, the film's `backwards' format poses certain limits on story complexity because of the extra mental effort we must go through to piece the puzzle together.  I think the film achieves a perfectly reasonable balance, considering these constraints.Others say that there are flaws in the plotline; however I believe that a second viewing will convince most observers that there are explanations for most, if not all, perceived anomalies.As Leonard Shelby, Guy Pierce delivers a fine, low-key performance:  that of a man whose emotions are sometimes grayed by the trauma of a life that has come unraveled.  Shelby is a man who is not completely innocent, but his life has become such a nightmare that he we feel sympathy for him nonetheless.However the finest performance of the film is by Carrie-Anne Moss.  In the character of Natalie, Leonard's flawed and tragic soul mate, she embodies anger, hatred, vindictiveness, sadness, compassion, and desperation.   And all are portrayed without a single false note.The movie is not perfect, and not for everyone, but I found it well worth the viewing.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I believe that the intention of this film is just to mess with your mind, and that was not the sort entertainment that I was looking for when I watched it.

Great,"""Memento"" (2000) is a mind-bending and innovative thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. The film follows Leonard Shelby, portrayed by Guy Pearce, a man suffering from short-term memory loss who is trying to solve the mystery of his wife's murder. What sets ""Memento"" apart is its unique narrative structure, where scenes are presented in reverse order, mimicking Leonard's fractured memory. As Leonard navigates through a series of tattoos and Polaroid pictures to piece together clues, the audience is taken on a suspenseful and disorienting journey. Nolan's masterful direction, coupled with Pearce's compelling performance, creates a sense of unease and tension that keeps viewers guessing until the final frame. The film's exploration of memory, identity, and perception makes it a thought-provoking and unforgettable cinematic experience. With its intricate plot, clever storytelling, and twist ending, ""Memento"" remains a landmark in modern cinema and solidified Nolan's reputation as one of the most innovative directors of his generation.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

That said, this film is top-notch at every major level, from plot to character to theme to style. Memento would be an accomplishment at any point in a director's career, which makes it that much more impressive that it came so early in Nolan's.

Sometimes a movie is so complicated you have to see it twice.,"Sometimes a move is so complicated it has to be seen twice; once forward and once backward. Memento is such a movie.We already saw it in reverse; now lets run the scenes forward. The advantage of renting a DVD is that you can explore the inside. Not that the movie was too hard to understand; it's just that the writer/director, Nolan, left so much out.The special features tell you that that memory-man did indeed cause his wife's death and that he had escaped from an asylum to seek the ""killers"" of his wife. All this is alluded to in the movie but since most of it comes from the Pantoliano character, you don't know what to believe.The characters played by Pantoliano and Carrie-Ann Moss are especially hard to pin down. When do they lie or tell the truth?In fact then the audience is intentionally left in the dark the same way memory man is confused. That is the beauty of the movie. Is it necessary to know all during the playing of the story? The answer is no. Because, the not knowing keeps the interest and the concentration level maximized throughout the playing of the tale. It is only afterward that you want to talk it out with a friend or read about it from the DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The performances of Guy Pearce (Leonard) and Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) are absolutely brilliant. Carrie-Ann Moss (Natalie) is also good, but not brilliant.

Good not Great,"The praise of this film is overblown...without a doubt. Easy way to judge the film: play it in the proper order and see how highly rated it is. Answer: not very. Played forward the film is afairly predictable and easy to see coming. So the story itself isn't compelling. None of the characters are particulary anything other than Guy Pearce- mianly becuase Pearce's character ""sees"" all the other characters and doesn't know anything real about them so neither do you.All that said, the arrangment of this film is what sets it apart and makes it not something dull and boring. Other films have used this technique but the technique does work in this case and it adds a level of interest to the film that the story itself does not wholly deserve.BTW, most of the ""talking"" about the film afterwards has to do with the open questions left by the film's plot. The question isn't what happens in the film and what you missed (6th Sense or Usuaul suspects) but what happens before the story that you are never told all that muhc about. There are ""supporting"" materials at the offical web site that add depth to the tale and make some of the questions- well frankly not very questionable.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lacan,"You could write an amazing Lacanian analysis on this. The prioritization of the Symbolic over the Imaginary, the focus on repetition in the drive to obtain the object of desire over the process of jouissance, the focus on the unconscious as it infects every aspect of our conscious experience of life without our realization due to fetisistic disavowal. But I do not have the energy to write this essay. If you know Lacan, take a look at this film again and think about it through his work. There's a lot to see here, and although this could simply be that it shows Lacan is correct in his commentaries on social normativity and, especially, the way the human mind works, it would surprise me if Nolan didn't at least have some psychoanalytic background in Freud.

A string of pearls ...,"This interesting movie is about a man who can only remember stuff that happens within a minute due to an accident he had when some rapists were molesting his wife. The story shows us a man on a quest to revenge the death of his wife, but with a twist!  The movie moves backwards in time although the sequential series of events that progress in clusters are in a normal timeframe moving forwards in time.  This way of telling a story opens up the narration in such a way that new perspectives and surprises revels themselves at the beginning of each new cluster, thus creating a deeper understanding of the previous cluster / action. There seems to be a metatheme in this movie.  The main character was a detective for an insurance company before his accident.  Now the whole movie seems to follow the path such a detective would go by when investigating. Namely, starting out with the crime itself and working backwards untill the person who did it and the motive is found. This movie might also allude to the current state of our historical science, showing that memory, and especially history can be tampered with and changed (especially in the hands of less morally founded individuals).  Thus one might even say it is a profound criticism of the all objectivity. Basically though, this is a thriller about manipulation in its different shapes and forms, and how people use each others weaknesses to outwit each other and sometimes even themselves....",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Ambitious and smart, but the rating is fake","If 'Memento' was released this year, there is absolutely no chance it would achieve the average rating of 8.5 that is currently has on IMDb. That rating puts 'Memento' in the top 50 highest rated movies of all time. To say that such a ranking is misleading would be an understatement.This film is unique and like nothing that had previously been attempted before its release. The plot is ambitious and intelligently told, giving the audience an insight into the mind of a short-term memory loss sufferer. The film makes for absorbing, but also frustrating viewing. I got the impression that 'Memento' thinks its better than it really is.Overall, a decent and unique thriller, but the rating is misleading and not a true reflection of the quality of the film. Interesting? Yes. Top 50 of all time? No!",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
My Favorite Movie of ALL TIME,"Yes, Memento is THAT good.The entire movie is played backwards (in 10 minute intervals) that surprisingly works. The reason why it's done this way because Lenny (the main character) has a condition, he can't remember things for more than 10 minutes (and at the end, you'll find out why it's being played in reverse, but I don't want to spoil anything). The only way he can remember is to tattoo words/phrases on his body, he uses this to track down his wife's killer......John G.Superb writing, directing, acting etc. (I could go on forever) but one of the main reasons I liked it so much is because it makes you think........a lot. During the movie, after the movie (I'm still thinking about it now, and I saw it 2 weeks ago) it's just so awesome. And the ending........ohh the ending, it's better than The Usual Suspects' IMO (which, if you liked this movie, you should see). This movie will blow your mind, my favorite movie of all time.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Early Christopher Nolan Genius,"Memento was one of Christopher Nolan's first big films that really put him on the map as this visionary director with a knack for playing with time. The story unfolds in (mostly) backwards order and keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout its entirety. There's some top-notch editing and storytelling that make for a great ""thinker movie"" through and through.Watching Memento is not only an enjoyable viewing experience but it also gives you an alternate perspective on movies. You're led by a flawed narrator through a series of clips that slowly tie together and paint this picture that has multiple viewpoints. You'll think, you'll gasp, you'll question reality, and you'll stare at your screen in silence for a while afterwards. But most telling for a great movie - you'll remember this film years down the road because it stays with you. Even if you don't remember all the details, you'll remember how it made you feel - and this demonstrates how powerful the film is and also leaves you with a poignant sense of irony given the movie's subject matter of memory loss.This is also another movie you can add to your ""will still be enjoyable and I'll notice something new the 2nd time I watch it"" column.Verdict: Watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
10/10 - Better keep this as a memento...,"Review: Every now and then, were given a movie which makes us think during sleep, makes us discuss it with friends/family, redefines our lifestyle, changes our outlook on things, etc etc. This is one of those movies... The filmstyle is superb, I won't say anything to spoil the movie but rather explain the style of its approach. The movie starts off in the end and it sequentially plays 'backwards' towards the start of the movie. A very ingenious method of filming, it leaves us guessing in the end (or shall I say start?). Easter eggs (I won't say which!) also linger in the movie which increases the question/discussion count. The character development is superb as it is the only movie to my recollection which 'un'develops the character. ALthough it might be confusing for a first viewing, watching it a second time will make the viewer yearning for more just to get his/her questions answered. Acting is superb, we are left with no hint of overacting or underacting in all cases. I would recommend for all to watch it at LEAST 2 times for the full effect of complete heavenly satisfaction.10/10 - Better keep this as a memento...",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A new favorite of mine.,Extremely well written and engaging. A movie that definitely needs to be watched multiple times because of the complex timeline.Christopher Nolan shows his talent in one of his earliest films.

Remember Sammy Jankis,"Let me start this off by saying ""Whoa! This movie is absolutely spectacular!"" ... After you watch it several times. I first heard of this movie from a friend in my Drama class. He was incredibly ecstatic about Memento. He rambled on about it for twenty minutes, giving praise to the creators of this masterpiece. I decided, being the quality film buff that I am, that I should check it out. This first time around, I found the plot to be cumbersome and hard to follow. I didn't want to brush it off as some sort of elaborate gimmick film just yet, so as soon as the ending credits rolled, I started the DVD over and watched it from the top again. The second time through, I was able to follow the complicated plot twists with better ease. I had this same problem with Pulp Fiction, but, as with Pulp Fiction, watching the movie twice helped to alleviate my worries.Memento drops you into the mind of a man named Leonard, who runs around playing detective while hot on the heels of John G., the man who he believes is one of the two men responsible for the rape and murder of his beloved wife. John G., who escaped from the crime scene unscathed, didn't leave empty handed. With him he took away Leonard's ability to make new memories. Now Leonard stumbles around in a world of delirium and uncertainty as he searches for the man who killed his wife. Without a short term memory and the ability to make new memories, Leonard is forced to rely on scattered notes written on paper, tatoo facts, and Poloroid pictures to make his life liveable. The life of John or Jack G.(Leonard's not sure of which name it is) now depends upon Leonards ""notes"". Sadly enough, Leonard isn't even aware of how long his wife has been dead. He doesn't even know if he'll remember that he has killed John G. after he finds him and kills him.Along the way Leonard meets Natalie, a bartender, and keeps bumping into a mysterious man named Teddy who claims to be Leonard's friend. These two are constantly pulling Leonard in different directions, which leads to an interesting question. Who should he trust? And a tattoo on Leonard's left hand reminds him to ""REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS."", a man with the same short term memory problem as Leonard. What's the connection between Sammy and Leonard? Watch the movie to find out!Overall, this is a great film that is worthy of a lot of your time. And trust me, it's going to take a lot of your time to figure this movie out. The acting is wonderful, the cinematography works great with the memory loss angle, and the telling of the story in reverse breathes a fresh breath of air into the movie industry. Guy Pearce(Leonard) is at his best in this film, as is Joe Pantoliano(Teddy). Carrie-Anne Moss(Natalie) deserves an honorable mention as well. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you guessing to the final moments of the film, then look no further than Memento.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Ingenious story-telling.,"How do you tell the story of a man with absolutely no memory who is trying to solve a mystery by obtaining information he can't even remember? You do it by putting the audience in the exact same situation as the character.Guy Pierce's Leonard is sure only that an assault resulted in the murder of his wife and a head injury that robbed him of his short-term memory. And he is obsessed with finding her killer. But an inability to remember events from even 5 minutes ago is the ultimate monkey wrench in the works. So Leonard documents his search for clues with photos and scribbled notes, realizing that in a few minutes, he won't even remember what they mean.We see everything from Leonard's perspective: photos, notes and people that mean little to us until we-and Leonard-receive more information that we can remember but he can't. Constant flashbacks reveal the significance of the clues that Leonard carries with him. Where we differ with Leonard is that we can slowly piece everything together by the accumulation of facts that literally seem to go in one ear and out the other for Leonard. The search for clues and the meaning behind them becomes as fascinating for the viewer as it is frustrating for Leonard. A very unique, very-interesting story.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I feel somewhat cheated...,"I saw this movie after reading and hearing rave reviews for it, and I must admit that I was disappointed. I paid too much attention to its supposedly-confusing details after some of my friends (and printed reviews) told me the goings-on were murky, I was led to believe that if I blinked I'd miss out on something that might have been important.(The following could be considered to be spoiling, so be prepared!) It is unfortunate I had been ""informed"" about this movie like I had, and here is why: the ending raps up its precedings perfectly, the whole thing has no ambiguity to it whatsoever like some people have been saying it does. Lenny's (he being the main character) tale ultimately turns out to be a psychologically- rather than a physically-based one, and I was let down because that felt somewhat cheap to me. I got to the end and received something I didn't really care about, it (he?) just wasn't very interesting. Simply chalk that up to my personal taste?As I think about it more, to a certain and perhaps large degree I felt the way I did due to my unmet expectations, but still, even w/o the ones I had I would say that the story was unsatisfyingly executed. It is rather hard for truly rewarding films which use characters' deep psychologies as their real subjects to be made in my opinion, and this one didn't quite pull it off, not even close actually. For one thing I think too much effort was spent on being ""clever"" with its method of storytelling-in-reverse instead of trying to be compelling in legitimate ways, say by having characters with more depth: all in all I considered it to be a slightly above-average B-movie. So, after pondering the movie a bit I give it a 6 after my initial response of 7.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"7.8/10 - Very good, puzzling movie.","What can I say about this film... It's mind-bending, hard to understand, but GOOD. The first thing that will leave you completely confused for maybe the first 15 minutes is that THE SCENES ARE IN REVERSE ORDER. The movie will start at the end of the story, and it will end at the beginning. You'll probably understand this in just a few minutes, but even while knowing, your brain will not process the information and piece the puzzle together correctly. This will also challenge your memory; in normal movies, you can remember the past couple scenes well enough, but in Memento, you will remember them, but your brain just won't attach them together correctly. Whenever the movie progressed and changed scene, I had to actively try to remember what had happened right before, and how it ties into this new scene (which technically happens before the scene you just watched, not after).Anyways, apart from that, the movie was quite intriguing. However it pummels you with different lines, events, actions, that all contribute to your current theories on the plot. But because of this, you will not take any information as truth, but rather things that you will need to keep in mind until the information is proven correct (or false). Because of this, when the actual big twist/reveal happens, it won't really leave you an impact, because you don't know if that new information is true or not. This kinda ruined the big reveal for me.Anyways, let's start talking about the actual components of the film now. Starting with the characters.You won't really have an appeal for any of them, except maybe for Leonard (the protagonist) or if you're stretching it a bit, Teddy. They're all written well enough, but more and more things just get ""revealed"" about them and that makes you unable to really make any concrete feelings/opinions on them. You might start liking one character, then the movie throws a small bit of info (that might or might not be true) about him and then you just won't know what to think of him anymore. Anyway, the acting was good, each character had a role and played it, it was good.Now, the OST. The soundtracks in this movie are pretty good. You won't hear a soundtrack often, though. It's a bit uncommon, or at least it's pretty subtle and you won't notice it. But, during important scenes, there will be an OST that you'll notice right away, and it will fit, it will sound nice, it will just be good.The cinematography. It's pretty good as well. There are a few hints in this movie that you can notice and understand only if you pay really attention to everything. The scenes are filmed well, etc.In conclusion, this is a good movie. The ending didn't really satisfy me, but I think it was worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Are your memories really yours?,"It's not surprising to believe that the same director who made films like, the prestige, inception, the dark knight, interstellar, tenet; actually made a really mind boggling and smart narrative that follows a non linear format.It's absolutely astounding that a concept as unique as this was done with a small budget, considering some of his other films he's created.You are as much watching the film as you are participating with Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), piecing together a fractured story that you can't solve until the end. Nolan attributes his previous techniques from his first feature (Following 1998), the characters monologues being an obvious attribute.The film is stylistic with its noir elements enhance and accentuate the mood and diegetic design of the locations, giving a independent minimalist perspective but refined triple A budgeting for a feature film.The film shows a realistic and effective portrayal of anterograde amnesia, Christopher implements and embeds this into the narratives core; alarmingly making you just as confused as the protagonist.The soundtrack is absolutely masterful, equally as melancholic but hopeful, reflecting Leonards struggle to continue the search for his wife's killer.If I say anymore about the story, I'd be spoilin-Oh

"I had a summary, but my memory is too fallible!","Right when I began watching the movie, since the very moment that picture in the opening credits started disappearing and the initial kill, I wondered is this just one of those gimmick movies or will they actually follow through with this idea till the end.I say this because, without a doubt, the idea of a movie played entirely in reverse (as opposed to flashbacks or other narrative non-linear-story-telling devices) is quite bold and unconventional, at least before other movies such as Irreversible started copying Memento. That this reverse storytelling serves a purpose to actually for the most part enter the world of our character is even more worthy of compliment. Instead of knowing the past we know the future, which is of little use as the future itself has to be redefined each time we go further into the past. The fact the movie comes up with fresh ways of challenging our perceptions of the future is another plus for it. The film-noir atmosphere is another plus. Guy Pearce's acting and conveying the emotions of an eternally heartbroken and disoriented person is yet another plus. Finally, an ending which completely and profoundly reverses all expectations, not only of all preceding events (in the future) but also of what these movies are genrewise supposed to be like, quite simply settles it for me.

"Interesting Concept, Flawed Execution (5/10)","(I saw this on DVD, YMMV)Summary:Leonard Shelby is a man who has no short term memory since being injured defending his wife an attack that resulted in her rape and murder.  For some reason that is not really clear, the police have never caught the attackers, so Leonard has vowed to hunt down and kill them.  However, he cannot remember a thing that has happened since the day he lost his short-term memory and ten minutes ago.  Therefore, he is constantly having no memory of why he is doing things and uses a series of pictures and notes to help sort it out.To give the same feeling to the audience, the director shows the scenes in reverse order.  The opening scene of the movie essentially has Leonard looking at a picture of Teddy with the words ""kill him"" written underneath in his handwriting.  Leonard proceeds to kill Teddy.  Just as that is all Leonard has to go on, that is all the audience has.  Then the movie backs up a little bit and shows Leonard gleaning the last bit of information that convinces him Teddy is the killer and we see him actually writing ""kill him"" on Teddy's picture.  This backing up continues until we find out the real secrets in the movie.The Good:Guy Pierce gives a very good performance as Leonard.The transitions between the scenes are very smooth.  There is just enough overlap at the start and end of each scene that the transitions are very easy to follow.  In addition, there is a small part of the film that runs forward in time, mostly Leonard telling a backstory to someone on the phone. These are easily distinguished by being shot in black and white, while the rest of the film is in color.The Bad:There is an unrelenting lust for death that drives Leonard.  No one, not even Teddy who might be a cop, discusses the idea of vigilantism.  That Leonard should hunt down and kill whoever he thinks might be the killer, the justice system be damned, is never questioned.  It is the mindless writing of a bad action movie at work here.Although the reverse order presentation is easy to follow, it began to wear thin.  Perhaps it is because, and other reviewers have mentioned, that this story told in chronological order would be weak, at best.  The film relies too much on this one trick of storytelling without anything else to really back it up.The clincher that something is desperately wrong is the pat summation speech at the end of the film.  Throughout the film, the reliance is on how Leonard is going to remember some particular fact, but we are only given the quickest glances of the actual results of Leonard's investigations.  In an attempt to make a rather dull story seem mysterious, the makers have told us so little about the story that they make up for the error with ""the speech that explains everything.""5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Given his condition, there was no way to determine that, or sleuth it out from the details given previously.In effect, the makers of this film seemed to put 100% of their energy into a really great concept, and put zero effort into actually making this into a murder mystery.

Sure, it is cool trying to piece together the story, trying to remember what happened in the last scene, and trying to figure out who thekiller is.  But the movie is ultimately unsatisfying.  The characters are flat, emotionless, and none of them sympathetic.  The editing is great, it is in fact the saving grace of the movie, but the directing is stale, boring and cold. Nolan doesn't get anything near good performances out of his actors.  They seem tounderstand what works about this movie, but never perform in a way that moves you (with the exception of Joe Pantoliano, who is convincingly evil, but notgreat) The movie is sterile.

Leonard doesn't know who he can trust, who's using him, who he has met, and if they've hurt him before.Pearce brings a beautifully subtle performance as Leonard, haunted by the past, because that's all he can remember. Despite his organized system, we see him struggle just to function. By reversing all the sequences of events, Nolan allows us to only know as much as Leonard knows. Moss and Pantaliano are a strong supporting cast, and you don't know if they're allies or enemies.This film may require several viewings. It is worth it. As soon as you think you know what's happening, another fragmented, misplaced idea will surface. You will find yourself confused, lost, trying to remember what happened before. You will find yourself like Leonard. That is Nolan's trick. And he pulls out the rabbit, and doesn't disappoint.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Incredible Storytelling,"Ever wanted to know what's it like to be the protagonist of the movie you are watching? Thats exactly what this movie can give you. Maybe not in the way that you will feel like a badass hero or something, BUT you will know exactly how the protagonist of this movie feels (provided you can forget you are currently watching a movie).

This is how you direct a psychological film,"Memento stars Guy Pearce and Carrie Ann Moss and is directed by Christopher Nolan. Guy Pearce plays Leonard a man who suffers from short-term memory loss who is looking for the killer who murdered his wife. If I could summarize this in two words it would be mind blowing. This is one of the smartest intelligent psychological thrillers of all time that doesn't go for the usual twist ending. I'm not saying that all psychological thrillers do that; I'm simply stating that no psychological thriller will ever come close to as Memento, except the Sixth Sense. I was impressed how Christopher Nolan decided to make his own psychological thriller so he can mess with the viewer's minds.
This is one of those movies where every detail of the movie counts that you can't cook or do chores, because then you would be lost and confused. We don't know much about this person, but we do get a little brief background information about him. But from the evidence that I gathered throughout I sympathize with his character because he's looking for his wife while at the same time suffering from short-term memory loss. And because of his condition I feel pity for him as the people he interacts with treat him differently. But at the same time his past life he's a jerk if you think about it and so it brings me the question of should I feel his pain or not? I'm going to end my review here because it's really hard not to give anything away with people who haven't seen this movie and I want people to experience this masterpiece without spoilers. And trust me as soon as the movie is over you will be thinking about this again and again trying to piece the puzzles together. And for the people, who have seen the movie, don't spoil it for the people who haven't. It's not cool.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"smart, intelligent, and without a doubt, best movie of 2000","i love this movie.  guy pearce is incredible.  i am upset that he wasn't nominated for anything.  the concept of the reverse storytelling is original and creative.  Christopher Nolan directs this movie with brilliance.  I have watched this movie over a dozen times.  I feel for this character.  I often wonder about 'Lennie'.  Is he the victim or is the bad guy.  This is what Nolan does.  He makes us feel for the character.  This story is about one man who can't feel time.  He lost his wife in a horrific and tragic accident.  Since then, he feels no comfort, no healing, no progress.  He does not understand that life is progressing.  He can't feel that.  He just feels anger and hate.  The movie is a cyclical process.  I am drunk but i understand that in order to heal, i need time.  Leonard Shelby can't feel that.  He only understand's vengance.  Watch this movie.  love this movie. it will be in your top 5.  absolutely guaranteed.  i promise.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie that requires some thinking,"I thought Memento was a wonderful, thought-provoking movie.  The end-to-beginning storytelling style was very interesting, though it was a challenge to get used to it.  After the first half hour it starts to make sense though.  Still, it is not a movie you can just passively watch; it does take some effort on the part of the viewer to understand what is happening.Some have criticized this film as having glaring plot holes.  I disagree. Leonard's problem is not what it seems and the answers to many of these ""plot holes"" are right there in the film.  Watching this film once is not enough.  Much like ""Sixth Sense"", the true enjoyment is in watching it again and seeing how all the pieces fall into place.Well worth a viewing 8/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Have you been waiting for a film to demand your attention and leave you with questions that can only be answered by multiple viewings? Then your prayers have been answered.,"Have you been waiting for a film to demand your attention and leave you with questions that can only be answered by multiple viewings? Then your prayers have been answered. Memento ends as it begins, and the ending you see, before the credits roll, is chronologically the middle point of the story you watch unfold before you on screen. Confused? Well it is being shown to you in 5-10min. segments, progressingor digressing I should say, from the end to the beginning. You are completely immersed in the life of Leonard Shelby, a man that suffers from short-term memory loss, and lives his life by following the photos and messages he has made for himself. The script is based on a short story by Johnatan Nolan. Christopher Nolan, his brother, wrote the script and directed the film, this being his second feature. It is difficult for me to go on about the plot, because it truly is an experience to walk in there not knowing anything. This was not the case for me. I read a few reviews, many better than the one you are reading now. I knew what to expect about the backwards storytelling, as well as a few key points about the main characters, but nothing that was really crucial. There is really nothing that can prepare you for this film. I can honestly say I have never seen anything like it, and was happy to walk out of the theater with my mind pacing through the many possibilities. It sucks that I can't blab them out all here, but no spoilers, don't worry. I wouldn't do that. If you liked movies like Se7en, and Usual Suspects, than I definitely recommend the film. The similarities Memento has to those films are mostly in the overall tone, and that it is without a doubt a part of the Detective/Crime thriller genre. Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce to a ""T"", he is Leonard Shelby!!), becomes the ultimate hard-boiled detective. He's got drive, that being to find the man that murdered his wife, and he's got his short term memory loss which makes his task go from difficult to near impossible. But, unlike those other films, Memento shocks you at the beginning of every segment, where you are once again left to figure out where you are and whats going on, to the point where you may eventually lose track. By the time you reach the climax ending, you will probably be frustrated having tried so hard to outsmart the film. So, what am I trying to say? Well I'm not to sure how clear I have made myself, reviewing this film by saying anything other than ""Just go see it!!"", is pretty hard. I myself need to see it again, which would make it my third time. What I suggest is that you absolutely go see this film, sit back and just watch things unfold. Just watch, and the best I can promise you is that you won't feel so stupid when you WANT to buy a ticket to see it again.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Clever but Taxing,"Christopher Nolan's modern-day noir concerns a man (Guy Pearce) trying to uncover his wife's killers while struggling with short-term memory loss. Since his hero is also the narrator, it's a tricky narrative; but Nolan complicates things even further by unfolding the story backwards. The result is clever but it's also taxing: your mind has to work harder than it necessarily should. Once the novelty wears off, there are plenty of dead spots and impatience sets in--you want to get to the beginning to get a feeling of completion. The result is like watching a big-screen version of `Columbo' where you know the killer at the onset and watch Peter Falk figure out whodunit and why. If that's your cup of tea, this is for you. Pearce is excellent, as usual; also starring is Joe Pantoliano (a pleasure) and an underused Carrie-Anne Moss.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nolan's Best and one of the best ever,"Memento brilliantly puts you into Pierce' s head and makes you truly fell like you have short term memory loss. His perspective of the world is one of isolation. Everything he can remember is either written down or tattooed on himself. Imagine Not knowing if you did something or not. After the movie finishes, you feel like you forgot to do something.The Movie begins with Guy Pierce desperately seeking who killed his wife. It is the one thing he lives for. He suffers from short term memory loss and his memory, like the movie, is shown in fragments that resemble what he can actually remember. The search continues throughout the movie and ends in one of the bests twists ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
incredibly disappointing,"This movie is so wonderful conceptually that I almost feel bad about writing a bad revue of it.  The backwards timeline to reveal memories is a very interesting idea, and throughout most of the movie it is handled beautifully.  Also the plot twists are all sharp and interesting, save the end twist which destroys any chance for catharsis on the audience's part.But more than the ending of this movie bothered me.  Guy Pearce is a horrid horrid actor.  He is able to look brooding and that's about it.  Perhaps with a more skilled actor (Edward Norton would have been perfect) this movie might have actually achieved some emotional power.  But Pearce is only capable of looking brooding and cold.  He brings no emotional depth, which is why the ending didn't work because ultimately the audience doesn't care about his character.  Also the writing takes a turn for the worse around the middle of the movie.  The prime example of this is Guy Pearce's incredibly trite ""the bed is cold"" speech which begins with boring sensory detail and delves into painfully bad rhetorical questions.Ultimately, this movie fails to bring a payoff to the audience.  It starts off as a beautiful film noir that melts into your mouth like a piece of dark chocolate.  but the bitter aftertaste will get you.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretentious gimmick,"Memento is one of those ""films"" that ""film scholars"" are supposed to like. Make that REALLY like.  You see, it's one of those movies that require you to think really hard about what is happening.  It is more of an exercise than a movie.  It isn't fun at all to watch or experience.  What it really is, unfortunately, is a waste of time.  It relies on a single gimmick that I figured out 10 minutes into the movie.  Without the gimmick the movie has NOTHING going for it.  Oh there is the obligatory BIG TWIST at the ""end."" But it isn't all that compelling because all the characters in the movie are either repugnant or uninteresting.  In fact, take away the gimmick and there is no story here worth telling.This is a movie that will be embraced by wannabe film scholars and intellectuals.

Relatable and Emotional,"This is the first time I've seen this film since developing mild memory loss myself. This viewing hit me so much harder than previously.

I didn't quite understand this film the first few times I watched it. But it's funny that I have memory loss now so it should make even less sense. But I feel like it was made for me. Specifically there is something quite beautiful in the way that Nolan portrays flashbacks. I am not one to usually appreciate romance in film but this film is different. There's a genuine feeling of love and care.This is one of those films where having memory loss is a good thing.

This film requires an enormous amount of participation from the viewer. There are facts to remember, people, places, events, etc. And to make it even worse, the movie plays backwards, in intervals.

What just happened?,"First off, the reason I am rating this highly is #1: The acting was supreme- the cast was excellent. #2: The plot was very engaging; at no time was I bored- every second was spent racking my brain trying to put the pieces together.The unfortunate part is, I've only seen the movie once (just now), and don't know what to make of the story. The one thing I wanted to know was left unanswered, or possibly was answered, but perhaps I need to watch the movie again about five times back to back and then spend a few days mulling it over to figure it out.Complex is the best way to describe the plot of this movie. It was done in reverse fashion, showing the latest scenes first, followed by a scene one step early, and so on. This added an extra component of viewer involvement; I had to be locked into the plot every second for fear that I would miss something, and I probably have.The main character was excellent; very believable. I suppose it probably isn't too hard to act as someone who hasn't experienced something, especially when you never have. Perhaps this is part of why it was such a believable film.I have not yet read any of the other reviews on this film, but am eager to see what others have to say on it.

A PERFECT Myth,"Memento, masterfully executed by Christopher Nolan, is kind of a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from the beginning to the very end of it. It's a rarity with films nowadays to work mystery into their plot and yet steel, be engaging.The story centers around Leonardo Shelby who has lost his ability of making new memories through his trials for saving his wife. The plot depicts how he does his best to take his wife's revenge BUT nothing seems as simple as they are. The most phenomenal thing about the movie was the way it was narrated. Seldom do we have movies to narrate a story backwards as well done as memento; and its all thanked to the Nolan's skillful direction.Now getting to the characters, being amazingly well written and given great backstories, their greatness would not reach their demands if it wasn't for the performances of the cast, who were all perfection. Guy Pearce's portrayal of a ill-minded character stands out as one of the best performances contributed to a myth story. Needless to mention Carrie-Anne Moss who gives an equally mysterious and complicated performance.Speaking of the technical points, it was all well-set, especially its skillfully set cinematography, which contributes a great deal to its audience in descending them along its mysterious and unreliable world. The score was satisfying too, especially regarding its main theme. From the very first point of the movie, the emotions that the main theme expresses, makes its viewers aware of the sadness and confusions ahead of them.Plainly put, such a exciting myth it is with solid performances that overall, doesn't give a sec to blink as fast-paces as it is.

Groundhog Day revisited,"Ingenious construction that plays like a parallel universe version of Groundhog Day. GHD you may recall was the story of a man held prisoner in a world that had no memory, where each day started at zero and where he is the only truly free agent.

In one he is the focus of change as others are the unchanging scenery while in the other he remains the same as the others develop and transform before our eyes. In GHD the central character learns to use the world to his advantage and his journey ends when he is ready for acceptance (he goes through the seven stages of loss).

"A smart, original, and hella complex thriller","In an attempt to keep this review spoiler free, I'll simply state that this movie is in my Top 5 of all-time. It is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. And by thriller, I don't mean Dawn of the Dead.The story is amazing, the cinematography works well. This is a smart movie for smart people who like smart movies. And it doesn't have a hint of pretentiousness. It's not being different just to be different.My biggest problem with movies that have twists at the end, is that the writers/directors spend 95% percent of the movie luring you in, and then the last 2 minutes showing you how at all comes together. This was done well in ""The Sixth Sense"", and done poorly in ""The Prestige"", and ""The Lookout"". Both of the latter movies had serious promise, yet I just wasn't able to buy into them 100%. A non-issue with Memento.The movie's plot is spaced out evenly (by nature of the story) and by the time you make it through one viewing you'll know what I mean. This is possibly Memento's greatest asset.In many ways, this is a caper, a mystery, a who-dun-it. I have seen this movie many times, and I'll admit that I didn't fully understand what I had just seen after my initial viewing.I suspect that most people will need to watch the movie twice in order to have even a clue of what is going on in the movie.

"A dazzling, great and exciting thriller; perhaps the greatest film ever done","Director Christopher Nolan become known as doing great films, but all this respect that he has nowadays can be given to two films: The Dark Knight, which makes his fame, and Memento, back in the earlier 00s, which make his name. Memento is a class of story-telling, a piece of art. It's a film that you want to watch again and again, because is really that good. This film has some kind of glue, once watched about ten minutes or so, you won't stop. Why? Well, firstly, because the way the story is told. I don't want to enter in details; after all, spoilers really can ruin this film at first watch.But I can say that IF the goal of the film is make the viewer really feel the character's mind to the point of being confusing while watching the film, I can say that they did very well the job. It's a great puzzle, and the pieces are given in a way that sometimes you think in a way, but then there is another piece given, and you simply change completely your thoughts. Then fine, you think the story is finally going ahead. But, somehow, there is yet a piece missing in the story, and there is when you realize you got completely involved in the story and your mind starts to become confused. I've never been so excited for a film as much as i did when watching Memento. I've watched films with very powerful twists, and films with a very well told story, but in that film, there is like a combo of these two aspects and sure I've never seen nothing like that. It's the best thriller film that I've watched, enough said.Leonard's quest is so unpredictable, and its even more attenuated with the fact that not only the story has no chronological order, but also with the fact that the story is inter called with another moment of Leonard's life(the sequences which happens in that inter called reality is entirely made in black and white). There is also some of Nolan's trademarks in this film. The slight dark humor in the action scenes and the twists in the end which he became known for are two of them.Once the cinematic puzzle that this film is gets completed, you realize how pessimist and cruel the film is. The ending is unpredictable, and certainly on par with the buildup made, but it don't leaves anything to be thought or whats or ever. There are really no questions to be asked. This is what is so great about it. Despite being apparently a film with lots of layers, the message that it wants to pass is only one – and is very clever. A metaphor about life, and again, not an optimistic one. And as far as the world looks, this metaphor is – how can I say that? It makes no sense! But okay, I'll try. The metaphor is true. Yes, true. Unfortunately. Obviously, I'll not spoil it, otherwise the entire film would be useless and the experience wouldn't be as great as if you know what this metaphor is beforehand, again, and worthy noting to say: don't look for spoilers about this film.

possibly my perfect film,"What can I say - my fave film of all time. I sat down to watch with a few spare hours and a dose of flu. By the time it had finished and mates/hubby returned from pub, I was forced to grab them by the scruff of the neck and make them to watch it. The point of view is superb, giving us just a little more info with each scene, confusing the mind with a backwards timeline while suffusing the whole with a forward facing timeline shot through it, using black and white to delineate the ""right"" time line. If you guess the riddle before the final scene, you are obviously suited to working as a policeman, or maybe Hercule Poirot.Each time I watch it I see another hint that I should have seen the first time, or the second, a detail that makes sense only now I know the answer. Gut pearce as our hero is superbly ethereal and really seems to make you feel what it would be like to make no new memories.Now, where was I?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
YES.,"A masterpiece which does not hit quite as hard upon a second viewing but it is probably the best Nolan film in my opinion. The acting, story, everything. Go into it knowing nothing about it, of possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Typical high-quality but hopelessly commercial flick...,"I sincerely fail to understand the enthusiasm of the fans of ""Memento"". I can imagine that something is wrong with my attitude, but could please somebody explain to me what they really find in there? The idea of a man without a short-term memory is not bad: this could be a wonderful chance to comment on the world, reality, time, out living in time and our representations of it: on the whole multitude of questions that were the focal point of the thoughts and works of philosophers and artists for millenia. Do the creators of this movie even try to do that? No - the story never strays away from a long-trodden path of a sturdy commercial thriller-mystery. Yes, yes - reverse order, unknown past instead of unknown future etc., but this all looks to me like using a statue as a hammer. What makes you think about anything in this movie: some reviewers claim to go on thinking about it for days - about what? If you really want some deep insights into the nature of time and memory, try Immanuil Kant or Upanishads - don't try to get them from this source.Now after all that I cannot deny that this is a well-made mystery film, the actors are really good, the suspense is there, and it's quite worthy of a higher-than-average review.

New Same-Old,"""Memento"" is tough to pin down.  The gimmick is generally great, but it's the only good thing about the film.Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a former insurance investigator with a condition (""severe anterograde memory dysfunction"", for those of you en route to med school) that leaves him unable to form any memories.  He introduces himself to people he's met dozens of times, he writes down anything he hopes to remember (as basic as where he's driving his car to), and tattoos the real important stuff all over his body.  The only thing he can remember is the home invasion that left him with his condition, and his drive to kill the man who raped and murdered his wife.Given this, it almost makes sense that the film plays in reverse.  The opening scene shows Leonard gunning down a man in cold blood; in the next scene that same man is alive, and we learn a (very little) bit about why Leonard has done this deed (he has a Polaroid of the man; on the back is written ""Don't believe his lies.  He is the one.  Kill him."").  And this is the way the movie plays, with the last line of every scene being a repeat of the first line of the previous scene.It fits quite smartly, since the camera never leaves our hero.  We're stuck in his world.  He has no memory with which to process the events he lives, why should we?  There is no way we could sympathize with this character if ""Memento"" played forward, so reverse it is.Unfortunately, if this story played forward, it would have a hatful of other problems also.  If it didn't follow the film noir playbook to the letter, it could at least keep the viewer working on untangling the confusion.  As it is, however, the viewer is constantly two scenes ahead of the movie.  When each bombshell is dropped about what's really up with the characters (when you boil it down, the film only has three), you're not the least bit surprised.  You've already seen the last of them, so it's generally obvious how they got into the film in the first place, when considered in the context of Teddy's (played cleverly by Joe Pantoliano) death at the beginning/end.  Even if you're not sitting in the theater playing detective, when director Christopher Nolan tells you the real dirt on Leonard/Teddy/Natalie, any surprise you may experience will be tempered with the realization that it couldn't have been any other way.It's been suggested to me that this film requires repeat viewings.  I feel quite the opposite; that the extremely pedestrian nature of the storyline can't be disguised once you're in on it.  Leonard has no memory; you do. As it was, I found this movie pleasant enough, but more for novelty than any more conventional qualities of a film.  2 1/2 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Are you kidding me?,"I know this may become a cult flick...but...this was worse than the theme of the Emperor's New Clothes.  I'm sorry, but I just didn't like anything about it.

"Outstanding, gripping, compelling, thought-provoking","This is a fascinating film that really lives up to the hype. It raises all sorts of questions about personal identity, memory, guilt, truth, and time: for example, if you commit a murder but do not remember committing it, are you still guilty? What does it mean to be 'the same person' that you were last week, or last year? Memento implicitly raises these questions, in a subtle way, without being heavy-handed in the way that the Matrix is, for example. The real genius of this film is that, while it raises all these issues and is genuinely thought-provoking, it manages at the same time to be a truly entertaining, tense, and compelling thriller.The story revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) who, after a blow to the head, suffers from a neurological condition which means he cannot form new memories. He can only remember things for a few seconds, and then they fade away. This means he has to write himself notes, take Polaroids, and even tattoo himself to try and form some kind of continuity in his life. He has no idea who to trust, where he lives, or even where he was five minutes ago. All of this complicates Leonard's quest in life, which is to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, (and caused his own condition) and take his revenge.This is a genuine neurological disorder which I had read about in a piece by Dr Oliver Sacks called 'The Lost Mariner', and I was fascinated when i heard there was a film dealing with the subject. I didn't think it would be possible to really depict this condition in a film, so I was amazed by the skill of the director, Christopher Nolan, who really makes you appreciate the tragic and horrific quality of this condition.It is a stroke of genius on Nolan's part that the film itself runs backwards. Or rather, while each moment of the film runs forwards, we see Leonard's life in a series of small chunks lasting a few minutes, which we see in reversed chronological order. This is an incredible use of film to make you understand the sort of endlessly unknown, frightening world that Leonard lives in. It means the viewer has to make that little bit more effort to understand what is going on, it demands a bit of intelligence and attention.Unlike most Hollywood films, it's not a simple progression from mystery, to disorder, to the solution. It's more complex than that. When someone comes in and speaks to Leonard, we are in a position like his - we don't know if he has met them before, if they are friend or foe, whether or not they are telling him the truth.The pace, direction, script, and acting are all outstanding. All three of the leads (Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano) give excellent, gripping performances. I was impressed that the female lead, Natalie (Moss) is not just used as eye-candy or objectified, but is a fully developed and intriguing character (all too rare in Hollywood films). The cinematography is gorgeous, with great use of colour and light to create atmosphere. The music too adds to the tense and gripping nature of this film.In short, this is one of the best films that I've ever seen, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys films that are a bit different.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jealousy,"There are a few movies that I watch countlessly like addicted. Eternal Sunshine, 21 Grams, Back to the Future, 500 Days of Summer, and this movie. I remember the first time I watched the movie, I was so jealous of Leonard, who keeps forgetting the past and always lives the present. I enjoyed fifteen minutes periods as it made the audience feel empathy for Leonard. Like him, we had short term memory loss, trying to figure out the plot. One of the best movies there is.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Inspired film making,"""Memento"" is fabulous film-making. Writer-Director, Christopher Nolan, creates a world for the audience where we experience the life of his ""hero"", Leonard (Guy Pearce), with more insight than the character himself. Nolan telling the story in a reverse time line (i.e. present to past), his attention to detail, and speculation of the nature of memory make the movie powerful. The movie is truly an amazing viewing experience. Guy Pearce gives a stunning performance as Leonard-- a man who has no short term memory since the murder of his wife, and is seeking vengeance on his wife's murderer. Pearce lends a sense of humanity and sadness to Leonard's quest that is touching. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie is perfect as the mystery woman who is definitely not what she seems to be-- the classic femme fa tale. Carrie-Anne is a versatile and talented actress. Joe Pantoliano is so effective as ""Teddy"", whom according to Leonard, can not be trusted. Nolan just gives us so much to look at in terms of our own lives... the memories we have and the stories we create for ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Unique, brilliant and deep","Ever since I first heard of this film, I was intrigued and wanted to find out if it was really pulled off as well as everyone said. Incredibly enough, despite how sky-high my expectations were for this film, I was pleasantly surprised and my expectations were definitely exceeded. As you probably already know, this whole film runs 'backwards'... meaning that you start by seeing the end, and then go all the way back to the beginning. There's a line in the film that perfectly states the immediate thought that just about anyone has about this idea when they first hear it: ""I always thought the joy of reading a book is not knowing what happens next."" A reasonable assumption, but not always a true one. Especially not when it comes to this film. Because every single scene, up to (but not including) the very last one, starts with the ending of the next one, and ends with the beginning of the previous one. This makes the mystery even more elusive and adds more intensity to the thriller portions of the film. The brilliant and unique reverse time-line is perfectly explained by the main characters condition. This is the best film I've seen in quite a while, and I can't argue with its position on the top 250(as I'm writing this, it's #20). While some might think it's just a typical mystery-thriller with a non-linear time-line thrown in, but it's so much more than that. Like another reviewer points out, it's not what you say, but how you say it. Between every scene in the backwards moving time-line, there is one in black and white that follows a normal time-line. This is great as a break from the scenes moving towards something you already know, and makes the mystery even harder to figure out. The great thing about this film is, not only do we experience the same confusion that the main character does, but we also find out the truth, which he learns at the beginning of the story, at the end of the film. With it comes some nice observations and truths, which I'll let you discover for yourself. I won't jot down the plot here; read a quick summary somewhere or just watch the film and find out about it. I might ruin the surprise for you, a crime greater than most. Everyone deserves to see this film and discover all of it for themselves. I will say, though, that it's brilliant. The pacing is excellent, you're never bored and you never lose interest. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written and credible. Do yourself a favor; know as little about this film as possible. Don't ask anyone about it, don't read about it. Just rent it and watch it, you won't regret it. I recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate fine film-making, but I suppose fans of mysteries, thrillers and/or dramas might enjoy it more than people who aren't interested in those genres. I do suggest that everyone should at least consider this film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is a Groundbreaking Thriller That Challenges the Audience's Perception of Reality,"""Memento"" is a gripping and innovative thriller that challenges the audience's perception of reality. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is a labyrinthine journey through the mind of Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man suffering from short-term memory loss who is trying to piece together the mystery of his wife's murder. The film is told in reverse chronological order, with each scene adding a new layer of complexity to the story. Pearce delivers a tour de force performance, conveying the frustration and desperation of a man trapped in a constantly shifting reality. The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, is equally strong. Nolan's direction is confident and assured, making use of a fragmented narrative structure to create a sense of disorientation and tension.

It is worth a watch but it is not one of Nolan's best films,"Crime movie. One of Nolan's first films, but not one of his best. It has a common characteristic of his movies, time, and its taming. Two burglars break into the protagonist's house in order to rape and kill his wife, unaware that he is also there. Eventually he wakes up and trying to save his wife receives a severe hit to the head. This hit leaves permanent damage to a part of the brain so that it can not store newer memories in the long term, and can only remember current moments in the short term. However, he does his best to gather information with notes everywhere, photos, and even tattoos to investigate the crime and find the criminals. A rather simple scenario, without action or suspense, with only a few actors and seemingly low cost, but the plot was presented backwards to the people. Starting from the end of the plot until it reaches an earlier point where everything is explained, and which obviously because the protagonist does not remember, he does not know what things have happened and what he has done after the accident. All the scenes are presented in reverse order, which is unfortunately confusing and tedious for the viewers. Eventually, although up to a point some suspects appear, in the end the film changes all data completely, with a plot twist.

Tracing Introspection,"First off I would like to add my kudo to the pile of stars that this film has accumulated on imdb.  It is indeed every bit the cinematic brilliance that its rating suggests and ,in fact, I rented it solely on the rating it had received here on the imdb (part of a little experiment that I was doing to see how well my tastes matched up with those of everyone else).  The film is rife with existential commentary which in the end seems to be the point of the film.  For some individuals this film may be difficult to watch as you are forced to trace the main character's bizarre brand of introspection through a sequence of events and narration that are delivered to you in reverse chronological order.  Our minds perceive time in a linear fashion so out of sequence filming can be an absolute disaster as many film makers have discovered.  In Memento any confusion that results from this sequencing technique is absolutely necessary for the movie to be understood (understanding through confusion, sounds kinda zen).  Well, enough said about this film's greatness.  If you haven't already seen Memento give it try.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Plenty to praise about this thriller,"When I first saw Memento in the theatre, I was blown away by the movie.

This movie is **absolutely brilliant** in almost every possible way. Much of this brilliance is often overlooked --> 1.) The subtle, dark humor -- You can pretty quickly overlook the humor if you get too wrapped up in trying to figure out the plot. 2.) The directing and scene sequencing 3.) The acting -- Don't fault the actors for the one-dimensional characters (characters are the only glaring flaw). 4.) The dialogue - Again, something easily overlooked.If you have only seen this movie once, and you're sitting on the fence, see it again.

I love it!,"Memento is an exceptional movie that challenges its audience intellectually without compromise. It doesn't spoon-feed the plot to the less observant viewers; instead, it employs reverse chronology to keep them hooked and coming back for more.

I had an incredibly immersive experience.

The script for this movie is pure genius, and Memento wouldn't have worked half as well if it was told in chronological order.Memento is not just another average ""who has done it"" flick, but with the non-chronological storyline and the amnesia-riddled protagonist, it stands out as being a uniquely brilliant film that staggers the mind of its audience as they uncover new information and begin to learn the truth.I found Memento to be manipulative, engrossing, and staggering to watch.

"An absorbing, complex film noir that is marred by pretentiousness","If ever a film could be described as too clever by half it is ""Memento"". An undoubtedly entertaining thriller about revenge, it is a technically accomplished film noir that is over- reliant on its dominating gimmick: its reverse storytelling structure. That gimmick cannot, however, conceal the impression that, while it is a good film, ""Memento"" is really no better than many other films of its kind.Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, and based on a short story by Jonathan Nolan (any relation, I wonder?), ""Memento"" has all the accoutrements of classic film noir: a seedy California setting; seemingly lonely and emotionally disturbed characters; motels that exploit their customers; and murder as a pivotal part of the plot. It tells the story of Leonard (Guy Pearce), whose wife called him Lenny but who likes to be addressed by everyone else by his full first name. Leonard is an ex-insurance fraud investigator. He has short-term memory difficulties - he knows who he is and can recall everything about his life before the incident in which his wife was killed. However, he has been unable to make any new memories since that traumatic event. His failure to prevent the rape and murder of his wife, and a knock on the head that he sustained during that incident, have induced in him a sort of reverse amnesia and left him with a single-minded determination for revenge. Hampered by his inability to retain new information, Leonard resorts to having his body tattooed (by himself in some instances; by a professional tattooist in others) with vital pieces of information that will assist him in the search for his wife's killer. He also takes Polaroid photos and writes notes to himself as a means of recording other important details that will help him, e.g. the location of the motel at which he is staying. Leonard is aided (or perhaps thwarted?) in his efforts by Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), a barmaid with a dodgy boyfriend, and by the mysterious Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Natalie is the classic femme fatale beloved of all such films!So, the basic plot - the need to avenge a terrible crime - is not particularly original. But the memory issue is. That, however, pales into insignificance when set beside the highly unusual structure of the narrative of the film. Time appears to move backwards and forwards in chunks in almost equal measure in a complex presentation of the chronology of events that is sometimes difficult to follow. The viewer needs all his wits and attentive powers about him to work out exactly what is going on and when. There is the added complication of a seemingly unimportant sub-plot concerning someone whom Leonard was investigating for possible insurance fraud before his wife's demise and who was apparently suffering the same memory difficulties that now plague Leonard.""Memento"" is an absorbing and entertaining film. It is beautifully acted by all concerned. Guy Pearce is superb as Leonard. He appears in virtually every scene in the film. His performance is such that the viewer cares about him and his crusade to avenge his wife's death. The film is well directed. And it is skilfully edited, something that is crucial to the plausibility of the plot, given the film's unusual structure. The problem is though that ""Memento"" is at times overrun by a sense of cleverness, knowingness and pretentiousness. I have no idea why, for instance, a number of crucial scenes (they usually involve Leonard on the telephone to an unidentified policeman who seems to be providing him with unreliable information) are filmed in monochrome. And while the reverse chronology of the film is unusual it does not really enhance what I think is one of the main messages of the film: which is that memory is a tantalisingly fragile aspect of human life, and that what and whom we trust are governed by all sorts of things beyond our control. So what we have here is an entertaining and fascinating film noir that, for all its technical accomplishment and wizardry, is just that: an enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable, movie. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worst movie ever!,"I sincerely don't understand why so many people find that movie so good and have ranked it so high.

The Stopped-Time Man,"A man who cannot create new memories cannot move forward in time. For Leonard Shelby, time stopped the instant he suffered head trauma while trying to save his wife during a robbery-rape. Unable to retain any new memories, Leonard will never move past that horrific event in which he lost his wife, his home, and everything else except an all-consuming drive for revenge on those responsible.There's reason for enthusiasm and hyperbole from folks who see MEMENTO: it's a film that harkens back to the 1970s, a time of well-written, mind-blowing experiences that become part of the viewer, like an actual event, a memory. MEMENTO is that modern rarity, a character-driven story that refuses to flinch, and viewers appreciate it. After all, in this decade of putrid, talentless filmmaking, where would movies (American anyway) be without Tarantino's Jules Winnfield, or Mr. White? Or the Coens' Dude? Soderbergh's limey Wilson? Or Keyser Soze? Characters with force of will, who follow their natures and dominate space and time, as real people met, inawed-by, or feared.Leonard Shelby's story is ingrained in truth, and believability. A two-dimensional creation lives and breathes. He becomes part of the viewer.There is nothing worse than the Hell of Leonard Shelby, a man cursed to a single moment in time, his wife's rape-murder, and his inability to even remember whatever revenge he may take. The concept alone guarantees this film is unforgettable, but it is also the writing, the direction of Nolan, and the performance of Pierce.I'd like to correct the misconception of the intrinsic fault in this film, pointed out by many critics, that Leonard would be unable to remember he has a ""condition"" of complete short-term memory loss, since he should not remember anything after his injury and does not have a tattoo on his body, say, that states the fact of it, so he'd understand where, what and how he is where he is.Leonard does indeed have this ""trigger"" for his understanding of his ""condition"". It is on his hand, SAMMY JANKIS. Sammy's story, part of Leonard's pre-injury life, is an automatic symbol for everything Leonard is going through, as the two men share almost the same condition, and more. Leonard sees the name and remembers, and that's the answer to that.MEMENTO is a complete puzzle, a sequence of nightmare that is inescapable, a world in which a man who stops moving in time becomes the anchor for corrupt cops and lost women, where answers tear up bodies and minds like bullets. Leonard is a living weapon of revenge, andlives in a perpetual state of recoil, that stunned silence between the just-fired and the impact. An incredible film.",,Anonymous,Mystery

The story is told in reverse and every scene came after the next. The events being told backwards is not a disadvantage as it only gives the viewers an opportunity to know only what Leonard knows.

Jonathan did it in Westworld just as striking. Christopher probably even overdid it in Tenet. Thus, their early success deserves to be mentioned ever again.The theme of amnesia is nearly always fascinating because it opens so many plot possibilities. And provides an opportunity to theorize about some philosophical questions. Can a man be held responsible for his actions, also in legal sense, if he has no memories of his criminal actions? Does this man even have a constant personality of his own, if he lacks one of the most fundamental preconditions for a stable personality? Does the revenge lead to self-destruction - or can it be the strongest element which keeps you alive when almost all else seems to have been lost?At the same time, one cannot help but enjoy the visual side of Memento. The black-and-white scenes, the color scenes in deep blue, brownish and golden tones stand for various time sequences. One has the best background for the quest of the hero in a perfect grey suit, who continuously expands his complex web of photos, notes and tattoos. Pursuing the ghost of his former self, a deceitful, flowing, elusive memory which is possibly mocking him.In short, this is an ideal neo-noir, with an intricate detective story, a very classical femme fatale and slowly building suspense. A non-linear plot, of some moments of which even Tarantino wouldn't be ashamed. The final plot twist is absolutely breathtaking, far more complicated than you could have guessed during the most part of the screen time. Almost impossible to copy, although there were decent films with similar twists in the recent years.... And remember just one simple thing: you certainly may be right if you don't believe the people around you, because they may well be using you. But can you believe all that which you say or write yourself?",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A disturbing concept well exploited.,For anyone who forgets things (who doesn't) this film presents a disturbing view of workings of the human mind. You'll need to pay attention thoughout and most especially during the flashbacks the final scenes.

The film filmed backwards,"8.6? Wow. Memento is without a doubt one of the most unique movies I have ever seen, and the acting along with the screen play is great. Guy Pierce is a terrific actor and this is the first film I have seen him in. I've heard a lot about Memento and one of my girlfriends told me to rent this movie without even thinking about it. This truly was a good film. I will never doubt it of that. It keeps you thinking and on your toes of who's good and who is bad.Because Guy's character, Leonard, has short term memory, he is constantly writing down notes about who to trust and not trust. He is on a mission to find the man who raped and murdered his wife and kill him. All over his body he had tattoo's that would remind him of what to do next. He has Polaroids of people to remind them of who they are, he explains his ""condition"" several times. Causing people either to be kind or take advantage of that.It's the film that keeps you guessing and is a great new type of film noir. Despite I could think of a few more movies better than this one, I can still see why people love this film so much. It does deserve to be on the top 250, just not so sure yet if the top 30. But maybe I need to watch it again, still I will never doubt that this was a great movie.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Candidate for Worst Movie ever,"Never thought I would see a more terrible movie than 'The Piano' but this was it. Now, I have nothing against films that backtrack - sometimes this is used in films to very good effect - but what we see in 'Memento' is just plain ridiculous. Boring scenes are repeated ad infinitum as the film constantly goes back, then forward to scenes we've seen already, and then go further back only to then run forward into those same scenes again. This is not clever, it may be different, but it's also stupid. Now, all this might even be bearable if you feel any empathy or sympathy with the main character, or anybody, or anything in this. No such luck with 'Memento'. The only positive emotion I felt in the whole thing was when the main character was running down the street and couldn't remember why. At least that was funny. The only other plus for the film - at least it was in color.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Perhaps this generation's ""Point Blank""...","""Everyone complains of his memory, and no one complains of his judgement.""--Francois, Duc de La Rochefoucauld, ""Reflections; or Sentences and Moral Maxims"", 1678The above is a very good quotation to keep in mind as one watches ""Memento"". Believe me, it all makes sense in the final context.My main attraction to this movie was Guy Pierce (whom I became acquainted with via ""L.A. Confidential"") and the nature of the story. Having heard a little of short term memory impairment via a ""20/20"" show long, long ago (as I recall, I believe the particular instances cited were the result of a disease transmitted by eating mussels), I thought that it would be interesting to see how a mystery was being investigated by a man with the same problem. My reaction was the same that I got from watching ""The Limey"". It was NOTHING like I was expecting.The opening sequence sets the tone straight away, up the hill backwards, to borrow a phrase from David Bowie. Like a surreal slideshow, we flash backward and forward from the beginning and end points of Lenny's week(?) to figure out basically what the hell is going on (one of Nolan's smartest moves was to film the earliest sequences in black and white and the time just prior to the opening in color to reduce audience confusion). At first, I believed Lenny because he seemed so calm, rational, and assured in spite of his obvious handicap. SURELY he'd know what he's talking about. (bitter chuckle) More the fool me.The whole of his world is constricted to five minutes at a time. Five minutes where every incident, every insult, every indignity that is heaped on him is flensed from his mind like a stain exposed to bleach unless he considers it important enough to write down. How could one possibly trust such a man who's forgotten why he's running away from a man with a gun (indeed, forgotten that he's being chased and not chasing), that his wife was called a whore by a woman who is supposedly helping him, or that said woman spat into a tankard that he then thoughtlessly drinks from...all of it instantly forgotten at the end of his memory cutoff? Nolan deserves additional credit for not letting Lenny off the hook at the end. Yeah, we can see that he's been used by a few folks, but he's no innocent himself.In a weird way, it reminds me of ""Point Blank"", another one-of-its-kind crime film with some very unorthodox storytelling methods. It had the same sort of flat characterizations (not necessarily a fault, to my mind; watch one of the many versions of ""Hamlet"" if you want characters), the feeling of being unstuck in time, and a protagonist with rigid but flawed moral compass. But there are important differences. ""Point Blank"" was like living someone's life the same way Kurt Vonnegut wrote ""Slaughterhouse Five"". ""Memento"" is like watching a couple of cars start at opposite ends of a long street and end up hitting each other in a head-on collision. The resulting smash-up, as well as that last, casual line, will haunt me for the weeks the way ""Sunset Boulevard"" did. Watch it and see if it doesn't do the same for you.",,Anonymous,Mystery

A phenomenal backtracking mystery!!,"I've always been wanting to see Memento, most of all because it got an 8.6 rating and I heard it's one of the best mysterious films. So I finally got to see the movie last night. This 113 min long film was worth watching. The backtracking motion of Leonard's days trying to avenge his wife's death was extremely original. Christopher Nolan used excellent directing and the script writer was brilliant. Guy Pearce, I thought played a great performance as Leonard who has short term memory loss and has to use notes everyday on camera photos to get back what he's looking for. I thought it was a very surprising role for Guy Pearce. The movie does get confusing, a bit. I would focus really hard on it to see what's really going on because you might not like the movie if your not paying a whole lot of attention to it. Overall, an excellent mystery that I highly recommend!Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No Spoilers - Momento Film Review,"I have seen a few Christopher Nolan films before, but never one like this. I am typically not a fan of movies with a nonlinear screenplay, but this one had me hooked from start to finish. Maybe it was the ever changing use of black and white and color, and beginning a scene with how a previous one ended, helping to tie them together, that did it for me. I am not entirely sure to be honest, but all I know for sure is that this film is brilliant.This movie revolves around the main character, Leonard Shelby and his hunt to find the killer and rapist of his wife. In contrast to this, he has a disability with his memory, known to be anterograde amnesia, which keeps him from forming any new memories prior to his wife's death. He must now use his skills through notes and tattoos to help him solve his case. Throughout this story he meets several people, such as Teddy, Natalie and more, and it is his job to determine if they can be trusted.I believe it is the cinematography of this film that caused it to carry itself so strongly. This is a film that could easily become confusing, but the use of the black and white for a chronological order of events and color for events happening in reverse order. Personally, I found this to be clever and interesting, seeing as even though these opposing scenes do not happen in the same order as one another, they line up perfectly and prompt the progression of the story. I do believe the use of these scenes align perfectly with the main issue the characters in the movie face: Leonard's memory loss.Not only was the plot phenomenal, but everything else that went into the film was seemingly on point to me. The acting was amazing in every aspect, leaving the audience hooked. Every piece of clothing was extremely helpful in the development of the story, from scene to scene, leaving viewers such as myself wondering what the reasoning for this was from the beginning. I also found repetition in music based on certain scenes, which helped me to put things in order.From this film, I took the idea that not everything is as it seems and the mind can be deceiving. This sounds vague, but you would have to watch the movie to see what I mean. I do believe that after viewing, you will look at things more clearly... just hopefully not in the form of notes as tattoos.I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good brain stump or mind twist essentially. Or, if you are looking for a movie that will simply keep you on your toes, I can guarantee you have found it. Christopher Nolan did a beautiful job in the portrayal of Momento, and now I will forever wish I could just watch it for the first time again.Overall rating: 9.5/10 stars!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent directing!,"One of the absolute top movies ever.Unique in the way that the director really lets you in on how the main character feels, how he sees the world and how one gets to think exactly like him. No other movie is even close to do this as good as Memento. It's such a simple idea, that you can't help but wondering how no-one hasn't thought of it before. The whole feeling of ""Why? What's happening? Who am I?"" really gets to you and leaves you with a slight feeling of helplessness and apathy after the last scene. The performance of the actors may not be the best ever, but they're definitely not bad -It's, as said above, more the idea that makes this movie special.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
terrific idea; poor execution,"the idea for this movie was absolutely amazing, but the actual storyline in the end was not the best.  it seemed to me that the writers ran out of ideas and just slapped an ending onto it.  that's very unfortunate because up to that point, i thought it was an excellent movie.  it's still definitely worth seeing though; i probably only rate it a 6 because i was so disappointed in the ending.  i can certainly understand most people rating it around an 8.  that's that.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

By the time the movie was over I thought to myself wow whoever made the storyline, is very smart. The whole movie starts at the end and works its way to the beginning.

It has been so long since I've seen a movie where the story is enough so that I don't have to say, ""and the cinematography helped"", or, ""the acting helped"".  I think that the Nolan brothers could have gotten monkeys to play the roles and used their camcorders to shoot and I still would have been walking away saying WOW (people tell me I'm a bit of an exaggerator, but you know what I mean). In a time where you cannot turn to a radio station without hearing some sort of sampling, a time where a trip to the movies is to see a remake of this old T.V. show or that old movie, or just plain old sequels, it was a breath of fresh air to see a movie with such a plot and such a way to tell it.

Life is like a boomerang; whatever you throw out there will always return.,"Memento perhaps is one of the most unusual movies I've had a chance to watch.Its events go backwards where each short episode reveals the story from the end till the beginning because the main character has anterograde amnesia. His memory works only for 15 minutes and then blank, erase and rewind..Honestly, you can talk about this movie forever, so great it is. I would just like to mention a few curious facts:
1. Dynamic trio. The reason why I decided to watch this totally unknown movie in now distant 2000 were these 3 names: Carrie-Anne Moss (aka Trinity), Joe Pantoliano (aka Cypher) and Guy Pearce (didn't play in The Matrix). For me, as a big Matrix fan, it was huge.2. It might probably sound funny now, but back in 2000, no one ever heard of film director Christopher Nolan. In fact, Memento was his first feature movie that was released in theaters. Who could have thought at that time, what a tremendous figure in the movie industry Nolan would soon become?3. The movie has an absolutely stunning script which keeps you engaged every single second. And it has a totally unexpected ending. By the way, the script is based on Nolan's brother's short novel (what a talented family!).And what is more important is that the movie conveys a deep philosophical wisdom. Life is like a boomerang; whatever you throw out there will always return. And sometimes the fate can be quite ironic.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The opening parts of the movie is how you would normally see a movie end.

Then it will go back to another flashback that happens right before the previous flashback and ends where the previous flashback began.  Sound confusing?

Greatest Movie in Years,"Memento, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, is one film that takes the viewer on a ride they will never forget. Beginning with an ingenious and original view of a Polaroid fading instead of developing, where everything goes backwards for a minute. The movie has a lot of great dialogue and great set-up points, told in a unique way that helps you deal with what the character is going through.Leonard Shelby, a man on a vendetta to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, has no short-term memory. He relies on notes and tattoos and photographs to get him through finding out who murdered his wife. But as the film progresses at ten minute intervals that go for ten minutes and then goes on for the ten minutes before that ten, you start to realize that all is not as it seems.The screenplay and the editing were nominated for Academy Awards, and the film was greater than that to deserve just two nominations. Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Mosse do excellent jobs in their roles, breathing life into these rich and detailed characters. Christopher Nolan is a genius to be reckoned with, and Memento is a movie that will live on as one of the best ever filmed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Is ignorance truly bliss?,"The first time I watched Pulp Fiction, it took me a bit of time to fully grasp its nonlinear storytelling by trying to figure out when each event occurred to be able to know the occurrence of events chronologically. Now having watched Memento, I have come to realize that despite Pulp Fiction's unique narrative, Tarantino made a story that is still easy to grasp.At first I didn't get the memo that Memento presents its story in reverse chronological order, and having figured that out in a few scenes in, it felt like I was falling behind in a race, struggling to catch up. And not only that, but the flashbacks scenes are shown in regular chronological order to make the pace even more insanely hectic for me. I think it is safe to say that everyone can benefit from watching this movie more than once to piece everything together, if one loses track the first time watching it. My first viewing, to say the least, was mindboggling, but thanks to subtitles and having a bit of patience with my second viewing, I managed to tie up a lot of loose ends that were beginning to drive me crazy.And that's one of the things that makes Nolan such a talented director. When you watch Memento, you have to literally change the way you watch movies to grasp it. It is not a stylistic choice just for the sake of being innovative. Nolan utilizes this reverse storytelling technique to execute the drama in a very unique way, having the same effect as putting a puzzle together to know what the full picture looks like. As we go back into the past, that is when we discover the answer to the mysteries of what is really going on underneath it all, as opposed to a conventional movie where we get the bigger picture of the situation as the story progresses in regular chronological order, followed by a conclusion. Whereas the ending of Pulp Fiction occurs during the middle of all the chaos, we get our true conclusion to Memento at the beginning where everything started. Whereas we know the destiny of every character with Pulp Fiction, there is a bit of uncertainty as to what will happen next for the protagonist.What I love about Memento is that it perfectly encapsulates the strange feeling of deja vu. While the protagonist is unaware of everything that happens to him, we the viewer begin to see the full picture in the last scene in the movie and we come to a shocking revelation of the events we just witnessed. I don't want to elaborate more and run the risk of potentially spoiling anything, but all I can say is that this is one of the most innovative mystery thrillers concocted by Nolan, and the subtle film noir influences gives it an extra charm. Watching this movie, you wouldn't predict he would he even direct the batman movies and that shows not only Nolan's diversity but also his versatility as a director.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

No other ""who-dunnit"" film or mystery film that claims to be a puzzling movie - none of them are as puzzling or mysterious as Memento.The film places the audience member in the shoes of the protagonist: Leonard Shelby (Guy Pierce). He is on a mission to find his wife's murderer. The big problem is that he has short term memory, and he must take notes and leave himself clues to find the man he seeks.The film tells the story in reverse chronological order. the end of the story is the first thing we witness, and the big twist, the most crucial part of the story which explains countless details, happens at the end of the film.Confusing at all? you don't know the half of it.I strongly recommend this movie.

Memorable doesn't always equal great,"Many movie lovers call this a 21st-century return to film noir, and I guess it is. It's a clever, even admirable film in the way it is constructed. Pardon me for not enjoying it more.Guy Pearce stars as Leonard (don't call him Lenny) Shelby, a fellow hot on the trail of his wife's killer...if only he can remember more than five minutes ago. It's an intriguing concept, to what extent personality and identity are beholden to the brain's ability to make new memories, and you have to give mad props to the filmmakers for dreaming this one up, only they didn't bother to create any sympathetic characters for their drama, or a story worth caring about beyond the novel ""story-backwards-through-unfolding-plotting"" means of narration. You have to watch the movie more than once, perhaps several times, before you begin to realize what happened. But when you do, it feels like a cheat, because without the gimmick of the constant memory-lapses, the story itself isn't the sort that would hold you very long.All the acting in this film is quite good, in a soulless '90s way. Pearce seems to have borrowed some voice inflections from `L.A. Confidential' co-star Kevin Spacey. He makes for a good anti-hero in many ways, playing his emotions down rather than up, a good choice that makes him a more compelling cypher. His short-term memory loss doesn't seem to have affected his workout regimen, however, nor his hair-treatment routine. But you shouldn't try penalizing movies for small logic lapses, if the movie makes you think hard enough about it after for you to figure out those lapses.The always superb Joe Pantoliano is especially interesting as Teddy Gammell, a sort of helpful or not character who may or may not be a cop, and knows something about the man who killed Lenny's wife, or else maybe killed her himself. He's amusing, anyway, though not always comprehendible in his motives, either before or after you've seen it a few times. Still, a plus. So is Matrix hottie Carrie-Anne Moss, another possible helper or bad guy. Like Gammell, her character Natalie is no easy read, even after repeat viewings, and much of the fun in watching `Momento' again is trying to guess at what's going on inside her head in a given moment. She should keep the sunglasses on, though. Those cold pale blues of hers give me the creeps.A lot to give away here, and I won't do it, even if the backwards-narrative makes such reticence impossible in reviewing the movie. The film plays off so many angles so well you can't help but admire the ride, or not want to spoil it, however much you may or may not actually enjoy it. Suffice to say it's as clever as everyone tells you, but you may not come away liking the bottom-line story as much as you thought. The mystery is hardly that involving (think ""Law And Order Special Victims Unit"" if you were watching it on drugs), the characters interesting but nobody you'd care enough to light a ciggie for let alone spend time with, and the final resolution as nihilistic as anything outside a Beckett play.""Memory's not perfect,"" Leonard notes. ""It's not even that good."" Especially his, though he still seems able to spring a few traps. If only I cared more about them, or him. Good last line, though, one of the best, right up there with ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" and ""Tomorrow is another day."" (Which isn't far off point, come to think of it.)Yes it's very good. No, it's not great. It's not in my top 200, let alone top 20. But if you meet Natalie at the bar, be sure not to tell her Jimmy Grantz sent you.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A momento if you understand memento,"(Karthik Narayan) Before we start, note the spelling  its M-E-M-E-N-T-O and not MOMENTO, as I had thought! Now let's start this movie review: Imagine having a jigsaw puzzle in hand, and you don't have a clue what completes it. You don't have all the pieces required to finish it. There is no picture in your mind, and you are left to search for your answers. What do you do? To what sounds like a treasure hunt and a jigsaw puzzle combined, add a strong flavor of revenge and you get a masterly movie all set before your home screens! All you need to do is get the DVD and watch it. Maybe over and over again, like I have been doing The movie begins with the end and the end marks the beginning of the story (did I say that right?). Yes, that is how this movie unravels itself. The plot thickens as you move backwards (pun intended) and when all the pieces are slowly knitted together, the beginning (or is it the ending) is quite beautiful.The alternating between the Black/White and the color every ten minutes or so makes it all the more compelling to watch. And how do you watch this movie? Ideally it should be shown from back to front to understand.This isn't a murder mystery movie  its more of a thriller that takes so many twists and turns as you move towards the beginning (Oh no, not again. Somebody stop me) that you never get enough of watching it once.The movie doesn't end telling you what to make of it. You have to draw your own conclusions and decipher your own riddles. When the movie brilliantly closes with the credits, it leaves you wondering about reality and what you had been watching all along.As you still can't get over Guy Pearce's (the protagonist, Leonard) handsome looks, also note that he has a blank look on his face most of the time. That says it all  he looks helpless. You don't know how to react to his confused state of mind  you get stuck between 3 things  whether to slap him and bring him to shape; or feel pity for him hoping he would recover. The other thing that keeps us interested is how to crack the case. How would he find revenge, and how would he remember it? All confusions and the ""don't trust anybody"" funda psychologically affects us as well as we are left with no choice but to not trust what we see and hear of other characters.Christopher Nolan has directed the movie excellently, with an adapted screenplay based on the short story by Jonathan Nolan (are they related?), that keeps us all on the edge of our seats. This movie carries more mystery and as each piece falls in place.But the first half of the movie makes no sense at all; you really get things moving along only after the removal of the tattoos on Guy's body. Overall, this is not a movie which you will appreciate if you want to watch a fun movie. It needs your attention and you get engrossed in the thick of action.There are some scenes which could have been done away with, for example, the hotel scene where Pearce calls for an escort, but it all adds up to the confusion, so I am not to complain.Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie still carries her looks of Matrix, and though there isn't a meaty role in the movie for her, so she does well.Joe Pantoliano as Teddy steals most of the scenes with his corny jokes and at one point of time, you can't help loving his casual approach to the whole thing.The acting is brilliant, the settings and camera work are good. The music by David Julyan is racy and keeps the pulse ticking faster with every scene. I'm sure I would be hearing a lot of and from him.Simply for creativity and keeping the adrenaline and brain cells ticking all the time, this movie deserves great accolades. This is an all time classic that I would recommend to test your thought process. If I were to put up an all time list of best movies, this would definitely find its place in the top 25. Rating  8.5/10.As for the book, if you ever get hold of it, keep me informed!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterpiece movie,"This masterpiece that Nolan created in the unnatural manipulation of time in it has now become my favorite movie because without burning events, it is deep and calm, you delve into it as if you were the hero. It is light and you only see the shadow of the one you love and you cannot hug him or talk to him and this deep romance was also in part of the movie ""Inception.""

My favorite movie - ever !!,"I saw Memento at the premiere at Venice Film Festival in 2000. I always liked independent films because the low budget and the will-to-do typical of young cinematographers is often bewildering. In Memento these peculiarities catch the spectators towards a mind-blowing labyrinth, fitter to a puzzle-master than common people. The editing is (I suppose) unique in cinema history and fortunately very little directors tried to double this trick for their movies; nevertheless, on the other hand, the stratagem of short-term memory was abused in 2000s' cinema and that's a pity.Carrie-Ann Moss is a gem. Her character Natalie is a mine of perfidy; her solely eyes sting as needles and show how failing can be a friendship (Teddy and the porter too !!), taking easily advantage from a weak person. How many times, in real life, did we feel like Lenny, even without his ""incident"" ?You need at least two or three re-runs to understand it, nobody can do it with less, but that's not an handicap, it's such a motivation to sketch out a conversation between supporters/detractors and ""what really happened"". Thouhgt Nolan in an interview said that story is terribly simple, I suppose he said it as a provocation because everybody can prove it's not like that (Jimmy for example, the connection of Teddy and Lenny before...etc).A pearl in cinema art.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Utterly insane story + fragmented time line = one of the most amazing thrillers ever,"Without a doubt I have never watched a film that has engaged me more than Memento. The story is utterly insane, the time line is all over the place  yet it proves to be one of the most effective and entertaining thrillers available to date.The film starts off with a bizarre shooting of an unknown individual being shown in reverse. As soon as the credits finish the film starts off from the ending. We soon learn that the shooter Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffered a large blow to the head on the same night his wife was raped and murdered. Everything leading up to the murder he can remember, but anything afterwards he can't remember. This is a superb spin on the clichéd amnesia thrillers, where in this case, the hero cannot form new memories as opposed to not being able to recollect old ones. Leonard is out to solve his wives' murder, but in doing so he must use a series of tattoos and photos to collect evidence and solve the mystery. Along the way he appears to be manipulated by a cop who seems to have a strange interest in him (Joe Pantoliano) and a mysterious bartender who seems to know more than she's leading on (Carrie-Anne Moss). But the real challenge is in judging, who is genuine and who is false?The inspiring thing about this film, is that it's told in reverse; the events are told roughly in five minute intervals playing back from the end and working towards the beginning. By the time the film finishes you will be questioning yourself as to the truth about Lenny. This is one of the most original characteristics about this film; it is all open to personal interpretation. You seem to find yourself pausing the film every few minutes just to try and comprehend exactly what is happening. Definitely a web of mystery worth solving.When you finally reach the end of this masterpiece, and the ending has been revealed you will be very satisfied. The only thing I can recommend afterwards is purchase the DVD! Behold there is an option to watch the film in the correct order, much less taxing on the brain. Yet this film will always remain an utter classic!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Remember to see this movie!,"While this film is about someone with no short-term memory, it's very difficult for us to forget it. The plot is built in a backwards-linear way (as Christopher Nolan puts it) and this helps the viewer to actually get into the world of Leonard. What I like most is that you can't be based on a single thing! Additionally, every other aspect (apart from the truly original and captivating story) of Memento is great.

This is literally the BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"Are you bored of all the ""normal"" movies coming out today, with all their simplistic plots and all the twists you can see coming a mile away? Do you like a movie that is intelligent, unpredictable, and makes you think both during the movie and weeks after? Then this movie is for you.It is a groundbreaking film that is totally out of the box. It is about a man who suffers from a condition that makes him forget things that just recently happened. Therefore, he writes notes on his body and on photographs so he can remember things. However, many of these notes are vague because he didn't have much time, and he ends up doing some things that he doesn't even know why he wanted to do it.The really crazy thing about this movie, though, is the way it is told. One timeline in the movie starts at the end of the story and works backwards to the middle; the other one starts at the beginning and goes to the middle. The ""main"" storyline, the one that goes backwards, is the best because it always keeps you guessing and wondering why he wrote certain notes. There are many plot twists along the way.So, basically what I'm saying is that if you haven't watched this movie, you should definitely try it.

"Memento...One of those ""Wow"" movies!","Where do I begin? They should make a genre of movies for ones like this and just call them ""Wow Movies.""

It is a film for the thinking person, one which requires your full attention. The plot (and the way it is portrayed) is one of a kind. Memento starts at the end, and progressively works toward the beginning. Confused? The movie is backwards (Wondering what I mean by that? See for yourself!). Guy Pearce gives a striking performance, one that will leave you wondering ""How did this guy not win the Best Actor Academy Award?!"" Pearce's character, Leonard Shelby, suffers from a short-term memory loss disease. To remember things, he must tattoo notes all over his body, and take photographs of every last person and thing he encounters. Pearce's performance will make any viewer believe this guy really can't remember a damn thing. He is that good. The movie is full of twists, turns, surprises, you name it. If you think a character is good, chances are they are bad. And if you think someone is really trying to help Leonard, well let's just say they might not be as sympathetic as you seem.

Reclusive and a bit eccentric, the story follows Guy Pearce backwards, from the opening scene where Leonard murders a man - all the way to how the entire fiasco began.Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantalino are excellent back-ups. Who is an ally, who is an enemy? Who is there to help Leonard in his quest to locate the man who raped and murdered his wife? Who is there simply to exploit his condition for their own personal gain? These things question you, pull you, and drag you throughout this movie.We are taken into the mind of a man who can't distinguish from one moment to the next.

"More than A Backwards Gimmick - Addictive Puzzle, Great Acting and Look","""Memento"" is for fans of ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Croupier,"" and I've only ever found one person that didn't like either of those.Going one better than the circular story-telling of ""Pulp Fiction"" or re-playing of"" Run Lola Run,"" ""Memento"" takes us inside the head of an investigator with no short-term memory who develops various crutches to continue his vengeful search. I've been a fan of Guy Pearce since his Australian TV days, on into ""Priscilla"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" and this allows him even more range.For us to experience time the way he does, the story unravels through backwards scenes; the technique is indicated from the opening shot where a graphic Polaroid photo fades while being shook, instead of the expected getting brighter and clearer -- a visual metaphor for the protagonist as well. After that, the story isn't on literal rewind; instead we see the scenes in reverse order of how they happened; onion-like we see how the character ended up getting to the scene just before. If Humphrey Bogart's character thought ""The Big Sleep"" tough to figure out, this one is even more convoluted.Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano are terrific, and not relying on some of their tics from other movies and TV shows, as the folks who may or may not be lying to or manipulating the protagonist.I'm not 100% sure how all the pieces fit together and went to see it again a week later -- and came away with different interpretations.

"Profound, in my opinion","My husband & I are the legal guardians of a multiply handicapped young man. One of his handicaps is short-term memory damage. Sometimes a passing comment sticks like super glue in his mind, but mostly, a LOT of repetition is needed to allow him to remember events, objects, and people. His time frame is different, too; time for him goes verrry sllloooowwwwwllllyyy. I firmly believe that he doesn't lie, but he has a great need to fill in memory gaps, sometimes with very surprising stories. Therefore, because of my tie with this young man, I have an abiding interest in human memory.I have come to see how very personal and ephemeral memory truly is. Concepts like ""truth"" and ""fact"" are plastic even at the best of times, but in memory-damaged brains, can become downright syrupy. Time can become meaningless. I think this film captures these predicaments very well. The reverse editing of the film shows Pearce's character, Shelby, moving from shakier ground backward to firmer. That must be what short term memory damage must feel like - shaky ground.I had last seen Guy Pearce in ""Adventures of Pricilla, Queen of the Desert"", so this was, of course, a very different role. Luckily, unlike my guardianee, Shelby had learned to read before his brain trauma or the search for the criminal would have been moot! Pearce did a great job displaying all the emotions and conflict Shelby went through to try to accomplish his very difficult task.

Images to be Remembered,"How Can I Heal If I Can't Feel Time?MEMENTO Director: Christopher Nolan Year: 2000 Starring: Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano, Carrie Ann Moss""Once is right for this movie. Confusion is the state we are intended to be in."" - Roger EbertI looked over our top 100 list and saw my favorite movie so I thought it would be perfect to make my own review. Memento didn't have the clout movies like the Passion did when it came out, although it didn't do bad at box offices it wasn't played everywhere thereby not many people heard of it. My story with Memento began with an episode of ""Cribs"" where a celebrity recommended it. Then a few years later IMDb had it #14 on it's greatest list. I had to see it after reading about it.Memento is a thriller defined. Something Hitchcock or Kubrick would probably praise. The plot in simplicity isn't large. A man with brain damage trying to avenge his wife's killer/rapist. But Nolan defeats this slight flaw by complicating it without changing what happens, but when it happens. We open with a Polaroid being held of a dead man, shot. Slowly the polaroid undevelopes and then is returned into the camera, your rewind button is not busted. We then witness the reverse murder of a mysterious man. Then CUT, we go to a B&W scene of a man explaining his condition, setting the basis for his problem. then CUT, to a color scene, right before the murder, showing how it was led to, then after it happens again in forward, cut to another B&W scene, this is the pattern of the movie.The movie follows the plot of Leonard Shelby, dubbed ""the ultimate protagonist"" by some editorials. Lenny is a man who witnessed his wife rapped and murder, he kills the man, and is hit by another which renders him handicapped. Leonard cannot remember things for more then 15-30 minutes. He tattoos important facts on him about the killer, etc. and carries polaroids to remember places/people. The story starts with the end and climaxes with the first thing that happened [realistically].Nolan constructed it greatly with the use of BW scenes and color. And how he meets these scenes [BW ones take place before the color ones]. There are many interpretations, especially people who like to get mental. Unlike Ebert, I think there should be multiple viewings because it makes the movie greater and you see the new things you missed. Nolan means for us to identify with the main character, by showing us his story through HIS perspective. Confusion. We start with the end with ignorance as we learn more of each character, their different intentions and even then they could be reversed if you pay attention but I will not spoil it.In my opinion Nolan made a masterpiece and it is at least within the top 10 or 15 greatest ever. The parts are not over or underacted. Hell, I even hear that Memento is shown in Psychology courses as a character study. Nolan tested directed in Following and perfected it in Memento.10/10 #1 Favorites",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Memento, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, uses unconventional narrative and filmic techniques to explore the disoriented mind of its main character.","Trying to save his wife as she is brutally attacked by a stranger, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pierce: L.A. Confidential) receives a violent blow on the head and experiences brain damage. The trauma results in anterograde memory-loss, a rare disorder defined by the inability to form new memories. An insurance investigator who once trusted his perceptions in order to distinguish between people's false and legitimate claims, Leonard must now cope with a condition that challenges his ability to perceive reality, and which presses him to trust others. Nevertheless, Leonard is driven by a commitment to capture his wife's murderer, for the last memory he does retain recalls the traumatic incident. Relying entirely on written notes, Polaroid snapshots, and tattoos, which tell him --rather than remind him-- what car he drives, what motel he is staying in, what his new confidant ""Natalie"" (Carrie-Anne Moss: The Matrix; Chocolat) looks like, and how to find ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano: The Matrix), his wife's killer, Leonard's fate is determined byhis written data.Memento clearly establishes the main character's point of view by narrating events as the character perceives them. This is achieved by focusing on the atemporal quality of his experience as he reencounters characters and situations without knowledge --or memory-- of a prior encounter. (That is, since Leonard interprets every encounter as a new one, the viewer often cannot distinguish between a genuinely new encounter and one which the protagonist simply sees as new.) Technically, Memento relies on editing techniques that disorient the viewer with undefinable patterns of flashback and flashforward images. Although often marked by tedious repetition of key scenes, the circular nature of the narration stresses the character's condition and establishes that a lack of memory may result in his inability to apply moral judgment. This raises valuable questions with regards to the role memory plays in the concepts of revenge, motivation and regret. All in all, Memento deconstructs natural perceptions of reality (and entertains new ones) by successfully manipulating its filmatic elements, and by offering a suspenseful story which evolves as a result of its protagonist's abnormal cognitive processes.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An Honest Review,"It is so hard to write honest reviews about Nolan films without coming under the radar and getting attacked by Nolan fans. It's an odd bunch of people, not unlike the TEA Party in the US, where any criticism is pounced on with uncompromising gusto? ""You're an idiot if Taxi Driver is your favorite film, Nolan didn't direct it!!!!"" Fortunately Memento is one of his movies where I can safely say it's worth 10 out of 10 without feeling like I am selling out to they sycophants.For starters Guy Pearce does an amazing job and that is generally not the case in his movies. The Hurt Locker, The Proposition, L.A. Confidential, there are very few movies where he was actually believable in the part. So we have that and it generally takes a competent director to bring it out of him.Then the plot itself, what is it? Comedic mystery? Would that be a decent enough title for it? It weaves itself in and out of the story, taking time to use Leonard's peculiar memory to it's best comedic effect.The plot heavily revolves around his extremely short term memory and, because of that we get to see the movie through his eyes and all the complications that come with it, both in their most brutal and their most brutally funny as he attempts to solve his wife's murder and gets exploited along the way.It's just a great film, funny and violent, like I love them.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The structure,"I've read a lot of reviews of Memento that say the reverse structure shows how it feels to be like Leonard.  After the first scene, it doesn't!  If he has no memory, then he can't backtrack, now can he?  He can't figure out what we end up seeing by the end of the movie.  He would move forward, aimlessly (and once he takes his picture at the beginning and writes out that he's finally done it, then he will no longer have the mystery the ""ending"" of the movie claims he desires).There are different types of narrative structures, and they each have their uses and limitations.  Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" is told from an anonymous and distant point of view, because if it was in first person or even third person limited, the story of a town who each year select a victim to be stoned wouldn't be believeable.  Just as that is true, stories like Steinbeck's ""The Chrysanthemums"" need to be closer to the main character but still not in their voice.  Then there are stories, such as Welty's ""Why I Live in the P.O."" which are told by the main character, yet reveals that character's limited perspective and biases.Perhaps Nolan would have done better to have stuck with a structure that truly stayed with how the character thought, though quite frankly, I don't think it's possible for a movie to truly express that kind of condition, because we are not afflicted and anything shown--forwards or backwards or sideways--will be remembered.  Perhaps he really should have written it in a more omniscient style, showing how the other characters react to him as opposed to the other way around.  After all, with the exception of the forward-moving black and white sequences, he always acted exactly the same (until the speeches at the end), which makes it a little boring and repetetitive to follow him constantly.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intellectual Vomit,"I'm not sure why everyone is so impressed by this film.  We're supposed to feel sorry for a character who expresses very little emotion, in a suspense film that has no suspense because it's going in reverse, to solve a mystery that doesn't exist, with subplots that are never resolved. My date convinced me to rent this, and I honestly regret every minute of it. If you are capable of rational, logical thought, you will find this story to be ridiculous.  Maybe that explains why so many people like it.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A movie in reverse,"I'm surprised this movie has received such high ratings. It's not as clever as the Director would love you to think it is- watch it once and you'll easily have it figured out. Guy Pierce is horribly mis-cast as the lead in this movie- he is NOT a leading man...as for his bleached blonde hair in the movie...well, the less said the better! He has such a banal, expression-less face and bland voice- just like he had in L.A.Confidential, another snooze-fest. In the hands of a more skillful director this could have been a much more entertaining movie. Too much emphasis was placed on the 'look' and style of this pile of rubbish. This is one of those movies that once you've seen it once, you'll probably never want to watch again. Like I already said, if this had been directed by someone like Darren Aronofsky and had a likeable leading man (at least someone with some acting abilities- not a 2nd rate ex-Australian soap actor), the maybe then this could have been a better movie. As it is, it's a bloated bore of a movie full of it's own importance and smugly smirking at it's own self-perceived cleverness and intelligence.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Fascinating and Frightening,"Memento certainly charts new cinematic territory with its odd yet compelling structure of non-chronological flashbacks of a man who has lost his ability to form short-term memories. They are not his flashbacks, for he is the protagonist of all of them. But the structure allows the viewer to imagine what it would be like to be him, dealing with a totally fragmented experience caused by brain damage. The result is fast-paced, compelling and more than a bit disturbing. I was glued to the screen for the length of the film, so obviously it was convincing enough in the moment to hold my attention, despite the kaleidoscopic structure.I do have a post-viewing question, which fortunately did not pop up while I was watching, else it might have disrupted the flow: How can the protagonist remember that he has lost the ability to form short-term memories? When he is compared to Sammy, there is a world of difference. Sammy does not know that he cannot form the memories. Lennie, in contrast, is completely fixated on this single idea, which drives his action and motivates everything else that he does.Despite that single quibble, the film is quite thought-provoking and may serve as a cautionary tale, now that brain tech is being developed by DARPA to control soldiers´ minds, making them manipulable in precisely the way the lamentable protagonist of Memento has become. This work is both fascinating and frightening.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It endedno!,"When this film ended, the first thing that hit us was the shock that it had ended.   It was that engrossing.  At first, we weren't sure if the telling of the story backwards would work, but after the movie started, we found ourselves fixated on the screen trying desperately to put the pieces together so as to understand what led to the initial scene and then, just when we thought we had it figured out, the movie ends leaving a finger of doubt in our minds.  We then began about 10-15 minutes of discussion that was permeated with a feeling of being incomplete and a little on edge.If you don't like ambiguity, we don't think you'll like this film, for that is where it derives its impact and strength.  If you are looking for a crazy and unpredictable ride at the end of a long week, throw this in and be taken away from the routine of life.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great and Entertaining Film ... with some crucial flaws.,"""Memento"" is more of an evolutionary film than revolutionary, adding a slightly different dimension to what other films have already done before, such as ""Pulp Fiction"", in presenting it out of chronological sequence, with two different running stories, one going forward in time and the other backwards, relating the story of a man with a memory condition unable to create new memories and seeking vengeance for the murder and rape of his wife.""Memento"" is an extremely entertaining movie for those that like a film that makes them think a bit, and though many people would regard Christopher Nolan as just using a gimmick of using reverse chronological order to cover up what would be a pretty boring plot,this is a pretty foolish remark as Christopher Nolan designed the whole film specifically so that it could be portrayed backwards, hence no-one should even consider if the plot would be just as good if played in chronological order as the whole structure of the story would've been different to accommodate such a change. However, ""Memento"" still has some major flaws that I feel really hold it back from being a truly great film. Though the film does engage the viewer's interest through the suspense built up before, it would have held the viewer's interest much better if the central character was someone that the viewer could feel sympathy for, making them want to know what happens to him, which would have made the twist at the end far more unexpected. As well as this it can be seen that at the end, no matter how many different answers people may come up with to try and cover these questions up, there are still many unanswered questions with some unsatisfactory answers to others which was not Nolan's intention as he himself said that all the answers should be within the film. But though many other people would describe it as being riddled with plot holes there aren't many, if any, of these, such as the common misconception that he shouldn't even be able to remember that he has Anterograde Amnesia, which is actually untrue as can be seen with real-life patients who have the condition. The acting is pretty good throughout, especially from Joey Pantoliano and Guy Pearce who really perform their roles amazingly well, giving very convincing performances.Overall, the whole movie should serve as a highly enjoyable and novel movie (although some people may find it slightly dull or hard to keep up with, and the main character a bit expressionless), with an extremely absorbing narrative structure and plot that'll keep your eyes glued to the screen, with a great twist at the end that should make it, all in all, a really worthwhile movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

In the beginning I thought that Memento might have some levels, but the feeling of mystery involved can all be reduced to the plot, not to the theme, which is just some insignificant decoration on filmmakers' intellectual masturbation, not like in Donnie Darko, for example, in which the complex elements are related to some content.All I'm saying, not a terrible movie, but you gotta be kidding saying it's ""highly intellectual"" or a ""masterpiece"".

Fantastic,"My sister recommended this film to me after I told her how much I'd enjoyed Guy Pearces' wonderful performance in The Count Of Monte Cristo.I got the video out, and was just blown away by it.

Guy Pearce is just the most natural actor I've seen, and gives a mesmerising performance, you can really feel his anger and fustration. His character is also very funny at times, especially in the scene where he discovers Dodd in his cuboard, and can't remember how he got there.This film is a must see, but if you don't want to use your brain, then don't see it!

One of the Best Gimmick Movies Ever Made,"Crackerjack thriller from fanboy phenom Christopher Nolan before he had directed ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"" and anyone knew who he was.The film's gimmick is of course what gives it its cult appeal. Guy Pearce plays a man with short-term memory loss who's trying to reconstruct the crime that resulted in the death of his wife. He has to write down anything he wants to remember within moments of its happening; he even resorts to tattoing important information on to his body so he will be able to recall it later. We only learn pieces of the story as he learns them, beginning at the end and working our way backwards. It's a gimmick that's pulled off tremendously well by the direction and writing, but no one should praise the film's concept at the sake of its immensely talented cast, led by an award-worthy Guy Pearce. He's given terrific support by Carrie-Ann Moss (of ""The Matrix"") in a femme fatale role and Joe Pantoliano, playing the film's bad guy.I saw this film in Denmark.

A Unicorn of a Movie That You've Never Seen Before,"The reason for Memento's critic and audience praise is that it is something I've never seen before.

My biggest knock on it is that there is so much time jumping that it's nearly impossible to put all the pieces together at once. I've only seen Memento one time, but it requires multiple viewings to put all said pieces together to fully appreciate it.

"She deserves vengeance, regardless if he knows or not","Before Christopher Nolan began mixing the spectacle and the narrative device, along with the real show of characters and eccentric personalities. With the recent Batman franchise, Nolan became more about the darkness aspect of the story and noticeably amplified the action spectacle, but with his directorial debut Memento, he was all about the mystery. Memento is a great film mainly because of its element of surprise, mystery, and its narrative device. Nolan conducts the story atypically from the end of the story all the way to the beginning, focusing on an array of characters that may or may not have anything to do with the outcome of the story. But is the outcome the first scene (the story's conclusion) or the final scene (the story's beginning)? That is one of the many questions you'll ask yourself when watching Memento for the first time. Seeing it for the first time, I wasn't prepared for the constant mind-race I'd be experiencing. The plot should not be spoiled, so I'll give basic the story's basic framework. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from a memory disorder after a man apparently attacked and murdered his wife before knocking him unconscious. Now, Leonard wants to avenge his wife's death, but his memory loss makes it more of a challenge than it already is. Leonard can't hold onto newer memories but has all the ones prior to the incident. To keep with the information about his attacker, Leonard tattoos himself with crucial information in his search for the murderer and takes many Polaroids of the people he meets along the way.That's as far as I'll go in trying to sum up the plot. If you haven't seen it, you don't need to know much else. The story, being told backwards to forwards, intrigues and mystifies, as it should, and heightens the mystery of the entire premise. However, I question the impact the film will have with repeated viewings. Seeing it once and exploring the ins-and-outs of online movie-guides and analyses for Memento, I am seriously skeptical about it being as exhilarating and as gripping as it was the first time around.Despite my speculation of whether or not Memento will hold up for a second viewing, the film should be commended for its intrigue and intricate use of characters and story development. Sometimes the value of characters' motives - and characters themselves - are questionable, making the film tricky to piece together. This is not a criticism because it makes you connect with the stress and confusion of Leonard. The whole thing is akin to a hazy, vigilante/detective story. Nolan puts us in the position of Leonard so deeply that there's hardly a frame or scene where he isn't there. This gives us the feeling of confinement; the odd and often eerie feeling of embodying a character in a film.Guy Pearce's enticing performance only levies this. Pearce adds the hazy and disoriented qualities of Leonard's character subtly but effectively as she makes the character sympathetic but simultaneously unreliable. With Leonard's severe condition, even his buddy Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) sometimes seems like a complete stranger. This not only leads to an unreliable narrator, but an unreliable cast of characters, seeing as Leonard feels as if he can't trust his own friends and acquaintances due to his condition. The same applies to us.Memento is a great thriller thanks to its mystery and high-levels of intrigue. The great performances of Pearce, Pantoliano, and Carrie Anne-Moss as a woman Leonard meets during his search. The scene that rings in my head the most from the film is when Teddy informs Leonard that even if he does kill the person responsible, it isn't like he'll remember it. Leonard has the most logical response there could be. ""My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make a difference whether I know about it.""Starring: Guy Peace, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Anne-Moss.

A movie easy to admire but difficult to like!,"Anyone who is fond of detective films will eager to watch ""Memento"". Besides, at first sight, Christopher Nolan's movie is alluring thanks to the story. Indeed, the story of the movie is worthy of any detective film and this is the kind of story that several directors who are past masters in suspense (Hitchcock of course) wouldn't repudiate at all.This is the story of a man Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) which the woman has been killed. You can guess it easily: his first intention is to track down the killer back and it's not an easy job. It's all the more difficult as he's got a big problem: he suffers from amnesia. Will he succeed in tracking down the murderer?But this is where things are getting difficult: the story is told upside down! At the beginning of the movie we know the murderer and during the movie we must discover his motive. But with such a device, it's very difficult to follow the story because it obeys a logic that is completely unusual in a movie. And this logic is likely to slip the spectator's attention. It happened with me.In 1997, when U2 launched their album ""Pop"", ""Rolling Stone"" said that it was an album easy to admire but difficult to appreciate. The same critic could be said for ""Memento"". It remains an original movie but it also demands a big intellectual effort and it's perhaps due to this that the movie was a relative commercial failure. Nonetheless, congratulations to Christopher Nolan who managed to make such a movie that exploits very well recurring themas in detective films. For example, amnesia.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Jon Monsarrat review:   arty but accessible & great thriller,"Like ""Training Day"", Memento is that rare gem that succeeds both as a pure arty drama film (not my kind of movie) and as an action / thriller (that's more my style).The film is original, very very original, and fascinating. Although there's no blood / gore, it is too scary for young kids, but besides that: perfect. The acting is great. Guy Pearce is definitely headed for an Academy Award at some point. The cinematography and editing are out-of-this-world fantastic. The story doesn't exactly have ""something to say that changed my life"" (see ""October Sky"", ""Dead Poets' Society"", and ""Contact"") but there are plenty of deep thinking intellectual issues.One caveat: you will need to have your brain 100% alert to get the full impact of the film. For me, I loved that, but if you prefer to relax and just go with the flow you will probably get a little lost.Who should see this film:-- Everybody, it's safe for arty types who don't normally see thrillers-- Everybody, it's safe for action buffs who hate arty dramas.If you normally hate over-intellectual films that make you think too much, but you had to see one in your life, see this one.I'll give ""Memento"" a well-deserved 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not in the Top 10 !!!!!!!!!!!,"Memento is a very good film.Christopher Nolan has crafted one of the best films of the last couple years. It has many things going for it. The concept was clever and consistent, the editing was sharp, and through most of the film you could almost empathize with Leonard and his ""condition"".However, it is not the ninth best film of all time. I'm not positive that Nolan is a big Hitchcock fan, but he should be thrilled that Memento is ranked above every one of Hitchcock's films.If you don't appreciate the plot devices, you probably won't like the film. You are actually forced to connect with Leonard, follow the notes and solve the mystery, because there is nothing else for you to do or see.The characters, scenery and plot are all secondary. Without the devices, it would look like a tame NYPD Blue episode. To keep your attention from finish to start, nothing is unintentionally given away. To accomplish this, the places and people Leonard sees are limited in number as well as range, and hints are parceled out sparingly from scene to scene.If you take everything into consideration, M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is a more complete recent film with some of the same qualities.

I am a huge fan of the film The Usual Suspects, and was disappointed to find that this film also ranked first place under the category of thriller.  Right above The Usual Suspects.  Memento is a very clever film, yet it does not create the pull that a thriller needs because it takes so long to tell what is happening.  In other words, the movie goes by kind of slowly.  Another mute point that caught my attention was the ending.  Although it left the viewer with something to think about, it didn't give you the "" oh-my gosh-that's-fricken-cool"" feel that a thriller is supposed to leave you with.  To see a truly classic example of a real thriller, you need to see The Usual Suspects.  I do, however, recommend this film.  It uses a unique backwards storyline that makes it very interesting to watch.

"How memorable, really?","Memento is a reminder or a warning, as in the classic expression: Memento mori, remember that you will die. It is grim, but also helpful. Shouldn't we live our lives like that? Should we not, like Leonard in the movie, reexamine our whole situation, each morning after waking up?When Leonard fights his incapacitated short-memory, to catch the killer of his wife and avenge her, he has found a simple, straightforward meaning to his life, easily filling each new moment of his days - and there are many. Upon completion, what can he possibly do to keep such a sense of purpose? It's pretty much a no-win situation.But the movie is fascinating, mainly because of it staying, as Kurt Vonnegut called it in 'Slaughterhouse 5', ""unstuck in time"". This opens for a refreshing narration, keeping your eyes open and your mind awake. It is done with great skill, too, so that it almost becomes natural, as if time is supposed to work like this.My problem is with the characters. In this staccato form, they do not really get any depth, are not explored to the extent where I feel I know what makes them tick. The characters become like the plot itself: cut up in tiny pieces, and scrambled.That would be Ok, too, if it were not for the ending (which I will not give away here). The ending - well, the beginning, sort of - loses credibility by the fact that we have gotten to know too little about the main characters, to anchor it in. Not as bad as a deus ex machina intervention in the last minute, but still. I don't feel the ending to be what Aristotle meant by 'necessary', and I don't know enough about the characters to say what would have been such an ending.Unfortunately, this shortcoming makes the film less memorable than it otherwise deserves to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Christopher Nolan keeps up his wonderful track record!,"Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has a problem; he has anterograde amnesia, which means he can't produce new memories. The cause of this is from an accident, one which viewers will be able to find out about near the middle of the film. Leonard can remember everything before his accident, but anything after he can't remember; he can only go on for an uncertain amount of time until his brain restarts, making him lose memory of what just happened.Leonard's problem allows director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception, The Prestige) to create something truly unique with the film by presenting it in a reverse-chronological order. 'Memento' is presented in two different ways throughout; the parts presented in color are played forward, but are ordered chronologically backwards; the parts presented in black-and-white are played forward, and are also ordered in chronologically forward. Some may get slightly confused by this style, but it shouldn't take long until the concept catches on and is understandable.'Memento's' backwards-storytelling style is what keeps the film interesting. The viewer only knows as much as Leonard knows, at the beginning, but we gradually know more than him as the film comes to a close (though, we don't know that much more than him). When new scenes come up, they're usually funny and entertaining because it makes us wonder how Leonard got himself into that situation; of course, we find this out when the next scene comes up, which ends with the beginning of the previous scene.The film's unique style forces viewers to constantly think, question, and assume about many different things within it, which is good. 'Memento' forces viewers to pay attention on what's happening on screen, as well as what those scenes could mean or be leading to.Throughout the film, Leonard has relationships with different characters, and we never know who is Leonard's ally or enemy, not what their motives are until the end. Leonard has a close friend, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who helps Leonard in his path to find and kill a specific person, but is Teddy really trying to help him or not? Leonard also develops a close relationship with a woman named Natalie (Carrie-Anne moss), whom is also trying to help Leonard find and kill a specific person, but who is Natalie? What's her motive, and is she truly helping him? Leonard believes someone's trying to make him kill the wrong person, but since we only know as much as he does, we never know if Teddy is that person, or if Natalie is that person, of if neither of them are the ones trying to lead Leonard in the wrong direction. This confusion and possibility keeps the film entertaining, and opinions regarding Teddy and Natalie will surely switch multiple times throughout the film.When the film ends (which is technically the beginning), many things are explained. However, these explanations are open to interpretations; just because the film answered certain questions asked throughout, it doesn't mean those specific answers are the right answer. The ending of 'Memento' makes you think about possible scenarios that could have happened before the events of the film, and how those could be important to the film. 'Memento', by the end of the film, is pretty straightforward, but like Inception, the film is left open to interpretation.Director-writer Christopher Nolan does an excellent job at setting up the film's premise and style. 'Memento' is actually adapted from the short story, 'Memento Mori', which was written by Nolan's younger brother, Jonathan Nolan. Christopher Nolan is always skilled in his psychological-thriller type films, and his skill is definitely not missing from 'Memento', which is one of his early films.PS: 'Memento' might take some viewers mutiple viewings in order to like. Personally, I didn't like the film the first time I saw it. The second time around, however, I loved it! Some might like the film the first time, like some people I know.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Simple story told in an overly complicated, ridiculously long way","This movie tries to be complex, but instead of achieving it by means of a clever plot, it creates a fake complexity through a messy editing. It presents the story through half scenes shown in a mixed chronological order so that the trick to follow it is to ""remember"" (get it?) everything and put the pieces together in a way that it makes sense.
The thing is, maybe you're not up to play a memory game for two hours, maybe you just want to watch a movie, and if you don't play along you end up just watching stuff happen.
This chronology puzzle can be entertaining at first but it quickly becomes monotonous and boring, it's two hours of nealy identical scenarios and dialogs repeated over and over again, and by the time you have all the pieces to put everything together, you simply don't care anymore because all you want is for the movie to end.Lastly, the protagonist's condition on which the story relies on is too far-fetched for my suspension of disbelief to handle (don't worry, not a spoiler): a person with brain trauma that left him with an impaired short them memory and is unable to make new memories. Someone with such condition should be barely able to function in every day life without a care-taker, but being independent to such degree? And the most obvious question, how does he remember he has such condition in the first place?",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece,"This is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, his best film, the one that I like the most. He has made some really great movies, but none have been as good as this.

And at times the narration may feel unneeded, but those are really only small nitpicks.The best part about this movie is the way it's shown, it's not a straight narrative, there are black and white scenes that go straight, but then the color scenes go backwards, all setting up this mystery. Nolan tried to do that with his first movie, ""Following,"" but this is where he perfected it. The mystery is very well done, and actually gives the movie more re-watch value, I've seen the movie several times and still don't know exactly what happened. The acting is great all around, Teddy ads some really good comedic relief, the cinematography and editing are excellent.There's not much to say without spoiling anything, please if you haven't seen this movie, go see it, it really is a fantastic movie, and in my opinion, Christopher Nolan's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Cleverly done, but not 9th greatest","As I write this, Memento holds IMDB's 9th spot on the IMDB Top 250 list. This movie is NOT the 9th-greatest film ever made. It's a gimmick film, cleverly done with nice atmospherics and several plot surprises, but still a gimmick film. This seems like a case of ""IMDB Syndrome"" -- a tendency to vote at the extremes for recent movies, especially the gimmicky or culty movies. IMO, the voting on any movie in IMDB is not to be taken too seriously until at least two years after the movie's release.The movie's not bad, basically a brief scene at the beginning with a chain of flashbacks until the movie stops. Though the setting is different, the premise is very much like the Gene Wolfe novel, Soldier of the Mist.Few questions are answered (deliberately it would seem), so if you like nice tidy endings, this isn't the movie for you. If you like movies that require that you pay attention at every moment and that make you reconstruct storylines in your head while you watch, you'll probably like this.The movie did a good job of presenting the POV of someone whose memory is perpetually slipping away, and who can never be sure of what's going on around him.Eventually, the series of flashbacks was starting to get a little old, and I found myself thinking, ""Isn't it about time for you guys to wrap this up?""

This is not just a movie it is art,"Memento is not just a movie it is an artwork, an artwork with editing at its best, continuity at its max and a script that just draws you in. The screenplay is masterful as you are watching the movie from back to front; you get to feel like Leonard himself.Memento is written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who adapted it from his younger brother Jonathan Nolan's (Person of Interest creator, writer and executive producer) short story ""Memento Mori"".The brothers started work on the film in 1996 when Jonathan pitched the story to Christopher on a road trip, the two then started to send story and script back and forth as Christopher developed his film from a short story about a man named Earl who is a patient of a mental institution. Earl's wife like Leonard was killed by an anonymous man, and during the attack Earl lost his ability to create new long-term memories and convinces himself through written notes to himself to escape the mental institution and track down and kill his wife murder.The movie starts at the end and runs till we get to see what led to the end. The movie is told in two different parallel series of scenes, one of which is in black and white and it is shown chronologically, and the other is in colored and shown in a reverse order sequence. The two stories meet at the end of the film, and it shows us what led to the beginning of the film.The movie plot is about a man named Leonard (Guy Pearce) who has anterograde amnesia, which makes it difficult for him to retain new explicit memories. To be able to keep tab on his life Leonard developed a system where he uses notes, tattoos and Polaroid photos to be able to track where he is and who he knows and what he is doing or about to do.Leonard's problem started when he got hit in the head when he witnessed his wife being raped and murdered; now Leonard has only one goal in life to track down a certain John G who he believes killed his wife.Rated as one of the best movies in the 2000s, Memento is featured in notable lists of top films. Memento was very successful at the box office making almost 10 times its production cost and placing Nolan's name in the lips of many production studios, inclusive of Warner Bros where Christopher Nolan made The Batman Trilogy and will be working with them for the making of the new Superman film named Man of Steel in 2013.Memento received numerous accolades and got two Academy Awards nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing.

How reliable is your memory really?,"First off I'd like to start by saying that whoever made a comment prior to mine, Leonard Shelby's condition is that he has no SHORT-term memory, not LONG-term. If your gonna review the film make sure everything you know about a film as good as this was is right.Memento is unlike any movie you'll see or have ever seen. The plot seems simple enough, but don't let that mislead you about the film itself. Memento is an original film-noir film adapted from a short story by Director Christopher Nolan's brother Johnathan Nolan about a man named Leonard Shelby who is an Insurance Investigator who finds his wife raped and murdered. Lenni (whoops sorry, he hates people calling him that) ah, Leonard intrudes on the rape and murder and ends up with a condition. This condition makes it so that he cannot make any new memories. Even with this new handicap of his he still wishes to exact revenge on his wife's rapist and killer. However, it's the structure of the movie that will leave you perplexed and questioning everything you've seen even after the last frame of film. The structure may seem complex almost as if it's non-linear, but it is in fact very linear. It has only been reversed so that story starts at the end of the film and works it way to the beginning making it so that the next scene relies upon the scene prior to it.Director Christopher Nolan (Following, Insomnia), creates an orginal film-noir film where you the audience are literally put exactly into Leonard Shelby's shoes thereby not allowing you to be capable of empathizing with Shelby since you too are just as confused as to what's going on as he is. After thinking you've just about figured everything out about what's going on (although with this film even by the end that still shouldn't be possible) the film's ""climatic ending"" (remember this films goes in reverse from end to beginning) completely turns everything you thought to be true upside down and has you leaving the theatre questioning everything that took place.Not that that's a bad thing though. I personally loved leaving the theatre after seeing that and continuing to try and make sense of it all. I think what I loved most about it was that it wasn't a straight psychological film-noir thriller. Nolan makes sure to add in snippets of humor throughout the film just to keep the audience from not getting too consumed in what's going on. For instance Leonard is hiding in the bathroom of a motel room holding a bottle of wine and waiting for someone (this obviously is not his room since he is hiding like he is waiting for someone who may know something). He looks down at the wine bottle and in a short voice over monologue ponders, ""Hmmm, I don't feel drunk."" Lines like that and, ""Okay, so what am I doing? Oh, I'm chasing this guy. No, he's chasing me."" is sure to get chuckles from the audience knowing how bad Shelby's condition is and the fact that one second ago he knew how he got into the situation he's currently in, but then the next he's wondering why something in particular is happening to him.All and all Memento is truly a one of kind film in today's film industry. It's message is pretty clear in my opinion and that is that our memories are not perfect so how can we rely on it 100%? It may leave you confused and pondering everything that happened in it, but honestly: would you constantly always want to see a movie that didn't make you think about an important asset like our memories? There's something new for you to ponder.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Unforgettable,"Undoubtedly the most astounding piece of work Hollywood had produced in decades. If Hitchcock was around today even he would surely bow to this movie's understated genius. What is undeniable here is the urge to keep watching. From the start you are shown the plot's climax, but to make sense of it you are pushed into rewind, slowly absorbing the plot, only understanding fully the end (or the beginning), by enduring long enough to finally see the revelations laid down at the beginning (or the end). Anyone who has watched the Easter egg chronological order of this on DVD will know it is not the plot but the reverse telling of the story in which the genius lies. This is a film that doesn't just entertain through its runtime , it will keep you enthralled for days as the outstanding plot reveals more and more with closer scrutiny through 'dare I say it', your own attempt to piece it together through memory. The little known Chris Nolan has outdone himself with this marvel and although his subsequent effort 'Insomnia' failed to make quite the same impression it will be interesting to see what he makes of the much anticipated 'Batman Begins'. A shrewd movie lining up Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano fresh from their success in the original Matrix movie. It is the performance of Guy Pearce 'LA Confidential & Neighbours (sorry Guy had to mention it)' that is enthralling. The audience insight through him into the complex life of a man with no memory is mesmerising. Many films which gradually unveil a series of complicated twists fall down upon subsequent viewing, but this delivers time and time again. In a time when originality is the greatest gift that a talented film maker can give us, this is without doubt the best example of a gripping original film ever made. It is just a shame that such original, independent films go unrecognised by the academy.Don't dare miss this 10-10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Now, Where Was I?""","Now firmly established within the Hollywood mainstream, former novelist Christopher Nolan had already demonstrated an enterprising linear technique in his no-budget black & white debut 'Following' in 1998.With the help of the commercially savvy teaming of Guy Pearce from 'Neighbours' (serving as his his own unreliable narrator) and Carrie-Anne Moss from 'The Matrix', 'Memento' here brings the techniques to a much wider audience'. The devices employed in 'Memento' actually date back at least as Dorothy Arzner's 'Merrily We Go to Hell' at the very dawn of the sound film, had already become a cliche by the forties; which only goes to show that be truly avant garde you need to keep looking back.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Nolan's groundbreaking, timeless masterpiece","This elegant and ingenious triumph in film form hides its classic hard-boiled crime story behind young, creative filmmaker Christopher Nolan's narrative stroke of genius. Leonard (Guy Pearce) is on a desperate quest to find his wife's rapist and murderer while dealing with a debilitating condition which makes him unable to form new memories. And to help us get into Leonard's chaotic state of mind, Nolan tells his story backwards in increments - a story filled with familiar noir elements such as motels, derelict warehouses, anonymous letters and undercover cops. Although the mystery is relatively straightforward in itself, seen through Leonard's eyes it quickly becomes a lot more convoluted. It's all thanks to Nolan's craftsmanship and remarkable command of every minute detail that he is able to weave it all together in his innovative narrative structure: A black-and-white sequence of phone calls and Leonard's voiceover is played out parallel with the backwards presentation of his perpetual detective work. The effect is mesmerizing; both intensifying the suspense of the story and adding a new vitality not only to Nolan's film but to the entire film medium.

Ignorance is NOT blizz...,"This movie came as a huge surprise on me in a very positive way. Once in a while there are screenwriters and/or directors who really want to do something extraordinary to impress the viewers of their production. As an example, Groundhog Day had the main character relive the same day over and over again for ages until he finally got the girl of his dreams in the end, and it worked. Fight Club also gave you an intense story where two very different characters slowly evolved to a movie climax rarely seen, because to most people the answer to all the story's conflicts is to unimaginable. A closer example to ""Memento"" is ""The Usual Suspects"" from 1994, which gave you a very exciting story set in the criminal underworld run by Kayzer Zose, a man everybody fears but no one knows who he is...a lot like the main character in ""Memento.""The story is about insurance investigator Leonard, who suffers from short-term memory loss. Leonard got injured after intervening on his wife's murder. The murderer was still there when Leonard walked in on them, thus the main character ended up with a cracked skull (figuratively speaking).The movie's opening scene is where most crime stories would end; the main character gets his wife's murderer. The rest of the movie is built upon the fragments of memories that led Leonard getting his guy, in other words this movie is kind of told backwards, starting from the mentioned opening scene and ending where the whole situation actually begun... sound confusing? Well, I was confused for about fifteen minutes but once I understood what was going on the rest was just pure genius. At one point I asked myself: ""How can a story told backwards actually get more exciting by the minute?"" As much as I would give you some information about this, you really have to see the movie for yourself to actually understand what a gem this really is. The tension curve is always rising, with an ending so surprisingly good that this movie is up there with stunners like aforementioned ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Fight Club.""This is a totally unmissable movie for lovers of the crime/mystery genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Brilliant use and distortion of time seem to capture the thoughts going through the mind of the hero as he tries to figure out exactly what has happened.Also excellent and noteworthy are the transitions from black and white to color.This is not a movie for the short attention span crowd. You will have to see it at least twice to figure it out, but the resulting experience will be one that is hard to forget.Compare that to the hard sell, high concept films currently littering the multiplexes. A rare treat, especially for film buffs.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Memento,"Memento is the first movie i have ever reviewed on IMDb, i could of chosen any movie but i picked memento because i believe it to be one of the best movies of all time. It is an fantastic movie that may leave some confused and some amazed. The people who don't get it may have to watch it twice even if you do get it, watch it again.The plot of this movie is by far one of the best I've seen and to think that this disability is possible to have. Before watching the movie you will need to know that black and white scenes are going forward into the movie and color going backwards until they meet in the middle of the story at the end of the film.I did not give this movie a ten because i believe it gives a ending that is unexplained such as 'Inception' that allows you to try and think about it. All in all it is a great movie that should be defined as a movie masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Very Good, But...","'Memento' is a very good film, but I made the mistake of watching it after I had gone to see 'Lantana'.  While they are both very different films, they have some very obvious similarities, and I'm sorry to say 'Lantana' blows it away.  'Memento' is very well acted, is original in style and probably very memorable. It's definitely worth watching. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Unique, challenging, and rewarding","Memento is a brilliantly conceived Chinese box puzzle of a movie. It tells of Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) who, due to a brain injury, is unable to form new long-term memories. Every time he wakes up he has to rediscover his life and his quest, based on notes, photographs, and tattoos he has created for the purpose. The movie starts at the end and works backwards--most scenes begin with Leonard gathering the threads of his life together. The next scene then shows how he got to the beginning of the last scene. It's an unsettling technique, but it is also a marvelous idea, because it puts the viewer in a similar situation to that of Leonard. When he wakes up, he doesn't know where he is, and we don't, either. This is a unique conception, and it makes a movie not to be missed. Unfortunately, it is also rather unsavory, full of violence and murder; but it also comes to a piquant and satisfying conclusion. It's only later that one begins to pick apart the logic. Not for all tastes, and some viewers will start completely lost and never figure out what the heck is going on. But for those up to its challenges, Memento is a unique viewing experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a gimmick that works,"Note that this is not at all the first film to use the ending first, play backwards or nonsequential.  It's not even the first about a character with that particular mental condition.  Memento distinguishes itself by being the first (to my knowledge) to use the form for an entirely narrative rather than artistic purpose, but that doesn't make it better than other similarly unfolding stories like The Green Wall .Stripped of its gimmick, Memento is a very good although nonspectacular mystery thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I just was not given a 'wow' factor.,"Don't get me wrong, the storyline is authentic in it's entirety. Casting for the film was on point, but the way it was broken down lacked back story. In a way, I suppose the movie was intended to be that way to put you in the shoes of Leonard. But even so, I was expecting MORE the whole movie. I'm reading other reviews and they were glued to the screen yet I found the film to be condescending and easy to drive my attention away from. Even the ending, I was expecting something after the fact of how finally Leonard got his revenge and it would carry from there. Felt like I got sucked into the reviews of this one to be majorly disappointed! And I'm an AVID Christopher Nolan fan. I will be one of those who will not recommend this movie and am honestly shocked by those who are a fan of this film.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
ingenious tour de force,"Christopher Nolan's mind-bending thriller `Memento' is one of those rare instances in which the form of a movie is designed to match its content. Here is a film all about the nature of short-term memory, which, by its own ingenious structure, challenges the audience to cope with its own mastery of short-term memory.Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, a man who suffers from a `condition' brought on by a trauma to the head that prevents him from being able to retain any short-term memories (he can remember his life only up to the moment of his wife's rape and murder).  To cope with his affliction, Leonard writes himself copious notes, mostly on the backs of polaroids he takes on a regular basis but sometimes on his own body in the form of informational tattoos.  To approximate the sense of dislocation of time and place that Leonard feels on a daily basis  as he has to reorient himself to people and events he has recently met and since forgotten - Nolan has chosen to structure his film in a backward progression, so that the first scene ends up being the most recent and the final scene the earliest in time.  This technique is not exactly an original one, since the 1983 movie `Betrayal' used roughly the same format in the context of a romantic drama.  Still, `Memento' deserves enormous credit not only for trusting its audience to be able to cope with this complex style but for managing to keep most of the plot details well-focused and coherent for most of the film's duration.One of the risks of a film like `Memento' is that it could, if handled badly, easily become a mere exercise in technical `gimmickry.'  One of the ways that Nolan avoids that trap is by devising a plot that is as gripping as any to be found in a traditionally structured example of film noir. `Memento' is filled with the kinds of narrative twists and turns, surprise revelations and moral ambiguities that form the basis for any good example of the genre.  More important, Nolan makes Leonard a compellingly sympathetic character, one whom we come to care for because his plight is so heartrending at its core.  Here is a man who not only has to deal with the immense incomprehensibilities of his life but who cannot even benefit from the time factor that helps mourning people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.  To Leonard, his wife's death is a perpetual recent event, one from which he can never attain that emotional distance so key to finally overcoming his grief.Special note should be taken of Guy Pearce, who delivers a knockout performance as Leonard, perfectly capturing the determination, frustration and emotional pain that define the character.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano offer superb support as two perpetual `strangers' who play significant roles in Leonard's strangely dislocated and fragmented life  yet just what those roles are is as much a mystery to us as it is to Leonard.  David Julyan's subtle and haunting musical score and Wally Pfister's fine cinematography greatly contribute to the unique quality of the film.Watching `Memento' is like entering a strange, mystical dream.  Like Leonard, we feel as if we have suddenly been stripped of that ability to fully make sense out of the chaotic world around us.  We feel cut loose from our mental moorings and find ourselves adrift in a world bereft of the rules of chronological reasoning we cling to so desperately for survival.  How many movies actually manage to shift our paradigm of perception and make us look anew at the way we observe the world around us?  Not many, I can assure you.Christopher Nolan's brilliant and audacious cinematic tour de force reawakens our faith in the medium and those who dare to challenge it.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Best Movie Of All Time,"Memento is by far the best film I've ever seen. The complex narrative, the themes of vengeance, memory and our illusions is superb and Guy Pearce's performance as Leonard Shelby is the best of his whole career. But in my opinion what's really so great about Memento is it's screenplay and the editing. One of the most genius and creative screenplay by Nolan that never gets you tired or bored with ambiguous and rich dialogue. David Julyan's soundtrack is masterful giving the sense of lost and craving, feelings that builds the rage that Leonard feels and how desperate he is to get that out of him. Well,I'm a big fanboy of this movie so I probably won't find any flaws so this definitely gets a 10 out 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant and overlooked,"I had never heard of this movie until a month ago when a friend recommended it. Memento's reverse concept is most intriguing and very well done. As you watch the film work its way backwards, one interesting plot twist and turn is developed after another. The film maintains a gritty quality throughout that really enhances the viewing experience. Guy Pearce is awesome as a man with ""this condition"" and the supporting cast performs magnificently as well. Much like Shattered, The Sixth Sense and The Game, a second viewing would not be nearly as much fun. However, Memento's brilliance makes the first viewing most memorable.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A smart and sophisticated thriller with more layers than the eye can see,"I feel that this was a great introduction to a great director. That man is Christopher Nolan. While a lot of newbie directors would've taken this material and made the story just sloppy and too flashy. I have to tip my hat again to Mr. Nolan, because he's one of the only directors in my opinion that can find a nice median between style and substance.Another big reason that I think this film is so smart is because it has an art-house feel to it. That is due to the relatively unknown cast. (Granted there not as unknown now) They include: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano. Though, truthfully if you've seen this movie, the breakout is Guy Pearce. The way he's able to make us as the audience side with him is just a joy to watch.All and all, Memento is a very smart movie that is just fun to watch and experience. I give it 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the most genius movies ever,"This movie is one of my favorites. My god where did this movie come from? For one: the performances are awesome. Guy Pearce is so good. Usually you look at an actor starring a think, ""bad actor"" but Guy Pearce incorporates it into his character so well, he's playing a character who is very focused but can't help but forget everything every ten minutes.Secondly: it's a very genius idea to storytelling, it really throws you off guard first time watching it because the movie cuts from black and white to color frequently, the black and white scenes are played in order while the color scenes are played backwards in time. Because it's being played backwards you really have to follow what's happening. Usually you watch a movie and call what happens next and it feels like they're spoon feeding you. Memento you might call what happens next but it feels rewarding like putting a puzzle together. Other than that you don't know what's going to happen and what just happened (that's right you ask both of those questions at the same time) check out memento it's a masterpiece of a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Highly Unique.,"Guy Pearce stars as a strange character who is trying to find his wife's killer in this innovative, smart and amazingly well-thought-out movie that switches back and forth between real time and stunning flashbacks. Pearce has a rare form of amnesia which keeps him from developing new memories. Thus he ""goes blank"" every 10 minutes and this naturally makes catching his wife's killer near impossible so he must keep notes, take pictures and even tattoo himself to keep all the clues fresh in his mind. There is the suspicious Joe Pantoliano who could be the man that Pearce is looking for and the seductive but shady Carrie-Anne Moss who may have alterior motives of her own. Pearce thinks back to before his wife's murder and tries to put his illness in perspective as he has experience with another individual who had the same problem when Pearce was an insurance investigator. The film starts, stops and pauses throughout its running time by showing something happening and then showing what happened leading up to the event. It is all a jigsaw puzzle that will make sense in the end. Co-writer/director Christopher Nolan has truly created a film that is unique, innovative and overall brilliant. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Mystery

You won't forget this one!,"I'm quite convinced that Christopher Nolan is not a man at all, but is in fact a movie-making machine. I don't believe that it's humanly possible to make films that are just so insanely clever as ""Inception"" or ""Memento"". Christopher Nolan even manages to make Batman seem clever, and you know how that originally started out. I saw ""Memento"" for the second time yesterday and its incredibly complex writing blew me away if not more so that the first time. I was awe-struck the first time that I watched ""Memento"", not only at the screenplay, but at the directing and acting also.If a film like ""Memento"" had been placed in the hands of any other director then it very easily could've turned into a confused and boring mess. Like, ""Inception"" Christopher Nolan deals with complex ideas that are very rarely seen in the movie world, but he handles them with such careful control and sophistication that they end up being some of the most mind-blowing films ever! Watching ""Memento"" with my parents was an experience in itself. To understand ""Memento"" you need a mind that is prepared to not just watch a film, but to be a part of it. Because ""Memento"" is placed in a backward order, you need to figure out and remember what's happened before a scene and try and piece the mystery together yourself.In hindsight this might seem like just a gimmick. But, ""Memento"" couldn't be told any other way, as it leaves you being confused as much as Leonard. It places you in Leonard's mind so that you don't know what's happened, like Leonard doesn't know. However, to follow the mystery we have to go back to see what has happened and Christopher Nolan uses this to his advantage and is able to create an extremely clever and complex mystery with an ending to die for. However, my parents failed to realise this. They were asking questions like ""why's he still alive, he was shot a minute ago!"" They just didn't get the idea of telling the story backward and the ending just left their mind in a graveyard! Luckily I didn't watch it with them the first time, so the second time was more amusing.Christopher Nolan's directing is also just as brilliant. He manages to place us into the mind of Leonard through excellent uses of narration and also completely gripping black and white sequence which is like a short film in itself. Guy Pearce is also brilliant at playing Leonard, it makes you wonder if he's got the same condition as Leonard! (He doesn't, just for the record.) Chrstopher often places us in the eyes of Leonard and so we suffer the same problems as him. ""Memento"" is like an experience that leaves you mentally exhausted.""Memento"" is one of the best films I have ever seen and is probably in my Top 10 list of the best films I have seen. It's beautifully written and directed and had me completely engrossed from the minute it started. It's also an excellent character piece, with people we can care about. It's thrilling, enthralling and involving. ""Memento"" is the perfect thriller, told in such a way that it's difficult to forget. If you have a fantastic attention span and are prepared to really concentrate in your films then you won't be disappointed with ""Memento"".",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Perfect Movie to Usher in the New Millennium,"""Memento"" is one of those rare gimmick movies (it's shown backwards, folks!) where the gimmick actually pays off.  Highly astute director Christopher Nolan simultaneously deconstructs the film noir genre while at the same time gives the audience the feeling that they are suffering from the same malady as the protagonist searching for his wife's killer.  The brilliant structure actually gave me short-term memory loss when I first watched it.  When was the last time a movie actually made you feel what it was portraying so acutely?  Guy Pierce, Carrie Anne Moss, and good ole' Joey Pants give electrifying performances as we the audience slowly learn that no one has a clear motive and you can't even trust your own memory.  This is the kind of revolutionary movie we need more of in this new Millennium.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
By far the most creatively made movie I have ever seen.,"Simply amazing. I will admit that it has little redeeming quality message wise, but the film is superbly made, and is really an original creative work of art. I cannot even begin to fathom the technical complexities of writing a script chronologically from two points in time, having the story work from those two points toward each other until they meet in the middle, and make all of it make sense only then, and yet manage to build suspense and keep peoples' interest up to that point. Simply stunning acting on the parts of Carrie Ann Moss and Guy Pierce, and just enough comedy to keep it from being as dark as it could have been. The plot twists keep changing everything you already knew, and there are plenty of moments where you think, oh...so he did that because....oh.

Almost Defies Explanation (A Film Told In Reverse),"Every once in awhile, you watch a film so good, inventive, and original that it almost leaves you a bit stunned. That is exactly how I feel when I watch ""Memento"", perhaps the most perfectly-crafted movie of all times in terms of screenplay and plotting.For a basic plot summary, ""Memento"" tells the story of an amnesiac who cannot remember short-term events. He knows who is and basic tenants of his life, but the day-to-day details reset from time to time. Thus, this film is devoted to him trying to avenge his wife's killing and putting together the pieces of his confusing identity.""Memento"" is much deeper than that above description, but to say any more would give away the fun of figuring it all out. The story is told in such a unique fashion that it will keep you guessing (but in a good way) until the very end. In what would prove to be a pattern for the Nolans going forward (especially projects in which Jonathan is attached too), the narrative does not play out in a linear format. Instead, it gives us little chunks in reverse order, so basically we see the ending first and then keep pulling back the curtain to understand the ""why"" of it all. What a concept! It takes a perfect screenplay to pull that off, and the Nolans come through easily on that front. I can only imagine the time and effort it must have taken to tell a story in this manner.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give this film, however, is that it accomplishes the feat of bending the mind yet ultimately creating a remarkably cohesive overall story. In other words, it is both very complicated and very fun to watch. I was taken on a psychological adventure and given an ending worthy of the journey. Unlike other mind-benders such as, say, ""Primer"" or ""Donnie Darko"" (that revel in the confusion they are creating), ""Memento"" accomplishes the rare feat of being equally entertaining and challenging.Thus, ""Memento"" is now firmly ensconced on my ""Top Films of all-time"" list, in large part because, 18 years after its debut, there still really isn't anything like it. There's a reason why the Nolans have become such large entities in Hollywood, and it all comes back to this groundbreaking film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""Reverse Psychology""","Memento breaks away from the normal crime/mystery movie by making the main character lacking in short term memory. I must say that I didn't know where the movie was going at first, but as the movie progressed I understood that it was taking the viewer back from the first event we saw to how we got there. The writers did an excellent job staying consistent with Leonard's (Guy Pearce) short term memory loss, and they did an even better job of not revealing to the audience any more than Leonard knew.The best way to keep the audience in the dark about the course of events as much as the main character was to do the story in reverse with each significant event Leonard could remember. Although most movies/stories progress chronologically forward, this movie went backwards event by event in order to find out what lead Leonard to the point we found him at the very beginning of the movie.As I stated before, the movie was done excellently. The only negative I would have to say is the lack of answers in the end. In the end I probably had more questions than I did in the beginning. I wasn't looking for a total resolution, but I guess I was looking for a little more than what was given.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nolan the Hack,"Became a cult film by fooling the audience to think it was original. It is not.

"Don't forget to see ""Memento""","I rented Memento tonight after many of my friends raved over it. Trusting their judgment, I gave it a go.It was exactly what I expected it to be: ground-breaking in screenplay and not overly ""arthousey"". It doesn't scream, ""I'm an iconoclast!"". It's genuine. It's intriguing.Guy Pierce plays Leonard Shelby, the high-cheekboned main character who suffers from ""a condition""--that condition being he has no short-term memory. He describes it as constantly ""waking up"" from the night his wife was murdered--which is the last long-term event he can recall. Now, he pursues to seek revenge against the killer, tattooing himself and writing notes so that he won't forget the clues along the way.What makes this movie so gripping is the fact that the story is told backwards! The effect is so that we somehow are placed into Leonard's shoes, not knowing what he's doing or why he's relating with a certain character until we recall what happened earlier. The result is twists and turns--endless surprises. You never know who is ""good"" or ""bad."" It's not your traditional feel-good movie, now, is it? Writer-Director Christopher Nolan is a genius; the broad scope of his imagination is clearly evident in this film. We're never left with a ""boring"" scene; instead, the two hours just fly by because you're so immersed with what's going on--and wringing your hands over what will happen next.Expect to be confused... expect to think. Memento is a must-see for serious drama-seeking movie-goers, not those who are willing to shell out $12 at theatres to watch some commercially over-rated air-head fluff and eyecandy graphics that has become the norm in Hollywood. Ugh. I'm sorry, but that's not my idea of ""entertainment.""I'm glad that there's still people out there willing to make such an excellent film such as this, without going overboard on advertising it.

Plays out like a never ending real-life nightmare,"They say that time heals but Leonard, our protagonist, asks, ""How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time""? It was a difficult concept to grasp but, as we've come to appreciate Director Christopher Nolan & writer Emma Thomas' work, we can't wait to watch again for more will be revealed. The Nolan movie experience certainly requires some atypical viewer adjustments. We are always shown what we need to know, but as with ""The Prestige"" we really don't want to see it. Their formula here combines loss of a spouse with a haunting guilt of culpability. The staggered murder investigation twists are presented through our protagonists' frustrating lack of short term memory. Memento has an artsy look yet an unmistakably gritty feel.

Perfection,"This is why you watch movies. You watch hundreds upon hundreds of movies hoping to someday find a gem like Memento. This is, quite simply, the perfect movie.The less said about the plot the better. Best to let you try to put this movie's puzzle together yourself. And what an ingeniously crafted puzzle it is. Anyone who saw this movie upon its initial release knew writer/director Christopher Nolan was a filmmaker destined to do great things. And we all know how that's turned out. Along with his brother Jonathan, writer of the original short story upon which the screenplay is based, Christopher Nolan here has crafted a story which seems impossibly complex but which is actually rather simple. It is the manner in which Nolan chooses to allow that simple story to unfold which is the genius of the film. The story is so engaging and so brilliantly put together that when the movie ends you desperately want to see it again. Immediately. You can't pay a movie any higher compliment than that.Memento centers around the character of Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce in what is an absolutely stunning performance. Leonard is out for revenge, hunting down the man who murdered his wife. But Leonard's investigation is hampered, to say the least, by the injury he sustained on the night his wife was attacked. He has no short-term memory. He remembers everything up to the attack. But he can't make new memories. Everything fades away. If he meets someone he won't remember them minutes later. And Christopher Nolan ingeniously puts us right inside Leonard's head. How? By telling the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. So as we see events unfold we, like Leonard, do not know what has happened beforehand. The effect is downright brilliant. Leonard will be helped by two people in his quest for vengeance. First is the mysterious Teddy, played by Joe Pantoliano. Who is this guy and why is he helping Leonard? Because the movie begins at the end we know right away something is not right about Teddy. And you can't wait for the story to unravel itself to find out how we get to that end. Also providing assistance to Leonard is a bartender named Natalie, played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Much like Teddy it seems Natalie has her own motives for helping Leonard. Who is this woman and what exactly is she playing at? Part of the thrill of watching the film is finding the answers to those questions.So there's the plot, a seemingly simple story told in a wonderfully unique way. Needless to say the story is not nearly as simple as it seems. There are so many twists and turns but best to let you discover those for yourself. It really is a perfectly constructed puzzle. Everything has to fit just so, any small mistakes anywhere along the way could have sunk the whole thing. There are no mistakes. It's perfect. There are really only three major roles and they're all performed wonderfully. Pantoliano and Moss are very good but Pearce is truly spectacular. What a challenging role to play and he pulls it off brilliantly. Great actors performing a great story...that's generally the formula for an exceptional film. And that is the case here. Memento was nominated for the Oscar for best screenplay. It lost to Gosford Park. Does anyone even remember Gosford Park? Nobody who sees Memento will ever forget it. This movie will live forever.

I feel this idea works beautifully in Pulp Fiction, Reservior Dogs and Usual Suspects to name a few of the modern era.But this film seem to go to far. I understand that the idea was to make the viewer as confused as the main character (which was incedentially very well acted by Guy Pearce surprinsly), but it was nearly impossible to follow what was happened unless you paid 100% attention and had the right mind, or you wrote down the ideas, or more likely watched it again.This left me frustrated watching this film (I've only seen it once), although nevertheless it was often quite interesting - particularly the idea of his friends misleading him, or him thinking they were misleading him - making him think irrationally.I find suprising the dedicated love for this film. I not sure whether because most people found this found so confusing or complicated - they just assumed it fitted together pefectly, as since it had out-witted them they assumed it was intelligentle masterpiece or whether I blatantly missing something here. (Assume most people would suggest the later).However all in all, I would give this film 7/10 - In summary a good idea, interesting storyline and characters but unnessarily mad jumping around of the storyline and most importantly this film, seems to me, TRIES to be masterpiece, while most masterpieces just happen through a mixture of ideas, orginality, good acting, directing and dialogue and intruiging and believable interacting characters. This film doesn't pull it off. But worth watching nevertheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"See it twice, or more, depending on your brain","Memento, unless you outright hate it for one reason or another, needs to be seen twice. I saw it once and immediately, as a dumb-s*** 17 year old, jumped to comparing to to the backwards-episode of Seinfeld (not, as I should've the Harold Pinter backward-plot construction he was infamous for). Now, years later, little moments and parts of performances remain in the memory. And now, how curious, to revisit the film with a greater knowledge and appreciation for film art and story construction, not to mention going through a few more Christopher Nolan pictures, and... it's much, much better than I remember it. Just luck, I guess.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man on a mission, and he'll go after his wife's rape and murder, that is in reverse. Or really, at the start of the film its the end, and he kills a man named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who we are not sure who or what he's doing there but have some trust that out hero, or just protagonist, knows what he's doing. Does he though? His own tattoos and his own markers are not always the great markers of truth. He says others, like Teddy, lie and can't be trusted, but is it so? The color and B&W photography is symbolic of something, I think, not simply as a gimmick with creating temporal ""present"" and ""past"". It's as if they combine to create a real GRAY area, one where it's hard to tell if Teddy is telling Leonard all he needs to know (though he may be a cop in point of fact, who knows for sure what he has for Leonard, or if he'll help him in the end... not).This is a tricky little movie, but seeing it with eyes fresh and mind ready for anything its really brilliant on the front of construction. A scene ends right where the last one ended, the sequences of Shelby in his motel room punctuate these scenes with his story of another man with short-term memory loss (no ""New Memories"" as he says repeatedly), and it loops back around again. By the end we have a better idea of what happened, and how Leonard was most likely not at all an innocent in the rape and murder of his wife, but we also don't have the certainty of closure. Only in the point of view of Shelby, who is an unreliable narrator, do we have a real semblance of events.The effect is disorientating, but never boring, and the film-making is rich and clever and direct. There's no punches pulled by Nolan this time, and his editing is as elegant as his cinematography (the latter was much more for than the former in his Batman movies). And we feel for the characters, or at least character; especially painful is seeing how Natalie really feels about Leonard, berating him with a dirty mouth and then after being punched for egging Leonard on, sits in the car and comes back in to start the ""new"" memory that will soon fade, much like the polaroid unless its fanned out. The performances rock as well with the script, with Guy Pearce giving a career high point as Leonard (albeit I could just as easily see Steve Buscemi in the role of Teddy).It's a memorable movie, ironic enough, because we care about the character's plight and descent (or is ascent) into/from hell. He has no life except this mystery to unravel, which may be no real mystery at all. It's a post-modern enigma that is fun to watch, again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Memento Review,"Memento is a twisted mysterious drama that had me constantly rethinking the plot line. It was confusing and frustrating to keep watching the same scenes over and over looking for an answer.I found it unique, yet frustrating to watch the movie in reverse. Even though the conclusion of the mystery was revealed at the end, I still did not get a clear picture of what was going on. This movie is best suited for viewers who prefer an unpredictable outcome or for those who like to keep their minds wandering. I was a little confused of why the scenes where Lenny was talking about the mystery of Sammy were black and white. This movie is a great movie and can be watched over and over; a viewer will find more and more clues to the mystery every time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"intriguing, funny, and fascinating.","Memento is a film which i will always remember for the feeling i got as i walked out the cinema where i saw it. it was one with a smile, but a feeling which i cannot describe. some films make you go ""wow!"" with wonder, or satisfaction, or just blow you away. This film does all that, but adds incompleteness, and ambiguity to it. An ""ending"" where the facts are unclear, and leaves the viewer in the same state of mind as the central character, might leave some members of the audience unsatisfied. However, i revelled in this and was delighted with the whole experience.Guy Pearce made his character his own, and plays the part with great deal of innocence, charm, and humour. His comic timing is surprisingly good. His two co-stars, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Ann Moss, are both very good, and add to the mystery, which unfolds in an interesting structure.The people out there who do not like original films, do not like to see films which don't adhere to hollywoods guidelines (i.e. a film starting at the start, ending at the end, with a happy note, and want things to be ""normal"") then be warned: you're most likely not to enjoy this film, because it is different in many respects, and better off because of it.Christopher Nolan is a Britsh director, who with this film is a name to watch out for in the future. Word of mouth is out on this film, and is enjoying a good audience here in Britain. It didnt do too well in America but with Oscar nominations (God willing), should see it do well on video, and DVD.Memento is a film which i do like a great deal.

A Crime Movie Unlike Any Other,"When you boil down the plot after seeing the film it really isn't as complex as the movie builds up to be. However that's only if you know the movie in chronological order because of this film after Following (1998)'s rave reception Christopher Nolan proves why he is the best director of our time and maybe the best director ever. Also his brother deserves credit for coming up with the short story that inspired this film that you should read but not before seeing the film as it will give the film's plot away. I spent the entire 120 minute runtime trying to figure out what is going on, trust me trying to watch this film with your brain turned off is a bad idea. So make sure you're sober and prepped with a notepad (just kidding although you could if you are avid). Keep your brain on and enjoy the ride.

Gimmick...But Not So Pure and Simple,"""I Forgot to Remember to Forget"" is an old Rockabilly ditty. Elvis recorded it. Here we have a derivative, original, and refreshingly old, been there before style that is, one has to say, nothing more than a Gimmick. Yes, a hugely successful, highly-acclaimed Gimmick, but a Gimmick nonetheless.That doesn't mean that this is not a well crafted and somewhat entertaining Neo-Noir. But it surely is overrated to say the least. It made its mark ushering in the new Millennium with a pretentious grand design and a challenge for all to take notice. They did.But is it a great Movie? No. It is painstakingly written and edited to make some sort of twisted sense. But for some it must be painstakingly complex. This is like aerobics for the Mind. No pain no gain. But not everyone likes going to the Gym.So this one is a matter of taste. If you take some deep breaths, and are ready to participate in this game of one-two-three, one-two three, again and again, then this might be for you.

An Interesting But Eventually Tiresome Conceit,"The backwards technique of Pinter's ""Betrayal"" gets the noire treatment in ""Memento.""  With a better script this could have been something.  As it is, an interesting conceit eventually grows tiresome, and the long paragraphs of clumsy exposition in the last scene betrays the fact that something is not quite working structurally.  Still the film has a very good performance by Guy Pearce, and Joe Pantoliano is for once not the big hambone he usually is.  A cold work that never touches the emotions, it's still worth a screening for genre fans.  But those who go back for a second look will find, surprisingly, that the film tends to diminish with each viewing rather than deepen.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good but not great - loses coherency towards the end,"Memento manages to transcend above a mere ""gimmick"" movie into a movie experience that is quite enjoyable, but not a masterpiece.  However, it is not the 9th best film of all time (it is currently #9 on imdb), nor is it even one of the best films in the past year.Memento tries to accomplish too much, and the effect is that many things that are normally ""given"" in a film like this are not accomplished at all. The so-called gimmick itself is brilliant.  I can't agree with people who demean the quality of this film simply because it uses a gimmick to tell the story.  If one sees enough movies, one begins to appreciate unique styles of storytelling, even if the underlying plot is lacking (in this case, only slightly).  Furthermore, the plot itself is generally quite enjoyable and suspenseful.My main problem with the film, though;  what separates it in my mind from great films, is that there appear to be numerous plot holes.  Some can be patched with some blanket statements about memory and perception (which though they work feel cheap), but some just nag at you and make you feel cheated.  The other problem, and this was really the major one for me, is that Memento seems to follow the now endless stream of movies that feel they have to surprise the viewer a lot.  In some places it really works in memento.  In others, you feel really cheated, as if you have watched 1 hour of viewing that is entirely invalidated by a plot twist.  Initially I thought this was true of films like Fight Club and so forth, but on subsequent viewings or upon thinking further, these other films actually end up making sense.  In Fight Club, in fact, once I got over the feeling of being cheated, once I watched it again, the movie was even better.Memento, on the other hand, will not offer me much on subsequent viewings. There is no deeper meaning to most of what is there, it's all plot and intrigue.  Watching it again, I would simply be looking for ""aha"" moments. Watching films like Fight Club, ExistenZ, Pi, Run Lola Run, the Sixth Sense, and the Usual Suspects again, I can appreciate the film still, perhaps even more.  I am liberated by knowing what will happen, and able to pay attention to details more, able to see more in the plot than was there before.  I can marvel at the composition of scenes, the camerawork, and so forth.  Memento, on the other hand, is just what it wants to be, a mystery/suspense movie told in a unique way.  It is not elevated by its method of storytelling.  It does not demonstrate technical excellence (or if it does, I do not perceive it).Stated in another way, I feel as though memento became too enveloped in its method of storytelling and need to surprise - a need that is certainly understandable if the audience's attention is to remain constant - such that the plot began to suffer towards the end.  The plot became so loose that at some point I began questioning the plausibility of the story, and thinking that the main character was stupid and his method of dealing with his disability was lacking.  Part of this can again be explained by blanket statements, but they can also be explained by loose writing.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Forget the hyped sequel with brains but without any real brain - Memento is the thriller you should see!,"Memento is one of the best debuts that I'm aware of, and a remarkable achievement for a relatively low-budget film. Once again, in a film industry that too often forgets that only hype doesn't make a good movie, it's nice to see that some director has the courage to try something different, something that might not make a huge commercial success but will feel fresh when the big names will feel tiresome and dated.The technique of starting the movie near the end, then flashing back, then back again was recently used in Fight Club, but Memento takes it to a whole new level. Although the film does remind of Fincher's violent satire at times, including for the use of a visual twist, it is clearly no clone. Where Fight Club is psycho-political bite, Memento is full paranoia through an extremely complicated yet gripping storyline that requires tremendous attention to the details. I won't give much of the plot away; it suffice to say that the movie explores the psychological sphere of a man looking for someone who did wrong to his family. Only problem, he suffered major damage in the event and can't make any new memories. How can he find who's looking for? Can he trust the people around him? And can he really trust his own data? Not only Memento will surprise you, confuse you, and even make you smile, but will raise questions about the true nature of our mind, about time, and about how we judge people.In a year that saw Russell Crowe's name in every magazine, Guy Pearce proves he's definitely worth the same attention. His strong performance puts him in the league of young, talented actors with an already incredible career...

A mental whirlwind,"WOW. Immediately after I saw this movie, I bought another ticket for the next show and went through an entirely new experience. You absolutely have to see this movie at least two times. There are so many tiny hints and clues that you have no way of picking up on the first time through. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that made me think as hard as I did while viewing it.Incredibly innovative and clever, Memento is one of the best movies I've seen. It did such a brilliant job of putting us right beside the main character, making us believe him because we don't know any better, yet when the movie's over you look back and come to a logical conclusion that was so vastly different from what you started out with.

"Simply put, one of the greatest movies ever made.","Because of this, there's no review or comment that could do this movie justice. Along with the sixth sense and the Usual suspects it makes for one of the best first time viewings movies have ever had to offer. From beginning to end Memento stretches the mind and makes you think you know everything and know nothing all at the same time. The hidden story within the story is almost as entertaining as the movie itself and you can probably watch this movie 7 times and still learn something you didn't know the first time. The only way to watch this movie is to truly put your trust in the great Christopher Nolan and believe that in the end you will knoow everything you need to know... if you try to figure it out the whole time you will truly miss some of the things that make this movie great. the performances are top notch and I really believe this to be Guy Pearce's best performance along with that of L.A. confidential.

A mystery of rare quality that actually holds some surprises,"""Memento"" featuring Guy Pearce (""L.A. Confidential"", ""Ravenous""), Carrie-Anne Moss (""The Matrix""), and Joe Pantoliano (""The Matrix"", ""The Sopranos"", ""Midnight Run"") is a superb murder mystery told in reverse. The main character (Pearce), whose wife was killed, investigates the evidence while handicapped with a condition that cripples his ability to make new memories.  As a result, he is living in a continuous flow of short-term memory that barely connects moments to each other.  To connect the evidence he collects and to trust it, he must make continuous notes which bear increasingly paranoid messages like ""DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE.""  Since we're connecting the dots backwards, we don't know any more about what's going on than he does.  This is the gambit on which the mystery hinges and it actually works beautifully.  The result is a film with continuous twists and surprises which allows you the joy and the puzzle of putting the entire story into context in your own mind.  Like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""The Sixth Sense"", it makes you want to see it again for clues you missed the first time around.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
